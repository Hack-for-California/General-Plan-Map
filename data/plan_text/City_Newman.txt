1 INTRODUCTION
  Newman has historically been a small and relatively stable community with
  an economy and heritage rooted in agriculture. As a result of increasing
  growth pressure in the Central Valley, Newman has experienced a significant
  amount of new residential development in the last 5 years. Unlike many cit-
  ies in the region, Newman provides housing that is relatively affordable,
  when compared to other parts of the Central Valley and the San Francisco
  Bay area. While recognizing that some change is inevitable and desirable, the
  City has adopted this General Plan to provide the control and regulation nec-
  essary to ensure that in the face of these outside pressures, its high quality of
  life, small-town atmosphere and agricultural traditions continue into the fu-
  ture.
  A. Purpose of this Proposed General Plan
  The proposed General Plan provides the fundamental basis for the City’s land
  use and development policy, and represents the basic community values, ide-
  als and aspirations to govern a shared environment through 2030. The pro-
  posed General Plan addresses all aspects of development including land use,
  community character, transportation, housing, public facilities, infrastructure
  and open space, among other topics.
  California Government Code Section 65300 requires that the proposed Gen-
  eral Plan be comprehensive, internally consistent and long-term. Although
  required to address the issues specified by State law, the General Plan may be
  ultimately organized in a way that best suits Newman. The Plan should be
  clearly written, available to all those concerned with the community’s devel-
  opment and easy to administer.
  The overall role of the Newman General Plan is to:
     ♦ Define a realistic vision of what the City desires to be in 25 years.
     ♦ Express the policy direction of the City of Newman in regard to the
        physical, social, economic, cultural and environmental character of the
        city.
                                                                                I-1

C I T Y O F N E W M A N
G E N E R A L P L A N

   ♦ Serve as a comprehensive guide for making decisions about land use,
      community character, circulation, open space, the environment, and pub-
      lic health and safety.
   ♦ Serve as the City’s “constitution” for land use and community develop-
      ment. That is, it is to provide the legal foundation for all zoning, subdi-
      vision and public facilities ordinances, decisions and projects, all of which
      must be consistent with the proposed General Plan.
   ♦ Be in a clear and easy to understand form that encourages public debate
      and understanding.
This proposed General Plan document supersedes the previous General Plan,
adopted in 1992, and coordinates with the Housing Element update adopted
in 2003. The proposed General Plan’s implementation will include actions to
update other planning documents to ensure consistency with the vision out-
lined in the Newman General Plan.
B. Newman Today
The City of Newman is located in Stanislaus County, approximately 25 miles
south of Modesto, 100 miles south of Sacramento and 100 miles southeast of
San Francisco. There are is one minor highway, State Highway 33, that runs
through downtown Newman, but there are no major highways that run
through or adjacent to Newman. Interstate 5 (I-5) is the closest freeway, run-
ning northwest to southeast with a linkage via West Stuhr Road. Figure I-1
depicts the City’s regional location. The existing incorporated area of the
City of Newman is 2.14 square miles.
Newman was founded in 1888 as a result of the growing importance of the
surrounding agricultural lands and the arrival of the railroad to the commu-
nity, with incorporation as a city in 1908. Agriculture still continues to play
an important role in the community, providing jobs and influencing

the physical design of Newman; however, new development, employment
opportunities and regional growth pressures are affecting the character of
Newman.
According to the US Census, there were 7,093 people living in Newman in
2000, which represented a 71 percent increase from 1990, or about 7.1 percent
per year. The Department of Finance estimated that Newman continued to
experiencing a fast rate of growth, with 10,114 residents estimated on January
1, 2006, which reflects the same annual growth rate of approximately 7 per-
cent. The persistent increase in population is primarily a reflection of the
regional growth pressures that are affecting the Central Valley as people liv-
ing in more expensive regions look for affordable housing in the Valley.
While there has been a significant increase in the construction of new hous-
ing, the cost of housing has also increased, with a significant spike beginning
in 1990. As discussed in the Housing Element, median housing prices have
increased from $102,500 in 1992 to $160,000 in 2003. This increase in price
represents an approximate 62 percent increase over the past 10 years. Al-
though prices are increasing, housing in Newman is generally affordable in
comparison with other nearby cities. According to the 2003 Housing Ele-
ment, a family earning the County median family income of $48,000 and
spending 30 percent of its income on housing can afford a $228,000 house.
The subdivisions developing in Newman offer new houses at an entry level
price of $300,000. The ability of Newman residents to afford housing is a
mild concern, with approximately 55 percent of Newman’s lower-income
owner households spending more than 30% of their income on housing in
2000.
The number of commuters traveling outside of Newman for their jobs is in-
creasing. According to the 2003 Housing Element, the percentage of com-
muters is low, with approximately 50 percent of Newman residents traveling
more than 30 minutes to their job. Many of these residents work within
Stanislaus County, traveling to major employment centers such as Modesto.

Available data indicates that commuters go to employment centers such as
Tracy and Stockton, and to a lesser extent to Sacramento and the Bay Area.
This General Plan is designed to address the issues that face Newman as pres-
sures to grow and change occur. New employment opportunities are encour-
aged to allow residents to work, shop and live within the community. A
range of housing types are allowed to provide housing to meet everyone’s
needs, while limiting growth to areas adjacent to the existing city limits and
protecting the agricultural lands that contribute to Newman’s character, his-
tory and economic success.
C. The City and its Planning Area
The State of California encourages cities to look beyond their borders when
preparing a General Plan. For this reason, this General Plan assesses two de-
lineated areas known as the Sphere of Influence (SOI) and the Planning Area,
both of which are larger than the city limits.
The SOI includes land over which the City currently does not have complete
jurisdiction, but which it may annex and urbanize in the future. The total
SOI outside the city limits is approximately 3,750 acres. Figure I-2 depicts the
city limits, SOI and Planning Area for Newman.
While updating the General Plan, the City decided to propose revisions to the
SOI to accommodate anticipated growth through 2030. Figure I-3 depicts
the proposed changes to the SOI. The SOI proposed in this General Plan is
subject to approval by the LAFCO.
To comply with LAFCO regulations, Newman’s SOI has been divided into a
Primary and Secondary SOI. As discussed in more detail in the Land Use
Element, the Primary SOI depicts areas that may develop within the first 10
years of this General Plan, through 2016, while the Secondary SOI includes
                                                                                I-5

the remainder of the SOI. Figure LU-5 in the Land Use Element depicts the
Primary and Secondary SOI.
State law also allows cities to identify a Planning Area. This is an area outside
of a jurisdiction’s boundaries that bears a relation to the City’s planning. While
Newman does not have any regulatory authority within the Planning Area,
outside the SOI, the Planning Area is included in the proposed General Plan as
a signal to the County and to other nearby local and regional authorities that
Newman recognizes that development within this area has an impact on the
future of the city. The Planning Area includes unincorporated land north of W
Stuhr Road to Lundy Road, Draper Road to Eastin Road, and south of New-
man to the Newman Wasteway.
D. General Plan Contents
This General Plan includes this introduction and a brief overview of New-
man, as well as six separate “elements” that set goals, policies and actions for
each given subject. These six elements cover the seven topics required by
California State Government Code Section 65302. Some State-required topics
have been combined or included into other elements, as allowed by State law.
As previously mentioned, the Housing Element, one of the required ele-
ments, was adopted under a separate process and is available as a separate
document. A brief explanation of the topics included in the Newman Gen-
eral Plan is provided here.
Land Use Element. The State-required Land Use Element designates all
lands within the City for specific uses such as housing, commercial, industrial,
open space and recreational, public facilities and agriculture uses. The Land
Use Element also provides development regulations for each land use cate-
gory, and overall land use policies for the City.
Transportation and Circulation Element. State law requires that a Trans-
portation and Circulation Element specify the general location and extent of
I-8

                                                       C I T Y O F N E W M A N
                                                            G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                              I N T R O D U C T I O N
existing and proposed major streets and other transportation facilities. The
Element must be correlated with the Land Use Element to ensure that ade-
quate pedestrian, bicycle, motor vehicle and emergency access is provided to
serve both new and existing land uses.
Public Facilities and Services. This optional Element assesses the current
state of public services and facilities within the City, including law enforce-
ment, fire services, schools, libraries, government facilities, water, wastewater,
stormwater drainage, solid waste and utilities. Goals and policies focus on
ensuring minimum service levels within Newman for existing and new devel-
opment.
Recreation and Cultural Resources Element. This optional Element ad-
dresses park standards, planning and design, inter-agency coordination, trails
and greenways, recreation programs, and private recreation facilities. The
Element also addresses the preservation of the community’s archaeological
and historical resources and heritage.
Natural Resources Element. The Natural Resources Element provides di-
rection regarding the conservation, development and use of natural resources
in and around Newman, including agricultural land, water quality, vegetation
and wildlife, and air quality. This element addresses the State mandated Con-
servation Element and, by addressing open spaces that preserve natural and
agricultural resources, the state mandated Open Space Element.
Health and Safety Element. State law requires the development of a Health
and Safety Element to protect the community from risks associated with the
effects of seismic and other geologic hazards, flooding and dam inundation,
hazardous materials, as well as ensuring adequate emergency preparedness.
State law also mandates that a city’s General Plan address current and foresee-
able noise impacts. Noise is not contained within a stand alone element in
this General Plan but is addressed within the Health and Safety Element.
                                                                                   I-9

Community Design Element. This optional Element discusses urban design
principles that are intended to guide both public and private development and
protect and enhance the positive characteristics of Newman’s built environ-
ment, characteristics that contribute to its sense of place and contribute to-
wards a high quality of life for its residents.
Housing Element. As previously stated, the City’s Housing Element was
adopted in 2003 pursuant to State law. Government Code Section 65588 re-
quires that Housing Elements be updated every five years and include specific
components such as analysis of existing housing stock, analysis of existing and
projected housing needs, and quantification of the number of housing units
that will be developed, preserved and improved through its policies and ac-
tions. The Housing Element is available as a separate document.
E. Organization of the General Plan Elements
Each element of this proposed General Plan contains background informa-
tion and a series of goals, policies and actions. Some elements also have addi-
tional sections that are specific to them. For example, the Land Use Element
contains descriptions of a series of land use designations that guide overall
development in the City and the Circulation Element contains information
on the network and hierarchy of streets.
The background information section of each element describes current condi-
tions in Newman relative to the subject of the element. The goals, policies
and actions provide guidance to the City on how to direct change and manage
its resources over the next 20 years. Figure I-4 illustrates that policies and
actions are at the same level of importance, and are both intended to imple-
ment goals. In most cases, goals have both implementing policies and actions.
However, it is also possible for a goal to be implemented exclusively through
either policies or actions. The following provides a description of each and
explains the relationship between each:

FIGURE 1-4 GENERAL PLAN COMPONENTS
 ♦ A goal is a description of the general desired result that the City seeks to
    create through the implementation of its proposed General Plan.
 ♦ A policy is a specific statement that guides decision-making in working to
    achieve a goal. Such policies, once adopted, represent statements of City
    regulation and require no further implementation. The General Plan’s
    policies set out the standards that will be used by City staff, the Planning
    Commission and City Council in their review of land development pro-
    jects and in decision-making about City actions.
 ♦ An action is a program, implementation measure, procedure or tech-
    nique intended to help to achieve a specified goal.

F. General Plan Update Process
The process to update the General Plan began in March of 2005 and was
completed, with the adoption of the General Plan by the City Council, in
2007. The General Plan was developed with extensive community input and
involvement and reflects the community’s vision for the City of Newman.
The following describes the public process to update the General Plan.
1. Public Outreach and Involvement
The General Plan Update process was overseen by a Steering Committee of
nine Newman citizens. The Steering Committee represented the diverse
Newman community throughout the Update process, acting as a "sounding
board" for ideas from community members, City staff and consultants. The
Steering Committee also reviewed working drafts of documents and recom-
mended a preliminary General Plan to the City Council. To develop the
Plan there were a total of 11 Steering Committee meetings, all of which were
open to the public.
In addition to the Steering Committee Meeting there were three community
workshops at key points in the planning process. At the workshops, staff
worked with community participants to develop the Vision for Newman, to
identify issues that needed to be addressed in the General Plan, and to identify
a preferred land use and circulation alternative. All three public workshops
were advertised in the West Side Index.
2. Public Review Period and Adoption
As required by State law, this General Plan was circulated for a 45-day review
period along with its associated Environmental Impact Report (EIR) during
the months of October and November, 2006. During this time, the public
was allowed to submit additional comments, which were taken into consid-
eration at subsequent public hearings. As part of this 45-day review period, a
Planning Commission Hearing was held on November 16, 2006, to take pub-
lic comment on the Draft Plan and EIR.

After the close of the comment period, the City prepared a Final EIR and
proposed revisions to the Draft General Plan. The City’s Planning Commis-
sion considered those documents on January 18, 2007 and February 10, 2007,
and recommended certification of the EIR and adoption of the General Plan
on February 10, 2007. The City Council subsequently considered these
documents on February 13, February 27, and March 27, 2007. The Council
certified the EIR and adopted this General Plan on April 10, 2007.
                                                                              I-13

2 VISION STATEMENT
  The Vision Statement is a description of what Newman wants to become through
  the implementation of its General Plan. The Vision Statement provides a sense of
  the purpose and mission for the General Plan and sets the tone for the Plan’s goals,
  objectives, policies and actions.
  Newman will continue to be a small town with a vibrant downtown sur-
  rounded by attractive residential neighborhoods and undeveloped agricultural
  and ranching lands. Newman is and will be a safe community where people
  know their neighbors. The historic fabric of the downtown and surrounding
  neighborhoods provide a strong sense of place and pride for residents.
  Newman will be a walkable community, with a well-connected street grid,
  pedestrian amenities and bike lanes. Residents will be able to walk to down-
  town, to school, to work and through the city on safe, tree-lined streets.
  Newman’s historic downtown will offer unique shops, services and restau-
  rants, with the small town character preserved by design standards. Addi-
  tional retail development will also be located along the Highway 33 corridor.
  There will be a range of activities available in Newman for all residents, in-
  cluding youth and seniors. Parks scattered throughout the city will provide a
  variety of play equipment and facilities that promote community gatherings.
  A network of pedestrian trails and bike paths will connect residents to parks,
  schools, downtown and other destinations.
  A range of housing types will be available in Newman, each meeting high
  design standards. New residential subdivisions will offer single-family homes
  that are affordable to a range of incomes and include sufficient yard space
  around each house. Multi-family housing, including townhouses, condo-
  miniums and apartments will be located throughout the community includ-
  ing in new development areas, on previously vacant lots, and in the down-
  town. New development will be well-integrated with Newman’s existing
  fabric.
                                                                                 VS-1

C I T Y O F N E W M A N
G E N E R A L P L A N
V I S I O N S T A T E M E N T
Newman will provide a variety of employment options for local residents,
from entry-level to more advanced positions in the trade, office and higher-
paying retail industries. These new jobs will occur in the downtown, along
Highway 33, in industrial areas and in new employment areas.
A sufficient level of public services and infrastructure will be in place as
Newman grows and future development will not negatively impact existing
infrastructure. Roadways, police, fire and medical services, and water supply
and wastewater treatment infrastructure will be provided to support the safe
environment that residents value. There will be sufficient public schools,
providing quality education to local residents. The quality of Newman’s
natural resources will be preserved and enhanced.
Newman will meet the challenge of managing growth while enhancing the
small town flavor, safety and strong sense of community that attracts people
to live here.

3 LAND USE
  The purpose of the Land Use Element is to shape the potential physical develop-
  ment of the City of Newman and to preserve, protect and enhance the commu-
  nity’s current quality of life consistent with the City’s vision. The Land Use Ele-
  ment is not designed to discourage or promote development as allowed in this
  General Plan, but rather describes the manner in which development should be
  managed in the event that it does occur. The Land Use Element is the central
  chapter of the General Plan.
  As required by California Government Code Section 65302(a) and Public
  Resources Code Section 2762(a), this Land Use Element portrays the distribu-
  tion, location and extent of existing lands used for housing, business, indus-
  try, parks and recreation, education and other public facilities. The Element
  also contains text, including specific goals, policies and actions, and maps that
  guide the future use and reuse of land within the city limits, and set standards
  of density and building intensity within the community.
  The Land Use Element focuses on development that could potentially occur
  in both the existing city limits and the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI). The
  SOI is the area outside the city limits that the City considers as reasonable for
  annexation, with the Primary SOI indicating an area that is sufficient to ac-
  commodate development for the next ten years through 2016.
  The Element is divided into five sections:
    ♦ Background Information. Provides details on existing land uses in
       Newman and its surrounding area, as described by the Stanislaus County
       and Merced County General Plans. The land use designations for unin-
       corporated land surrounding Newman is included, as well as relevant
       policies affecting these areas.
  This report also provides details concerning the land use designations for un-
  incorporated lands surrounding Newman, for both Stanislaus and Merced
  County General Plan land use designations of the unincorporated lands sur-
  rounding Newman. Also discusses relevant County land use polices affecting
  these unincorporated lands.
                                                                               LU-1

C I T Y O F N E W M A N
G E N E R A L P L A N

  ♦ General Plan Land Use Designations. Describes the characteristics and
     intensity of each land use designation and contains a map of the applica-
     tion of these designations in the Newman area.
  ♦ Master Plan Requirements. Describes the requirements for the creation
     of Master Plans for the subareas that are anticipated to be the basic in-
     crement for development within the timeframe of this General Plan.
  ♦ Sphere of Influence. Describes the City of Newman’s SOI and Primary
     SOI and how development in these areas would be phased over time.
  ♦ Goals, Policies and Actions. Provides guidance to the City related to
     land use decisions.
A. Background Information
This section provides details on the existing land uses in Newman, to both
document the development pattern in Newman in 2005 and to provide back-
ground for the Land Use Element of the General Plan. This section also pro-
vides information on the Merced and Stanislaus County land use policies and
land use designations on the unincorporated lands surrounding Newman.
1. Existing Land Use in Newman
The City of Newman is a contained small town with a vibrant historic down-
town surrounded predominately by single family residential neighborhoods
and then by agricultural and ranch lands. The downtown is centered along
Main Street and consists of one and two story commercial buildings, many of
which are historic and dating from the early 20th Century. The area east of
Highway 33, extending from the center of town to the southern City limit, is
predominately in industrial and commercial use.
The land use data contained within this plan is based on data from the Stanis-
laus County land use database developed in 2004. Table LU-1 quantifies the
amount of different types of land uses in Newman. This table includes acres

for all transportation infrastructure in the area including roadways and the
railroad. In terms of acreage, the most common land use in the almost 11,000
acre Planning Area is agriculture, at 8,300 acres, followed by single-family
housing at 850 acres. The following land use categories were created to de-
scribe the existing pattern of development in Newman and are not the official
General Plan land use designations, which are identified later in this Element.
Figure LU-1 shows the location of the existing land uses within the City of
Newman’s Planning Area.
  ♦ Rural Residential. Rural residential uses are homes and associated out-
     buildings on several-acre parcels along the edge between the city and the
     surrounding farmland. These parcels may not be large enough to ac-
     commodate commercial agricultural uses, but they are larger and more

     isolated than the typical single-family home within a more urbanized
     neighborhood.
  ♦ Single-Family Residential. This is the predominant land use within the
     City of Newman. It refers to parcels that contain a single residence and
     related structures, such as second units, garages or sheds. Single-family
     uses fill most of the land between the City limits and the commercial and
     industrial core of the city.
  ♦ Multi-Family Residential. This land use category refers to parcels that
     contain more than one housing unit and includes duplexes, triplexes,
     four-plexes, townhomes, condominiums and apartment buildings. These
     residential categories are found only in a few areas of Newman, including
     the area south of Driskell Avenue and east of L Street.
  ♦ Commercial. Commercial land uses refer to parcels that contain a num-
     ber of business types including retail, services, restaurants, offices and
     medical facilities. Commercial development is predominantly located
     along Highway 33, along Main Street between Kern Street and Merced
     Street, and in the West Side Marketplace at the southern edge of town.
  ♦ Light Industrial. Light Industrial development refers to parcels used for
     production and manufacturing and also includes warehouses, self-storage
     facilities, automobile garages, and production-oriented small businesses.
     Light Industrial uses in Newman are concentrated in the downtown area,
     generally along M Street, north of the County line.
  ♦ Heavy Industrial. Heavy Industrial development refers to parcels used
     for the production of raw materials, such as a steel mill or chemical plant.
     Heavy Industrial uses in Newman are concentrated near the intersection
     of Inyo Avenue and M Street, and northeast of Newman at the intersec-
     tion of Hills Ferry Road and E Stuhr Road.
  ♦ Office. Office land uses refer to parcels that contain multi-story and sin-
     gle-story businesses. Office uses occupy the least amount of land area in
     Newman. The majority of Office parcels are scattered throughout
     downtown Newman.

  ♦ Agriculture. This is by far the predominant land use within the Plan-
     ning Area as a whole, particularly outside of the City limits. This cate-
     gory includes uses such as row crops, orchards and grazing.
  ♦ Public/Quasi-Public. Public facilities cover a number of uses including
     schools, libraries, police and fire stations, and utilities. These uses are dis-
     tributed throughout Newman and are generally integrated with sur-
     rounding land uses.
  ♦ Vacant. Parcels that contain abandoned or vacant structures, or are void
     of any structures and are not used for agriculture are all classified as
     vacant.
2. County General Plan Land Use Designations and Policies
While the City of Newman is located within Stanislaus County, Newman is
surrounded not only by unincorporated Stanislaus County to the west, north
and northeast but also abuts unincorporated lands within Merced County to
the south and east. Given that both counties have jurisdiction over the lands
surrounding Newman, it is important to understand these Counties’ land use
policies and designations as background to the Newman General Plan. Figure
LU-2 shows both the Stanislaus and Merced Counties General Plan land use
designations for the unincorporated areas surround Newman.
a. Stanislaus County General Plan Land Use Designations and Policies
Stanislaus County has jurisdiction over the land outside of Newman’s City
limits to the west, north and northeast. Stanislaus County’s General Plan is
the ultimate land use regulation in these unincorporated areas. As shown in
Figure LU-2, the majority of the unincorporated land around Newman is
designated as Agriculture, but there are also almost 216 acres along the north-
ern and western borders of the City designated as Urban Transition, and a
smaller 20-acre parcel to the southeast designated as Industrial.
Lands designated Agriculture in Stanislaus County are restricted to agricul-
tural uses, uses that are related to agriculture, and uses that are compatible
with agricultural practices, including natural resources management, open

space, and outdoor recreation. Minimum parcel sizes in agricultural areas are
generally 40 to 160 acres. The County has a number of policies in place to
preserve agricultural land and protect agricultural uses, including an Agricul-
tural Element in the General Plan. Such policies include Policy Fourteen of
the Land Use Element, which states that, “[u]ses shall not be permitted to
intrude into or be located adjacent to an agricultural area if they are detrimen-
tal to continued agricultural usage of the surrounding area.” Furthermore,
Policy 2.3 of the Agriculture Element states that, “[t]o reduce development
pressures on agricultural lands, higher density development and in-filling shall
be encouraged in urban and built-up areas of the County.” A follow-up Im-
plementation Measure states “[t]he County will work with the cities and
towns to encourage higher density development and in-filling of already-
existing urban areas.”
The County applies the Urban Transition designation “in recognition that
unincorporated land within the established spheres of influence of cities…
ultimately will be urbanized.” The purpose of the Urban Transition designa-
tion is to ensure that land remains in agricultural use until urban development
consistent with a city's General Plan designation is approved.
The Industrial designation, which is applied to a portion of Stanislaus County
immediately east of Newman’s industrial area and immediately north of the
Merced County line, “is intended for lands within spheres of influence
which… are not zoned or developed for industrial usage, but lie in the path of
a valid expansion of a contiguous industrial area. Land falling within this des-
ignation may continue to be zoned and used for non-industrial purposes
pending demand for such industrial expansion.”
b. Merced County Land Use Designations and Policies
The land outside Newman’s southeastern City limit is under the jurisdiction
of Merced County. The unincorporated portion of Merced County that is
designated Heavy Industrial and Light Industrial in the Newman General
Plan is also designated Industrial in the Merced County General Plan. The
County has an agreement with the City of Newman that allows this area to
                                                                             LU-9

be developed with industrial uses consistent with this General Plan. Fur-
thermore, the agreement states that Merced County will forward all devel-
opment applications in this area to the City for review and comment.
The remainder of Merced County south of the City limit is designated Agri-
cultural in the Merced County General Plan, as is the majority of the central
part of Merced County. According to the Agricultural land use designation,
“the Agricultural areas are used [primarily] for cultivated agricultural prac-
tices which rely on good soil quality and water availability, and minimal
slopes. Also, many non-cultivated agricultural practices occur in these areas.”
Like Stanislaus County, Merced County has a number of General Plan poli-
cies aimed at protecting agriculture. Objective 1.A, Policy 1, states that “Ur-
ban development shall occur only within adopted urban boundaries of cities,
unincorporated communities and other urban centers consisting of the fol-
lowing designations: Specific Urban Development Plan (SUDP), Rural Resi-
dential Center (RRC), Highway Interchange Center (HIC) and Agricultural
Services Center (ASC).” The closest urbanized area to Newman is the City of
Gustine, 5 miles to the south. Gustine is designated as a “Specific Urban De-
velopment Plan” area on the Merced County Land Use Policy Diagram.
Objective 4.A, Policy 1 also states that agricultural and rural land shall only
be converted to urban uses “where a clear and immediate need can be demon-
strated based on anticipated growth and availability of public services and
facilities.”
Figure LU-3 maps the General Plan Land Use Designations, depicting
planned land uses for the City of Newman and Table LU-2 summarizes the
acreage for each land use designation in the city limits and within the current
SOI. The boundary lines between most land use designations are delineated
as specifically as possible, in most cases following parcel lines.
The 17 different land use designations establish a range and intensity or
density of uses and are intended to help implement the future vision of the

City of Newman, while providing flexibility for development. The land use
designations also reflect the goals and policies in this General Plan. In this
General Plan, standards of building intensity for residential uses are stated as
the allowable range of dwelling units per gross acre. Gross acreage includes
all land (including streets and rights-of-way) designated for a particular resi-
dential use, while net acreage excludes streets and rights-of-way. Normally,
net acreage is about 25 percent less than gross acreage.
Standards of building intensity for non-residential uses are stated as maximum
floor-area ratios (FARs) based on net acreage. An FAR is a ratio of the gross
building square footage permitted on a lot to the net square footage of the lot.
For example, on a site with 10,000 net square feet of land area, an FAR of 1.0
will allow 10,000 gross square feet of building floor area to be built. On the
same site, an FAR of 2.0 would allow 20,000 square feet of floor area (i.e. two-
story building with 100 percent lot coverage); and an FAR of 0.4 would allow
4,000 square feet of floor area.
The goals, policies and actions contained in this Element provide additional
direction on how the various land use designations should be developed to
contribute to the overall character and vision of Newman.
3. Residential Designations
Six residential land use designations allow for residential uses ranging from
very-low-density estate-type homes and low-density single-family homes, to
duplexes and multi-family structures. Consistent with State Law AB1866,
secondary dwelling units are also allowed in the Very Low Density, Low
Density, Central and Planned Mixed Residential land use designation catego-
ries.
The residential land use designations also allow for public and quasi-public
land uses that serve the community. Examples of allowable uses include
churches, schools, parks and recreational facilities, fire stations, libraries, day
care facilities, community centers and other public uses.

With the exception of the Planned Mixed Residential land use designation,
which has more specific density requirements, the residential land use catego-
ries establish minimum and maximum allowable gross densities. New resi-
dential development must fall within the density range established by the land
use designation for a given area or parcel. New development in areas desig-
nated Planned Mixed Residential must also meet the density requirements of
this land use category.
a. Very Low Density Residential (VLDR)
The Very Low Density Residential designation provides for large lot single-
family homes, secondary dwelling units, public and quasi-public uses and
similar and compatible uses. Residential densities shall be in the range of 1 to
3 units per gross acre, with lots typically in the half to a third of an acre
range. This land is use designation is not applied to specific parcels, but is an
overlay designation applied to the hatched areas along the Central California
Irrigation District Canal, as shown in Figure LU-3. Development within this
hatched area may be developed with Very Low Density Residential uses un-
der a Master Plan approved by the City.
b. Low Density Residential (LDR)
The Low Density Residential designation allows for single-family detached
and attached homes, duplexes on corner lots, secondary residential units, pub-
lic and quasi-public uses, and similar and compatible uses. Residential densi-
ties shall be in the range of 3 to 6.0 units per gross acre. Lot sizes within this
designation would typically range from 6,000 square feet to a half acre.
c. Central Residential (CR)
The Central Residential designation is applied to the central, older neighbor-
hoods within the historic town core and is intended to preserve the mix of
residential uses within this historic core. This land use designation allows
single-family detached and attached homes, duplexes, secondary residential
units, public and quasi-public uses, and similar and compatible uses. Parking
for adjacent commercial uses shall be permitted as a discretionary use. Resi-
dential densities shall be in the range of 3 to 12.0 units per gross acre. Subar-
                                                                             LU-15

eas within this designation that are developed predominantly with single fam-
ily homes should be preserved for such uses, while areas with higher densities
or a mix of housing types shall be permitted to intensify or develop at the
higher end of the density range.
d. Medium Density Residential (MDR)
The Medium Density Residential designation allows for single-family de-
tached and attached homes and multi-family residential units, public and
quasi-public uses, and similar and compatible uses. Residential densities shall
be in the range of 6 to 12.0 units per gross acre.
e. High Density Residential (HDR)
The High Density Residential designation provides for single-family attached
homes and multi-family residential units, group quarters, assisted living facili-
ties, public and quasi-public uses, and similar and compatible uses. Residen-
tial densities shall be in the range of 12 to 30 units per gross acre.
f. Planned Mixed Residential (PMR)
The Planned Mixed Residential land use designation allows for single-family
detached and attached homes, secondary residential units, multi-family resi-
dential units, parks, open space, public and quasi-public uses, and similar and
compatible uses.
Any development that occurs under this designation within one of the Master
Plan Subareas, shown on Figure LU-4, shall be approved pursuant to an
adopted master plan. Within each of the eight subareas designated Planned
Mixed Residential, no more than 75 percent of the units can be developed at a
density of 6 or less units to the gross acre and at least 10 percent of the units
shall be developed at a density of 12 units to the gross acre or greater. In ad-
dition, Very Low Density Residential development is envisioned to be devel-
oped on the western portions of Master Plan Subareas Three, Four and Five,
as shown in Figure LU-3, with no more than 10 percent of the total number
of units built within each of these subareas falling into this category.

Within the Master Plan Subareas designated with a Planned Mixed Residential
land use designation or within new developments occurring under this desig-
nation that are not within a Master Plan Subarea, the overall average residen-
tial density for residential lands (i.e. excluding lands designated for Recreation
and Parks, Open Space, or Public/Quasi-Public) shall not exceed 8.0 units per
gross acre. The minimum overall average density for residential lands within
this designation shall be 5 dwelling units per gross acre.
Higher density housing developed within areas designated Planned Mixed
Residential shall be located near schools and parks as a means to create
neighborhood centers, and shall be integrated with the design, development
and circulation patterns of the surrounding neighborhoods to the maximum
extent feasible.
4. Commercial Designations
Three commercial land use designations allow for a wide range of uses focus-
ing on retail, office and service uses. The Downtown Commercial land use
designation also allows residential development in mixed use residen-
tial/commercial projects.
a. Downtown Commercial (DC)
This designation provides for retail and service uses, restaurants, professional
and administrative offices, hotels, residential units above the ground floor,
live-work units, public and quasi-public uses, and similar and compatible uses.
This designation is intended to accommodate local-serving retail and offices;
large administrative offices and land-extensive commercial operations are not
appropriate in this designation. Residential densities shall be in the range of
10 to 20 units per gross acre; the combined FAR for all uses shall not exceed

B. Master Plan Requirements
This section discusses the master plan requirements for the subareas illus-
trated in Figure LU-4.
Before any of the subareas shown in Figure LU-4 can be annexed to the City
of Newman and developed, a master plan shall be approved by the City. The
Master Plan shall address the entire subarea. Master Plans shall also be consis-
tent with all of the goals and policies of this General Plan and contribute to-
ward achieving Newman’s vision.
Master Plan Subareas Two and Three are planned for both residential and
business park uses. Master Plans for these two subareas shall include the re-
quired contents and meet the criteria for both residential and business park
uses, which are discussed below. Consistent with Land Use Policy LU 2.4,
development of the business park uses and the residential uses shall run con-
currently.
The portions of subareas planned for residential uses are designated with a
Planned Mixed Residential land use designation. As Master Plans are
approved, the General Plan Land Use Diagram shall be amended to replace
the Planned Mixed Residential designation with more specific land use desig-
nations that are consistent with the approved Master Plan. For example, por-
                                                                            LU-21

C. Sphere of Influence
In addition to its City limits and Planning Area, every city in California has a
SOI, which is the term used for areas outside the City limits that the City
expects to annex in the future, usually within the next 20 years. The SOI
must be reviewed and approved by the County’s Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO). This General Plan identifies extending the southwest
portion of Newman’s SOI south to Hallowell Road as shown in Figure LU-5.
In addition to the SOI, Stanislaus County LAFCO also requires cities to es-
tablish a Primary SOI. The Primary SOI distinguishes land that is expected
to be annexed in the next ten or so years. The purpose of the Primary SOI is
to promote compact, concentric development.

This General Plan identifies expanding the Primary SOI shown in Figure
LU-5, which includes Master Plan subareas 1, 2, and 3 shown on Figure LU-4.
These three subareas combined are projected to provide more than an ade-
quate supply of land to accommodate projected growth and it is not antici-
pated that all three of these subareas will develop by 2016. However all three
subareas are included to allow flexibility on where and how much develop-
ment could occur by 2016. The expanded Primary SOI identified in this
General Plan encompasses a total of more than 2,171 acres, and there are cur-
rently approximately 843 acres within the expanded Primary SOI that the
City has not yet annexed.
As a General Plan implementation action the City of Newman will need to
request that Stanislaus County LAFCO update the City’s SOI, including the
City’s Primary SOI, to include the expanded areas identified in this General
plan.
D. Goals, Policies and Actions
1.   General
Goal LU-1         Preserve Newman’s traditional small-town qualities,
                  while increasing its residential and employment
                  base.
Policy LU-1.1     The City shall encourage development of a scale and type
                  that is compatible with the existing scale and character of
                  Newman. Large residential development that has the look
                  and feel of a single project and does not have variation in
                  terms of densities, building typology and design shall be dis-
                  couraged.
Policy LU-1.2     To preserve and enhance the existing small town character
                  of Newman and ensure orderly growth, new planned devel-

                                                         G E N E R A L P L A N
                                                    L A N D U S E E L E M E N T
              opment shall be phased over the time frame of this General
              Plan. No more than two neighborhood Master Plan subar-
              eas should be developed concurrently. Before development
              an additional Master Plan subarea can be initiated, one of
              the two Master Plan subareas developing concurrently must
              be substantially completed, or the City must find that con-
              current development of an additional Master Plan subarea
              will allow for continued orderly growth and maintenance of
              small town character.
Goal LU-2     Provide for orderly, well-planned and balanced
              growth consistent with the limits imposed by the
              city’s infrastructure and the city’s ability to assimi-
              late new growth.
Policy LU-2.1 The City will link the rate of growth in Newman to the
              provision of adequate services and infrastructure, including
              schools and District-wide school support facilities, road-
              ways, police, fire and medical services, and water supply and
              wastewater treatment infrastructure.           The City shall,
              through the Citywide Services Master Plan, ensure that
              growth occurs in an orderly fashion and in pace with the
              provision of public facilities and services. New development
              shall not negatively impact existing infrastructure and level
              of services.
Policy LU-2.2 The City shall, through the use of Master Plans, ensure that
              growth and development occur in an orderly and contigu-
              ous manner. Development shall be considered contiguous if
              it meets the following three Criteria;
                ♦ It is adjacent to any phase or tract of incorporated or

4 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION ELEMENT
  The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide the policy framework for
  regulation and development of the circulation system in Newman. This Element
  balances the need to provide safe ways to move people and freight from one place
  to another with the goal of preserving the character of the community and creating
  a walkable and bicycle-friendly city. The transportation system should accommo-
  date the needs of Newman and planned growth while minimizing environmental
  degradation.
  The Circulation Element must be correlated with the Land Use Element to
  ensure that adequate pedestrian, bicycle, motor vehicle and emergency access
  is provided to serve both new and existing land uses. As required by Gov-
  ernment Code Section 65302(b), the Circulation Element contains informa-
  tion on the general location and extent of existing and proposed major thor-
  oughfares, transportation routes and terminals.
  State law also requires that a Circulation Element include data and policies
  related to the provision of public infrastructure. For the purposes of this
  General Plan, these components are presented in the Public Facilities and
  Services Element.
  The Circulation Element is divided into four sections:
    ♦ Background Information. Provides background information on the ex-
       isting circulation system.
    ♦ Roadway Classifications and Standards. Provides a description of the
       various roadway types in Newman, along with a map depicting the loca-
       tion of existing and planned roadways.
    ♦ Bicycle Network. Provides a description of the types of planned bicycle
       facilities along with a map depicting the location of these facilities.
    ♦ Truck Routes. Provides a description of the purpose and location of
       truck routes in the city.
    ♦ Programmed and Planned Improvements. Outlines improvements to
       the local circulation system planned by the City to support the future
       needs of the community.
                                                                               TC-1

     and improving all aspects of the circulation system.
A. Background Information
1. Roadway System
The network of roadways in and around Newman consists of arterials, collec-
tors and local streets. The closest major highway, Interstate 5, is located ap-
proximately 5 miles west of Newman and is accessed via Stuhr Road.
The following provides an overview of the existing roadway system, along
with an analysis of how well it is able to carry current traffic loads. In addi-
tion, major intersections are identified with an analysis of their capability to
operate at acceptable levels with existing traffic conditions.
a. Existing Roads
The City of Newman’s Roadway System is comprised of arterials, collectors
and local streets, all of which are two-lane with one lane in each direction.
  ♦ Arterials. Arterials are major thoroughfares that provide the primary
     routes across Newman and connect the city with surrounding cities as
     well as with adjacent major highways. The existing arterials include State
     Highway 33, Hills Ferry Road, Merced Road, a portion of Hardin Road
     and Sherman Parkway.
     State Highway 33, which is also designated as “N” Street within New-
     man, bisects the City, running north to Patterson and south to Gustine.
     Hills Ferry Road runs northeast from Newman and is the primary route
     into Newman from the east. At Highway 33, Hills Ferry Road becomes
     Merced Street, an arterial that also runs northeast to southwest through
     the historic downtown core. At the intersection with Upper Road,
     Merced Street then becomes Hoyer Road. While Hoyer Road is planned
     to be developed into an arterial all the way to Drapper Road, it is cur-
     rently a two-lane farm road west of Yolo Middle School. A relatively
TC-2

                                                          C I T Y O F N E W M A N
                                                               G E N E R A L P L A N
                 T R A N S P O R T A T I O N A N D C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
    new arterial is Sherman Parkway, which is located on the northern City
    limit and connects Highway 33 to Hills Ferry Road.
  ♦ Collector. Collectors are intermediary streets that link local streets to
    arterials. Existing collector streets in downtown Newman include Yolo,
    Kern, “T” and “Q” Streets. Inyo Street is also a collector in downtown
    that runs east across Highway 33 to Canal School Road. In the northeast
    portion of Newman, the north south collectors include Eucalyptus Ave-
    nue, Barrington Avenue, and Balsam Drive with an east-west connection
    provided by Driskell Avenue. The relatively new neighborhoods in the
    southwest portion of the City are served by Canyon Creek Drive, a col-
    lector which connects with Upper Road and Prince Street; two road-
    ways planned to be developed into arterials.
  ♦ Local Streets. Local streets provide access to properties and connect to
    collectors and arterials. The remainder of the streets in Newman are lo-
    cal streets. The local streets located within the downtown and the ma-
    ture neighborhoods built between World War II and the 1970’s are gen-
    erally built in a grid pattern that provides direct access to surrounding
    neighborhoods and streets, including collectors and arterials. The more
    recent residential developments, built since the 1970’s, are generally built
    on a curvilinear street pattern with multiple cul-de-sacs and fewer local
    streets. These newer communities therefore have less direct connections
    within the neighborhood and less access to surrounding neighborhoods
    and streets.
b. Roadway Level of Service
As part of the General Plan background analysis, the operation of major
roadways was analyzed. To describe traffic conditions and put traffic vol-
umes in perspective, level of service (LOS) standards are utilized. LOS is a
qualitative measure of traffic operating conditions whereby a letter grade, “A”
through “F”, corresponds to progressively worsening traffic service along a
roadway or intersection. LOS “A,” “B” and “C” indicate that traffic can
move relatively freely. LOS “D” indicates that delays are more noticeable
and average traffic speeds are sometimes 40 percent of free flow speed. LOS
“E” describes operating conditions at or close to capacity with significant
                                                                                 TC-3

G E N E R A L P L A N
T R A N S P O R T A T I O N A N D C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
delays and average travel speeds as low as 30 percent of free flow speed. Table
TC-1 shows the general level of service (LOS) thresholds used for assessing
traffic conditions for the roadways in Newman. These thresholds are based
on the 1999 Traffic Impact Fee Study.
Traffic counts were conducted along the major arterial and collector streets in
Newman in May 2005. In addition, some data was taken from other recent
traffic studies. Data for Highway 33 was taken for annualized Caltrans data
for the most recently reported year (2003). The current daily traffic volume
on most roads in Newman falls within the LOS “C” standard, indicating that
current traffic conditions in the community are good. In fact, LOS “A” con-
ditions are projected on nearly all study area streets. The highest volumes
were observed on Highway 33, Merced Street and Hills Ferry Road, but these
roadways are still within the standards for LOS “C.”
c. Major intersections
The City of Newman has only two signalized intersections. These two are
the intersection of Merced Street and Highway 33 and the intersection of
Kern Street and Highway 33. The remaining controlled intersections either
have all-way stops signs or stop signs in two directions. As part of the Gen-
eral Plan background study, the two signalized intersections, as well as several
stop sign-controlled intersections along the City’s collectors and arterials were
analyzed. These intersections include the following:
  ♦  Highway 33/Jensen Road
  ♦  Orestimba Road / Yolo Street/“T” Street / Hardin Road
  ♦  Hills Ferry Road/Driskell Avenue
  ♦  Highway 33/Yolo Street
  ♦  Fig Lane/Kern Street
  ♦  Highway 33/Kern Street
  ♦  Hoyer Road / Inyo Avenue/Merced Street
  ♦  Merced Street/“Q” Street
  ♦  Highway 33/Merced Street
  ♦  Inyo Avenue/ Prince Street
  ♦  Highway 33/Inyo Avenue

Table TC-2 depicts the LOS levels that were used to determine the 2005 oper-
ating levels for each intersection during both the AM (7 to 9 a.m.) and the PM
(4-6 p.m.) peak hours. For those intersections controlled by an all way stop
or a signal, the existing level of service is C or better. This satisfies the City’s
current minimum standard. All of the intersection controlled by side street
stop signs also operated at LOS “C” or better except for the intersection of
Highway 33 and Inyo Avenue. During the AM peak hour, motorists waiting
to turn onto Highway 33 experience delays of over 25 seconds, which is in-
dicative of LOS “D” conditions.
2. Freight Movements
Freight traffic in and through Newman consists primarily of rail and truck
traffic. Truck traffic and the operation of the existing railroad through the
city are described below.
a. Trucks
Freight, mainly consisting of retail and agricultural goods, travels to and from
Newman by truck. Through truck traffic also passes through Newman on
Highway 33 and Hills Ferry Road. Recognizing the negative impacts truck
traffic has on residential neighborhoods and noise sensitive land uses, while
also recognizing the important role that trucks play in the local and regional
economy, the City of Newman’s municipal code has designated truck routes.
These routes are located primarily on major arterials and other roadways that
directly serve the city’s industrial areas and avoid primarily residential areas.
As per the municipal code, trucks over a gross weight of 10,000 pounds are
not allowed on other city streets except for local pick-ups or deliveries or to
repair or service the vehicle.
b. Railroad
A branch line of the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) passes along Highway
33 in Newman. Currently, one freight train goes southbound through town
to Volta and then returns back through town northbound each weekday.
While this railroad line could provide freight service to Newman, the existing

businesses and industrial uses do not use this rail service, shipping by truck
instead.
Even though the west side railroad line does not have heavy train traffic and
train speeds are typically only between 15 and 25 miles per hour, the line does
have an impact on the community. This railroad line bisects the community
and limits access between the portion of Newman on the west side of the
tracks and the portion on the east side by restricting the number of at grade
street crossings. The only streets that cross the railroad and connect the east-
ern and western portions of Newman are Inyo Avenue, Merced Street,
Driskell Avenue and Sherman Parkway, which was recently developed at the
northern City limit. The Public Utilities Commission and the Railroad con-
trol and approve new grade crossings and grade crossing improvements and
are not likely to approve the development of additional new grade crossings.
3. Public Transit
Newman is served by Stanislaus County Transit’s Westside Runabouts. Run-
abouts are a transit service that combines designated fixed stops (like a fixed
route) and curb-to-curb service (like a dial-a-ride). The Westside Runabouts
are available to the general public, with subscription rides allowed on a lim-
ited basis. The Westside Runabouts run along Highway 33 to link Newman
with the communities of Crows Landing and Patterson. The line continues
easterly to Turlock.
Newman is also served by Stanislaus County Transit’s Dial-A-Ride Service.
This service operates door-to-door from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through
Saturday.
4. Park-and-Ride Facilities
Park-and-ride facilities are free parking lots for commuters to use as a conven-
ient meeting place for carpools, transit and vanpools. Presently there are no
park-and-ride lots in Newman or on the west side of the County. Based on
the 2000 Census, over 550, or almost one quarter of the total commuters in
Newman, reported commute to work time of over 60 minutes. Of these
TC-8

                                                          C I T Y O F N E W M A N

                 T R A N S P O R T A T I O N A N D C I R C U L A T I O N E L E M E N T
commuters, more than half reported commute times of 90 minutes or more.
Given the growing trend of Newman workers commuting long distances to
jobs in the San Francisco-San Jose Bay Area, and other locations outside of
Stanislaus County, the development of park-and-ride facilities in or within
close proximity to Newman would help facilitate and encourage ridesharing
by its commuters.
5. Parking
Newman generally has an adequate supply of parking and parking is not an
issue. All new residential and commercial developments are required to meet
the City’s parking standards, contained within the City’s Zoning Code, and
provide off-street parking spaces. Most streets within Newman also have on-
street parking.
The downtown commercial core generates the most demand for parking.
While development in the commercial core is relatively old and does not meet
the City’s current off-street parking requirements, there is still sufficient pub-
lic parking. Public parking in the commercial core is provided by diagonal
parking spaces along Main Street and in two public parking lots, an approxi-
mately 20-space lot located on the west side of Main Street and a 40-space lot
on the east side of Main Street across from the Westside Theater. This second
public lot is planned to be redeveloped into a public plaza and parking lot
that will contain an additional 20 parking spaces. In addition to the publicly
owned parking lots, the City leases a lot on Main Street adjacent to the
Westside Veterinary Clinic to provide more public parking. Employee park-
ing and customer parking is also provided on many properties in private sur-
face parking lots located behind the commercial buildings and accessed by
alleys.
6. Pedestrian System
The City of Newman’s pedestrian system primarily consists of sidewalks
within the public right-of-ways and crosswalks. Most of the streets within the
City have sidewalks on both sides. In addition, there are two dedicated pedes-
trian pathways that are located outside of public street right-of-ways. These
                                                                                 TC-9

pathways are located adjacent to Von Renner Elementary School and Upper
Road.
The majority of the destinations within Newman, including the downtown
commercial core and most schools and parks, are accessible by walking and
the sidewalks are generally in good condition. There are, however, locations
where there are gaps in the sidewalk system. These locations are generally
adjacent to undeveloped lots or lots that were developed prior annexation to
the City. These sidewalk and street right-of-ways will be fully developed as
the adjacent lots develop or redevelop. An example of such a location is
Hoyer Road, between Yolo Middle School and downtown. Children walk-
ing to school and other pedestrians must walk on dirt pathways along por-
tions of Hoyer Road because this right-of-way has not yet been developed to
City standards.
While the majority of the destinations within Newman are accessible by
walking, the degree of pedestrian accessibility varies greatly between the age
of a neighborhood or area. Within the downtown, for example, the streets
are laid out in a traditional grid pattern with block lengths of 400 feet. This
circulation pattern provides pedestrians with a high level of accessibility to
destinations, often providing direct or nearly direct walking routes. The
more recent residential neighborhoods built since the 1980’s are built with
few through streets, multiple cul-de-sacs that do not provide through pedes-
trian connections and walls along collector and arterial streets. This circula-
tion pattern creates long and indirect walks to destinations and discourages
walking.
The walking or streetscape environment also varies greatly between
neighborhoods within Newman. The downtown and most of the mature
neighborhoods have park strips between the curb and the sidewalk. These
park strips often contain street trees that provide shade for pedestrians. In the
development built since the 1980’s, the design of the streetscapes and side-
walks are inconsistent. While some new neighborhoods were developed with
the traditional streetscape that includes a park strip and row of street trees

located between the curb and sidewalk, other new developments have solid
curb and sidewalks, with no park strip providing a buffer between pedestrians
and the street and no street trees providing shade in the hot summers.
As required by the American’s with Disabilities Act (ADA), all streets re-
cently development in Newman include accessibility ramps at corners and
crosswalks. However many of the older intersections, developed prior to the
passage of the ADA, do not and need to be retrofitted.
7. Bicycle System
Newman has many qualities that make it an ideal community for biking. It is
flat, the weather is temperate for a good part of the year, motor vehicle traffic
volumes are low and destinations within the community are relatively close
together. While the local streets and most of the collector and arterials do not
contain designated bike facilities, Newman does have Class I (bicycle path) or
Class II (bicycle lane) on a few roadways. Caltrans defines these facilities as
follows:
  ♦ Class 1 Bikeway (Bicycle Path). Provides a completely separate right-of-
      way and is designated for the exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians
      with vehicle and pedestrian cross-flow minimized.
  ♦ Class II Bikeway (Bicycle Lane). Provides a restricted right-of-way and
      is designated for the use of bicycles with a striped land on a street or
      highway. Vehicle parking and vehicle/pedestrian cross-flow are permit-
      ted.
Within the Newman there is an existing Class I path along the south side of
Sherman Parkway between the railroad tracks and Hills Ferry Road. Class II
bike lanes are located along “S” and “T” Streets between Yolo Street and Inyo
Avenue.

B. Roadway Classification and Standards
Each of the roadways in Newman’s comprehensive roadway network can be
categorized according to a typology known as roadway functional classifica-
tion. Roadway functional classification is a method to classify a roadway
based on the type of service it provides. Since two major functions of a
roadway are to serve through traffic and provide access to adjacent property,
different roadways prioritize these two functions differently. For instance,
arterials prioritize the movement of traffic over access to individual adjacent
properties whereas local streets prioritize access to private properties over
through traffic. Roadways are also intended to provide bicycle and pedestrian
access and circulation and are the backbone of the bicycle and pedestrian
network.
The city’s ultimate roadway plan, with general functional classifications, is
shown in Figure TC-1. The current functional classifications for roadways in
Newman are detailed below, and planned improvements are then discussed in
Section D. The roadway network shown in Figure TC-1 is conceptual. As
development occurs, actual roadway locations may vary, provided that over-
all the connectivity shown in Figure TC-1 is achieved.
1. Arterials
Arterials are facilities that are fed by collector roadways, provide for cross-
town and regional travel and carry larger volumes of traffic. They are in-
tended not just for motor vehicle circulation but also for bicycle and pedes-
trian circulation, and shall not be designed to facilitate motor vehicle travel at
the expense of bicycle and pedestrian circulation. All right-of-way widths are
intended to include sidewalks of sufficient width to allow two pedestrians to
walk side-by-side and a planting strip wide enough to accommodate large
canopy shade street trees between the sidewalk and the curb and gutter. All
arterials are also intended to include on-street Class II bicycle lanes or Class I
off-street bicycle paths, as shown on Figure TC-2.

Arterials are divided into two and four-lane facilities as described below.
a. Four-Lane Arterials
New four-lane arterials are divided roadways with a large landscaped median
to be used for auxiliary lane purposes at intersections. Away from intersec-
tions, median breaks shall only be used to provide access to arterial and col-
lector streets and to provide mid-block pedestrian crossings on long blocks.
On high-volume, four-lane arterials, projected to have daily traffic volumes
that are in excess of 25,000 vehicles, and speeds of 45 miles per hour or
greater, there should be no direct access to adjacent properties unless no rea-
sonable alternative exists. Such direct access should be limited to right-turn in
and right-turn out movements only. If driveways must be provided near in-
tersections for facilities such as service stations, such driveways should be lo-
cated at least 50 feet from the intersection. Speed limits on arterial roadways
are typically in the 35 to 40-mile per hour range.
Four-lane arterials that include on-street parking on both sides shall typically
have 104 to 108 foot rights of way while those four-lane facilities without on-
street parking shall typically have 90 to 92 foot rights-of-way. Right-of-way
widths may be greater at intersections to allow for added turn lanes. New or
improved arterials that are intended to include Class I Bikeways (bicycle
paths) instead of Class II Bicycle Lanes will need an additional 5 feet of right-
of-way to accommodate the development of an off-street bike path on one
side of the right-of-way. These arterials include the Jensen Road/Sherman
Parkway, Prince Street and portions of Highway 33/“N” Street.
Roadways classified as four-lane arterials on Figure TC-1 include:
  ♦  “N” Street/Highway 33
  ♦  Jensen Road/Sherman Parkway
  ♦  Merced Road east of Main Street
  ♦  Hills Ferry Road
  ♦  Kern Street/Driskell Avenue between Main Street and Balsam Drive

b. Two-Lane Arterials
New two-lane arterial roadways that are intended to include on-street parking
on both sides shall typically have 68 to 70 foot rights-of-way. Two-lane arte-
rials that do not include any on-street parking shall typically have 54 to 56
foot right-of-ways. Right-of-way widths may be greater at intersections to
allow for an added turn lane. Like with four-lane arterials, driveways should
be at least 50 feet from an intersection. Two-lane arterials typically do not
have a landscaped median.
Roadways classified as two-lane arterials on Figure TC-1 include:
  ♦  Stuhr Road
  ♦  Hoyer Road west of Harvey Road
  ♦  Orestimba Road
  ♦  Canal School Road
  ♦  Harvey Road
  ♦  Harvey Road extension north of Shiells Road
  ♦  Shiells/Brazo Road
  ♦  Upper Road
  ♦  Merced Street between Inyo Avenue and Main Street
  ♦  Prince Road between Canyon Creek Drive and Inyo Avenue
  ♦  Shiells Road and Draper Road north of Shiells Road
2.   Collectors
Collectors are intended to “collect” traffic from local roadways and carry it to
roadways higher in the street classification hierarchy (i.e., arterials). These
roadways also serve adjacent properties. Collectors are broken into two types
of facilities, major collectors and minor collectors, which are described below.
a. Major Collectors
Major collectors generally carry light to moderate traffic volumes, and speed
limits are typically in the 25 to 30 miles per hour range. Roadways designated
as major collectors in Figure TC-1 include:
                                                                                 TC-15

  ♦  Yolo Street
  ♦  Kern Street
  ♦  Inyo Avenue
  ♦  Prince Road south of Shiells Road
  ♦ “T” Street
  ♦  Fig Lane/“Q” Street
  ♦  Barrington Road
  ♦  Driskell Road
  ♦  Hallowell Road
  ♦  Balsam Drive
  ♦  Eucalyptus Avenue
All new collectors shall include Class II Bicycle Lanes and on-street parking
and will typically have 68 to 70-foot right-of-way. New collectors will also
include sidewalks on both sides of the street that are wide enough to accom-
modate two pedestrians walking side-by-side and are separated from the curb
and gutter by a planting strip wide enough for large canopy street trees. If
driveways must be provided near intersections for facilities such as service
stations, they should be at least 50 feet from the intersection.
b. Minor Collectors
Minor collectors are intended to connect neighborhoods to each other and
generally carry light traffic volumes, with speed limits set at 25 miles per
hour. Furthermore, minor collectors generally are and shall be located to
provide through motor vehicle, pedestrian and bicycle connections every
quarter of a mile. To discourage cross-town traffic, minor collectors have
stop signs at intersections with collectors or arterials and four way stop signs
when intersecting with other minor collectors. They generally do not have
signalized intersections. New minor collectors shall typically have a 58 foot
right-of-way that includes sidewalks wide enough to accommodate two pedes-
trians walking side-by-side and a planting strip wide enough to accommodate
the planting of large shade trees. Unlike major collectors, minor collectors do
not include Class II bicycle lanes.

New minor collectors do not have to be developed in the exact locations
shown on Figure TC-1. However, a functional equivalent of each minor col-
lector shall be developed and the segments of a given minor collector shall
provide through connections, connecting with each other at four way inter-
sections.
3. Local Streets
Local streets are intended to serve adjacent properties only and should en-
hance community livability. They carry very little, if any, through traffic,
and generally carry very low traffic volumes, usually less than 5,000 vehicles
per day. While often discontinuous in alignment, many of Newman’s local
streets are laid out in a grid pattern, making through travel possible, but not
desirable. Speed limits on local roadways normally do not exceed 25 miles
per hour. Not all roadways are depicted on Figure TC-1. New local road-
ways shall typically have a 58-foot right-of-way or a 50-foot right-of-way for
shorter segments with limited traffic such as cul-de-sacs. Like arterials and
collectors, new local streets shall also include ample sidewalks separated from
the curb and gutter by a planting strip wide enough to accommodate street
trees. Pedestrian and bicycle safety, and aesthetics should be high priorities
on local streets.
C. Bicycle Network
As discussed in the background section there are two types of bicycle facilities
planned in Newman, Class I (Bike Paths) and Class II (Bike Lanes). Figure
TC-2 shows where these facilities are planned to be developed or, where they
currently exist, will be maintained.
Class I (Bike Path) facilities currently exist along the south side of Sherman
Parkway between the railroad and Hills Ferry Road. This pathway is
planned to be extend along Jensen Road to the CCID canal and from Hills
Ferry Road to the Wasteway. Class I bike paths are also planned along Canal
School Road between Hills Ferry Road and Brazo Road, and along the future

South Parkway. Additional Class I bike paths are planned along the eastern
side of the Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way, along the CCID Canal and
along the Wasteway. All three of these facilities are intended to be extended
beyond the City limits. The path along the railroad right-of-way could ulti-
mately be extended by Merced and Stanislaus Counties as regional bikeways,
linking Patterson in the North to Gustine or Los Banos in the south.
Class II (Bike Lane) facilities are planned on all arterials streets that do not
have an adjacent bike path and on major collectors only. Along some existing
arterials and collectors there could be insufficient right-of-way to allow for
the striping of bike baths and bicycles would have to share the roadway with
motor vehicles. To identify specific bicycle circulation improvements needed
to implement this network of bike paths and lanes, and the phasing and fund-
ing of these improvements, the City will prepare a Bicycle Master Plan.
Additional through connections for bicycles on smaller, lower traffic streets
shall also be provided in all new developments.
D. Truck Routes
Figure TC- 3 shows the location of dedicated truck routes. These designated
Truck Routes are intended to provide for the movement of goods by truck
through and to and from Newman, while also minimizing the negative im-
pacts of truck traffic on residences and other noise sensitive land uses. Trucks
shall only be permitted to use other, non designated, roadways for local deliv-
eries and to secure repairs or servicing.

E. Planned Circulation Improvements
Based on the traffic and circulation studies completed for Newman and the
policies and actions contained in this General Plan, several improvements to
the local circulation system have been identified to support the land use plan.
Improvements to roadways are described below. Intersection improvements
are described in Table TC-3. The following roadway improvements are iden-
tified on Figure TC-4 and the numbering on the Figure corresponds to the
numbering below. The location of new roadways identified below are con-
ceptual and as development occurs, actual roadway locations may vary, pro-
vided that overall the connectivity shown in Figure TC-1 is achieved.
1.   Highway 33 Expansion. Improve the capacity of Highway 33 by wid-
     ening the right of way to accommodate four lanes of traffic. Because the
     adjacent properties are developed between Yolo and Inyo Avenue and a
     significant number of them are not likely to redevelop, widening the
     right of way along this segment of Highway 33 is not feasible. Therefore
     Highway 33, between Yolo and Inyo Avenues, will need to be re-striped
     to four lanes within the existing right-of-way and curb to curb width.
     The portion of Highway 33 adjacent to the railroad will include a Class I
     Bikeway (bicycle path). Where the railroad separates from Highway 33
     in central Newman, the bikeway will be located adjacent to the railroad
     right of way and separate from the Highway 33.
2.   New West Parkway (Harvey Road). Develop the West Parkway be-
     tween Stuhr Road and Hallowell Road. The future West Parkway will
     be an extension of the existing Harvey Road. The portion of West
     Parkway north of Sheills Road, or the future South Parkway, will be de-
     veloped as a two-lane arterial and the portion between Shiells/South
     Parkway and Hallowell Road will be developed as a two-lane collector.
3.   Prince Street Improvements. Expand Prince Street into a four-lane ar-
     terial between Inyo Avenue and the future South Parkway. Prince Street
     will include Class II bicycle lanes on both sides of the street.
                                                                                 TC-21

F. Goals, Policies and Actions
1.   Roadways
Goal TC-1           Create and maintain a roadway network that pro-
                    vides for the safe and efficient movement of people
                    and goods throughout the City while maintaining
                    the quality of life for residents.
Policy TC-1.1       The City shall endeavor to maintain a LOS “C” as defined
                    by the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual or subsequent revi-
                    sions, on all streets and signalized intersections within the
                    City except on Merced Street downtown, Kern Street be-
                    tween Main Street and Highway 33, and Highway 33, where
                    a level of service lower than “C” is acceptable.
Policy TC-1.2       To identify the potential impacts of new development on
                    traffic service levels, the City shall require the preparation of
                    traffic impact analyses at the sole expense of the developer
                    for developments determined to be large enough to have po-
                    tentially significant traffic impacts. All development pro-
                    posals shall be reviewed to assure consistency with the cir-
                    culation policies and standards contained in the General
                    Plan.
Policy TC-1.3       Streets shall be dedicated, widened, extended and con-
                    structed according to City standards as shown in Sections B,
                    C, D and E of this Transportation and Circulation Element
                    Dedication and improvements of full right-of-ways shall not
                    be required in existing developed areas where the City de-
                    termines that such improvements are either infeasible or
                    undesirable. The City may allow other deviations if the
                    City Engineer determines that safe and adequate public ac-
                    cess and circulation are preserved by such deviations.

Policy TC-1.4  The City shall encourage the development of a grid pattern
               of collector and local streets in newly developing areas. De-
               velopment of paved alleys may be allowed in conjunction
               with grid street patterns. Development of cul-de-sacs that
               do not provide for through bicycle and pedestrian connec-
               tions shall be discouraged.
Policy TC-1.5  The City shall provide for the phased development of an
               arterial grid street system to facilitate travel around the exist-
               ing developed portion of the City and ensure access to new
               areas of the city as it expands. The arterial street system
               shall be constructed with a sufficient number of lanes to sat-
               isfy traffic volumes through 2030, although right-of-way
               may be reserved for traffic volumes beyond 2030. Arterial
               streets may be widened subsequently (after 2030) to respond
               to increased traffic volumes.
Policy TC-1.6  Street widths for new or improved arterials, collector and
               local streets shall be limited to the minimum width neces-
               sary to adequately carry the volume of anticipated traffic
               and meet the City’s Level of Service Policy of C while al-
               lowing for adequate bicycle and pedestrian facilities and
               emergency access.
Policy TC-1.7  Traffic calming measures shall be incorporated into the de-
               sign and construction of new roadways to discourage speed-
               ing of motor vehicles. On arterials and collectors, traffic
               calming measures could include intersection and mid-block
               bulb-outs, large canopy street trees, pedestrian refuge is-
               lands, and narrower street widths, consistent with Policy
               TC-1.5 above. On local streets, traffic calming measures
               could include also include street trees, bulb-outs and nar-
               rower streets widths or other measures approved by the
               City.
                                                                             TC-27

Policy TC-1.8       The City shall cooperate with the County and Caltrans in
                    monitoring traffic volumes on Highway 33 and at the Stuhr
                    Road interchange at Interstate 5. The City shall support ap-
                    propriate actions and improvements to maintain adequate
                    levels of service on Highway 33 to the extent feasible and
                    adequate levels of service at the Stuhr Road/I-5 interchange.
Policy TC-1.9       The City shall provide for the southern extension of Main
                    Street south of Inyo Avenue into the West Side shopping
                    center as shown in Figure TC-5, with an additional connec-
                    tion to Prince Street. As an interim measure a pedestrian
                    only connection might be established from Prince Street to
                    the shopping center.
Policy TC-1.10 The City shall prohibit development of private streets in
                    new residential projects, except in extraordinary circum-
                    stances.
Policy TC-1.11 On-street truck parking shall be prohibited in residential
                    areas and where such parking restricts adequate sight dis-
                    tances or otherwise poses a potentially hazardous situation.
                    The City shall maintain appropriate truck routes. Industrial
                    and commercial development shall be planned so that truck
                    access through residential areas is minimized.
Policy TC-1.12 New development shall ensure that safe and efficient emer-
                    gency vehicle access is provided.
Policy TC-1.13 The City shall ensure through a combination of traffic im-
                    pact fees and other funding mechanisms that new develop-
                    ment pays its share of the costs of circulation improvements.
                    The total cost of required improvements shall be paid for by
                    new development.

                    projects and improvements to existing roadways.
Policy TC-4.1       To the extent feasible, the City shall provide for separation
                    of residential and other noise sensitive land uses from major
                    roadways to reduce noise and air pollution impacts.

Policy TC-5.1  The City shall continue to participate in state, regional, and
               local transportation planning efforts to ensure coordination
               of the expansion and improvement of the region's transpor-
               tation system.
Policy TC-5.2  The City shall continue to maintain formal and informal
               lines of communication between adjacent jurisdictions to
               ensure cooperation in the development of transportation
               systems that cross jurisdictional boundaries. In particular,
               the City will work with Merced County to develop im-
               provements to Canal School Road, Brazo Road and High-
               way 33 north of its intersection with Canal School Road.
               Potential intersection improvements specifically include sig-
               nalization of the intersections of Highway 33 and Brazo
               Road, Brazo Road and Canal School Road, Highway 33 and
               Sanchez Road and Sanchez Road and Canal School Road.
               Potential roadway improvements specifically include devel-
               opment of Brazo Road and Canal School Road into arterial
               roads in Merced County.
Policy TC-5.3  The City shall continue to work with Stanislaus County
               and other cities in the county to maintain and implement
               the County’s Congestion Management Plan.
Action TC-5.1  Request that the County update the Regional Traffic Mitiga-
               tion Fee to reflect needed improvements to regional facili-
               ties, including capital improvements that could be needed to
               ensure adequate access between Newman and Interstate 5 as
               the City and the region grows.

6.   Parking
Goal TC-6           Ensure the adequate provision of both on- and off-
                    street parking.
Policy TC-6.1       If future growth in traffic volumes necessitates removal of
                    on-street parking places to provide additional traffic lanes,
                    the City should ensure that the lost on-street spaces are re-
                    placed with an equal number of off-street spaces within the
                    same vicinity.
Policy TC-6.2       The City shall require provision of adequate off-street park-
                    ing in conjunction with all new developments.         Shared
                    parking arrangements shall be encouraged. To the maxi-
                    mum extent possible, downtown parking shall be located
                    behind buildings, out of direct view from Main Street. Pri-
                    mary access to parking shall be via "N,” Kern, Tulare,
                    Fresno, Merced and Stanislaus Streets. For a conceptual dia-
                    gram illustrating where parking shall be located in the
                    downtown refer to Figure TC-6.
Policy TC-6.3       In the design of new or reconfiguration of existing streets,
                    the City shall balance the need for improved traffic flow
                    with need for on-street parking. On-street parking not only
                    provides public parking opportunities, but also provides a
                    barrier between pedestrians and through vehicular traffic,
                    thereby creating a more pedestrian friendly environment.
                    The Street Master Plan shall develop criteria for developing
                    on-street parking by street type.
Action TC-6.1       Review and revise, as necessary, the parking requirements of
                    the Zoning Ordinance to ensure adequate parking for new
                    development.

Goal TC-7           Provide a bicycle and pedestrian network to en-
                    courage bicycling and walking for both transporta-
                    tion and recreation.
Policy TC-7.1       The City shall create and maintain a safe and convenient
                    system of pedestrian and bicycle facilities that encourages
                    walking or bicycling as an alternative to driving. These
                    routes should directly link residential neighborhoods, parks,
                    schools, downtown, neighborhood shopping centers public
                    facilities and employment centers. New development shall
                    be required to develop and/or contribute to the develop-
                    ment of these facilities.
Policy TC-7.2       The City shall promote development and street patterns
                    that encourage walking, bicycling and other forms of non-
                    motorist transportation.
Policy TC-7.3       The City shall require installation of sidewalks and/or walk-
                    ing paths along all city streets in newly developing areas.

Policy TC-7.5  Within the Master Plan Subareas a system of pedestrian
               trails shall be developed within linear open space corridors
               linking residential neighborhoods, downtown, shopping ar-
               eas, employment centers, and parks, schools and other pub-
               lic facilities.
Policy TC-7.6  Bicycle facilities shall be developed on all new arterials and
               collectors and on all existing arterials and collectors, where
               feasible. Bicycle facilities on arterials should consist of ei-
               ther Class I (Bike Path) or Class II (Bike Lane) facilities. On
               collector streets, Bicycle facilities should consist of Class II
               bike lanes. Figure TC-2, the Bicycle Network Diagram,
               shows the ultimate location of Class I and Class II bicycle
               facilities in Newman.
Policy TC-7.7  The City shall require inclusion of bicycle parking facilities
               at all new major public facilities and commercial and em-
               ployment sites.
Policy TC-7.8  Bicycle and pedestrian safety shall be considered when de-
               signing and implementing improvements for automobile
               traffic operations. Improvements for motor vehicle circula-
               tion shall not detract from or degrade the pedestrian and bi-
               cycle circulations system.
Policy TC-7.9  The City shall work with Stanislaus County, Merced
               County, the cities of Patterson and Gustine, the community
               of Crows Landing and other West Side communities in an
               effort to develop a regional bike path along the railroad
               right-of-way, the CCID canal and the Delta Mendota Canal
               linking Newnan with other West Side communities.

5 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICES ELEMENT
  The Public Services and Facilities Element addresses the changing public services
  and infrastructure needs of the City and provides for their logical and timely ex-
  tension to keep pace with growth. Policies supporting well maintained infrastruc-
  ture, excellent fire and police services, quality schools and healthcare services are
  essential to achieve broader community development objectives and support the
  future envisioned by the residents of Newman.
  Although the Public Services and Facilities Element is an optional element
  and is not required by State law, the topics addressed here are an integral part
  of the City’s overall planning strategy and play an important role setting
  growth and development policy. This Element is important to ensure that
  development occurs concurrently with the availability and/or funding of
  public services and facilities, and that adequate and high quality public facili-
  ties and services are provided in the City of Newman. Public services and
  facilities (“Public Facilities and Services”) include water, wastewater, storm
  drainage, fire services, solid waste, streets and highways, other utilities, parks
  and governmental services, and schools and education services and facilities
  (including permanent and interim school facilities, District-wide support fa-
  cilities, and transportation and bussing facilities). Recreation and open space
  facilities, such as parks, are addressed in the Recreation and Cultural Re-
  sources Element. Public facilities related to transportation and circulation are
  addressed in the Transportation and Circulation Element. This Public Facili-
  ties and Services Element addresses the following topics:
    ♦   Water
    ♦   Wastewater
    ♦   Stormwater Drainage
    ♦   Agricultural Irrigation Drainage
    ♦   Solid Waste and Recycling
    ♦   Police
    ♦   Fire
    ♦   Schools
    ♦   Libraries
    ♦   Healthcare
                                                                                 PFS-1

The Element is divided into two sections:
  ♦ Background Information. Contains information on current public ser-
     vices and facilities, and the infrastructure serving Newman.
  ♦ Goals, Policies and Actions. Contains policy guidance for the provision
     of adequate public services and facilities as change occurs in the City, and
     action items to be pursued during the lifetime of the General Plan.
A. Background Information
1. Water
The City of Newman owns and provides water service within the city limits,
and is the only public water agency serving the Planning Area. The city’s
potable water source is groundwater. All areas within the Planning Area
have underlying groundwater, and static water levels vary from 30 to 50 feet
below the surface. Groundwater wells are drilled to the blue clay layer which
is approximately 500 feet deep. There is adequate water supply, but water
quality is an issue because of high salinity. The City expects that an alternate
water source, such as treated surface water, may be implemented in the next
10 years.
Currently, there are four wells serving the City with a maximum pumping
capacity of 6,000 gallons per minute, or 8.6 million gallons per day. It is ex-
pected that there is sufficient groundwater available to serve future growth
with new wells.
Water is stored in a 100,000 gallon elevated storage tank at the northeast cor-
ner of Fresno and Q Streets. A ground-level storage tank may be needed in
the future.
Most of the existing water distribution system is relatively new. In 1982,
Newman voters approved a $1 million water main replacement project. The
water mains were enlarged, gridded, and connected for increased fire flow and
improved water supply. In addition, new steamer-type hydrants with three

                                                                  G E N E R A L P L A N
                           P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S & S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
hose connections replaced the old hydrants. There are currently 276 fire hy-
drants and water for fire flow demand is satisfactory. Old water lines in the
alley between L and M streets, from Merced and Kern, still need to be re-
placed.
2. Wastewater
The City of Newman provides wastewater treatment and collection for most
residential, commercial and industrial developments within its City limits.
Some individual septic systems are used both inside and outside of the City
limits.
The existing wastewater collection system is adequate to serve existing de-
mand within the City of Newman. Additionally, a new wastewater main was
constructed along Sherman Parkway from Highway 33 to Hills Ferry Road.
This main turns west on Hills Ferry Road and then runs into the existing
outfall lines at Merced/Hills Ferry Road. This system is designed to take in
all wastewater connections from new development north of Sherman Park-
way to Stuhr Road, from the CCID canal to the west and Hills Ferry Road to
the east. The southwest portion of the City does not, however, have addi-
tional wastewater capacity to accommodate future demand generated by new
development. Any further annexations in this area would require master plan
improvements to the pipes conveying flows to the outfall lines.
Another significant component of the City of Newman’s wastewater collec-
tion system is its systems of seven wastewater lift stations located throughout
the city. This system is currently functioning at capacity. Any new large
scale development would require the development of a new lift station and
possibly additional improvements.
Newman’s Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Facilities are located on a
total 450 acres of city land next to the San Joaquin River, one mile northeast
of town on Hills Ferry Road. The general location of these facilities is shown
on Figure PFS-1. The plant conducts primary and secondary treatment of
                                                                                     PFS-3

wastewater. The treatment facility complies with all applicable wastewater
discharge and monitoring requirements.
Treated water is disposed of by providing flow and flood irrigation on City
owned agricultural land. Currently, 239 acres of agricultural land is irrigated
and farmed by a third party contracted by the City. Typical crops include
alfalfa, oats, corn (silage) and pasture grass. The irrigation system includes a
29-acre storage reservoir, an irrigation canal, recovery/circulation ditch, tail-
water collection pond and return pump station.
The water treatment plant has an operational capacity of 1.37 million gallons
a day (MGD) and a permitted capacity of 1.69 MGD. Currently, the capacity
of the wastewater treatment plant is the major factor limiting growth in New-
man. The City is working with a engineering consultant and the Central
Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) to create and ap-
prove a plan for additional wastewater facilities.
3. Stormwater Drainage
The City of Newman maintains and services all storm drains within the City.
In addition to the storm drains, some agricultural ditches used for irrigation
supply and tailwater runoff are also located within the City and SOI. These
ditches are maintained by the Central California Irrigation District (CCID).
Drainage within the Planning Area generally flows from west to east. Storm
runoff is collected in underground pipes and the CCID ditches and piped to a
pump station at Inyo Avenue and Canal School Road. Stormwater drainage
from a majority of the city feeds into a major pipe underneath Inyo Avenue.
This pipe is the main bottleneck in the present system and the City has plans
to upgrade about 750 to 1,000 feet of the pipe to 60-inch diameter. After this
upgrade, the storm drain system will be adequate to serve existing and ap-
proved development. The storm drainage system also includes seven lift sta-
tions to pump stormwater. This pump system is currently operating below
capacity.
                                                                                      PFS-5
C I T Y O F N E W M A N
G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S & S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
Stormwater runoff is not treated in Newman. The majority of the storm
water, including the water running through the Inyo Avenue pipe, drains
into the Wasteway, south and east of the City. In times of heavy stormwater
flow, overflow is directed towards lands owned by the California Department
of Fish and Game on the south side of Hills Ferry Road and the west side of
the San Joaquin River.
Because the City of Newman has a population of less than 10,000, the City is
not currently required to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit for its stormwater system. As authorized by the
Clean Water Act, the NPDES permit program controls water pollution by
regulating systems that discharge pollutants into waters of the United States.
When the city’s population reaches 10,000 Phase II NPDES permitting will
be required as well as the development of a stormwater management pro-
gram, which may involve treatment and monitoring.
4. Agricultural Irrigation Drainage
There are two subsurface or tile drain systems in the Planning Area, which
were installed to lower groundwater levels by draining agricultural irrigation
to the San Joaquin River. The tile drain systems are composed of under-
ground, unjointed 10-inch pipes laid in gravel beds. The large majority of
these tile drains are located within and maintained by the Newman Drainage
District (NDD), which is located in the northeastern area of the City.
Tile drains present two constraints to residential development. First, because
the water that drains through these systems flows directly into the San Joa-
quin River without being treated, the NDD does not want urban runoff and
associated contaminants to enter the tile drain system. Second, it is necessary
to maintain access to the tile drain system. Therefore, no buildings can be
placed on top of the system, and areas where the system is in place must be
preserved as parks or greenbelts, as is the case along the eastern edge of the
new Sherman Ranch subdivision.

                                                                 G E N E R A L P L A N
                          P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S & S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
There is also a smaller tile drain system, known as the Business Park Tile
Drain system, which drains agricultural lands between L Street and Canal
School Road. The same development constraints apply to this system.
5. Solid Waste and Recycling
The Bertolotti Disposal Company is the waste hauler for the City of New-
man and serves approximately 3,000 households and businesses in and around
Newman. Bertolotti collects recycling once every two weeks as well as nor-
mal household waste once a week. The waste is transported and landfilled at
the Stanislaus County Fink Road Landfill or burned at the Covanta Stanislaus
Transformation Facility. Both facilities are located on Fink Road in Crows
Landing.
6. Police Services
Police services are provided by the Newman Police Department within the
City limits, and by the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Department in unincorpo-
rated areas. In practice, both the Police Department and Sheriff’s Depart-
ment provide frequent mutual aid and back-up services within the Planning
Area. Police units are dispatched via the 911 system through the Stanislaus
County Central Dispatch in Modesto.
a. Newman Police Department
The Newman Police Department provides law enforcement within the City
limits. The police station is located at 1200 Main Street, as shown on Figure
PFS-1. The Department currently has eleven paid, sworn officers including
one Chief and one Investigator. There are also two full-time and two part-
time support staff. Until recently there was also a School Resources Officer.
The school district is currently applying for a grant to be able to re-instate
this position. There is also a Reserve Corps of five officers and about eight
people in the Volunteer in Police Services (VIPS) program who volunteer or
run errands, and sometimes do patrol services.
Additional services provided by the Newman Police Department include:
bicycle licensing, fingerprinting (application, immigration and children), ve-
                                                                                    PFS-7

hicle impound release, report and citation copies, fix it ticket sign-off, vehicle
I.D. verification, parking and municipal code citation collection, visa and
immigration letters, distribution of Department of Motor Vehicle booklets,
general information pamphlets, and crime prevention material.
The Police Department uses five patrol vehicles and there is one patrol beat
for the entire city. Staffing is usually one officer per patrol car. The staffing
ratio is 1.1 officers/1000 residents, and the target staffing ratio is 2/1000 indi-
cating that the City is not meeting its target with current staffing levels.
Calls are prioritized so that violent/emergency calls receive priority. The
average response time for these priority calls is 4 minutes. There is no stated
standard or policy for response time. In 2004 there was 1 homicide, 2 robber-
ies, 58 assaults, 49 burglaries, 131 larceny thefts and 37 car thefts.
b. Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office
The West County Area Command of the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office
encompasses approximately 400 square miles from the north county line to
the south county line, and west from Crows Landing Road to the west
county line. The West County Area Command is home to the two incorpo-
rated cities of Patterson and Newman, and the three unincorporated commu-
nities of Westley, Grayson, and Crows Landing. The Patterson station serves
as police headquarters for the City of Patterson, as well as the West County
Area Command Sub-Station.
The unincorporated City of Crows Landing has a Sheriff's Department sub-
station utilized by patrol deputies and volunteer staff. In addition, one dep-
uty is assigned to the unincorporated city of Westley and another deputy,
commonly referred to as the "five-beat deputy", patrols the remainder of the
unincorporated areas in the West County Area Command including the
Newman Planning Area. These deputies provide the Newman Police De-
partment with back-up and mutual aid.

7. Fire Services
Fire protection within the Planning Area is provided by the Newman Fire
Department and the West Stanislaus County Fire Protection District. Within
the Newman Planning Area there is one shared station located at 1162 N
Street, from which the Newman Fire Department generally responds to calls
within the City Limits and the District responds to unincorporated areas.
The location of this fire station is shown on Figure PFS-1.
a. Newman Fire Department
The Newman Fire Department is a volunteer fire department, with about 30
volunteers and one part-time, paid Fire Chief. The fire station in Newman
houses three City pumpers, two District pumpers, a new rescue engine jointly
purchased by the cities of Newman and Patterson and the West Stanislaus
County Fire District, and a new District 4,000-gallon water tender.
The average response time by the Newman Fire Department is 3 to 5 minutes
for locations within the city limits. There is no stated policy on expected
response times though an industry standard is generally 4 minutes. The City
maintains an Insurance Services Office (ISO) rating of 3 on a scale of 1 to 10,
with 1 being the best.
b. West Stanislaus County Fire Protection District
The West Stanislaus Fire District is a volunteer fire department. The District
has about 105 volunteers, including the 30 previously mentioned in Newman,
and paid positions for District Fire Chief and two Division Chiefs. Patterson
and the West District recently underwent a Needs Assessment which resulted
in new paid positions and the restructuring of the District Headquarters in
Paterson in a joint City of Paterson and District fire station.
In addition to the station shared with the Newman Fire Department and Pat-
terson Fire Department, the West Stanislaus Fire District also has stations in
Westley, Crows Landing, El Solyo and Diablo Grande. The Diablo Grande
station is a temporary facility, but is planned to become a permanent station
by about 2007.
                                                                                     PFS-9

G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S & S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
The stations in the West Stanislaus Fire District provide mutual aid for each
other. They also provide mutual aid for other Fire Districts in Stanislaus
County such as Woodland Avenue (Modesto), Salida, Westport and Moun-
tain View Fire Districts. The County also has an understanding of mutual aid
with the City of Tracy in San Joaquin County.
8. Schools
Public education facilities and services (grades K-12) are provided in the City
of Newman by the Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District
(“NCLUSD”). In addition to serving the City of Newman, the NCLUSD
also provides public education services to students living in the communities
of Crows Landing, Diablo Grande and the surrounding agricultural areas.
Public school facilities provided by the NCLUSD include permanent school
facilities, interim school facilities, land for permanent and interim school fa-
cilities, and District-wide support facilities (“School Facilities”). District-wide
support facilities include administration offices, food service and transporta-
tion services facilities, and warehousing and storage. Existing NCLUSD
schools are shown on Figure PFS-1.
The NCLUSD boundaries include approximately 384 square miles and incor-
porate the entire area of the City of Newman and portions of unincorporated
Stanislaus County. Recently NCLUSD undertook the preparation of the
Draft 2005-2006 Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District Facilities
Master Plan. This Master Plan provides an assessment of existing and future
facilities, identifying School Facilities that will be needed to accommodate
projected student growth. According to District policy, future School Facili-
ties and District-wide support facilities necessary to fulfill the development of
the General Plan are to be sited, financed and developed in accordance with
the District’s Facilities Master Plan then in effect.
9. Libraries
The Stanislaus County Library in Newman is located at 1305 Kern Street, and
is open 36 hours a week: Tuesdays from 12:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. and Wednes-
PFS-10

                                                             C I T Y O F N E W M A N

                           P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S & S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
day through Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The library is staffed by 2
full time and 1 part time person. The location of this library is shown on
Figure PFS-1.
The Newman library is one of the most widely used branches in the County
library system. Its usage rate is above for the size and population of the
community. Approximately 66 percent of Newman residents, or 5,574 peo-
ple, have active library cards, in comparison to a county average of 53 per-
cent. In addition to patrons from Newman and nearby parts of Stanislaus
County, patrons come from Gustine and Los Banos in Merced County.
41,000 items were circulated in fiscal year 2002-2003, and 35,477 in 2003-2004.
The Newman library has a permanent collection of over 16,000 items and a
traveling book collection of approximately 150 new books a month. The
library also offers free public computer use with internet access at five adult
stations and two children’s stations which have content filters. There were
3,910 adult and 428 child computer sessions in 2003, for a total of 4,338 ses-
sions. Pre-school StoryTime is offered weekly and was attended by 701 chil-
dren in 2003. Other programs offered at the library are free twice-monthly
astronomy classes (February-April), summer reading programs for children
and teens with live performances (June-August), a teen read program in Oc-
tober and a secondary children’s reading program in March.
The Newman library will merit expansion in approximately 2013 due to
growth in the west side of the valley. More community presentations and
outreach is also desired, especially to the Spanish-speaking community.
10. Healthcare
The City of Newman does not currently have a hospital. Until it closed in
the early 1990’s, the City was served by the Westside Community Hospital,
which was located at 151 South Highway 33, approximately one mile south
of Newman. This hospital provided general acute care and had a full-time
emergency room with ambulance and paramedic services. Presently, the
nearest hospital is the Emanuel Medical Center in Turlock, which is 23 miles
                                                                                   PFS-11

G E N E R A L P L A N
P U B L I C F A C I L I T I E S & S E R V I C E S E L E M E N T
from Newman. Additional hospitals are located in Tracy and Modesto to the
north and Los Banos to the south. The Westside Community Hospital Dis-
trict does, however, continue to provide ambulance service to Newman and
the surrounding west side communities.
The Golden Valley Health Center now occupies the former Westside Com-
munity Hospital Building and provides general family medical services Mon-
day through Friday during daytime hours. The mission of the Golden Valley
Health Center, which operates 18 health clinics in Stanislaus and Modesto
Counties, is to provide affordable primary health services to the region’s eth-
nically and economically diverse population.
Newman is also served by the Newman Family Resource Center, which is a
school, family and community-based non-profit providing a number of free
community services including health education. Through the Stanislaus
County Healthy Start program, the Center also provides free physical exams
for children once a month. The Center is located at 1300 Patchett Drive on
the Von Renner Elementary School property.

6 RECREATIONAL AND CULTURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
  Parks and recreation facilities are central to the quality of life in Newman, while
  the city’s archaeological and historic resources provide cultural meaning and con-
  tribute to the community’s distinctive character. The Recreational and Cultural
  Resources Element establishes a policy framework and action program for the ac-
  quisition, development and improvement of Newman’s parks and recreational
  facilities. The element addresses park standards, planning and design, inter-agency
  coordination, trails and greenways, recreation programs, and private recreation
  facilities. The Element also addresses the preservation of the community’s archaeo-
  logical and historical resources and heritage.
  Although the Recreation and Cultural Resource Element is an optional ele-
  ment and is not required by State law, the topics addressed here are an inte-
  gral part of the City’s overall planning strategy and play an important role
  setting growth and development policy. In addition, as with a State mandated
  element, this optional element must be internally consistent with the rest of
  the General Plan. This Element addresses the following topics:
    ♦  Parks, Open Space and Recreation Facilities
    ♦  Private Recreation Facilities
    ♦  Cultural Activities
    ♦  Recreation Programs
    ♦  Historic and Cultural Resources
    ♦  Heritage Tourism
    ♦  Native American Resources
  The Element is divided into two sections:
    ♦ Background Information. Contains information on recreation and cul-
       tural resources and facilities in Newman.
    ♦ Goals, Policies and Actions. Contains policy guidance for the provision
       of adequate parks, recreation and cultural facilities, the protection and
       promotion of cultural and historic resources, and the protection of Na-
       tive American resources. Action items to be pursued during the lifetime
       of the General Plan are also included.
                                                                               RCR-1

A. Background Information
This section provides background on existing parks and recreation opportuni-
ties in and around Newman, and also provides information on existing ar-
chaeological and historic resources within or adjacent to the city.
1. Parks and Recreation
The Parks and Recreation Department organizes sports activities and pro-
gramming in the City’s parks and recreation facilities. Parks are maintained
by the City’s Department of Public Works. The following provides an over-
view of the city’s recreational resources.
a. Park Standard
A sufficient supply of park land is important to maintain community livabil-
ity. The city has actively pursued park land acquisition and development to
meet community needs as the city grows. The City has a standard of five
acres of developed City park land per 1,000 residents.
b. Existing Parks
A variety of different park lands and facilities are needed to serve the diverse
needs of the community. The City’s parks include large community parks,
mid-sized neighborhood parks, and small mini-parks/playgrounds.
i. Community Parks
Community parks usually consist of larger sites that provide a mix of active
and passive recreational activities for the entire community.
  ♦ Lions Park is a six-acre community park at the northwest corner of
     Orestimba Road and Hardin Road. The park includes a skateboard park,
     a teen center, a wading pool, a community center, a lighted baseball field
     and a playground. It is next to Orestimba High School and also has ac-
     cess to the school playing fields.
  ♦ Pioneer Park is a community park covering the entire 2.9 acre block be-
     tween Fresno and Tulare Streets and R and Q Streets in the downtown.

     It features picnic tables, barbecue areas, a concession stand, a pavilion,
     covered dining areas and a playground.
   ♦ Densmore Park, a community park commonly called Library Field, is
     also located downtown. It is next to the Library between Kern and Mari-
     posa Streets and R and S Streets, and contains a small baseball diamond
     and open space for soccer.
   ♦ Hurd-Barrington Park is a community park on Barrington Avenue. It
     has a concession stand and restroom facilities, a basketball court, two
     small baseball diamonds and a playground.
ii. Neighborhood Parks
Neighborhood parks are smaller in size and host basic recreational activities
for people within a ¼- to ½-mile radius.
   ♦ Alfred “Bush” Rose Park, located on Park Circle in the new Stephens
     Ranch subdivision, has a play structure and playfield.
   ♦ Joe Borba Park in Lucas Ranch has a play structure and a basketball half-
     court.
   ♦ Janet Carlsen Park is on Canyon Creek Drive next to Von Renner Ele-
     mentary School.
iii. Mini-Parks
Mini-parks are small parks, typically less than one acre in size, that provide
recreational activities generally used by the local neighborhood or subdivi-
sion.
    ♦ Copeland Park, located at Yolo Street and Highway 33, has picnic ta-
      bles.
    ♦ Yancey Park, on Duck Blind Circle in Lucas Ranch, has a play struc-
      ture.
    ♦ Amy Street/Driskell Avenue Tot Lot at the Amy Street/Driskell Ave-
      nue intersection contains playground equipment.
                                                                                 RCR-3

parcels behind Yolo Middle School.
d. Recreational Programs
A variety of programs for youth and adults are organized through the Parks
and Recreation Department, including youth soccer, youth basketball, adult
basketball, swimming lessons and water aerobics classes. The Department
also runs the Youth Center at 831 Hardin Road, which is open weekday af-
ternoons for 6th to 12th graders.
e. Regional, State and Federal Parks
Regional and State parks, and federal lands near Newman offer additional
recreational and wildlife-viewing opportunities.
  ♦ Frank Raines Regional Park is a Stanislaus County Park in Del Puerto
     Canyon west of I-5. It offers biking, walking and picnic facilities.
  ♦ Hagaman County Park is a 74-acre Merced County Park with fishing,
     boating and picnicking on the Merced River approximately 15 miles east
     of Newman.
  ♦ George Hatfield State Recreation Area offers camping, boating, pic-
     nicking, and fishing on 46 acres on the Merced River four miles east of
     Newman on Hills Ferry Road.
  ♦ San Luis National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Complex is the largest pre-
     serve in the Central Valley, located approximately 15 miles south of
     Newman in Merced County. The San Luis NWR Complex comprises
     the 26,600-acre San Luis NWR, the 8,200-acre Merced NWR, the 12,800-
     acre San Joaquin River NWR and the Grasslands Management Area. The
     Complex is mostly marshland and native grasslands, and contains both
     managed grazing lands and wildlife refuge areas. The area is popular for
     wildlife observation, study and photography, and waterfowl hunting.

     species observed.
f. School Facilities
The Newman-Crows Landing Unified School District (NCLUSD) serves the
City of Newman and the communities of Crows Landing, Diablo Grande and
the surrounding agricultural areas. The District has three elementary schools,
one middle school and a high school. School district facilities and programs
help meet the community’s parks and recreational needs.
g. Private Recreational Resources
Private recreational resources in Newman include the Swamp Rats shooting
range and the Fisherman’s Bend campground on the San Joaquin River.
2. Cultural Resources
Cultural resources include both archaeological resources, ranging from ar-
rowheads to burial mounds from the prehistoric era, and historical resources,
such as buildings or locations important to more recent human history.
a. Archaeological Resources
Newman is within the historic territory of the Yokuts people, whose terri-
tory extended from the Tehachapi Mountains to the area of what is today
Stockton. The Yokuts likely lived along the San Joaquin and Stanislaus Riv-
ers and their tributaries, and inhabited the area at least 1,000 years ago.
Therefore, areas adjacent to waterways are considered highly sensitive for
archaeological resources. Much of the land along the eastern boundary of the
Planning Area were seasonally inundated marshlands and home to a variety
of resident and migratory waterfowl. The Yokuts and their predecessors
would likely have hunted the waterfowl that gathered there.
A search by the Central California Information Center (CCIC) to identify
any known or previously-recorded cultural resources within a one-mile radius
of the Planning Area identified one prehistoric site, CA-MER-215, also
known as the Wolfsen Mound. The site was characterized as a habitation site
                                                                                RCR-5

C I T Y O F N E W M A N
G E N E R A L P L A N
R E C R E A T I O N A L A N D C U L T U R A L R E S O U R C E S E L E M E N T
based on the presence of numerous house pits and human burials. An aggres-
sive data recovery investigation was conducted in 1977 to mitigate the de-
struction of the site by an upgrade of the City’s sewage system. A second site,
referred to as the W.R. Sherman area, was also located within the Planning
Area, about 1,000 meters northwest of the Wolfsen Mound, and was exca-
vated at the same time as the Wolfsen Mound. The Sherman site was not for-
mally recorded as it was found to be a “minimal use zone” associated with the
Wolfsen Mound, perhaps as a resource extraction locale.
Although these sites have been “destroyed,” there is a possibility that some
portion remains intact and should be taken into consideration in develop-
ment decisions. It is reasonable to expect that smaller prehistoric sites like the
W.R. Sherman area, which were used temporarily as resource extraction sites
for seed collecting and hunting, may be found within the Planning Area.
b. Historic Resources
The City of Newman, California was founded in April of 1888, by German-
born businessman, Simon Newman. Mr. Newman had come to Hills Ferry,
a small farming settlement on the banks of the San Joaquin River, at the close
of the Civil War. He bought a small mercantile business and was successful.
In 1887, the railroad was being built just a few miles from Hills Ferry. Mr.
Newman saw an opportunity to expand his business by moving it adjacent to
the rail line. He convinced others in Hills Ferry to move their businesses as
well, and just one year later, the town of Newman was founded.
Given in part, that Newman was established in 1888, the City of Newman
contains a significant number of historic homes and structures that contribute
to the unique character of the community and give the City a strong sense of
place. In 1984, an inventory was conducted of buildings in the City built be-
fore 1942. This inventory recorded over 200 historic homes. None was listed
on the National Register or the State Inventory of Historic Places. However,
twelve of the properties appeared eligible for separate listing on the National
Register. The inventory concluded that an additional twenty-nine properties
may also become eligible for separate National Register listing when the

                                                               G E N E R A L P L A N
          R E C R E A T I O N A L A N D C U L T U R A L R E S O U R C E S E L E M E N T
property becomes old enough to meet the Register’s 50-year requirement or
when more historical or architectural research is performed. It is likely that a
more detailed survey today would find a number of structures eligible for
consideration on local, State or national registers.
In addition to historic resources with the city limits of Newman, there are
known and potential historic resources adjacent to the City. The CCIC
search identified two historic structures outside the City but within the Plan-
ning Area: a portion of the Main Canal in Stanislaus County and an 85-year
old home at 1413 Orestimba Road. Two other historic features in the Plan-
ning Area are a portion of the Southern Pacific West Side line and the San
Joaquin (Joachim) Cemetery. The San Joachim Cemetery, at the southwest
corner of the intersection of Stuhr and Draper Roads, likely dates back to the
early 1890s. Nothing has been recorded about the history of this cemetery
other than its placement on historic and modern topographic maps. Further
investigation of the site would likely provide significant information about
the early settlers in the area.
A comparison of current topographic maps with a 1917 map of the Planning
Area revealed several rural structures that appear to have been in existence
since at least 1917. These structures might be eligible for listing on the Cali-
fornia Register and the National Register of Historic Places.
In addition, a plat map of the Newman area from 1862 shows a road that
heads south from Hills Ferry for about 3,250 feet and splits into two roads,
which are not on the 1917 or modern topographic maps. Portions of these
old dirt roads might remain intact in areas that have not been impacted by
intensive agriculture.
c. Newman Museum and the West Side Theatre
Newman's 1920 red brick Carnegie library building at the northwest corner
of O and Kern Streets now houses the Newman Museum. The museum

7 NATURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
  The Natural Resources Element provides direction regarding the conservation,
  development and use of natural resources in and around Newman, including ag-
  ricultural land, water quality, vegetation and wildlife, and air quality. Newman
  is committed to protecting and enhancing its environment and natural resources.
  The Element provides for the long-term preservation and orderly conversion of
  farmland, the protection of groundwater and surface water quality, the conserva-
  tion of plant and wildlife habitat and special-status species, and the improvement
  of air quality in the San Joaquin Valley air basin.
  This element addresses the State mandated Conservation Element and, by
  addressing open spaces that preserve natural and agricultural resources, the
  state mandated Open Space Element. In addition this Element addresses air
  quality in compliance with California Government Code Section 65302.1.
  This chapter includes discussion of the following topics:
    ♦  Agricultural Resources
    ♦  Water Quality
    ♦  Vegetation and Wildlife Resources
    ♦  Air Quality
    ♦  Energy and Water Conservation
  The Conservation Element is concerned with the protection of natural re-
  sources, including agricultural land, plants and animal wildlife, water bodies
  and watersheds, soils, minerals and energy conservation. The Open Space
  Element is intended to address the management of open space resources, de-
  fined as any parcel or area of public or private land or water that is essentially
  unimproved and undeveloped. These include open space that preserves natu-
  ral and cultural resources, manages production of resources, provides outdoor
  recreation, protects public health and safety and protects places, features and
  objects important to Native Americans.
  California Government Code Section 65302.1, was adopted by the California
  Legislature in response to the concern that the San Joaquin Valley has a seri-
  ous air pollution problem. As a result, cities and counties located in the San
  Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District must include goals, policies and
                                                                                NR-1

feasible implementation strategies in their General Plans to improve air qual-
ity. This Element addresses State requirements by including updated infor-
mation on air quality conditions, the regulatory environment, and goals, ob-
jectives, policies and actions to improve air quality in and around the City of
Newman. Other Elements, such as Land Use and Circulation, also include
policies and actions that work towards improving the air quality in the re-
gion.
The Natural Resource Element is divided into two sections:
  ♦ Background Information. Provides information on the existing condi-
      tions of agricultural resources, water quality, vegetation and wildlife re-
      sources, air quality and energy and water conservation.
  ♦ Goals, Policies and Actions. Provides policy guidance for protecting
      and preserving the important resources covered in this element, men-
      tioned above.
A. Background Information
This section provides background on natural resources in and around New-
man, including farmland, groundwater quality, vegetation and wildlife re-
sources and air quality.
1. Agricultural Resources
Agriculture is a major activity throughout Stanislaus County and the Central
Valley, including in Newman’s Planning Area. The industry has been at the
heart of the local economy and way of life throughout the city’s history and
continues to play a key role today.
It is important to the residents of Newman that new development minimize
the loss of agricultural land and not detract from the ability of nearby farms
to stay viable. Even as the city grows, Newman will to continue to be a
smaller town surrounded by undeveloped agricultural and ranching lands.
Areas planned for eventual urban uses will continue to be productively

                                                       C I T Y O F N E W M A N
                                                            G E N E R A L P L A N
                                       N A T U R A L R E S O U R C E S E L E M E N T
farmed for as long as possible. Areas beyond that will be preserved as a green-
belt around the city.
As the town grows, the potential for incompatibility between agriculture and
urban land uses increases. Agricultural impacts on urban uses include noise,
dust and chemical use. Urban impacts on agriculture usually are generated by
complaints from residents which can lead to restrictions on agricultural ac-
tivities and can sometimes involve effects such as increased traffic and access
difficulties that lower the productivity of farm operations.
a. Williamson Act Contracts
The Newman Planning Area includes many properties under Williamson Act
contracts. These agreements between landowners and counties or cities vol-
untarily restrict land to agricultural use. In exchange, the land is taxed at a
rate consistent with the actual agricultural use rather than being taxed at mar-
ket value. The ten-year contract automatically renews each year unless a no-
tice of non-renewal is filed, which ends the automatic renewal, though the
property must stay in agricultural use for the remaining nine-year term of the
contract.
Figure NR-1 shows Williamson Act contract lands around Newman. There
are over 4,580 acres under Williamson Act contracts in the Planning Area.
According to County records, as of 2005, there were no Williamson Act con-
tracts within the Newman city limits. However, 34 acres within the Primary
SOI and an additional 564 acres within the SOI were under Williamson Act
contracts. An additional 185 acres within the SOI were under contracts that
are set to expire by 2015.
b. Important Farmland
The California Department of Conservation Farmland Mapping and Moni-
toring Program tracks the conversion of agricultural land to urban uses
throughout the state, using classifications of important farmlands developed
by the US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation
                                                                               NR-3
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            CITY OF NEWMAN

Service (NRCS). The NRCS classifies farmland as Prime Farmland, Farmland
of Statewide Importance, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Local Impor-
tance, according to soil type and the availability of irrigation. Definitions for
each “important farmland” category are shown in Table NR-1. Figure NR-2
shows important farmlands in and around the Planning Area. Over 5,750
acres, more than half of all land in the Planning Area, is Prime Farmland,
mostly to the west and northwest of the city. Lands to the northeast and east
are a mix of Unique Farmland and Farmland of Local Importance.
2. Water Quality
The City’s potable water source is groundwater. Groundwater wells are
drilled to the blue clay layer approximately 500 feet deep. The quality of
groundwater is an issue because of high salinity.
The City maintains storm drains in the city. In addition to the storm drains,
there are also some agricultural ditches in the city and the SOI that are main-
tained by the Central California Irrigation District (CCID)and used for irriga-
tion supply and runoff from crop irrigation. Some city storm drains receive
CCID irrigation runoff.
Currently a large portion of the city discharges stormwater runoff into the
Wasteway without water quality treatment. As the city grows over a popula-
tion of 10,000, it may become subject to the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Stormwater Program requirements.
NPDES Phase II requires operators of regulated small municipal separate
storm sewer systems (MS4s) to obtain a permit and develop a stormwater
management program designed to prevent harmful pollutants from being
washed by stormwater runoff into local water bodies. The program must
include public education, public participation and involvement, illicit dis-
charge detection and elimination, construction site runoff control, post-
construction runoff control, and pollution prevention and good housekeep-
ing.

There are two tile drain systems in the Planning Area, composed of under-
ground, un-jointed pipes laid in gravel beds to lower high groundwater levels
by draining farm irrigation to the river. The larger system is the Newman
Drainage District in the northeastern part of the city. A smaller system, the
Business Park Tile Drain system, drains farmland between L Street and Canal
School Road. The tile drain systems are a water quality concern because they
drain directly to the San Joaquin River without being treated. Additionally,
in order to maintain access to the systems, no development can occur over
them.
3. Vegetation and Wildlife Resources
The Planning Area contains the existing developed parts of Newman and sur-
rounding lands used primarily for intensive agricultural production. Vegeta-
tive cover within this area is illustrated in Figure NR-3. Ornamental trees
and shrubs surround residences in the developed parts of the Planning Area,
including scattered rural residences in outlying areas. A few native valley
oaks occur in developed areas around the Inyo Road intersection with High-
way 33, and around an abandoned rural residence on Stuhr Road east of
Highway 33.
Wildlife associated with developed and landscaped areas are typical of urban
and suburban settings in the Central Valley, dominated by common species
such as pocket gopher, common crow, yellow-billed magpie, European star-
ling, house finch, American robin, mourning dove, scrub jay and northern
mocking bird.
Agriculture cover in the Planning Area consists of hay and row crops, with
some orchards, and a few large parcels used for extensive grazing to the
northeast. Despite their intensive management and lack of natural vegetation,
agricultural areas support a diversity of birds and other wildlife. The relative
wildlife value of agricultural lands depends on several factors, including crop
type, irrigation system, pesticide and herbicide use, farming practices, and
surrounding land use. Alfalfa fields are particularly valuable as foraging habi-
tat for raptors, including northern harrier, American kestrel, white-tailed kite

and the state-threatened Swainson’s hawk. In addition, colonies of California
ground squirrel were observed at field margins throughout the Planning Area.
Scattered blue gum eucalyptus, Fremont cottonwood, lombardy poplar, val-
ley oak and other mature trees provide important perching substrate, and
possible nesting habitat for raptors and other birds.
Grazing lands in the northeastern portion of the Planning Area continue to
support remnant valley grassland habitat. The grasslands appear to be domi-
nated by non-native grasses and forbs, but native species are most likely still
present. Because of the lack of repeated disking and disturbance, the grass-
lands support high populations of insects, California vole, pocket gopher, and
ground squirrel, which in turn provide important foraging opportunities for
raptors and other bird species.
There also remains a potential for a number of special-status species plants in
these grasslands. Stands of introduced eucalyptus occur around rural devel-
opment at Hills Ferry, at the very northeastern edge of the Planning Area.
Although these trees were planted as windbreaks and woodlots, they provide
suitable nesting habitat for raptors and other birds with a grassland under-
story.
The San Joaquin River lies just outside the Planning Area, where native vege-
tation is abundant and is dominated by mature valley oak, willow, Fremont
cottonwood and elderberry in the riparian woodland, areas of open grass-
lands, and marshland vegetation along the channel margins. The complex of
woodlands, grasslands and marshlands form a diverse ecosystem that supports
a wide variety of plants and animals, including a number of special-status spe-
cies such as nesting Swainson’s hawk, western pond turtle and Delta button-
celery.
a. Wetlands
Wetlands are generally considered to be areas that are periodically or perma-
nently inundated by surface or ground water, and support vegetation adapted
to life in saturated soil. Wetlands are recognized as important features on a
NR-10

                                                        C I T Y O F N E W M A N
                                                             G E N E R A L P L A N

regional and national level due to their high inherent value to fish and wild-
life, use as storage areas for storm and flood waters, and water recharge, filtra-
tion and purification functions.
Review of the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) mapping indicates that
wetlands are generally absent in the Newman SOI boundaries, but occur in a
number of locations in the Planning Area. Indicators of wetland vegetation
were observed in the pastureland north of Brazo Road and east of Canal
School Road, and this entire area is mapped as freshwater emergent wetland
in the NWI mapping. The Newman Wasteway is also mapped as a freshwater
wetland. Scattered freshwater wetlands are also mapped along drainages and
depressions in the pasturelands in the northeastern portion of the Planning
Area. Extensive deepwater and freshwater wetlands are mapped along the
San Joaquin River corridor, generally outside the Planning Area. Riverine
habitat is mapped along the Orestimba Creek corridor, just northwest of the
Planning Area.
These areas may provide suitable habitat for several special-status plant spe-
cies, such as the state-endangered Delta button-celery. Areas of wetlands,
freshwater marsh and pond habitat also provide important foraging and nest-
ing opportunities for a wide variety of wildlife, including mallards and other
ducks, great blue herons, egrets, snipe, killdeer, red-winged blackbirds, north-
ern harriers and white-tailed kite.
b. Special-Status Species
Special-status species are plants and animals that are legally protected under
the State and/or federal Endangered Species Acts or other regulations, as well
as other species that are considered rare enough by the scientific community
and trustee agencies to warrant special consideration, particularly with regard
to protection of isolated populations, nesting or denning locations, communal
roosts and other essential habitat. Species with legal protection under the
Endangered Species Acts often represent major constraints to development,
particularly when they are wide ranging or highly sensitive to habitat
                                                                              NR-11

disturbance and where proposed development would result in a “take” of
these species.
There are dozens of special-status plant species which are known or suspected
to occur in the southwest area of Stanislaus County, most of which are con-
sidered rare (list 1B) by the California Native Plant Society (CNPS), with
varied State and federal listing status. However, due to the extent of past and
on-going disturbance, the potential for occurrence of species-status plant spe-
cies in most of the Planning Area is generally considered to be low. Where
disturbance has been limited, such as the remaining grasslands in the north-
eastern Planning Area and areas of potential wetlands, further detailed sur-
veys would be necessary to confirm the presence or absence of any plant spe-
cies of concern.
A number of bird, mammal, reptile, fish, and insect species with special status
are also known or suspected to occur in the southwestern portion of Stanis-
laus County. These include a number of raptors, such as Cooper's hawk,
sharp-shinned hawk, burrowing owl, Swainson's hawk, northern harrier,
white-tailed kite, California horned lark and the American peregrine falcon,
as well as a number of other species such as various bats, San Joaquin kit fox,
San Joaquin whipsnake, California red-legged frog and valley elderberry
longhorn beetle.
Of this large list, only a few have been mapped as occurring in the immediate
vicinity of the Newman Planning Area by the California Natural Diversity
Data Base (CNDDB). Many of the above species have no legal protective
status under the State or federal Endangered Species Acts, and occurrence
information is not monitored by the CNDDB.
Most of the CNDDB records from the vicinity of the Newman Planning
Area are limited to sightings of Swainson's hawk, burrowing owl and San
Joaquin kit fox. These three species are considered to represent the largest
potential biological constraint to development in the Planning Area due to
known occurrences and their dependence on the remaining grassland and

agricultural habitat. Although no occurrence of valley elderberry longhorn
beetle have been reported from the Newman vicinity, this species is generally
known from throughout the Central Valley and the US Fish and Wildlife
Service (USFWS) considers it’s larval host plant within the known range to be
potentially occupied habitat. Additional information on these four species is
summarized below.
  ♦ Swainson’s hawk. Swainson's hawk is a state-listed threatened species.
     Most of the Swainson's hawk occurrence records are for nests in trees
     along the San Joaquin River at the northeastern edge or just outside of
     the Planning Area. The abundance of alfalfa crops and pasturelands
     along the Newman Wasteway and in the northeastern portion of the
     Planning Area contributes to their importance as foraging habitat for
     nesting pairs along the San Joaquin River. There remains a possibility
     that mature trees within the Planning Area could be used as nesting loca-
     tions by Swainson’s hawk in the future.
  ♦ San Joaquin kit fox. San Joaquin kit fox is State-listed as threatened and
     federally-listed as endangered. Several occurrences of this species have
     been reported from the open grasslands west of the Planning Area, gener-
     ally west of I-5. The potential range of kit fox mapped by the USFWS
     extends eastward to just west of the Planning Area. However, there re-
     mains a potential for kit fox to use the remaining grasslands along the
     banks of the Newman Wasteway and possibly along other canals in the
     Planning Area. This species has been observed at San Luis and Kesterson
     National Wildlife Refuges and in the southeast portion of Bennet Valley,
     just south of Sullivan Road.
  ♦ Burrowing owl. Burrowing owl has no legal protective status under the
     Endangered Species Acts, but is considered a Species of Special Concern
     by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) and is pro-
     tected under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Suitable foraging
     and nesting habitat occurs throughout the Planning Area, although no
     occurrences have been reported by the CNDDB.
                                                                            NR-13

  ♦ Valley elderberry longhorn beetle. Valley elderberry longhorn beetle
     (VELB) is a federally-listed threatened species. Elderberry shrubs are the
     larval host plant of VELB, which is known from the Central Valley from
     Redding south to Bakersfield, and from the western foothills of the Sierra
     Nevada to the eastern foothills of the coast range. Use of elderberry
     plants by VELB, a wood borer, is rarely apparent. Frequently, the only
     exterior evidence of the beetle's presence is an exit hole created by the
     larva just prior to the pupal stage. The USFWS considered any stand of
     elderberry to be potentially suitable habitat for the beetle, and generally
     requires that existing plants be protected. In instances where avoidance is
     not possible, an incidental take permit is issued following preparation of
     a detailed mitigation plan which provides for salvaging, transplanting,
     and restoring replacement habitat for the beetle at defined ratios.
4. Air Quality
Newman is located within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin, which is about
35 miles wide and 250 miles long. Surrounded by mountain ranges, the air
basin drains to the north, with an opening at the Carquinez Strait leading into
San Francisco Bay and then the Pacific Ocean. Summer winds blowing out of
the north become trapped in the southern portion of the basin. The potential
for serious summer air pollution in the San Joaquin Valley air basin is strong
because of high surface temperatures, plentiful sunshine, relatively stable air,
and mountains that trap emissions. In winter, low rainfall, strong inversions
and weak winds allow emissions to build up to high levels. In the Newman
area, local pollution sources are augmented by emissions transported from
upwind sources. Conversely, air pollutant emissions created in Newman can
be transported toward other communities by the wind, and contribute to
unhealthful levels in those areas. Hence controlling air pollution requires
both local and regional efforts and unified programs to achieve clean air.
The San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) is respon-
sible for local air quality regulations. The SJVAPCD’s primary responsibility
is to regulate stationary sources and develop plans to achieve and maintain air
quality standards. The SJVAPCD recently adopted Indirect Source Review

rule is intended to reduce emissions from construction and use of future de-
velopment. The California Air Resources Board (ARB) and US Environ-
mental Protection Agency (EPA) have jurisdiction over controlling emissions
from mobile sources.
The California ARB measures ambient air quality concentrations at two loca-
tions in Stanislaus County. The monitoring stations in Modesto and Turlock
are generally representative of regional air quality conditions (i.e. ozone lev-
els) in this part of the San Joaquin Valley. Because of the rural nature of
Newman, the monitor at Turlock is most representative for localized air pol-
lutants (particulate matter and carbon monoxide). During the past five years,
the State one-hour ozone standard was exceeded from nine to 31 days per year
in Turlock. Modesto had fewer exceedances, with two to 14 days per year.
The federal 8-hour standard was exceeded four to 25 days per year in Turlock
and between zero to seven days per year in Modesto. Reasons for higher
ozone levels in Turlock are related to the complex conditions that result in
ozone formation. Also, emissions from the City of Modesto lead to higher
concentrations downwind where the Turlock Station and Newman are lo-
cated.
The region as a whole, does not meet ambient air quality standards set at the
State and federal levels. US EPA has designated the region as Serious Nonat-
tainment for ground level ozone and Nonattainment for PM10 and PM2.5. Un-
der the California Clean Air Act, the region is designated as Severe Nonat-
tainment for ground level ozone and Nonattainment for PM10 and PM2.5. The
area is considered either Unclassified or Attainment for all other air pollutants
regulated by the State or US EPA.
To protect public health the SJVAPCD has adopted plans to achieve ambient
air quality standards. The SJVAPCD must continuously monitor its progress
for plan implementation. SJVAPCD must report this effort regularly to the
ARB and the US EPA. It must also periodically revise its attainment plans to
reflect new conditions and requirements. The SJVAPCD tries to exercise a
                                                                              NR-15

uniform emission control effort that will bring the entire region into compli-
ance with State and federal standards as quickly as possible.
5. Energy and Water Conservation
The energy shortages and accompanying high utility rates of the 1970s and
the year 2000, as well as the recent and projected continued rise of the price of
crude oil, has led to a heightened awareness of the need for energy conserva-
tion techniques as a means of saving money and natural resources. However,
the benefits of energy conservation go well beyond financial savings for indi-
vidual consumers. For example, the combustion of fossil fuels to produce
heat or electricity, or to power internal combustion engines, has also been
linked to poor air quality in the Central Valley, global warming and negative
impacts on crops.
In Newman, energy conservation can be achieved from reducing electricity
and private automobile use, encouraging alternative energy sources, effi-
ciently siting buildings for optimal sun exposure, and implementing land use
and transportation policies that encourage fewer and shorter vehicle trips.
Energy efficiency is promoted in new development in Newman by enforcing
the State (Title) 24 Building Codes on energy efficiency. Additional energy
efficiency can be achieved by requiring that new residential development
meet the State of California’s Energy Star. Energy Star qualified development
or homes or those developments or homes that meet or exceed the state of
California’s Title 24 energy efficiency code by 15 percent.
Water use and conservation is also a concern and priority throughout the
entire Central Valley, and will continue to be an issue in Newman as the City
explores opportunities for obtaining a surface water supply that reduces its
reliance on high salinity groundwater. The combination of agricultural pro-
duction, warm climate and increased urban landscaping threatens supply and
sustainability throughout the region.

B. Goals, Policies and Actions
1.  Agricultural Resources
Goal NR-1       Promote the continued productivity of agricultural
                land surrounding Newman and prevent the prema-
                ture conversion of agricultural land to urban uses.
Policy NR-1.1   The City shall support the continuation of agricultural uses
                on lands designated for urban uses until urban development
                is imminent.
Policy NR-1.2   The City shall encourage the County to retain agricultural
                uses on lands surrounding Newman pending their annexa-
                tion to the city.
Policy NR-1.3   The owners of lands designated Urban Reserve and Agricul-
                ture shall be encouraged to enter into and maintain William-
                son Act contracts with the County.
Policy NR-1.4   New development at the edge of the City, including all Mas-
                ter Plan Subareas, shall minimize potential incompatibilities
                between agricultural and urban uses through the location of
                land uses, the layout of roads, parks and public facilities,
                density controls and transfers, and design guidelines for
                buildings and public and private improvements. Considera-
                tion shall be given to the use of roads, canals, and other fea-
                tures to separate uses, as well as incorporating buffers of
                adequate width and use, and restricting the intensity of resi-
                dential uses adjacent to agricultural land.
Policy NR-1.5   The City shall minimize the creation of urban land use pat-
                terns such as peninsulas that would adversely affect the vi-
                ability of adjacent agricultural lands.
                                                                            NR-17

Policy NR-1.6       The City shall continue to allow and encourage activities
                    that support local agriculture such as farmers’ markets, on-
                    site sale of produce and special events promoting local agri-
                    cultural products.
Policy NR-1.7       The City shall maintain and continue to enforce the City’s
                    right-to-farm ordinance that protects owners of agricultural
                    land at the urban fringe from unwarranted nuisance suits
                    brought by surrounding landowners and provides for reso-
                    lution of urban-agricultural disputes.
Action NR-1.1       Adopt an Agricultural Mitigation Fee as a private, market-
                    based approach to mitigate the direct and indirect impacts of
                    urban development under the General Plan on the loss of
                    agricultural land. The mitigation fee shall be used by either
                    the City and/or a qualifying land trust, such as the Central
                    Valley Farmland Trust, to acquire easement or fee interest
                    in agricultural land that restricts the primary use of the land
                    to agricultural production in perpetuity and precludes sub-
                    division of the property, non-farm development, and other
                    uses inconsistent with agricultural production. The mitiga-
                    tion lands should be in Stanislaus County and strategically
                    located to maintain viable agricultural operations, maintain
                    open space between urban areas and reinforce urban devel-
                    opment boundaries.

              the use of existing septic systems in the city.
Policy NR-2.2 New development proposals shall be designed and con-
              structed using Best Management Practices (BMPs) to avoid
              adversely affecting water quality in the San Joaquin River
              and the area’s groundwater.
Policy NR-2.3 The City shall regularly monitor water quality in City wells
              for evidence of toxins and other contaminants.
Policy NR-2.4 The City shall support efforts at the county, regional and
              State levels to reduce runoff of toxic agricultural chemicals
              into the area’s watercourses and groundwater basin.
Policy NR-2.5 Prior to project approval, the City shall require developers
              to prepare and implement a soil erosion and sediment con-
              trol plan that includes features such as mitigation of sedi-
              ment runoff beyond project boundaries and revegetation
              and stabilization of disturbed soils.
Policy NR-2.6 The City shall comply with the requirements of the Na-

                    nificant wildlife habitat and vegetation resources for devel-
                    opment projects located in or near sensitive habitat areas.
Policy NR-3.3       The City shall support and participate in local and regional
                    attempts to restore and maintain viable habitat for endan-
                    gered plant and animal species, and wetlands. To this end,
                    the City shall work with surrounding jurisdictions and State
                    and federal agencies in developing a regional Habitat Man-
                    agement Plan. Such a plan shall provide data for the New-
                    man area on special-status species, including the Swainson’s
                    Hawk, and shall provide guidelines and standards for mitiga-
                    tion of impacts on special-status species.
Policy NR-3.4       The City shall require mitigation of potential impacts on
                    special-status plant and animal species based on a policy of
                    no-net-loss of habitat value. Mitigation measures shall in-

8 HEALTH AND SAFETY ELEMENT
  The Health and Safety Element provides information about risks in Newman due
  to natural and man-made hazards and contains goals, policies and actions de-
  signed to protect the community and its property as much as possible from seismic,
  flooding, fire and toxic material hazards. This Element also addresses noise, first
  identifying sources of noise generation in the community; and then establishing
  goals, policies and actions to minimize problems from intrusive sound and en-
  sure that new development does not generate unacceptable noise levels.
  As required by State law, the Health and Safety Element addresses the protec-
  tion of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with the im-
  pacts of:
    ♦ Geologic and Seismic hazards, including earthquake faults and ground
       shaking hazards.
    ♦ Flood Hazards, including localized flooding, 100 year flooding and dam
       failure.
    ♦ Fires.
    ♦ Hazardous materials.
    ♦ General emergency and disaster preparedness.
  State law also mandates that a city’s General Plan address current and foresee-
  able noise impacts. As noted above, noise is not contained within a stand
  alone element in this General Plan but is addressed within this Health and
  Safety Element.
  The Health and Safety Element is divided into two sections:
    ♦ Background Information. Contains information on current risks due
       to natural and man-made hazards. Also depicts information on the exist-
       ing noise sources and their current and projected levels within Newman.
    ♦ Goals, Policies and Actions. Provides goals and policies that are de-
       signed to reduce the risks to health and property due to natural and man
       made hazards and to reduce noise impacts on residents. Actions are also
       provided that are to be pursued during the lifetime of the General Plan.
                                                                               HS-1

A. Background Information
This section provides background information on potential public safety is-
sues, including seismic hazards, flooding, fires, hazardous materials and emer-
gency planning. Information on existing sources of noise in Newman is also
provided.
1. Geologic Seismic Hazards
Newman is located between two seismically active regions, the Sierra foothills
and the Coast Range. Figure HS-1 shows the major faults in the Central Val-
ley and Bay Area, none of which are located within the SOI or the City limit.
These faults include the San Andreas fault zone, Hayward fault zone, Clay-
ton-Marsh Creek-Greenville fault zone, Ortigalita fault zone, Rescue Linea-
ment-Bear Mountain fault zone and the San Joaquin fault zone. Of these,
only the San Joaquin fault is actually within the Planning Area, as shown in
Figure HS-2.
The City of Newman is on the outer edge of areas historically damaged by
groundshaking due to seismic activity in the Diablo Range and other active
coastal California faults. A Richter magnitude 5.0 earthquake occurred in
1926 in the vicinity of the Diablo Mountain Range. Another earthquake of
magnitude 4.0 with an epicenter in Stanislaus County also occurred since
1930. In 1986 a third earthquake of magnitude 3.7 occurred with an epicenter
several miles west of Crows Landing. While Newman has not experienced
the same level of seismic activity as the Bay Area, earthquakes are a still a haz-
ard for the community. For example, the Ortigalita fault zone located in the
Diablo Range is considered capable of generating earthquakes of Richter
magnitude 6.5 to 6.75.
The extent of seismic hazards in a community is not only a result of the type
and proximity of faults in the area but also is a result of the type of soil that
exists underneath a community. Soil type can extenuate or reduce ground-
shaking.

The City of Newman has a type of soil that intensifies groundshaking during
an earthquake. Most of Newman is located on alluvium deposits of varying
depths, which can increase the potential for groundshaking damage from an
earthquake. As earthquake waves pass from more dense rock to less dense
alluvial or water-saturated materials, they tend to reduce in velocity, increase
in amplitude, and accelerate more rapidly. As a result, structures located on
these types of materials suffer greater damage than those located on solid
rock. However, most of Newman’s buildings are one or two stories high and
are of wood frame construction, which is considered the most structurally
resistant to earthquake damage. Structures that are significantly vulnerable to
damage from groundshaking are masonry structures, particularly unrein-
forced masonry structures which are susceptible to structural failure. Down-
town Newman does contain a number of historic masonry buildings, some of
which could be unreinforced.
Groundshaking can result in a number of different types of seismic impacts
including liquefaction, settlement, lateral spreading, lurch cracking, and
earthquake induced landslides. Liquefaction is the loss of soil strength due to
seismic forces acting on water-saturated granular soils. This results in a
“quicksand” condition. Liquefaction is most likely to occur in deposits of
weak saturated alluvium or similar deposits of artificial fill. Liquefaction po-
tential in Newman exists is low-lying areas composed of unconsolidated, satu-
rated, clay-free silts and sands. However, the expected degree of groundshak-
ing is moderate and it is unlikely that significant liquefaction would occur.
Settlement is the compaction of soils caused by groundshaking. Newman also
has the potential for compaction to occur in its alluvial soils. Lurch cracking
refers to fractures produced by shaking or settlement, and are characteristic of
larger earthquakes. Thus, a major earthquake near Newman could damage
streets and infrastructure mains. Lateral spreading is the horizontal move-
ment or spreading of soil towards an open face such a river bank or the sides
of levees. Artificial fill areas which are improperly engineered or which have
steep, unstable banks are most likely to be affected. Newman does not have
areas of artificial fill or steep slopes, so the risk from lateral spreading is low.

2. Flood Hazards
Flooding hazards in Newman can be characterized into three categories: local-
ized flooding, 100-year flood zones and dam inundation hazards.
a. Localized Flooding
Much of Newman is subject to shallow flooding from overflow from Ores-
timba Creek which originates in the Coast Range mountains and flows east
into the Central Valley. This shallow flooding occurs in areas within the
Federal Emergency Management Agency’s 100 year floodplain, which is de-
scribed below, but occurs more frequently than a 100 year flood event.
Flooding occurs because the channel size and channel slope diminishes down-
stream, thereby reducing the capacity Orestimba Creek as the water flow
moves eastward into Newman. Vegetation and silt in the channel, and
bridges at Highway 33 and the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks further re-
duce the carrying capacity of the creek. During a major rainstorm, overbank
flooding can occur when the water flow meets the embankments of the
CCID canal, Highway 33 and the railroad tracks. While most of the flood-
water overtops the embankments and continues eastward, some floodwater is
directed southward through Newman by the railroad embankment. This
floodwater ponds in the southeastern part of the city before overtopping the
railroad and continuing eastward.
Flooding is most likely to occur from October to April. Flooding usually
occurs as sheetflow from Orestimba Creek broad, shallow, overland flooding
generally less than two feet deep and characterized by unpredictable flow
paths. Typically, little structural damage occurs because the flooding is shal-
low and relatively slow in velocity. However, floods in 1958, 1985, 1995 and
1998 damaged roads, homes and other property.
100-year Flood Zone
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) prepares maps show-
ing areas which are likely to flood during a 100-year flood event. A 100-year
flood event has a one percent probability of occurring in any year. These
maps are used for insurance purposes. As shown in Figure HS-3, a significant
portion of downtown Newman, the SOI and the Planning Area are subject to
HS-6

                                                         C I T Y O F N E W M A N
                                                              G E N E R A L P L A N
                                        H E A L T H  A N D S A F E T Y E L E M E N T
100-year floods from either the San Joaquin River or Orestimba Creek. The
area along the CCID canal and the railroad track are also subject to flooding
from Orestimba Creek, as described above. Virtually the entire area east of
the city is within the 100-year floodplain of the San Joaquin River.
b. Dam Inundation
As shown in Figure HS-4 parts of the City of Newman, and a large portion of
the eastern part of the Planning Area, are within the officially demarcated
dam inundation zones for several dams. These zones indicate areas that
would be inundated if a particular dam were to fail. The San Luis and New
Exchequer dam inundation zones extend into the northeastern portion of the
City limits, covering parts of Lucas Ranch and Sherman Ranch. The Los
Banos, Pine Flat, Friant, O’Neill and Crane Valley storage inundation zones
are limited to parts of the eastern SOI and Planning Area, including the city’s
wastewater treatment plant. To minimize the risk of dam failure, the Cali-
fornia Department of Water Resources Division of Safety of Dams inspects
each dam on an annual basis for safety.
3. Fires
This section describes the risk of both wildlands and urban fires within
Newman’s Sphere of Influence and within its Planning Area. Fire protection
services are discussed in the Public Facilities and Services Element.
a. Wildland Fires
The City of Newman is subject to a low risk of wildfires given that the great
majority of the Planning Area that is not urbanized is devoted to agriculture.
Agriculture decreases the risk of wildland fires because of the tendency to
irrigate fields and orchards, and because fuel is not generally allowed to build
up. Areas of brush along the San Joaquin River are a more critical fire hazard
but are at the outer edge of the Planning Area away from existing and
planned development.

b. Urban Fires
The majority of the fire risk in Newman is associated with structural fires
within the developed portions of the City. Structural fires are primarily asso-
ciated with residential, commercial and industrial uses and activities. Struc-
tural fires can start for a wide variety of reasons, including electrical shorts,
industrial accidents, carelessness and arson. In general, however, fire hazards
are greatest in buildings and structures which are old or substandard. Older
structures in Newman are generally in the city’s original neighborhoods, de-
veloped prior to the Second World War.
Another potential fire risk in urbanized areas is associated with gas lines. Gas
lines that have deteriorated because of age or rupture in an earthquake could
release highly flammable natural gas. Some of the fire risk associate with gas
lines could be reduced by upgrading and replacing old lines. Additionally
educating the public to turn off their properties lateral gas lines after an
earthquake can reduce the risk of fire.
4. Hazardous Materials and Waste
Products as diverse as gasoline, paint solvents, film solvents, household clean-
ing products, refrigerants and radioactive substances are categorized as haz-
ardous materials. What remains of a hazardous material after use, or process-
ing, is considered to be a hazardous waste. Hazardous materials and waste
come from a number of sources in the City of Newman. For example, resi-
dents use hazards materials such as cleaning supplies and waste, and commer-
cial and industrial business such as motor vehicle repair shops, gasoline sta-
tions and dry cleaners produce a variety of solvents and hazardous waste.
Hazardous materials and hazardous wastes in Newman are heavily regulated
by a range of federal, State and local agencies. One of the primary hazardous
materials regulatory agencies is the California Environmental Protection
Agency, Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), which is author-
ized by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enforce and im-
HS-10

plement federal hazardous materials laws and regulations, including disposal
and transportation of hazardous materials.
For the City of Newman, Agricultural activities pose a special risk in regards
to hazardous materials, since the community is surrounded by agricultural
operations which use a range of hazardous materials, such as pesticides, herbi-
cides and some fertilizers. The County Agricultural Commission and the
California Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Pesticide Regu-
lation are the major enforcement agencies responsible for controlling and
monitoring pesticide use.
A Hazardous Material Area Plan is maintained by Stanislaus County, in ac-
cordance with the California Health and Safety Code (Division 20, Chapter
6.95, §25500 et seq.) and California Code of Regulations (Title 19, Article 3,
§2270 et seq.) and is updated every five years. The Plan is designed to protect
human health and the environment through hazardous materials emergency
planning, response and agency coordination and community right-to-know
programs. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of federal, State, and local
agencies in responding to hazardous material releases and incidents.
5. Emergency and Disaster Preparedness
As required by State law, Newman has established emergency preparedness
procedures and designated evacuation routes to respond to a variety of natural
and man-made disasters that could confront the community. The City has
adopted a citywide Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) that addresses the
planned response to extraordinary emergency situations associated with natu-
ral disasters, technological incidents and national security emergencies in or
affecting Newman. In addition, the City is included in the Stanislaus County
Operational Area Emergency Operations Plan (EOP). In the event of an
emergency, Newman employees, including Fire, Police and Public Works
staff, will assess the situation and the damage and respond according to the
emergency plan, coordinating with other agencies as necessary
                                                                             HS-11

6. Noise
For the purposes of the General Plan, noise is defined as a sound or series of
sounds that are deemed invasive, irritating, objectionable and/or disruptive to
the quality of daily life. Noise varies in its range, source and volume and can
derive from individual incidents such as lawnmowers, to sporadic distur-
bances such as car horns or train whistles, to more constant irritants such as
traffic along major arterials. Noise is especially a concern in the vicinity of
noise-sensitive uses such as residences, schools and churches.
State Law requires that all city and county General Plans address noise to
limit the exposure of the community to excessive noise levels. To this end
local governments are required to “analyze and quantify noise levels and the
extent of noise exposure” through field measurements or noise modeling, and
“implement measures and possible solutions to existing and foreseeable noise
problems.” Noise contours for current and projected conditions within the
community are required to be prepared in terms of either the Community
Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) or the Day-Night Average Level (Ldn), which
are descriptors of total noise exposure at a given location for an annual aver-
age day. CNEL and Ldn are generally considered to be equivalent descriptors
of the community noise environment within plus or minus 1.0 dBA. Table
HS-1 provides definitions of the acoustical terminology used in this docu-
ment.
a. Land Use Compatibility
The noise exposure information included in this Element serves as a basis for
achieving land use compatibility associated with noise levels within the City
of Newman. State law requires that the General Plan consider the following
major noise sources:
  ♦ Highways and freeways.
  ♦ Primary arterials and major local streets.
  ♦ Passenger and freight online railroad operations and ground rapid transit
     systems.

TABLE HS-1 DEFINITION OF ACOUSTICAL TERMS
Term                     Definitions
Decibel, dB              A unit describing the amplitude of sound, equal to 20 times
                         the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of
                         the sound measured to the reference pressure, which is 20
                         micropascals (20 micronewtons per square meter).
A-Weighted Sound         The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound
Level, dBA               level meter using the A-weighting filter network. The A-
                         weighting filter de-emphasizes the very low and very high
                         frequency components of the sound in a manner similar to
                         the frequency response of the human ear and correlates well
                         with subjective reactions to noise. All sound levels in this
                         report are A-weighted, unless reported otherwise.
Community Noise          The average A-weighted noise level during a 24-hour day,
Equivalent Level,        obtained after addition of 5 decibels in the evening from 7:00
CNEL                     pm to 10:00 pm and after addition of 10 decibels to sound
                         levels measured in the night between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am.
Day/Night Noise          The average A-weighted noise level during a 24-hour day,
Level, Ldn               obtained after addition of 10 decibels to levels measured in
                         the night between 10:00 pm and 7:00 am.
Ambient Noise Level      The composite of noise from all sources near and far. The
                         normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given
                         location.
Intrusive                That noise which intrudes over and above the existing ambi-
                         ent noise at a given location. The relative intrusiveness of a
                         sound depends upon its amplitude, duration, frequency, and
                         time of occurrence and tonal or informational content as
                         well as the prevailing ambient noise level.
  ♦ Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport op-
     erations, aircraft over flights, jet engine test standards, and all other
     ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operation
  ♦ Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classifica-
     tion yards
  ♦ Other ground stationary sources identified by local agencies as contribut-
     ing to the community noise environment

State law also requires that noise sensitive uses be considered in the General
Plan. Land uses deemed as noise sensitive by the State of California include
schools, hospitals, rest homes, long-term care and mental care facilities. Many
jurisdictions consider residential uses particularly noise sensitive because fami-
lies and individuals expect to use time in the home for rest and relaxation, and
noise can interfere with these activities. Some variability in standards for
noise sensitivity may apply to different densities of residential development;
single-family uses are frequently considered the most sensitive. Jurisdictions
may identify other uses as noise sensitive such as churches, libraries, day care
centers and parks.
Land uses that are relatively insensitive to noise include some office, commer-
cial and retail developments. There is a range of insensitive noise receptors
which generate significant noise levels or where human occupancy is typically
low. Examples of insensitive uses include industrial and manufacturing uses,
utilities, agriculture, vacant land, parking lots and transit terminals.
Figure HS-5 illustrates the range of noise levels which will allow the full range
of activities normally associated with a given land use. Specific noise com-
patibility criteria are provided in the Goals and Policies section.
b. Existing and Future Noise Sources
As required by the Government Code and ONC Guidelines, a community
noise study was completed as part of the General Plan update to document
noise exposure in areas of the City containing noise sensitive land uses. The
community noise survey included noise measurements along major roadways
and near significant stationary noise sources, such as the industrial uses, which
are adjacent to noise sensitive uses. The primary noise source in Newman is
vehicular traffic on major roadways, with Highway 33 causing the highest
noise levels. Localized and intermittent noises also occur as a result of rail-
road operations along the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) and industrial
noise sources. Newman is not located within an airport plan or within 2

miles of any private airfields and aircraft noise is not considered a major noise
source in the city.
Future noise contours are depicted graphically in Figure HS-6 for major noise
sources in the City. Noise levels and contour distances were calculated based
on traffic noise modeling. Noise levels assume traffic along the roadway is
the primary noise source and do not take shielding by terrain or structures
into account. Roadways with future 70 Ldn contours include Stuhr Road,
Jensen Road, Highway 33, Orestimba Road, Hoyer Road, Shells Road,
Merced Street, Yolo Street and Hills Ferry Road.

Policy HS-6.1 As a guide for future planning and development decisions
              the City shall use the Noise and Land Use Compatibility
              Standards shown in Figure HS-5, the noise level perform-
              ance standards indicated in Table HS-4 and the projected fu-
              ture noise contours for the buildout of the General Plan,
              shown in Figure HS-6 and detailed in Table HS-2 (these will
              be inserted in the Final Draft).
Policy HS-6.2 Noise increases at noise sensitive land uses resulting from
              new projects shall be minimized. Noise-sensitive uses in-
              clude residential, hotel/motel, schools, libraries, museums,
              meeting halls, care facilities, churches and hospitals. Exte-
              rior noise levels would be measured in residential backyards,
              patios, outdoor instructional areas of schools, outdoor
              courtyards and play areas at care facilities or at the property
              line of undeveloped lands designated as noise-sensitive uses.
Policy HS-6.3 New non-transportation noise sources, including, but not
              limited to, industrial and commercial noise sources, me-
              chanical equipment, amplified sound, and on-site truck cir-
              culation and deliveries, shall be mitigated so as not to exceed
              the noise level standards as indicated in Table HS-4.
Policy HS-6.4 Noise can be mitigated through site design, building design
              and materials, landscaping, hours of operation and other
              techniques. This policy does not apply to noise sources as-
              sociated with operations on lands zoned for agricultural
              uses.
Policy HS-6.5 The City shall minimize potential transportation-related
              noise through the use of setbacks, street circulation design,
              coordination of routing and other traffic control measures,
              the construction of noise barriers, and consider use of
              “quiet” pavements when resurfacing roadways.

                          marily of speech or music, or for recurring impulsive noises.
                          Where measured ambient noise levels exceed the standards, the
                          standards shall be increased to the ambient levels.
                          The standards in Table HS-4 apply at residential or other noise-
                          sensitive land uses, and not on the property of a noise-generating
                          land use. When determining the effectiveness of noise mitiga-
                          tion measures, the standards may be applied on the receptor side
                          of noise barriers or other property line noise mitigation meas-
                          ures. These noise level standards do not apply to residential
                          units established in conjunction with industrial of commercial
                          uses (e.g. caretaker dwellings).

                          analysis shall be required so that noise mitigation may be in-
                          cluded in the project design.
Policy HS-6.7             New development of noise sensitive land uses shall not be
                          permitted in noise impacted areas unless effective mitigation
                          measures are incorporated into the project design to reduce

              exterior and interior noise levels to acceptable levels, as
              specified in Policy HS-6.1 and as follows:
               ♦ For new single-family residential development, maintain
                  a standard of 60 Ldn (day/night average noise level) for
                  exterior noise in private use areas.
               ♦ For new multi-family residential development maintain a
                  standard of 65 Ldn in community outdoor recreation ar-
                  eas. Noise standards are not applied to private decks and
                  balconies.
               ♦ Interior noise levels shall not exceed 45 Ldn in all new
                  residential units (single- and multi-family). Development
                  sites exposed to noise levels exceeding 60 Ldn shall be
                  analyzed following protocols in Appendix Chapter 12,
                  Section 1208, A, Sound Transmission Control, 2001
                  California Building Code.
               ♦ Where new residential units (single- and multi-family)
                  would be exposed to intermittent noise levels generated
                  during train operations, maximum railroad noise levels
                  inside homes shall not exceed 50 dBA in bedrooms or 55
                  dBA in other occupied spaces. These single event limits
                  are only applicable where there are normally 4 or more
                  train operations per day.
Policy HS-6.8 Where noise mitigation measures are required to achieve the
              noise level standards, the emphasis of such measures shall be
              placed upon site planning and project design. The use of
              noise barriers shall be considered after practical design-
              related noise mitigation measures have been integrated into
              the project.
Policy HS-6.9 During all phases of construction activity, reasonable noise
              reduction measures shall be utilized to minimize the expo-
              sure of neighboring properties to excessive noise levels.
                                                                          HS-25

                  Noise reduction measures could include, but would not be
                  limited to:
                   ♦ Construction activities shall normally be limited to the
                      hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 8
                      a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday.
                   ♦ Use available noise suppression devices and properly
                      maintain and muffle loud construction equipment.
                   ♦ Avoid staging of construction equipment and unneces-
                      sary idling of equipment within 200 feet of noise-
                      sensitive land uses.
Policy HS-6.10 No project shall be approved that would create noise levels
                  at school sites that would exceeds 55 dBA, measured at the
                  property lines of the school site.
Policy HS-6.11 Land uses that emit excessive noise shall not be located adja-
                  cent to schools and other sensitive uses unless noise levels
                  can be mitigated to an acceptable level.
Action HS-6.1     Require the evaluation of mitigation measures for projects
                  that would cause the following criteria to be exceeded or
                  would cause a significant adverse community response:
                   ♦ Cause the Ldn at noise-sensitive uses to increase by 3 dB
                      or more and exceed the “normally acceptable” level, or
                   ♦ Cause the Ldn at noise-sensitive uses to increase 5 dB or
                      more and remain “normally acceptable”.
Action HS-6.2 Coordinate with the County Sheriff’s Department to enforce
                  the California Vehicle Code as it relates to adequate vehicle
                  mufflers, modified exhaust systems and vehicle stereo sys-
                  tems.

              cant noise increases with the implementation of the General
              Plan. Cumulative traffic noise impacts on existing noise
              sensitive uses could be reduced through the inclusion of ex-
              terior and/or interior sound reduction measures such as set-
              backs, noise barriers, forced-air mechanical ventilation and
              sound rated window construction. The City should re-
              search sources of funding for these actions.

9 COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
  The City of Newman has a distinct character and a clear vision to maintain its
  unique sense of place and small town qualities as it moves into the future. The
  purpose of the Community Design Element is to identify, protect and enhance the
  positive characteristics of Newman’s built environment that contribute to its sense
  of place and contribute towards a high quality of life for its residents.
  This Community Design Element translates the two-dimensional Land Use
  Element into the third dimension by specifying how new development
  should look, feel and function. The Community Character Element includes
  important concepts and guidelines that apply to the type, location and charac-
  ter of both private and public development projects for new and existing areas
  of the City. This Element also includes policies and actions that will guide
  the decisions of individuals, developers and government in preserving and
  enhancing the physical character of Newman.
  This Element is organized into three sections as follows:
    ♦ Background Information. Provides a brief overview of the existing ur-
       ban design characteristics of Newman as well as background information
       on the Downtown Revitalization Plan and the Highway 33 Specific Plan.
    ♦ Urban Design Principles. Discusses urban design principles that are in-
       tended to guide and shape new public and private development.
    ♦ Goals, Policies and Actions. Provides additional guidance to the City
       related to decisions on public and private development.
  A. Background
  This section provides an overview of the urban design characteristics of
  Newman’s various neighborhoods as well as background information on the
  overall intent and the design policies of the Downtown Revitalization Plan
  and the Highway 33 Specific Plan.
                                                                               CD-1

                               1. Existing Urban Design Characteristics
                               The City of Newman consists of distinct neighborhoods and areas which of-
                               ten have different urban design characteristics that reflect the era in which the
                               given area was built. For example, the historic core, which was developed
                               largely in the early part of the 20th Century, has design characteristics typical
                               of that period that are distinct from the characteristics of neighborhood built
                               after the Second World War or the characteristics of subdivisions, such as
                               Hearthstone Ranch and Lucas Ranch, that were built relatively recently. The
                               section below highlights the design characteristics of Newman’s various resi-
                               dential neighborhoods, its non residential districts, including the downtown
                               and the industrial areas, and Highway 33, the main thoroughfare through
                               town.
                               a. Downtown
                               The downtown of Newman is a small grid of approximately 6 blocks by 6
                               blocks as shown in Figure CD-1. The downtown contains a vibrant commer-
                               cial core and the oldest residential neighborhood in Newman, both of which
                               contain many historic buildings. The entire area was established in response
                               to the Southern Pacific railroad, which marks its eastern edge. Highway 33
                               parallels the railroad, and is the main route to and through the city. The rest
                               of the downtown street grid is also either parallel or perpendicular to High-

            core.              south axis, intersects surrounding residential and rural roadways at a distinct
                               angle, which further emphasizes the sense of downtown as a cohesive whole.
                               The main retail and civic corridor is Main Street, generally between Kern
                               Street and Merced Street. These blocks primarily contain restaurants, shops,
                               offices, City Hall, the Police Station, the City Museum and the newly re-
                               stored Westside Theatre. It is a well-kept and attractive street with street
                               trees, decorative crosswalks, street banners, a new central clock and ample
                               sidewalks. Buildings along Main Street are one to two stories in height and
                               both the buildings and streetscape features are designed for and oriented to-
                               wards pedestrians. In accordance with the adopted Downtown Revitalization
                               Plan, a plaza will soon be installed opposite the Westside Theatre, on an exist-

                          and community gatherings.
                          On-street diagonal parking is provided on Main Street, as well as both parallel
                          and diagonal on-street parking along nearby blocks. Slow traffic speeds, well-
                          marked crosswalks and bulb-outs make it easy for pedestrians to cross the
                          two-lane street.
                          The outer area of the downtown is distinguished by older homes, mature
Historic home in downtown trees lining the streets, and two large parks, Densmore and Pioneer Parks.
                          Many of the homes are historic, dating from the early 20th Century with a
                          few dating from the late 19th Century. Sidewalks line most of the streets in
                          the downtown and there is a high level of pedestrian activity, particularly
                          noticeable in the afternoons as children walk and ride bicycles home from
                          school, play basketball in the driveways, or head to a team practice at
                          Densmore Park.
                          Just west of the downtown grid are the high school and middle school, each
                          with a large adjacent park containing playing fields and playgrounds. These
                          schools effectively extend the civic functions of the downtown westward.
                          While not directly downtown, the proximity of the schools to the downtown
                          grid helps maintain the compact, small-town character.
                          b. Mature Residential Neighborhoods
                          As shown in Figure CD-1, the blocks north across Yolo Street from the his-
                          toric core, immediately south of Inyo Street, and the triangular area between
                          L Street, Driskell Avenue and Merced Street are Newman’s older neighbor-
                          hoods, mostly constructed during the 1940s through the 1970s. In general,
                          the streets within these neighborhoods follow a grid pattern. The houses and
                          lots tend to be smaller than many of the newer residences, and amenities such
                          as sidewalks, street trees and parks are provided less consistently than in the
                          residential areas of the historic core. However, homes in Newman’s older
                          neighborhoods are generally well-maintained and the age of these neighbor-
                          hoods has allowed for more mature landscaping.

c. New Residential Neighborhoods
Newman’s newer residential neighborhoods were developed since the 1980’s
and generally located at the outer edges of the City. These areas generally
share curvilinear street patterns with cul-de-sacs that distinguish them from
the grid pattern in the historic core and older neighborhoods. In many other
respects, however, the new neighborhoods are dissimilar from each other.
For example, the Creekbridge subdivision, located in the southwest portion
of Newman, includes a planting strip between the sidewalk and the curb.
Furthermore, many houses in the Hearthstone Ranch subdivision, in the
northern portion of the city, include a front porch, patio or other feature
oriented towards the street. In other new subdivisions, the streets are very
wide, there are no planting strips or street trees along the street edge, garages
are placed closer to the street and are much more visually prominent, and
                                                                                    The Westside Marketplace
houses include fewer front porches or other publicly-oriented elements.
d. Commercial Areas
Commercial areas outside the downtown are limited to a strip of service
commercial uses, convenience stores and gas stations along Highway 33 and
the Westside Marketplace at the southern edge of town. The Westside Mar-
ketplace is relatively new and includes typical local-serving uses such as a su-
permarket, a fast food restaurant and a drug store arranged around a large
central parking lot with some landscaping. The shopping center, set back
from the road and arranged around a large parking lot, is oriented much more
towards automobiles than towards pedestrians. However, pedestrian access is
available via Inyo Avenue.
e. Industrial Zone
Newman’s industrial zone is focused on the area east of Highway 33, roughly
from Kern Street south to the County line. This area houses a wide range of
industrial uses, from low-slung mini-storage warehouses and the large vacant        The F and A Diary on Inyo
pad of the public scales to the towering tanks of the F&A Dairy. Similarly,         Avenue
some of the industrial uses have new and modern facilities while others are
older and not as well maintained. In general, the large parcels, lack of side-
                                                                              CD-5

                                  walks and potential for noise and traffic within the industrial zone, particu-
                                  larly the southern industrial zone, makes it an unfriendly area for pedestrians.
                                  f. Rural and Suburban Transition Areas
                                  Several distinct areas just northwest and west of Newman, such as along Jen-
                                  sen Road, Orestimba Road and Fig Lane, could be considered transitional
                                  areas between higher-density residential subdivisions and the large agricultural
                                  parcels farther west. These areas include a mix of historic orchards, old barns
                                  and farmhouses, small parcels that are still being farmed, and yards housing
Fig Lane is an area of transition cows, goats, chickens and similar barnyard animals. Although the transition
between the suburban and rural
                                  between these areas and the newer subdivisions can be abrupt, these pictur-
areas in Newman
                                  esque, rural-seeming areas recall the historic character of the Newman com-
                                  munity.
                                  g. Gateways
                                  Gateways of a city are the locations which announce to a visitor or resident
                                  that they are entering the city, or a unique neighborhood within that city.
                                  Newman has several gateways. The “Welcome to Newman” signs on High-
                                  way 33 both north and south of town serve as formal gateways. In the down-
                                  town, informal gateways include the beginning and end of the retail corridor
                                  on Main Street. There are also informal gateways marking the transition
                                  from rural to urban, such as the intersection of Stuhr Road and Highway 33
                                  and the intersection of Hills Ferry Road and Driskell Road.
                                  h. Highway 33
                                  California State Highway 33 is the main travel way into and through New-
                                  man. Traffic from Paterson, Crows Landing and Modesto, and much of the
                                  traffic coming from the north on Interstate 5, enters Newman on Highway
                                  33. Traffic coming from the south on Interstate 5 or coming from Gustine
                                  and Merced also enter the city on Highway 33.
                                  The importance of Highway 33 is that it provides many visitors and through
                                  travelers with a first, if sometimes only, impression of Newman. Highway 33
                                  is parallel to the Southern Pacific west side railroad line and contains a mix of

industrial properties, underutilized properties and, as noted above, a mix of
auto oriented commercial uses including the Westside Shopping Center. The
highway does not have an overall streetscape design concept and, outside of
the downtown, lacks sidewalks and street tress.
2. Existing Planning Documents
The City of Newman has two focused area planning documents that provide
policy guidance on the design of new pubic and private developments within
their respective areas. This section provides background on the overall pur-
pose of the Downtown Revitalization Plan and the Highway 33 Specific Plan,
and briefly discusses the urban design guidelines contained within each Plan.
a. Downtown Revitalization Plan
The Downtown Revitalization Plan envisions a vibrant pedestrian oriented
downtown, to serve as the heart of Newman and provide residents, employ-
ees and visitors with services and opportunities for shopping, recreating and
cultural activities. Completed in 1994, the Plan identifies land use and circu-
lation relationships; design standards; necessary infrastructure and streetscape
improvements; economic and market conditions; and specific implementation
tools necessary to promote the development of business in the downtown
commercial core of Newman. Many of the recent public improvements
completed, or in the process of being developed, area result of the recommen-
dations of this Plan. The urban design guidelines contained within the Plan
address site planning, parking, streetscapes and public open space, building
scale and massing and signage. These guidelines are used by the City to pro-
vide design direction for new construction, restoration and remodel projects
within the downtown commercial core.
b. Highway 33 Specific Plan
Completed in 1996, the Highway 33 Specific Plan provides policies and guide-
lines to shape the character and stimulate the economic growth of the High-
way 33 corridor to create a more attractive commercial corridor centered
around downtown. The Plan addressed land use, circulation, infrastructure
and urban design.
                                                                              CD-7
C I T Y O F N E W M A N
G E N E R A L P L A N
C O M M U N I T Y D E S I G N E L E M E N T
The Plan provides detailed design guidelines for two distinct portions of the
Highway 33 corridor, which are defined by the Plan as the “Downtown Dis-
trict” and the “Highway District.” The “Downtown District” includes the
downtown commercial core as well as the majority of the downtown abut-
ting the western side of Highway 33. The design guidelines for the “Highway
District” address the remainder for the corridor, largely outside of the down-
town. The design guidelines for the “Downtown District” portion of the
corridor are consistent with and build upon the design guidelines contained
within the Downtown Revitalization Plan. The Plan’s guidelines establish
that new development within the downtown portion of Highway 33 will be
pedestrian oriented and consistent with the existing pattern of historic down-
town development. On the portion of Highway 33 outside of downtown,
the Plan allows development to be more auto-oriented and establishes that
new development incorporate a Rural/Agrarian theme that reflects the char-
acter and heritage of the region.
B. Urban Design Principles
This Urban Design Principles section includes urban design principles that
are reflective of the existing small town character of Newman and are in-
tended to guide and shape new development as the City grows. These princi-
ples address the visual appearance and character of the built environment and
are intended to maintain and enhance Newman’s sense of place and the qual-
ity of life of its residents. These urban design principles should be applied at
all scales within the city, from individual buildings to larger development
projects, and should apply to new development as well as the redevelopment
of existing areas.
1. Human-Scale Design
People typically feel most comfortable and secure in environments that are
designed at the scale of the individual. At a neighborhood level, this trans-
lates into short, walkable block lengths that provide ample connections
throughout a neighborhood. Cul-de-sacs that do not provide through pedes-

                                                                G E N E R A L P L A N
                                           C O M M U N I T Y D E S I G N E L E M E N T
trian and bicycle connections should be avoided. At a site or building design
level, human-scale design involves the appropriate massing of buildings, ar-
ticulation of façade design, organization of buildings on a site, landscaping
and use of color and materials. Generally this means avoiding or minimizing
the use of sound walls in residential development and ensuring that future
residential, retail, office and commercial development presents an attractive
“face” to the street and fosters active street life.
2. Pedestrian-Orientation
                                                                                       Conceptual drawing illustrating
Designing places that are pedestrian-oriented rather than automobile-oriented
                                                                                       pedestrian orientation and hu-
often contributes to creating a sense of place because it encourages people to
                                                                                       man scale design
use public spaces. Pedestrian-orientation for transportation involves good
physical connections between destinations, providing a mix of uses where
possible, as well as a safe walking environment. In terms of building design,
pedestrian-orientation includes orienting buildings to the street, locating en-
trances to the public realm and providing pedestrian amenities such as awn-
ings, benches and attractive street lighting.
Increasing pedestrian-orientation not only enhances the attractiveness and
safety of an area, it also helps provide options to segments of the community
that benefit from not having to depend on auto travel, such as senior citizens,
people with disabilities and children. Furthermore, pedestrian orientation
encourages individuals to walk for both recreation and for transportation,
thereby contributing to a healthy lifestyle.
3. Focal Points
Focal points are locations that serve as meeting places where people gather.           Conceptual drawing illustrating
Examples of focal points include shopping areas, restaurants, plazas, parks or         the urban design principle of a
                                                                                       focal point
community centers. Lions Park or Pioneer Park would be considered focal
points in the city. Focal points are important components of a community
because they provide a common location for people to meet, talk, shop and
play. They are locations to sit and relax, read or converse.
                                                                                 CD-9

                                  4. Holding Corners
                                  “Holding corners” refers to having development located at sites at the corner
                                  of intersections built up to the corner at, or close to, the lot lines. Many of
                                  the existing corner buildings in downtown Newman exemplify this design
                                  principle. The principle of “holding corners” helps give definition to an in-
                                  tersection and avoids the condition of having pedestrians feel unsafe and ex-
                                  posed to the adjacent traffic. Ensuring that buildings in Newman are de-
                                  signed to hold the corners of key intersections will enhance the visual quality

                                  5. Landscaping
                                  A characteristic that greatly contributes to the attractiveness of Newman’s
                                  neighborhoods and can be augmented, both within its residential neighbor-
                                  hoods as well as within other parts of the City, is landscaping. In addition to
                                  adding to the community’s visual character, landscaping helps to create a pe-
                                  destrian friendly environment and reduces urban run off of rain water into
                                  the storm drainage system, allowing water to percolate back into the soil.
                                  Trees also provide shade and cooling during Newman’s hot summers. Street
                                  trees have the added benefit of discouraging speeding by motorists, thereby
                                  contributing to a safe and walkable community.

                                  Neighborhoods should also provide a mixture of housing types and styles in

                                  Newman to find housing affordable to their means.

                                                            G E N E R A L P L A N

Neighborhoods are comprised of two components:
  ♦ Development Areas. The majority of the physical area of a neighbor-
     hood should be devoted to residential development. Residences should
     have direct pedestrian connections with neighborhood focal points and
     the major destinations within Newman.
  ♦ Focal Points. The focal point of a neighborhood should be a park,
     school, plaza, or open space. Focal points should contain public spaces to
     serve as a nucleus for neighborhood life and provide a space where com-
     munity members can meet their neighbors. For example, the Alfred
     “Bush” Rose Park, located in the Stephens Ranch subdivision, serves as        Neighborhoods should be devel-
     the focal point for the small neighborhood created by the subdivision,        oped around a focal point.
     while Pioneer Park and Densmore Park serves as focal points for the
     downtown neighborhood.
Neighborhoods should be of a size where the majority of residents are within
a reasonable walking or bicycling distance of a focal point, which generally
means that neighborhoods should be no more than about ½-mile across in
any direction.
7. Gateways and Landmarks
Creating aesthetically pleasing gateways and landmarks is an important com-
ponent of land use planning and community design that contributes to a
city’s character and sense of place. Gateways of a city are the locations that
announce to a visitor or resident that they are entering the city, or a unique
neighborhood within that city. Formal gateways can include signs, structural
elements such as towers or fences or walls, landscaping and natural features
such as a row of trees. Newman has two existing and attractive “Welcome to
Newman” signs along Highway 33 and within the City limits. One is located
on the northern end of the city and the other is located on the southern end.
                                                                                   Existing gateway sign on High-
                                                                                   way 33.
Landmarks give an identity to a place and can inform visitors and residents
where they are in relation to a landmark. Examples of landmarks can include
towers, monuments, sculptures. Landmarks can be formal, meaning they
were designed with the purpose of giving an area an identity or they can be
                                                                           CD-11

informal, such as a water tower or smoke stack, which were not built as
landmarks but are give an area an identity nonetheless.
C. Goals, Policies and Actions
The goals and policies below address the physical design and character of de-
velopment within the City of Newman. Additional policies and actions re-

                  ting of the downtown shall be discouraged.
Policy CD-2.6     New development shall include human-scale details in the
                  design of buildings such as windows on the street, awning
                  and architectural features that create a visually interesting
                  pedestrian environment. Blank walls adjacent to pedestrian
                  circulation areas shall be discouraged.
Policy CD-2.7     The preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, reuse and
                  maintenance of existing downtown buildings shall be en-
                  couraged.
Policy CD-2.8     The architectural details and design elements of historic
                  structures shall be preserved during building renovations
                  and remodels.
Policy CD-2.9     Development of two-story buildings in the downtown is
                  encouraged. Building facades of one-story buildings in the
                  downtown should be a minimum of 18 feet in height to
                  maintain continuity with the predominant parapet height.
Policy CD-2.10 The City shall encourage the inclusion of new public spaces,
                  such as plazas and outdoor sitting areas, within new private
                  development.
Action CD-2.1     Ensure that new development and building and property
                  remodels and renovations are consistent with the design
                  guidelines of the Downtown Revitalization Plan.
Action CD-2.2     Continue to explore the development of new publicly
                  owned civic spaces on vacant and underutilized downtown
                  properties.

3.  Established Residential Neighborhoods
Goal CD-3       Preserve and enhance the existing character of
                Newman’s established residential neighborhoods.
Policy CD-3.1   The City shall seek to preserve the vital qualities of existing,
                stable residential neighborhoods, including preserving a
                human scale, pedestrian orientation, ample landscaping and
                trees, attractive architecture and historic materials.
Policy CD-3.2   The City shall seek to preserve the historic character of the
                neighborhoods within the historic core of Newman. For
                specific policies related to historic preservation refer to the
                Recreation and Cultural Resources Element.
Policy CD-3.3   New development in existing residential neighborhoods
                shall reflect the existing scale and character of the neighbor-
                hood and shall be compatible in design.
Policy CD-3.4   Renovations of and additions to existing structures shall
                result in a design that is compatible with surrounding devel-
                opment within a neighborhood.
Action CD-3.1   Encourage the maintenance of private property within the
                city’s existing neighborhoods.
Action CD-3.2   Maintain the streets, sidewalks, street trees within the exist-
                ing neighborhood and repair streets and sidewalks and re-
                place trees as needed.
                                                                            CD-15

4.   New Residential Neighborhoods
Goal CD-4         Create new residential neighborhoods that preserve
                  and enhance the existing community character and
                  fabric of Newman, create a sense of place, provide a
                  high quality living environment and emphasize pe-
                  destrian access.
Policy CD-4.1     The City shall encourage the creation of new well-defined
                  residential neighborhoods.
Policy CD-4.2     New residential development shall reflect the human scale
                  and pedestrian oriented character of existing neighborhoods
                  in Newman.
Policy CD-4.3     New neighborhoods should generally be no more than ½
                  mile wide in any direction and should not be bisected by a
                  physical barrier, such as an arterial street.
Policy CD-4.4     Each neighborhood should have at least one clear focal
                  point, such as a park, school, or other open space and com-
                  munity facility. Focal points shall have ample public spaces,
                  and shall be within ¼ mile from any point in a neighbor-
                  hood.
Policy CD-4.5     New neighborhoods shall be designed to maximize direct
                  pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular connections both within
                  the neighborhood and to surrounding neighborhoods. Us-
                  ing Newman’s existing grid system as model, new neighbor-
                  hoods shall be designed on a traditional or curvilinear grid.
                  In most instances block lengths should be short, typically no
                  more than 400 feet, to create a fine-grained street pattern
                  that allows for multiple routes through a neighborhood and
                  encourages walking. Cul-de-sacs may be used within the
CD-16

              grid if through bicycle, pedestrian and emergency vehicular
              access is provided at the end of the cul-de-sac.
Policy CD-4.6 Gated neighborhoods or neighborhoods that have bicycle,
              pedestrian and vehicular circulation systems that are not in-
              tegrated with the circulation systems of surrounding
              neighborhoods and areas shall not be allowed.
Policy CD-4.7 New residential development shall be designed with street
              networks and housing types that allow buildings to face or
              side onto local and collector streets and two lane arterials.
              Sound walls along public rights of way shall be discouraged
              and shall only be used along arterials when no other design
              solution exists for reducing the impact of roadway noise on
              residential areas. Where soundwalls are used, they shall be
              set back from the street, include design features that enhance
              visual interest and shall be landscaped to mitigate their im-
              pact on the community character and pedestrian environ-
              ment.
Policy CD-4.8 Garage doors shall not dominate the street facing facades of
              residential buildings. Garages for new single-family house,
              duplexes and townhouses should be subordinate in visual
              importance to the living area and front entryways. A num-
              ber of different design strategies can achieve consistency
              with this policy including locating garages towards the back
              of properties, constructing alleys and placing the garages
              along the alleys, limiting the width of garages to two car
              spaces, building garages as separate structures from the
              house, requiring garages to be set back from the front façade
              of the house, and orientating garage doors at 90 degrees to
              the street.
Policy CD-4.9 A variety of architectural styles shall be provided with in
              each neighborhood. Within each neighborhood block, the
                                                                         CD-17

                  vide visual interest to the streetscape.
Policy CD-4.10 Buildings shall include appropriate, consistent details and
                  design treatments on all sides of the building and not just on
                  the sides that face a street.
Policy CD-4.11 Buildings located at corners shall be designed to address the
                  corner, with porches and main entryways oriented towards
                  the corner or located on the portion of the structure adja-
                  cent to the corner.
Policy CD-4.12 Elementary and middle schools shall be encouraged to be
                  located and designed to be compatible with residential
                  neighborhoods as a means to foster the concept of
                  neighborhood schools, minimize bussing of students, and
                  encourage neighborhood identity.
5.   Highway 33 Corridor
Goal CD-5         Highway 33 will be an attractive corridor through
                  Newman and new development along Highway 33
                  will be of high quality design and be pedestrian ori-
                  ented.
Policy CD-5.1     New commercial development along Highway 33 and out-
                  side of the downtown shall be consistent with the “Highway
                  District” design guidelines contained within the “Highway
                  33 Specific Plan” and shall be designed with a rural/agrarian
                  design theme to complement the rural character of the re-
                  gion and Newman’s small town character. Franchise archi-
                  tecture that consists of a standard corporate design and is
                  not consistent with the rural/agrarian design theme is dis-
                  couraged.

Policy CD-5.2 New commercial development along Highway 33 and
              within or adjacent to downtown will be consistent with the
              “Downtown District” design guidelines contained within
              the Highway 33 Plan. New development on the west side
              of Highway 33, between Kern and Merced Street, shall also
              be consistent with the design guidelines contained within
              the “Downtown Revitalization Plans.”
Policy CD-5.3 New commercial development shall include building front-
              ages with human scale design elements, varied and articu-
              lated facades, and entries oriented to public sidewalks or pe-
              destrian pathways. Building facades located along pedestrian
              pathways and public rights of way shall also have window
              opening and not consist of solid blank walls.
Policy CD-5.4 New business park and industrial development along high-
              way 33 shall, through site and building design and landscap-
              ing, contribute towards creating an attractive Highway 33
              corridor.
Policy CD-5.5 Commercial and business park development shall hold to
              corners to create a pedestrian friendly environment and to
              create a strong building presence at intersections. Surface
              parking lots located at intersections are discouraged.
Policy CD-5.6 The presence of surface parking lots along Highway 33 and
              roadways shall be minimized by moving buildings adjacent
              and parallel to property lines abutting public rights of way.
              Ample landscaping and low walls should be provided to cre-
              ate a buffer between off-street parking and circulation areas
              and the adjacent pubic sidewalk.
Action CD-5.1 Work with property and existing business owners along
              Highway 33 to improve the appearance and maintenance of
                                                                        CD-19

Capital Improvements Program
A program, administered by a City and reviewed by its Planning Commis-
sion, which schedules permanent improvements, usually for a minimum of
five years in the future, to fit the projected fiscal capability of the local juris-
diction. The program generally is reviewed annually for conformance to and
consistency with the General Plan.
City
City with a capital “C” generally refers to the Newman city government or
administration. City with a lower case “c” may mean any city or may refer to
the geographical area of Newman (e.g. the City bikeway system).
City Limits
The legal boundaries of the geographical area subject to the jurisdiction of
Newman’s city government. For example, development applications for
properties located within the city limits must be reviewed by the City.
Collectors
Intermediaries between arterials and local roads; collecting traffic from local
roads and distributing it to the arterial system. Collector roadways also pro-
vide direct access to residential subdivisions as well as shopping centers and
industrial complexes, and should be spaced at quarter-mile to half-mile inter-
vals.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL)
A 24-hour energy equivalent level derived from a variety of single-noise
events, with weighting factors of 5 and 10 dBA applied to the evening (7 PM
to 10 PM) and nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) periods, respectively, to allow for
the greater sensitivity to noise during these hours.
Compatible
Capable of existing together without conflict or ill effects.
                                                                                 G-5

end and with a large turnaround at its other end.
Cultural Resources
Includes historic, archaeological and paleontological resources, as well as hu-
man remains.
dB
Decibel; a unit used to express the relative intensity of a sound as it is heard
by the human ear. The lowest volume a normal ear can detect under labora-
tory conditions is 0 dB, the threshold of human hearing. Since the decibel
scale is logarithmic, 10 decibels are ten times more intense and 20 decibels are
a hundred times more intense than 1 db.
dBA
The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels; weighs or reduces
the effects of low and high frequencies in order to simulate human hearing.
Every increase of 10 dBA doubles the perceived loudness even though the
noise is actually ten times more intense.
Dedication
The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and
the acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having juris-
diction over the public function for which it will be used. Dedications for
roads, parks, school sites, or other public uses often are made conditions for
approval of a development by a city or county.

The number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land. Densi-
ties specified in the General Plan are expressed in dwelling units per gross
acre. (See “Acres, Gross”)
Development
The physical extension and/or construction of non-farm land uses. Devel-
opment activities include: subdivision of land; construction or alteration of
structures, roads, utilities, and other facilities; grading; deposit of refuse, de-

tion of agricultural activities). The construction of a single-family home on
an existing lot, and routine repair and maintenance activities, are exempted.
Dwelling Unit
The place of customary abode of a person or household which is either con-
sidered to be real property under State law or cannot be easily moved.
Element

each mandated subject. Topics can sometimes be combined or included into
other elements, as allowed by State law.
Entry Corridor

Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
A report required pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) that assesses all the environmental characteristics of an area, deter-
mines what effects or impacts will result if the area is altered or disturbed by a
proposed action, and identifies alternatives or other measures to avoid or re-
duce those impacts. (See “California Environmental Quality Act”)
Fault
A fracture in the earth’s crust that forms a boundary between rock masses
that have shifted.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
The size of a building in square feet (gross floor area) divided by net land area,
expressed as a decimal number. For example, a 60,000 square foot building
on a 120,000 square-foot parcel would have a floor area ratio of 0.50. The
FAR is used in calculating the building intensity of non-residential develop-
ment.
Floodplain, (100-year)
The area which has a one percent chance of being inundated during any par-
ticular 12-month period. The risk of this area being flooded in any century is
1 percent, but statistically, the risk is almost 40 percent in a 50-year period.
Gateway

Mixed Use
Any mixture of land uses, including mixtures of residences with commercial,
offices with retail, or visitor accommodation with offices and retail. As dis-
tinguished from a single use land use designation or zone, mixed use refers to
an authorized variety of uses for buildings and structures in a particular area.
Parcel
A lot, or contiguous group of lots, in single ownership or under single con-
trol, usually considered a unit for purposes of development.
Pedestrian-Oriented Design
An approach to site and neighborhood design intended to facilitate move-

bile movement. Examples of pedestrian-oriented design include pathways
following the most direct route from sidewalk to front door, continuous
building streetwalls with shop windows, outdoor cafes, street trees and
benches.
Planning Area
The Planning Area is the land area addressed by the General Plan. The Plan-
ning Area does not lead to regulatory powers outside of the City limits. In-
stead, it signals to the County and to other nearby local and regional authori-
ties that City residents recognize that development within this area has an
impact on the future of their community, and vice versa. The unincorpo-
rated land within the Newman Planning Area will remain under the jurisdic-
tion of the County of Stanislaus. (See also Sphere of Influence)

Primary Sphere of Influence
The Primary Sphere of Influence distinguishes land that is expected to be an-
nexed in the next ten or so years and is an area that is sufficient to accommo-
date growth projected to occur over this time period (the year 2016 in the
case of the Newman General Plan). Stanislaus County LAFCO also requires
cities to establish a Primary Sphere of Influence.
Seiche
A seiche is a wave that occurs on a lake, bay or other body of water, such as a
swimming pool, and is caused by changes in atmospheric pressure, underwa-
ter earthquakes or landslides. The movement of the wave can be compared to
the back-and-forth sloshing of water in a bathtub.
Sensitive Receptors
Uses sensitive to noise such as residential areas, hospitals, convalescent homes
and facilities, and schools.
Specific Plan
Under Article 8 of the Government Code (Section 65450 et seq), a legal tool

ered by a General Plan. A Specific Plan may include all detailed regulations,
conditions, programs, and/or proposed legislation which may be necessary or
convenient for the systematic implementation of any General Plan element(s).
Sphere of Influence
Under State law, the term used for the area outside of the city limits which a
city expects to annex in future years. (See also Planning Area)
