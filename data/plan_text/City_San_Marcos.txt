LAND USE AND
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
           2.1	     Introduction
           The Land Use and Community Design Element describes the
           desired future physical composition of the planning area and the
           planned relationship of uses. The main objective of the element
           is to determine the future location, type, and intensity of new
           development, and to establish the desired mix and relationship
           between projects to maximize the long-term livability of the
           community.
           The goals and policies contained in this Element are designed to:
               •	 Ensure land use diversity and balanced development
                  that encourage an efficient and responsible relationship
                  between land use, transit, open space, and areas of
                  environmental sensitivity.
               •	 Establish and maintain community connections that better
                  connect people to places.
               •	 Promote economic strength and stability by maintaining a
                  strong local economy and employment base.
               •	 Create a synergy between the business community and
                  academia to promote San Marcos as the educational hub
                  for North County.
               •	 Encourage integration of high-quality and sustainable
                  development through the establishment of development
                  standards and land use patterns that encourage long-term
                  environmental sustainability.
               •	 Promote community design that produces a distinctive
                  built environment with memorable places.
               •	 Direct and sustain growth through management that
                  ensures adequate provision of urban services.
           Most of the Guiding Themes that were described in the
           Introduction section of the General Plan are manifested in this
           Element.

2                                       Purpose of the Land Use and Community Design Element
                                        The Land Use and Community Design Element is intended to
                                        establish a coordinated vision for the future built environment.
                                        This vision will serve as a guide for residents, businesses, local

                                        agencies, and decision makers as they shape the desired pat-
                                        tern of growth, development, and evolution of the City of San
                                        Marcos. The Land Use and Community Design Element, one of
                                        seven State-required General Plan Elements, directs and defines
                                        development patterns by designating allowable uses, require-
                                        ments, and locations for both existing and future development.
                                        This Element has the most wide-ranging scope in the General
                                        Plan, and affects all of the others.
                                        Although the interpretation of the Land Use and Community
                                        Design Element is the responsibility of the community’s policy-
                                        makers, this vision of long-term land use will influence short-
                                        term plans such as infill development, Specific Plans, and both
                                        public and private investments.

                                         The City’s planning area encompasses approximately 21,162 acres (33.06              Photo credit: City of San Marcos
                                         square miles), including about 15,579 acres (24.3 square miles) within the City’s
                                         corporate limits and 5,586 acres (8.7 square miles) of unincorporated land within
                                         the City’s sphere of influence.
                                         The planning area contains eight unique neighborhoods. Portions of these
                                         communities are guided by Specific Plans.
                                         San Marcos has been one of the fastest growing cities in the San Diego region
                                         and the state since 1980.
                                         The most prevalent existing land uses in San Marcos are residential, consisting
                                         of approximately 31 percent of the planning area; vacant lands, consisting of
                                         approximately 25 percent of the planning area; and, parks, recreation facilities
                                         and trails, and open space composing approximately 14 percent of the planning
                                         area.
                                         San Marcos contains various physical constraints to development, including
                                         topographical constraints and human-made constraints, including State Route
                                         78, which physically divides the City generally into northern and southern
                                         halves. State Route 78 presents mobility challenges for automobiles, pedes-
                                         trians, and cyclists, and also constrains the movement of wildlife between
                                         undeveloped lands to the north of San Marcos and open lands to the south of
                                         the City.
                                         San Marcos has identified several areas where land use changes were
                                         considered or are likely to occur within the General Plan’s planning horizon.
                                         These areas are referred to as Focus Areas.
                                         San Marcos is actively embracing community planning trends such as sustain-
                                         ability and smart growth development that furthers housing and economic
                                         opportunities while effectively managing environmental impacts.
                                         San Marcos is focusing on implementing environmentally sustainable develop-
                                         ment and land use patterns that promote greater connectivity and allow for
                                         better use of transit and other non-auto mobility choices.
                                         The City provides a variety of services and infrastructure but also contracts
                                         with appropriate service agencies and special districts to ensure the adequate
                                         provision of urban services.

all land in a city is to be used in the future. This Element unifies
the other Elements of the General Plan by providing an overall
policy context. The Land Use and Community Design Element
addresses the central issues of development and growth, and the
quality of the community, and helps define the desired balance
among the social, environmental, and economic costs and
benefits associated with land use decisions. The Land Use and
Community Design Element identifies the distribution, location,
and intensity of all land use types throughout the City. To fully
reflect the range of physical attributes that are important for San
Marcos’s success, this Element also contains goals and policies
to guide community form and design, and the provision of com-
munity facilities and urban services. Text, maps, and diagrams
establish the direction for land uses within the City.
Section highlights and key facts relevant to this Element are
highlighted in Table 2-1 on the previous page
2.2 Land Use Pattern and Community Character
The City of San Marcos contains a variety of existing land uses as
illustrated in Figure 2-1. The predominately residential land use
pattern in San Marcos reflects the City’s history of transition from
an early agricultural settlement surrounding a train depot to a
community of distinct residential neighborhoods and supporting
businesses, industrial employment, and commercial services.

defined as parcels void of on-site structures or
construction.

                                        portion of the City, south of State Route 78. Barham/Discovery
                                        Community contains a wide variety of land uses, including
                                        residential, commercial, park, open space, and California State
                                        University San Marcos (CSUSM). Multiple residential types are
                                        located within the neighborhood, including rural and estate

                                        The Richland Neighborhood was one of the first communities
                                        in San Marcos to develop and is located at the northeastern
                                        boundary of the City. The Richland Neighborhood is primarily

                                        Twin Oaks Valley Neighborhood
                                        More than half of the Twin Oaks Valley Neighborhood is located
                                        outside of the corporate boundary of San Marcos but within the
                                        City’s sphere of influence. The Twin Oaks Valley Neighborhood is
                                        characterized by a unique rural aesthetic with agricultural and
                                        equestrian uses, and estate homes on large lots. Agricultural
                                        uses consist mainly of greenhouses that grow flowers and
                                        vegetables. Grape production also occurs in Twin Oaks Valley. The
                                                                                                                     Twin Oaks Valley Golf Course within views of the

                                               Specific Plan Areas
                                               A Specific Plan is a comprehensive planning document that
                                               guides the development of a defined geographic area in a mix
                                                                                                                            2

                                               and parks and open space. Specific Plans typically include more
                                               detailed information than the General Plan about land use, traffic
                                               circulation, affordable housing programs, resource manage-

                                               infrastructure plan. Specific plans are also used as a means of
                                               achieving superior design by providing flexibility in development
                                               standards beyond those contained in the Zoning Ordinance. San
                                               Marcos has 48 Specific Plan Areas (SPAs) as shown in Figure 2‑3.
                                               Further information about these SPAs is included in Appendix D
                                               Table D-3.
                                               All of these Specific Plans have been adopted by the City Council
                                               after extensive review by City staff, commissions, and the public.
                                               Specific Plans contain detailed regulations, conditions, programs,
                                               and design criteria unique to that area and serve to implement
                                               the General Plan.

                                               use and community design in San Marcos, the Zoning Ordinance,
                                               Title 20 establishes specific standards to regulate development
                                               throughout the City. The functions of these two planning tools are
                                               described below.
                                               Land Use and Community Design Element:

                                        The Land Use and Community Design Element is primarily
                                        implemented by the City’s Zoning Ordinance, which specifies
                                        districts and performance standards for various types of land
                                        uses described in the General Plan. Each General Plan land use
                                        designation has a corresponding zone or zones that implement
                                        and regulate the intent of the land use. The zone districts specify
                                        the permitted uses for each category and applicable development
                                        standards. The Zoning Ordinance will be updated to comply with
                                        the General Plan land uses identified in Table 2-2. In addition to
                                        the Zoning Ordinance, adopted Specific Plans are also used to
                                        guide development areas.

                                        that everyone embraces, there are certain common elements. The
                                        basic Smart Growth principles are summarized as follows:
                                            •	 Provide for a mixture of compatible land uses on a single
                                               site
                                            •	 Take advantage of compact building design
                                            •	 Create a range of housing opportunities and choices
                                            •	 Create walkable neighborhoods
                                            •	 Foster distinctive, attractive communities with a strong
                                               sense of place

                                        The City of San Marcos has already undertaken planning efforts
                                        that serve to implement Smart Growth principles. The City has                 Mixed use development, homes above retail, in

                                        with many of the Focus Areas discussed below, or are included
                                        in adopted specific plans that often embrace these smart growth
                                        principles. Smart Growth principles are incorporated into the
                                        Vision and Themes of this General Plan, which guides the Land
                                        Use Plan and provides the basis for many of the Land Use and
                                        Community Design, and Mobility Element policies.

                                        or to adopt an Alternative Planning Strategy, for the purpose
                                        of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning planning for
                                        transportation and housing needs, and creating incentives for
                                        the implementation of the strategies, such as CEQA streamlining
                                        and transportation funding. Policies in this section also provide
                                        for coordination with SANDAG’s RTP and consistency with
                                        SANDAG’s strategies in the City of San Marcos’ planning efforts
                                        to facilitate and streamline the development of residential mixed

                                        with choices by centralizing active land uses to accommodate a
                                        range of business and housing choices; connecting people with
                                        places, building a greener community, and a healthy and safe
                                        community by increasing walkability and access to transit while
                                        promoting more condensed development in the urban core.
                                        Mixed Use Development
                                        The City of San Marcos is transitioning from large-scale master
                                        planned development to infill, mixed use development. Mixed

                                        life and in developing to their maximum potential. Healthy places
                                        are those designed and built to improve the quality of life for all

                                        April 2002, the American Planning Association (APA) identified
                                        six qualities that describe healthy community design.
                                        According to the APA, healthy communities:
                                            •	 Have a unique sense of community and place.
                                            •	 Preserve and enhance valuable natural and cultural
                                               resources.
                                            •	 Equitably distribute the costs and benefits of development.
                                            •	 Expand the range of transportation, employment, and
                                               housing choices in a fiscally responsible manner.
                                            •	 Value long-range, region wide sustainability rather than

                                        Green Buildings
                                        Green or sustainable buildings use resources such as energy,
                                        water, and materials much more efficiently than traditional
                                        buildings. Green buildings reduce impacts to human health and
                                        the environment during the building’s lifecycle, through better
                                        site planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and
                                        removal. Green buildings are designed to reduce the overall
                                        impact of the built environment on human health and the natural
                                        environment. Some of the key benefits are:
                                            •	 Lower electric and water utility costs
                                            •	 Environmentally effective use of building materials
                                            •	 Enhanced health and productivity
                                            •	 Long-term economic returns
                                            •	 Reduced environmental impact

                                                     The California Green Building Standards Code
                                                     The California Green Building Standards Code applies to all
                                                     new commercial, office, industrial, and residential buildings

                                                     buildings such as hospitals. It includes a list of mandatory green
                                                     building measures that must be applied to every new building
                                                     starting January 1, 2011. The Code’s water efficiency measures
                                                     became mandatory in July 2011.
                                                     Beyond the mandatory measures, the Code also includes two
                                                     “tiers” that local governments may choose to adopt. Each tier
                                                     adds a further set of green building measures that go above
                                                     and beyond the mandatory measures of the Code. There are
                                                     separate but similar sets of tiers for residential, industrial, office,
                                                     and commercial buildings. In both cases, Tier 1 requires that
                                                     buildings achieve a 15 percent improvement over the current Title

                                                     buildings achieve a 30 percent improvement over Title 24. Both

                                                   For nonresidential development, the “intensity” of development
                                                   is measured by FAR. FAR expresses the intensity of use on a
                                                   lot (see Figure 2-4).The FAR represents the ratio between the
                                                   total gross floor area of all buildings on a lot and the total land
                                                   area of that lot. For example, a 20,000-square-foot building on a
                                                   40,000-square-foot lot yields a FAR of 0.50. In the graphic descrip-
                                                   tion, 0.50 FAR describes a single-story building that covers half of
                                                   the lot, a two-story building covering approximately one-quarter
                                                   of the lot, or a four-story building covering one-eighth of the lot.
                                                   While intensity is often used to describe nonresidential develop-
                                                   ment levels, in a broader sense, intensity can also describe
                                                   overall levels of mixed residential and nonresidential develop-

                                                   Mixed Use 2, Mixed Use 3, and Mixed Use 4) use FAR to establish
Non-residential intensity, FAR, and orientation
standards can yield traditional commercial         the maximum development intensity for mixed use develop-
centers or mixed use districts based on land use   ment; Mixed Use 1 and Mixed Use 2 may include residential
designations.

                                                   This General Plan provides guidance for the development and
                                                   redevelopment of San Marcos to meet the vision identified by the
                                                   Guiding Themes. Achieving robust mixed use districts, business
                                                   parks, and commercial areas, and other non-industrial uses
                                                   would, over time, require the transition of some existing devel-
                                                   oped industrial uses to one of these land use types. However,
                                                   San Marcos values the economic vitality that industrial uses
                                                   contribute to the community. Therefore, the City will implement
                                                   a Transitional Zoning category to facilitate transition of existing
                                                   industrial land uses to other non-industrial land uses over time.

2                                       This will allow these existing industrial properties to continue
                                        to function per the industrial zone regulations (including such
                                        activities as development, demolition, reconstruction, expansion,
                                        and renovation) until such time as the property owner initiates

                                        redevelopment of the property to the future general plan land
                                        use designation. At that time, a rezone of the property will be
                                        required to be consistent with the new land use designation.
                                        These industrial properties are considered to be in conformance
                                        with the new non-industrial General Plan land use. This transi-
                                        tional land use and zoning strategy will support the business
                                        climate of the City while enabling quality and timely redevelop-
                                        ment. Properties that qualify for transitional zoning are identified
                                        in Appendix D Table D-4.
                                        General Plan Land Use Designations/Classification System
                                        The Land Use and Community Design Element establishes 25
                                        land use designations. The land use designations have been
                                        established to address (1) development trends affecting the
                                        City’s near- and long-term futures; (2) focus areas associated with
                                        major industrial uses, shopping and employment centers, and
                                        access to transportation facilities; and (3) community interests
                                        and desires expressed during the General Plan update process.
                                        Figure 2-5 graphically represents the planned distribution and
                                        intensity of land use in San Marcos on a citywide scale. The
                                        colors shown on the map correspond to land use designations
                                        that describe the types of existing and planned land uses in
                                        San Marcos. The City uses a land use classification system to
                                        regulate what can be built in specific locations within the City to
                                        protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community. Table
                                        2‑3 provides a description of each General Plan land use designa-
                                        tion within San Marcos and the range of density or intensity of
                                        development allowed within each category.
                                        Table 2-3 presents descriptions of each General Plan land use
                                        designation and the corresponding range of density or intensity
                                        of development permitted for each. The maximum allowable
                                        development on any individual parcel is governed by these
                                        measures of density or intensity, with the anticipated yield
                                        influenced by the physical characteristics of a parcel, by access
                                        and infrastructure issues, and by compatibility considerations.
                                        The land use designations are described here in terms of general
                                        land uses and maximum densities or intensities permitted.
                                        Corresponding zoning districts specify the permitted uses for
                                        each category and the applicable development standards. The
                                        density or intensity maximums outlined in Table 2-2 serve as
                                        development caps. Actual development intensities are expected
                                        to be lower than the caps, based on market factors and past
                                        development trends. The City anticipates most development will
                                        occur at or below these expected levels, although on any single
                                        property, development up to the maximum permitted by the land
                                        use is allowed.

Focus Areas
The Focus Areas represent areas within San Marcos where
change is very likely to occur over the planning horizon of the
                                                                              2
General Plan. As part of this process, the City of San Marcos
                                                                              LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
engaged the community through public meetings and a City
Council-appointed General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC).
This steering committee was a community representative group
composed of residents, business and chamber of commerce
leaders, youth, and seniors, plus Palomar Community College
and California State University San Marcos appointees. The GPAC
assisted City staff, the public, and the General Plan project team
to collect and evaluate community-generated land use alterna-
tives and make recommendation for the update of the General
Plan and Zoning Ordinance to address future challenges in the
community. Through this process, the community identified
areas where land use changes would likely occur, referred to
collectively as the Focus Areas. Multiple factors were considered
in selecting these Focus Areas, including the Guiding Themes,
opportunities and constraints, adjacent development patterns,
market conditions, and goals and objectives for the City.
Figure 2-6 (on the previous page) depicts the location of the San
Marcos Focus Areas. For each Focus Area, the vision and land use
updates are summarized in Appendix D. Focus Areas of consider-
able influence are discussed below to address the planning
context, reason for selection, and a description of the land use
plan and future development objectives.
Portions of the City that do not lie within one of the identified
Focus Areas identified below are not likely to experience signifi-
cant land use changes.
Urban Core Focus Areas
Three Focus Areas were chosen, centered on the existing urban
core of San Marcos, where the most impactful future land use
change will occur within the planning horizon of the updated
General Plan. These areas are referred to as:
     •	 Mission Road Focus Area (FA1), see Figure 2-8
     •	 Rancho Santa Fe Road Focus Area (FA2), see Figure 2-9
     •	 San Marcos Boulevard Focus Area (FA3), see Figure 2-10
These Urban Core Focus Areas are located in central San Marcos,
within the Business/Industrial District, along three of the major
thoroughfares traversing the City: Mission Road, Rancho Santa
Fe Road, and San Marcos Boulevard. These Focus Areas were
chosen after extensive public involvement identified evolving
land use trends and community goals for this area that represent
the best potential for redevelopment, change in land use, and/or
change in activity intensification.

                                        Focus Area 4 (FA4), the Richmar Specific Plan Area, is located
                                        along Mission Road encompassing an area both east and west of
                                        Twin Oaks Valley Road. The General Plan includes Specific Plan
                                        recommended land use updates to include mixed use develop-
                                        ment integrating residential, retail, and office uses in the Richmar

                                        Additional Focus Areas
                                        In addition to the Urban Core Focus Areas and Focus Area 4
                                        discussed above, 43 other Focus Areas were identified as poten-
                                        tial areas of change through the General Plan updated process.
                                        During review, land use revisions and implications were taken
                                        into consideration. Ultimately, 27 of the additional Focus Areas
                                        were identified as choice areas for land use change. These areas
                                        are highly likely to experience land use change throughout the
                                        planning horizon of the General Plan, or have been updated to
                                        suit the goals of San Marcos. In some cases, the land use desig-
                                        nation will be changed to allow uses that differ from what exists
                                        in the area today or what the existing General Plan designation
                                        allows. In other cases, the land use designation is proposed to
                                        be updated to better match the character of development that
                                        currently exists for that particular Focus Area.

                                        including patrol, traffic, and investigative services. The Sand

                                        their “beats.” Patrol deputies are also proactive in enforcing the

                                               The City of San Marcos budget funds the Sheriff’s Department
                                               to assign a School Resource Officer to high schools within the
                                               district. This School Resource Officer handles all crimes relating
                                               to school students. These crimes include truancy, tobacco, drug-
                                               and alcohol-related offenses, and crimes that occur on school
                                               grounds.
                                               The San Marcos Sheriff’s Station is staffed with 97 sworn officers,
                                               11 professional staff, 69 retired senior volunteer patrol members,
                                               and four reserve deputy sheriffs (Stumpfhauser 2011).
                                               Law enforcement officers typically patrol their jurisdiction and
                                               respond to calls while in the field. This is unlike the response of
                                               other emergency services (fire and emergency medical technician
                                               or EMT) which respond from fixed locations. Response times for
                                               the latter are critical measures.
                                               Even in law enforcement services, lower response times are
                                               preferred, especially when life safety is concerned. However,
                                               response times for field dispatches are influenced by multiple
                                               factors. Citizen and officer safety, traffic congestion, and commu-
                                               nication between officers and dispatcher all must be considered.
                                               Consequently, response times, while monitored to effectively
                                               manage resources, are not used as measures of efficiency by law
                                               enforcement and response time goals should not be used to as-
                                               sess performance. Therefore, the San Diego Sheriff’s Department
                                               compares response times but does not set response times goals
                                               as described.
                                               The prioritization of calls is used to facilitate deputy dispatches
                                               by the Sheriff’s Department. High-priority calls have lower
                                               numbers; so, for example, Priority 1 calls are more urgent than
                                               Priority 2, 3, and 4 calls, and so on. Call priorities are described in
                                               Table 2-5.
                                               When multiple events compete for deputy response, higher
                                               priority calls will be dispatched and responded to before lower
                                               priority calls. These are guidelines and obviously do not cover
                                               all possible situations. The complaint taker will be able to assign
                                               priority according to special circumstances.

                                        College was established. The main campus located at 1140 West

                                        designated California State University San Marcos in 1989 with
                                        construction for the new “full-service” university campus com-
                                        mencing in February of 1990. The first official CSUSM students
                                        attended classes in the fall of 1990. Rapid growth in enrollment
                                        and expansion of facilities throughout the 2000s made CSUSM a
                                        vibrant part of the community.

LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
                                        landfill space diminishes throughout the San Diego region, San Marcos
                                        recognizes the importance of recycling and reuse and is committed to
                                        reducing the amount of waste that enters the region’s landfills.
                                        EDCO Waste and Recycling (EDCO), a private franchise hauler, handles
                                        all residential, commercial, and industrial solid waste collections within
                                        San Marcos. EDCO provides residential customers with weekly curbside
                                        pick-up, while commercial customers receive bin service between one
                                        and six times per week. Separate-bin recycling collection is currently
                                        offered to commercial and single-family residential customers. This
                                        service is being implemented through a phased pilot program for
                                        multi-family residential development. Waste and recyclables are hauled
                                        to the Escondido Transfer Station; waste is then transported to the
                                        Sycamore Sanitary Landfill in the City of San Diego, while recyclables
                                        are processed through an on-site materials processing facility.
                                        To reduce costs associated with waste collection and storage, and to
                                        comply with the state requirements to reduce landfill waste, the City
                                        has continuously evaluated alternatives and implemented programs
                                        to minimize the generation of solid waste. The California Integrated
                                        Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939) mandates local governments
                                        to develop a long-term strategy for the management and diversion of
                                        solid waste, by requiring cities and counties to divert 50 percent of its
                                        solid waste. The 2006 diversion rate (latest available data) for the City
                                        was 57 percent of its solid waste. In 2009 (the latest available data),
                                        the Annual Per Capita Disposal Rate for the City of San Marcos was
                                        estimated to be 5.3 pounds per person per day for residents and 13.2
                                        pounds per person per day for employees. Both figures are below the
                                        target amounts of 8.9 pounds per person per day for residents and 19.0
                                        pounds per person per day for employees (CalRecycle 2011). Despite
                                        falling short of state mandates, continuous strides have been made to
                                        reduce collection and storage rates.
                                        This progress can be attributed to the comprehensive recycling
                                        programs implemented in San Marcos in cooperation with EDCO and

Water Service
Several agencies administer and control the supply and quality of
water within the planning area. These agencies include Vallecitos Water
District (VWD), Olivenhain Municipal Water District (OMWD), Vista
Irrigation District (VID), and Rincon del Diablo Municipal Water District
(Rincon Water District).
The majority of the planning area is served by VWD. VWD provides
water, wastewater services, and reclamation services to San Marcos;
the community of Lake San Marcos (within the sphere of influence);
and parts of Carlsbad, Escondido, and Vista. As a member agency of the
San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA), VWD receives its water
from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD),
which imports water from the Colorado River and Northern California.
As of the 2010 Census, VWD recorded service to a population of ap-
proximately 94,900 persons within a 45-square-mile boundary in North
County.
Portions of the Business/Industrial District, College Area Neighborhood,
and Twin Oaks Valley Neighborhood are served by VID. All water
delivered by VID is filtered and includes imported water purchased from
CWA and local water from VID’s Lake Henshaw facilities. Wastewater
collection, transmission, treatment, and disposal services to developed
areas within VID boundaries are provided by other agencies not
associated with VID (VID 2005). In addition, southern portions of the
Questhaven/La Costa Meadows Neighborhood are also served by
OMWD while eastern portions of the Barham/Discovery Community
and Richland Neighborhood are served by Rincon Water District.
The greatest challenge for water supply in the near future will be
to meet the water needs of a growing population, particularly with
projected population growth not only in San Marcos, but throughout
the San Diego region. Each of the water districts above develops and
periodically updates their Urban Water Management Plans (UWMPs).
Southern California has experienced multiple dry years, resulting in
an overall increase and use of imported supplies from MWD. Although
each UWMP indicates that the districts expect to have adequate water
supply available to meet the demand within their service areas, water
shortages could occur as a result of climate change and global warm-
ing. MWD has comprehensive regional Water Shortage Contingency
and Drought Management Plans in place to ensure adequate water
supplies are available to all of its member agencies, including those
serving San Marcos. However, it is necessary to examine other water
source options that could help reduce the dependency on imported
water, including desalination of seawater, expansion of water reclama-
tion facilities, enhanced local groundwater basin production, beneficial
reuse of urban runoff, and the use of greywater.

                                        analyze supply and demand, and storage capacity needs and add ad-
                                        ditional storage. Encouraging good water service in the City will require
                                        maintaining current infrastructure and extending new infrastructure

                                        The City will require adequate water supplies for fire flow, along with
                                        sufficient water storage for emergency situations, and will coordinate
                                        with the water districts in updates to their UWMPs to ensure the

                                        Wastewater
                                        Wastewater is any water that drains from showers, sinks, and toilets in
                                        our buildings. Wastewater services for the majority of the City of San
                                        Marcos planning area are provided by VWD. VWD’s sewer service area
                                        is divided between two principal drainage basins, which are named
                                        based on the treatment facility that serves it. VWD’s current 23-square-
                                        mile sewer service area is much smaller in size than its water service
                                        area due to the use of septic systems in some areas. VWD has over
                                        19,000 sewer service connections with four lift stations and 178 miles of
                                        pipeline. VWD’s wastewater systems currently have a total liquids treat-
                                        ment capacity of 12.54 million gallons per day (MGD). The estimated
                                        maximum daily flow would be approximately 9.54 MGD (VWD 2010).

                                        for San Marcos through the development review process. In addition,
                                        the City will continue to work with VWD and all the local water districts
                                        to plan and maintain wastewater collection facilities serving residents
                                        and business owners.
                                        Flood Control Facilities and Storm Water Management
                                        Flooding is a persistent or temporary condition of partial or complete
                                        inundation of normally dry land areas. Flooding is commonly associ-
                                        ated with the overflow of natural rivers or streams but can also occur
                                        near storm water diversion facilities, or in low-lying areas not designed
                                        to transport or infiltrate water at any time. The potential for flooding
                                        in San Marcos is high due in part to the City’s topography, which is
                                        characterized by several steep ridgelines that border a few wide valleys.
                                        San Marcos Creek is the main watercourse and natural drainage course,
                                        with its headwaters originating in the Merriman and San Marcos
                                        mountains to the north and east in San Diego County. San Marcos
                                        Creek empties into Lake San Marcos and continues through Carlsbad
                                        and Encinitas before emptying into Batiquitos Lagoon. The northern

branch and San Marcos Creek flow through Twin Oaks Valley and the
east branch flows through the Richland Neighborhood. San Marcos
Creek and the tributaries have a tendency to flood during storm events.
                                                                                    2
To protect the City from flooding or flood-related events, San Marcos
                                                                                    LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
manages the maintenance and operation of an integrated system of
storm drains, retaining basins, concrete channels, and other flood
control facilities; refer to the Safety Element for further discussion of
hazards associated with flood events. Development in San Marcos
is required to be planned and constructed in conformance with the
National Flood Insurance Program, and the City requires adequate
flood control facilities to protect all structures and major roadways from
hazards associated with a 100-year floodplain. The City will require new
development and redevelopment to be located to either avoid flood
hazards or incorporate them into the overall design consistent with the
goals and policies of the Safety, and Conservation and Open Space
Elements.
In addition to flood control facilities, San Marcos also implements a
high level of storm water management to help control urban runoff that
flows into the storm water conveyance system. Land development and
construction activities can alter drainage patterns and increase runoff
primarily through erosion and the increase of impervious surfaces,
whereby increasing storm water runoff. The City complies with the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit (Order
No. R9-2007-0001, NPDES No. CAS0108758), which requires the de-
velopment and implementation of a program addressing urban runoff
pollution issues in planning for the development of public and private
projects. The City also requires the use of Low Impact Development
(LID) standards to reduce the amount of storm water runoff and pol-
lution. Refer to the Conservation and Open Space Element for further
discussion of water quality and LID design techniques.
Dry Utilities
The public residences and businesses rely upon utilities and commu-
nications for carrying out most day-to-day activities. Natural gas and
electricity provide heat and light, and power our appliances. Through
telephone lines, fiber-optic cables, and the airwaves, people connect
with each other for business, or school, and just to keep in touch with
our friends and neighbors.
San Diego Gas and Electric Company (SDG&E) provides electrical and
natural gas service within the planning area. SDG&E, owned by Sempra
Energy, is a regulated public utility that provides energy service to 3.3
million consumers through 1.3 million electric meters and more than
800,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange coun-
ties. The utility’s area spans 4,100 square miles.
Electrical facilities located throughout the planning area include a
combination of above-ground and below-ground electrical distribution
lines and utilities structures; the latter is associated with more recent
development. The City will continue to require undergrounding of

                                        As the world of communications continues to progress and evolve,
                                        residents and businesses have the ability to interact with the global
                                        community from anywhere within San Marcos. Advancements in
                                        technology have allowed for the creation of more efficient communica-
                                        tion options and have opened the door for state-of-the-art services that
                                        facilitate a healthy business climate, making businesses more competi-

                                        tion. Furthermore, telecommunication technologies allow residents
                                        to establish home offices, which can decrease commutes, enhance
                                        neighborhood security, and provide flexibility for working parents.
                                        Communications services in San Marcos include telephone, cable,
                                        internet, and other wireless communication services provided by
                                        several companies. Future communication technologies may expand
                                        into other fields. Infrastructure upgrades are being made by private
                                        providers to facilitate high-speed data transmission and interactive
                                        video capabilities. The City encourages constructing new office and
                                        industrial buildings with state-of-the-art telecommunication circuits to
                                        use these upgrades. Under the Telecommunications Ordinance, the City
                                        requires cellular transmission systems to be designed and installed in
                                        a “stealth” manner, to blend with the vegetative or architectural setting

mobility Element
           3.1 	Introduction
           San Marcos is committed to enhancing mobility and access
           for its residents, businesses, and visitors. The foundation of
           San Marcos’s mobility framework is the planned transition to a
           multi-modal (e.g. ability to serve all modes of travel) transporta-
           tion network—this includes sidewalks and crosswalks, bikeways,
           roadways, pathways, and public transit routes. This Mobility
           Element strives to balance mobility strategies for the City of San
           Marcos and the statutory requirements to achieve the nine key
           Guiding Themes for the City.
           Purpose of the Mobility Element
           Strategically enhancing and managing the mobility network is
           critical to continuing the City’s vibrant commercial and industrial
           areas, its thriving residential neighborhoods, its diverse job
           and employment uses, and its unique student population. This
           philosophy supports the development and maintenance of a
           network of mobility options that support connecting people to
           places within the City. Implementation of this philosophy will
           assist in maximizing the quality, comfort, safety, walkability, liv-
           ability, and bikeability of the City’s streets, sidewalks, trails, and
           multi-modal transportation system.
           The City also understands the importance of providing a
           balanced and sustainable system. Sustainable transportation sys-
           tems are those that are environmentally sensitive, are sensitive
           to the health and well being of the community, and are economi-
           cally viable (to build and maintain). This Mobility Element reflects
           this sustainable focus of the City by incorporating key ingredients
           of sustainability.
           Scope and Content of the Mobility Element
           Government Code Section 65302(b) requires a “circulation”
           element be provided in all general plans as described in the
           following statute:
                                City of San Marcos General Plan | Mobility | Page 3-1

3                      “A circulation element will consist of the general location
                       and extent of existing and proposed major thorough-
                       fares, transportation routes, terminals and facilities, all
                       correlated with the land use element of the plan.”
mobility Element
                   Although this Mobility Element addresses the multi-modal
                   system for the entire City of San Marcos, special emphasis is
                   placed on connectivity to the Focus Areas (defined in the Land
                   Use and Community Design Element). Connectivity to these
                   Focus Areas is provided via multiple modes, primarily along the
                   following corridors:
                       •	 San Marcos Boulevard
                       •	 Rancho Santa Fe Road
                       •	 Mission Road
                       •	 Twin Oaks Valley Road
                   Highlights within this Mobility Element are described in Table 3-1.                    Mobility includes circulation facilities for
                                                                                                          vehicles, transit, pedestrian, bicycles and non-

                   Transportation Sustainability
                   Transportation planning used to focus on identifying land uses
                   and identifying the number of roadway lanes needed to service
                   the traffic generated from such uses. Transportation planning has
                   shifted toward a new focus – one of promoting sustainability and
                   balance for all users of the transportation system.
                    Table 3-1
                    Mobility Element Highlights and Facts
                    The City has tremendous connectivity to the region, being situated between the
                    I-5 and I-15 freeways, with direct access to State Route 78.
                    Implementing complete streets (e.g. a system of facilities that provide accessibil-
                    ity for all users of the transportation system), especially in the Urban Core Focus
                    Areas, is paramount to creating vibrant and active centers within the City.
                    The City’s access to the SPRINTER light rail system provides a robust alternative
                    mode for North County residents and employees.
                    The City has a first-rate trails system, boasting some 60 miles of existing net-
                    work, and has planned expansion for 72 miles of trails.
                    The City is unique in that it is the educational hub of North County, home to Cali-
                    fornia State University San Marcos, Palomar Community College, and a range of
                    other educational institutions. This creates unique transportation opportunities
                    in connecting those activity centers with the rest of the City.
                    The City actively manages traffic volumes on areas roadways, where appropri-
                    ate, using state-of-the-art technology and techniques.

3                  The D’s of Smart Growth
                   Much of the City is currently developed. However, as develop-
                   ment, redevelopment, and revitalization occur along select
mobility Element
                   corridors, implementation of the following strategies of smart
                   growth (also known as the Eight D’s) will provide the building
                   blocks for improving mobility for all modes of travel:
                       •	 Density – The more compact the development is, the easier
                          it is to promote transit, bicycles, and pedestrian travel.
                       •	 Diversity – Diversifying land use (e.g. making sure that
                          households have easy and convenient access to retail
                          uses, schools, and jobs) allows people to reduce the length
                          of their trip; thus reducing vehicle emissions and promot-
                          ing walking, biking, and transit use.
                       •	 Design – Pleasant and safe biking/walking environments,         Mobility and smart growth go hand-in-hand.

                          components promote alternative modes of travel.
                       •	 Destinations (or regional accessibility) – Being located near
                          a regional activity center promotes shorter trips and make
                          alternative modes of travel more attractive.
                       •	 Distance to Transit – Locating land use in close proximity to
                          transit promotes transit use and reduces the need to drive
                          to the destination.
                       •	 Demographics – Providing supportive land use and afford-
                          ability for a wide range of life styles and income ranges
                          afford the ability for people to live in close proximity to
                          where they work and play.
                       •	 Development Scale – Larger areas that are well planned
                          and are connected together reduce trip making behavior
                          compared to smaller (isolated) developments.
                       •	 Demand Management – Encourages people to manage the
                          demand on the roadway system by promoting alternatives
                          modes of travel.
                   The mixed use orientation of the Urban Core Focus Areas is key
                   to integrating the proposed land uses with the mobility system.
                   The mixed use configurations provided for in the General Plan
                   enable many (if not all) of the Eight D components to minimize
                   reliance on the single occupant vehicle and promote use of
                   alternative modes.

                                              Complete Streets
                                              One key theme of the General Plan is connecting people to places. One
                                              way to accomplish this is to implement “complete streets”. Complete
                                                                                                                                    3
                                              streets balance the needs of all users—including pedestrians, bicyclists,
                                                                                                                                    mobility Element
                                              motorists, transit riders, seniors, children, and those with disabilities—
                                              in the planning, design, and construction of all transportation projects.
                                              One important distinction, as it relates to complete streets, is that they
                                              must be considered within a system-wide context. For example, provid-
                                              ing bicycle lanes on every roadway may not be necessary for the street
                                              to be complete; as long as the bicycle network is complete and provides
                                              for mobility throughout the City.
                                              Table 3-2 provides a complete streets guide for the City of San Marcos.
                                              The specifics for the sample street typologies are described below.
                                              The key to this table is identifying the prioritized, non-prioritized, and
                                              prohibited modes by City street.

3                  Street Typologies
                   When transportation planners used to accommodate only the
                   single-occupant vehicle, Roadway Classifications (i.e. prime
mobility Element
                   arterials, secondary arterials, collectors, etc.) were a key terminol-
                   ogy used in describing and planning for roadways. In fact, there
                   was a hierarchy of roadway classifications, with prime arterials as
                   being those that carried the highest volume and fastest mov-
                   ing traffic, while collectors were facilities that provided vehicle
                   access to adjacent properties. Since the San Marcos Mobility
                   Element focuses on connecting people to places, utilization of
                   Roadway Classifications all-but ignores the other modes of travel,
                   like transit, bicycle, and transit, which are critical to the City.
                   Therefore, this Mobility Element focuses on Street Typologies as
                   it better addresses all modes of transportation: pedestrian, transit
                   bicycles, and vehicles. Roadway classifications are identified in
                   Figure 3-1.
                   Street Typologies relate to how Complete Streets interact with all
                   users of the system (bicycles, pedestrians, transit, etc.) by ensur-
                   ing that the roadway is designed and implemented in a way that
                   is supportive of the preferred modes through the corridor. Street
                   Typologies also include assessment of the adjacent land uses,
                   and strive to provide a mobility system that is complementary to
                   the adjacent development. Additionally, street typologies can be
                   developed to address other key components of the system, such
                   as landscaping to improve water quality, and providing shade for
                   pedestrians and bicycles.
                   Multi-Way Boulevard
                   These facilities provide through travel lanes near the center of
                   the roadway (next to the median or without a median) to serve
                   through traffic; but local traffic is served via a local circulator
                   roadway that is buffered (by a landscape barrier) from the
                   Image of Franklin Boulevard in Eugene as it might look in the future as a multiway boulevard.

through trips. The local circulator has a lower rate of speed, such
that it is compatible with parking, driveway accessibility, and/
or bicycle/pedestrian activity in the area. Wide sidewalks are
provided adjacent to the travel way.
                                                                                    3

San Marcos Boulevard is designated as a future multi-way boule-
vard, between Discovery Street and Bent Avenue. As, envisioned,
San Marcos Boulevard will consist of a center median separated
by two through lanes in each direction. Another median will
separate the outermost through lane from a one lane frontage
lane. Class I and/or Class II bicycle lanes will be incorporated.
Finally, diagonal and/or parallel parking will be provided along
frontage lanes. This facility will improve vehicle, pedestrian,
and bicycle accessibility to the Urban Core Focus Areas and San
Marcos Creek District along San Marcos Boulevard by removing
that local circulation and connectivity from the through travel
lanes. This will also de-emphasize the street as a through route.
Rancho Santa Fe Road is designated as an arterial (six lanes)
with bicycle facilities and will prioritize vehicles in order to
serve through traffic that would otherwise be on San Marcos
Boulevard. Multi-way boulevards should be congested, as they
are typically in high activity areas (for pedestrians and bicycles).
Although San Marcos Boulevard will be congested during peak
periods, the multi-way boulevard will provide good circulation to
all users of the system.
Arterial
These facilities provide for all modes of travel, but they acknowl-
edge that the arterial is a primary link in the City’s vehicular
transportation system. Key facilities include Rancho Santa Fe
Road, Las Posas Road, and Twin Oaks Valley Road (near the
freeway).

3                  Arterial with Enhanced Bike/Pedestrian Facilities
                   These facilities are key links for all modes of travel within the
                   City. Since all modes are prioritized, there is generally a higher
                   rate of speed for vehicles and pedestrians/bicycles are accom-

                   modated in a separate enhanced right-of-way. Mission Road (as
                   it currently exists) is a key example of this type of facility; where
                   transit is served parallel to the roadway, bicycles and pedestrians
                   are served via a Class I pathway, and vehicles are served on the
                   through roadway.

                   Freeway
                   The freeway in San Marcos will serve regional vehicular travel to
                   and from the City. State Route 78 (SR-78) is the primary east-west
                   freeway providing regional connectivity for vehicles in the area.
                   Freeways fundamentally serve vehicles, but they also provide
                   for regional bus transit connectivity to the region. Bicycles and
                   pedestrians are prohibited on the freeway.

                   Collectors
                   Collectors are meant to serve as intermediate facilities, con-
                   necting local areas to regional mobility corridors. Collectors
                   will prioritize bicycles and pedestrians through facility design
                   and speed management. Bus and shuttle transit services can be
                   provided on collectors, and vehicles will use them for accessibil-
                   ity (but these modes are not prioritized in the corridor).

Bicycle/Pedestrian Trails
These facilities are meant for connecting people to places via
bicycling or walking. They are dedicated to those modes of travel;
vehicles and transit are prohibited. San Marcos boasts some 60
miles of bicycle/pedestrian trails linking many activity centers
within the City. Additional miles of trails are planned.

Neighborhood Streets
These facilities are provided to connect people to their house-
holds. Since this is an area that connects communities, they are
a public space and are meant to serve bicycles, pedestrians, and
vehicles. Transit is typically not provided on these facilities. These
roadways should include traffic calming techniques (measures
to control vehicular speed) and focus on person scale through
design and connectivity. The livability of this street is paramount
to the success of the neighborhood.

                   Main Street facilities provide access to key activity centers
                   within the City. They focus on linking people to the place they are
                   visiting; thus, they should be complete streets that prioritize the
                   human scale (walkability and bikeability). They should emphasize
                   the pedestrian, but provide access for transit users. Vehicles in
                   this area should travel at slow speeds and should only be using
                   these facilities to access local land uses.

                                              MMLOS is desirable for the City of San Marcos for several rea-
                                              sons. First, it evaluates the entirety of the mobility system (e.g. all
                                              users of the City), thus supporting connecting people to places.
                                              Second, It is the adopted state-of-the-practice methodology for
                                              assessing system performance. Third, it supports complete street
                                              concepts that are contemplated as part of this Mobility Element.
                                              Table 3-3 identifies what travel modes are currently included
                                              in the MMLOS methodology and is provided for informational
                                              purposes only. Level of Service (LOS) is a qualitative measure-
                                              ment of comfort of the system and ranges from LOS A to LOS F.
                                              LOS A typically represents a high level of comfort on the system
                                              (e.g. minimal congestion, over-sized facilities, high degree of
                                              separation between modes of transportation, etc.) and LOS F
                                              represents poor system performance (e.g. high levels of conges-
                                              tion or uncomfortable/poor performance for alternative modes).
                                              LOS E typically represents “at capacity” operations, where the
                                              system is “right sized” to meet demand levels.
                                              Transit Services and Facilities
                                              Public transportation in San Marcos is envisioned to consist of
                                              the following services and facilities:

                   Bus service in San Marcos is operated by North County Transit
                   District (NCTD), which enables commuters to travel within the
                   City and adjacent cities with minimal transfers. The bus service
mobility Element
                   is more commonly referred to as “The Breeze.” Currently, NCTD
                   operates The Breeze on several routes in the San Marcos area.

                   One of the major rail servicers provides direct connectivity to San    College
                   Marcos. This line is referred to as The SPRINTER, and is con-
                   sidered a light-rail passenger service. The SPRINTER has stops
                   at the Palomar Community College SPRINTER Station, Civic
                   Center SPRINTER Station, California State University San Marcos
                   SPRINTER Station, and Nordahl Road SPRINTER Station within
                   the vicinity of San Marcos. The SPRINTER provides services to
                   the Oceanside Transit Center, the City of Vista, and the Escondido
                   Transit Center.

                   There is a tremendous opportunity to connect some of the key
                   activity centers, including the San Marcos Creek District and the
                   University District, with the City through an intra-city shuttle
                   system. The shuttle system could connect Palomar Community
                   College, the San Marcos Creek District, the University District,
                   California State University San Marcos, and the Civic Center
                   Transit Station. Connecting these core activity centers of the City
                   will provide additional mobility options throughout the commu-
                   nity to educational, shopping and recreational destinations.
                   These transit services are critical to providing mobility within
                   the City. They link to key destinations in the region and provide
                   an alternative to driving in the vehicle. The City envisions work-

                   Bicycling is considered an environmentally friendly mode of
                   transportation that enhances both personal and social well being.
                   In addition to transportation, this mode of travel provides many
                   public access, health, and economic benefits. Bicycling is recog-

                                   nized as an integral component of San Marcos’ transportation
                                   system. Well-designed pedestrian facilities are safe, attractive,
                                   convenient, and easy to use.
                                   Pedestrian paths are primarily developed as part of the roadway
                                   and trail systems of a City and reflect the interconnected nature
                                   of circulation and transportation systems as a whole. Currently
                                   sidewalks are provided along most of the major routes within
Discovery Hills Trail
                                   the City. However, there are some gaps, especially in the older

                                   areas and in the industrial/manufacturing areas developed prior
                                   to 1990.
                                   The City of San Marcos boasts a unique trail system that aims
                                   to provide recreational access and alternative circulation for
                                   non-motorized users through an interlinked City-wide system of
                                   trails connecting neighborhoods to local parks, schools, Palomar
                                   Community College and California State University San Marcos.
                                   The system is also designed to connect with the wider regional
                                   trails system as planned by adjacent cities, such as Carlsbad,
                                   Vista, Escondido, and Encinitas, and the County of San Diego.
                                                                               Photo Credit: City of San Marcos
                                   The City of San Marcos maintains a Master Trail Plan that depicts
                                   the buildout of the trail and park system within the City. The
                                   map identifies 60 miles of existing trails, with a buildout system
                                   of approximately 72 miles. Figure 3-5 shows the existing and
                                   proposed trail facilities for San Marcos.
                                   Even though bikeway master plans specifically address bicycle
                                   facilities on paved road-ways, a community’s trails are relevant
                                   and are critical to connecting people to places within the City of
                                   San Marcos. This is especially true wherever connections can
                                   be made that enhance intra-community connectivity by linking
                                   the two systems to each other and the greater mobility network.
                                   Therefore, these two non-motorized systems can be regarded as
                                   complementary extensions of each other.

3                  Goods Movement Facilities
                   The goods or freight movement system in San Marcos consists of a rail
                   system and designated truck routes. Each system is discussed below as
                   it relates to the operation and service of transporting freight.

                   Freight Rail System
                   The freight line that runs through San Marcos is parallel to State Route
                   78. The freight rail line is operated by Burlington Northern Santa Fe
                   (BNSF). The rail right-of-way is used by both freight and commuter
                   (SPRINTER) rail services. BNSF is one of the largest railway companies
                   in the United States with more than 390 different railroad lines. The City
                   shall explore ways to move freight and passenger rail efficiently tho-
                   rugh the city and surrounding jurisdictions by evaluating the feasibility
                   of rail grade separation along the Mission Road corridor.
                   Truck Routes
                   Currently the City maintains 11 designated truck routes. Of these, 3 will
                   be eliminated, 6 will be modified, and 3 new routes are identifies as
                   planned. Figure 3-6 identifies City truck routes. Truck routes are subject
                   to public hearings and consideration by the Traffic Safety Commission
                   and City Council prior to their adoption.
                   The following truck routes are envisioned for the City of San Marcos:
                       •	 Mission Road; from Rancho Santa Fe Road to the eastern City
                          limits
                       •	 South Santa Fe Avenue; from Rancho Santa Fe Road to Smilax
                       •	 Grand Avenue; from Rancho Santa Fe Road to Las Posas Road
                          (In the future, the truck route will extend along the Grand Avenue
                          southerly extension to the future Discovery Street extension)
                       •	 Linda Vista Drive; from Rancho Santa Fe Road to Las Posas Road
                       •	 San Marcos Boulevard; from Business Park Drive to Rancho
                          Santa Fe Road, and from Grand Avenue to SR-78 interchange,
                          and from Twin Oaks Valley Road to Mission Road
                       •	 Rancho Santa Fe Road; from Mission Road to the southerly City
                          limits
                       •	 Las Posas Road; from Linda Vista Drive to Mission Road

                                                 manages traffic flow in the City. The TMC remotely controls most
                                                 of the traffic signals in San Marcos. It also provides real-time
                                                 video feeds from traffic cameras strategically located at the City’s
                                                 busiest intersections.
                                                 Traffic engineers staffing the TMC can check signal operations,
                                                 adjust signal synchronization timing and monitor traffic progres-
                                                 sion throughout the City. The TMC opened in 2003 and was
                                                 made possible through Congestion Management and Air Quality
                                                 Improvement Program (CMAQ) funding. Since then, the City has
                                                 used federal and state funding to improve the TMC. Ongoing
                                                 improvements include installing additional traffic cameras,
                                                 upgrading traffic controllers, deploying an adaptive traffic control
                                                 system on San Marcos Boulevard, and establishing a fiber optic
                                                 communication network to interconnect many of the City’s
                                                 signals and traffic cameras.
                                                 The City continues to aggressively seek federal and State grants

                                                 optimization strategies like adaptive signal control. In the future,
                                                 Mission Road will be converted to an adaptive traffic control
                                                 system which will also coordinate the rail crossings.
                                                 The City will continue to investigate state of the art technology
                                                 in order to better serve the users of the transportation system.
                                                 Appropriate technologies will be integrated, as appropriate, to
                                                 maximize the efficiency of the transportation system.

3                  Parking
                   The City has undertaked measures to improve parking conditions
                   by readdressing circulation within the parking facilities, update
                   parking stall dimensions, and considering Smart Parking tech-
mobility Element
                   niques. Examples of Smart Parking techniques include:
                       •	 Shared Parking – Allowing uses that have different tem-
                          poral (time of day) parking demands to share the same
                          parking facilities. This is an effective way to minimize
                          pavement, allow land use to be more compact, provide
                          for more landscaping, and provide improved walkability
                          within a mixed use area. The best example of shared
                          parking is an office building and an apartment building
                          as office’s peak parking demand occurs at 10:00 a.m. and
                          apartment’s peak parking demand occurs at 11:00 p.m.
                       •	 Collective Parking – Allowing uses in mixed use districts to
                          utilize up to 50% of the vacant on-street parking to count
                          toward their parking supply requirements.
                       •	 Park Once – A strategy whereby destination districts
                          attempt to have visitors “park once” and visit a series of
                          destinations. Park once strategies work well in downtown          Rock Springs Roundabout, before (top) and after
                                                                                            (bottom).

                          trian and bicycle facilities.
                       •	 In Lieu Parking Fees – A strategy by which developers
                          can contribute in lieu fees toward the development of a
                          common parking facility. This works best in downtown
                          or mixed use districts, works well to assist in paying for
                          unified structured parking, and provides developers an
                          opportunity to increase density on their parcels.
                       •	 Parking Locator Signs – These are electronic monitoring
                          devices that identify the available parking in a given facility
                          and utilize changeable message signs to assist travelers in
                          identifying available parking locations.
                   Although there are additional smart parking strategies that are
                   available and may become available in the future, most of the
                   strategies work best in smart growth/mixed use development
                   areas and will be necessary to accomplish the goals and visions
                   identified for this General Plan.
                   Traffic Calming
                   Traffic calming is a series of methods to reduce vehicle speeds,
                   improve safety, and enhance quality of life. Although traffic calm-
                   ing includes traffic education, enforcement, and engineering (the
                   three E’s), most traffic calming applications focus on engineer-
                   ing measures to change driver behavior (such as encouraging
                   vehicles to travel at a lower rate of speed).

Specific engineering applications of traffic calming include:
    •	 Horizontal deflection of the roadway, such as bulbouts, chicanes,
       or roadway narrowing
                                                                                    3
                                                                                    mobility Element
    •	 Vertical deflection of the roadway, including raised crosswalks,
       raised or textured intersections, or speed tables
    •	 Traffic control devices, such as roundabouts or traffic circles
Traffic calming is encouraged within the City on neighborhood streets
and other areas where high levels of pedestrian activity are envisioned
(such as the San Marcos Creek District and the University District).
Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
As identified in the Ds of smart growth, one component of reducing the
reliance of the single occupant vehicle is to implement a comprehen-
sive TDM program. TDM consists of measures and policies to promote
alternative modes of travel. These can include employers providing
transit passes to employees, developers providing secure bicycle
parking and showers at key employment centers, preferred parking
for carpools, or reduced parking supply to encourage alternative travel
modes.
Given the network of mobility options the City currently has (and
envisions expanding as part of this General Plan) and the educational
facilities at the City, TDM has the potential to be extremely successful
within the City.
Circulation Improvements
The SANDAG 2050 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) identifies
improvements that are planned to be implemented through existing
funding sources by Year 2050. Circulation improvements identified for
San Marcos are shown on Figure 3-7. The following improvements have
been identified in the 2050 RTP document and are supported by this
Mobility Element:
Transit:
    •	 Expanded light-rail and express light-rail service through San
       Marcos extending between Oceanside and Escondido
    •	 Streetcar/shuttle service through the core of San Marcos
Roadway:
    •	 Managed lanes added to State Route 78
Bicycle:
    •	 Carlsbad/San Marcos Bicycle Corridor
    •	 Encinitas/San Marcos Bicycle Corridor
    •	 Inland Rail Trail Bicycle Corridor
The TransNet funds received each year by the City of San Marcos are
designated for local streets/roads and State Route 78 interchanges.

                   Efficient Local and Regional Circulation System
                   The City strives to “right size” the transportation system for all modes
mobility Element
                   of travel. This “right sizing” includes providing the most appropriate
                   system to integrate the adjacent land uses with the public realm,
                   provide choices for all modes of travel, provide sufficient capacity
                   (without over-supplying the system), and maximizing the efficiency of
                   the system. This enables the City to maximize the use of each of its
                   mobility investments.
                   Goal M-1
                   Provide a comprehensive multimodal circulation system that serves
                   the City land uses and provides for the safe and effective movement of
                   people and goods.
                   Policy M-1.1:	     Safely and efficiently accommodate traffic generated
                                      by development and redevelopment associated with
                                      implementation of the General Plan Land Use Policy
                                      Map.
                   Policy M-1.2: 	    Require new development to finance and construct
                                      internal adjacent roadway circulation and City-wide
                                      improvements as necessary to mitigate project
                                      impacts, including roadway, transit, pedestrian and
                                      bicycle facilities.
                   Policy M-1.3: 	    Require new developments to prepare and implement
                                      Transportation Demand Management (TDM) programs
                                      to minimize vehicle trip generation and promote
                                      alternative modes of travel within the City.
                   Policy M-1.4: 	    Utilize multi-modal level of service techniques to
                                      evaluate transportation facilities. For identified
                                      prioritized modes (based on facility typology), provide
                                      the following minimum LOS as shown in Table 3-4:
                                      •	 LOS D or better for Vehicles as a prioritized mode
                                         – Generally provides facilities that have minimum
                                         vehicle congestion during peak periods. Most
                                         motorists are delayed less than 55 seconds at a
                                         signal (or less than one signalized cycle)
                                      •	 LOS D or better for Bicycles – Generally provides
                                         bicycle facilities that provide a good level of comfort
                                         for average cyclists.
                                      •	 LOS C or better for Pedestrians – Generally provides
                                         for wider sidewalks and ensures a peasant and
                                         comfortable walking environment.

                                      direction of the City Engineer, to assign street
                                      typologies to City streets, depict roadway cross-
                                      sections, and where appropriate, incorporate the

                   Traffic Calming and Safety
                   The City strives to improve safety and livability within the City’s
                   neighborhoods. This is accomplished by implementing neighbor-
                   hood-scale design features, such as traffic calming devices, to
                   manage traffic speeds in these areas.
                   Goal M-2
                   Protect neighborhoods by improving safety for all modes of
                   travel and calming traffic where appropriate.
                   Policy M-2.1: 	    Work with new development to design road-
                                      ways that minimize traffic volumes and/or
                                      speed, as appropriate within residential neigh-
                                      borhoods; while maintaining the City’s desire to
                                      provide connectivity on the roadway network.

Alternative Modes of Travel
The City of San Marcos promotes and values the use of travel
modes other than the single occupant vehicle. To that end, the
following policies ensure that a true multi-modal system is imple-
mented within the City.
Goal M-3
Promote and encourage use of alternative transportation modes,
including transit, bicycles, neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs),
and walking, within the City.
Policy M-3.1: 	   Develop an integrated, multimodal circulation
                  system that accommodates transit, bicycles,
                  pedestrians, and vehicles; provides opportuni-
                  ties to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas
                  emissions; and reinforces the role of the street
                  as a public space that unites the City.
Policy M-3.2: 	   Improve safety conditions, efficiency, and
                  comfort for bicyclists and pedestrians through
                  design, maintenance and law enforcement.
                  Install wider sidewalks and curb extensions
                  at pedestrian crossings (bulb outs) where
                  appropriate.
Policy M-3.3: 	   Provide a pedestrian and bicycle network in
                  existing and new neighborhoods that facilitates
                  convenient and continuous pedestrian and
                  bicycle travel free of major impediments and
                  obstacles.
Policy M-3.4: 	   Work with local partners to implement a
                  Citywide Bike Sharing System. This would
                  include working with developers to provide bike
                  stations for key new developments, working
                  with California State University San Marcos,
                  Palomar Community College, and private
                  universities to provide bike stations on their
                  facilities, and working with regional transit
                  agencies to implement bike stations near transit
                  hubs.

                                      of pedestrian activity (such as employment
                                      centers, residential areas, mixed use areas, and
                                      schools) support safe pedestrian travel by pro-

                                      way finding signage, transit shelters, and other
                                      appropriate amenities.
                   Parking
                   Parking at key activity centers is critical to the success of the cen-
                   ter. However, parking needs to be provided appropriately. Over
                   or under parking these locations both will negatively impact the
                   success of the center. Additionally, mixed use districts succeed
                   when vehicles are parked in a common location and patrons walk
                   between their destinations. The City strives to provide the right
                   amount of parking in these locations.
                   Goal M-4
                   Provide efficient parking within the City.

                  sufficient parking supply while minimizing the
                  need for paved surface parking lots.
Movement of Goods
The City of San Marcos recognizes that its economic vitality
is dependent on the City’s ability to move goods and services
throughout the City and the region. However, the City recognizes
that the movement of goods needs to be accommodated on
identified routes within the City to ensure that those routes are
appropriately designed to accommodate the vehicles (e.g. ap-
propriate turning-radii, appropriate roadway structural sections,
etc.). Additionally, identifying appropriate routes will limit the
conflict of heavy vehicles with inappropriate land uses (such as
residential and/commercial) and minimize conflicts with bicycle/
pedestrian users in the City.
Goal M-5
Provide for the safe and efficient movement of goods throughout
the City.
Policy M-5.1: 	   Consult with other agencies and private entities
                  (such as the BNSF) to identify ways to maintain,
                  improve, and expand rail services to safely
                  meet existing and future needs of residents and
                  businesses.
Policy M-5.2:	    Maintain truck route designations on appropri-
                  ate facilities as shown in the Truck Route Plan
                  within this Mobility Element.

Open Space Element
           4.1 	Introduction
           The urban and suburban areas of San Marcos are surrounded
           by open space that supports unique habitats like vernal pools,
           sensitive plant and wildlife species, and agricultural areas—these
           areas are also valuable aesthetic resources that add visual inter-
           est to the landscape. The City recognizes the finite value of the
           area’s environmental resources and is committed to their protec-
           tion and enhancement. In addition, the City is working to address
           pressing resource issues like water supply, watershed and water
           quality protection, air pollution, climate change, and energy inde-
           pendence. The Conservation and Open Space Element sets forth
           goals and policies that allow the City to take an active role in
           the management of these resources for the benefit of residents,
           businesses, and visitors, for years to come.
           Purpose of the Conservation and Open Space Element
           The purpose of the Conservation and Open Space Element is to
           identify natural, cultural, historic, and open space resources. This
           Element provides goals, policies, and programs related to open
           space and conservation. It also covers a wide range of other
           topics that together, compose the natural setting of San Marcos
           including biological, scenic, cultural, and historical resources. The
           goals and policies contained in this Element also address climate
           change and practices related to water conservation, energy
           conservation, air quality, and protection of watersheds and water
           quality.
           The City also understands the importance of providing a frame-
           work of natural, managed, and conservation open spaces in line
           with the guiding principles. Open space that extends throughout
           the City Connects People with Places by providing pathways
           to destinations and natural recreation spaces and is critical in
           Sustaining Environmental Quality by conserving the quality of
           natural systems. These spaces support water and energy conser-
           vation, Building a Greener Community.

                                      This Conservation and Open Space Element meets State of
                                      California requirements for a Conservation Element and Open
                                      Space Element of the General Plan (California Government Code
                                      65302(d) and 65302(e)). The purpose of the Conservation Element
                                      is to consider the effects of development on natural resources.
                                      Similarly, the purpose of the Open Space Element is to recognize
                                      that open space land is a limited and valuable resource that must
                                      be conserved whenever possible. The City of San Marcos has
                                      combined these elements to comprehensively address conserva-
                                      tion, protection, and management of its natural, cultural, historic,
                                      and open space resources.
                                      Section highlights and key facts relevant to this Element are
                                      highlighted in Table 4-1.

                                      Ecological and Biological Resources
                                      Although the extent of native habitat in San Marcos is limited,
                                      the City has a significant amount of natural communities that
                                      support unique habitats like vernal pools, and sensitive plant and
                                      wildlife species endemic to the region. Even the lush landscaping
                                      and ornamental plantings in suburban areas can provide “green-
                                      belts” of vegetative cover and separation between developed
                                      urban and suburban areas and natural communities. The City,                The City of San Marcos includes a range of
                                                                                                                 biological and wildlife species.

                                      better protect these habitats and species.
                                      Vegetation Communities and Land Cover Types
                                      Many of the urban and suburban areas of San Marcos are well
                                      landscaped with tree-lined streets and verdant lawns; this ample
                                      display adds visual interest and distinguishes neighborhoods
                                      within the City. While nonnative landscaping has limited value
                                      as habitat for native species, some of the rural and agricultural
                                      areas, for example, along Twin Oaks Valley Road, provide nesting
                                      and foraging habitat for migratory birds. Large stands of eucalyp-
                                      tus trees, which are found throughout the City, provide nesting
                                      habitat for raptors.

Conservation and Open Space Element Highlights and Facts
Portions of the planning area are identified as a subarea in SANDAG’s Multiple Habitat Conservation
                                                                                                              4

About 25 percent of the City is currently undeveloped and provides habitat for a range of vegetation
communities. These large areas of open space and conservation land are mostly located on the
hillsides surrounding the City and the natural creek areas.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has identified critical habitat to protect four species:
the thread-leaved brodiaea, the spreading navarretia, the San Diego fairy shrimp, and the coastal
California gnatcatcher.
Wildlife movement within the City is primarily limited to the northern and southern parts but may
occur along riparian creeks and drainage corridors that traverse the City, including San Marcos Creek,
Buena Creek, and Agua Hedionda Creek.
The City contains 2,499 acres of dedicated open space, which is approximately 12 percent of the City’s
acreage.
The northern Sphere of Influence (SOI) within the Twin Oaks Valley neighborhood includes some
areas where either mineral deposits are present or where there is a high likelihood for their presence.
Current mining/quarry operations do not exist within the City.
San Marcos has prominent landforms such as Mt. Whitney, Double Peak, Owens Peak, San Marcos
Mountains, Merriam Mountains, Cerro de Las Posas, and Franks Peak that add visual interest to the
landscape.
Air quality in the City is affected not only by local emissions, but also by pollutants transported from
other areas, in particular, ozone and ozone precursor emissions from the South Coast Air Basin (e.g.,
Los Angeles) and Mexico.
San Marcos will address climate change and greenhouse gas emissions through a broad range of
policies and programs that take into account land use efficiency, transportation patterns, and energy
efficiency.
Southern California water resources are facing unprecedented water supply challenges. Severe
drought and court-ordered pumping restrictions have caused water supplies to drop to historically
low levels. During severe drought seasons, voluntary and mandatory water rationing for homes and
businesses may be imposed per water district ordinances. Water resources in San Marcos include
imported water resources such as the Second San Diego Aqueduct connections to the Vallecitos Water
District, Vista Irrigation District, Olivenhain Municipal Water District, Rincon del Diablo Municipal Water
District (Rincon Water District), and the siphon Vista Canal. Other local groundwater and surface water
resources include Discovery Lake, South Lake, privately owned and operated Lake San Marcos, and
multiple wells.
The protection of watersheds and water quality is a prominent concern for San Marcos since all of the
major creeks and their tributaries (San Marcos, Agua Hedionda, and Escondido) are listed by the State
Water Resources Control Board as impaired for a variety of pollutants that ultimately affect the water
quality of surface and groundwater supplies and biological resources. The City has partnered with
other jurisdictions in the watersheds to implement Water Quality Management Plans in coordination
with the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board Region 9 for nutrients and bacteria to protect
the watersheds and address the water body impairments. The City is the lead agency for the nutrient
management plan in the Upper San Marcos Creek Watershed.
Cultural resources within San Marcos include archaeological and historical objects, sites and districts;
historic buildings and structures; cultural landscapes; and sites and resources of concern to local
Native American and other ethnic groups.

                                      Wildlife typically associated with the urban and suburban areas
                                      of the City are predominantly nonnative or common species
                                      that have adapted to urban settings such as common reptiles,
                                      blackbirds, gopher snakes, sparrows, raptors, mourning doves,
                                      and ground squirrels.
                                      However, San Marcos contains some important habitats and
                                      species that are considered sensitive by resource agencies,
                                      including U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), California
                                      Department of Fish and Game (CDFG), San Diego Regional
                                      Water Quality Control Board (SDRWQCB), California Native
                                      Plant Society (CNPS), SANDAG’s Multiple Habitat Conservation
                                      Program (MHCP), and County of San Diego’s Multiple Species
                                      Conservation Program (MSCP). Sensitive habitats and sensitive
                                      species are federal-, state- or local-listed species that are afforded
                                      a higher level of protection because of their status (e.g., threat-
                                      ened, endangered, critical). Typically, development applications
                                      will have to demonstrate that these habitats will not be affected
                                      or will provide abatement mitigation measures for any possible
                                      negative effects. Permit authorization from regulatory agencies
                                      and mitigation would be required if a proposed project were to
                                      have the potential to impact sensitive species or their habitats or
                                      jurisdictional waters, including vegetative wetlands.
                                      Fifteen special-status plants and 24 special-status wildlife species
                                      are known to occur in San Marcos. Of note is a large population
                                      of the federally threatened coastal California gnatcatcher that
                                      is associated with Diegan coastal sage scrub habitats, which
                                      occur within the undeveloped open space areas in the northern
                                      and southern portions of the planning area. These areas are
                                      connected to protected lands on the north (i.e., MSCP lands)
                                      and undeveloped coastal sage scrub communities on the south
                                      (MHCP critical habitat). In addition, the USFWS has identified
                                      critical habitat to protect four species: thread-leaved brodiaea,
                                      spreading navarretia, San Diego fairy shrimp, and coastal
                                      California gnatcatcher.

                                               isolated areas. These areas are often separated by otherwise
                                               foreign or inhospitable habitats, such as roadways, subdivisions,
                                               or other man-made barriers. Isolation of wildlife populations can
                                               have many harmful effects and may contribute significantly to
                                               local species extinction.

along Twin Oaks Valley tributaries and open
spaces.

                                               of the City, five internal corridors within the planning area are
                                               identified that provide linkages: one corridor connects to north

                                               Meadows Open Space area, one corridor connects to southwest
                                               Carlsbad, and three corridors connect to open space lands
                                               associated with the MHCP and MSCP. As discussed previously,
                                               these regional corridors are important in connecting wildlife spe-

                                               Open Space and Limited Resources
                                               Open space and agricultural areas within San Marcos are highly
                                               valued by the community as they represent a key component
                                               of the City’s character. They include public and private parks;
                                               hillsides; canyons; creeks; open space corridors; agricultural
                                               lands; and various utility, roadway, and buffer easements. The
                                               purpose of designating these open space areas is to preserve
                                               environmental resources and aesthetic attributes. Within the City,
                                               there are also other resources, such as mineral or paleontological
                                               resources, that represent limited, nonrenewable, and sensitive
                                               materials.

                                      Open space areas and preserves within San Marcos protect the
                                      area’s natural beauty and contribute to a regional system of
                                      hiking, biking, and equestrian trails. In addition, the open space
conservation and Open Space Element
                                      areas within the community preserve habitat for a variety of
                                      plants and animals. The City contains 2,499 acres of dedicated
                                      open space, which is approximately 12 percent of the City’s acre-
                                      age. Figure 4-3 shows the location of open space in San Marcos.

                                      The City contains productive agricultural areas within the
                                      planning area, as illustrated in Figure 4-4. A broad range of
                                      agricultural activities occur in San Marcos including nurseries,           Open space resources total 2,499 acres of land
                                      horse farms, and produce production. These areas are primarily             within the City.

                                      The Planning Area contains approximately 166 acres identified as
                                      Prime Farmland, 145 acres of Farmland of Statewide Importance,
                                      and 1,407 acres of Unique Farmlands. The Planning Area also
                                      contains approximately 807 acres of farmland classified by the
                                      County of San Diego as Farmland of Local Importance. In addi-
                                      tion, approximately 11 acres of Williamson Act contract lands are
                                      located in the Twin Oaks Valley Neighborhood within the Sphere
                                      of Influence area. While the City is committed to supporting local
                                      farming and preserving agricultural land uses and activities,
                                      some conversion of agricultural land may occur over the life of
                                      this General Plan. Agricultural conversion is a sensitive process
                                      dependent on land use designation, evaluating the scale and
                                      regional importance of activities, and site-specific analysis.

                                      Pursuant to the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act
                                      (SMARA) of 1975, the California Geological Survey (CGS) classi-
                                      fies land through a mineral inventory process intended to ensure
                                      that important mineral deposits are identified and protected for
                                      future extraction. The State Geologist classifies mineral areas,
                                      Mineral Resource Zones (MRZ) as one of four zones:
                                          •	 MRZ-1: Areas where adequate information indicates that
                                             no significant mineral deposits are present or where it is
                                             judged that little likelihood exists for their presence.
                                          •	 MRZ-2: Areas where adequate information indicates that
                                             significant mineral deposits are present or where it is
                                             judged that a high likelihood for their presence exists.
                                          •	 MRZ-3: Areas containing mineral deposits the significance
                                             of which cannot be evaluated from available data.
                                          •	 MRZ-4: Areas where available information is inadequate
                                             for assignment to any other MRZ zone.

According to CGS, the planning area is not a suitable source for
construction materials. However, the San Marcos Planning area has
land classified in all four MRZ zones:
                                                                                    4
    •	 MRZ-1 areas are located north of State Route 78.
                                                                                    conservation and Open Space Element
    •	 MRZ-2 areas include small portions between Double Peak, Mt.
       Whitney, and Franks Peak; and small portions in the northern
       Sphere of Influence within Twin Oaks Valley Neighborhood.
    •	 MRZ-3 areas include the majority of the undeveloped northern
       and southern areas of the City.
    •	 MRZ-4 covers the majority of the developed areas.
These classifications are based solely on evaluation of geological
factors and do not consider existing land use.
California does not require that local governments protect land des-
ignated as MRZ-1, MRZ-3, or MRZ-4. However, the City is responsible
for recognizing lands designated as MRZ-2 and protecting these areas
from premature development incompatible with mining through
General Plan policy. In addition, if new significant aggregate resources
are ultimately found in the City, state policy favors conservation and
development of those resources.
The City currently does not have active mines or quarries, although two
historical mining/quarry locations does exist within the corporate City
limits; Meadowlark Ranch Quarry located in the Questhaven/La Costa
Meadows Neighborhood and the former mine near Village Drive at Twin
Oaks Valley Road. The Galbrath Quarry is located in the planning area’s
Sphere of Influence within the Twin Oaks Valley Neighborhood. Should
new mineral resources be discovered in the future, the City will main-
tain awareness and comply with state policies regarding protection and
extraction.
Paleontological Resources and Unique Geological Formations
Paleontological resources, or fossils, are the remains and/or traces
of prehistoric (i.e., older than approximately 10,000 years) plant and
animal life. Fossils provide direct evidence of ancient organisms
and document the patterns of organic evolution and extinction that
have characterized the history of life over the past 3.4 billion years.
Paleontological resources, like archaeological resources, represent
sensitive scientific and educational resources.
Scenic Resources and Landform Features
The City’s scenic resources are preserved for the mutual enjoyment
of community residents and visitors. Scenic resources within the City
include, but are not limited to, undeveloped hillsides; prominent land-
forms such as the San Marcos Mountains, Merriam Mountains, Mount
Whitney, Cerro de La Posas, Double Peak, Owens Peak, and Franks
Peak; creek corridors; eucalyptus stands; rock outcroppings; landmarks
or historic buildings; and ocean views.

                                      time lighting in commercial areas to limit the amount of light that
                                      spills onto adjacent properties or reflects into the sky.
                                      Other scenic resources within the City include, but are not limited
                                      to, creek corridors, eucalyptus stands, rock outcroppings, land-

                                      Air Quality, Climate Change, and Energy
                                      Addressing air pollution, climate change, and energy indepen-
                                      dence will continue to be a pressing challenge throughout the
                                      life of the General Plan and beyond. Because these are regional,
                                      statewide, national, and even international concerns, the City
                                      will not be alone in its efforts. However, the City does not have
                                      to wait—through local initiative and innovation it can mitigate
                                      air quality impacts, quantify community-wide and municipal
                                      greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, set GHG reduction targets,
                                      and implement programs that will increase energy efficiency and
                                      reduce dependence on nonrenewable energy sources.
                                      Air Quality
                                      San Marcos is within the San Diego Air Basin, which covers the
                                      entirety of San Diego County (Figure 4-6). Air quality in the San
                                      Diego Air Basin is impacted not only by local emissions, but also
                                      by pollutants transported from other areas, in particular, ozone
                                      and ozone precursor emissions from the South Coast Air Basin
                                      (e.g., Los Angeles) and Mexico. In addition to regional factors,
                                      air quality conditions in San Marcos are determined by localized
                                      factors such as topography and weather.

                                                 confidence (i.e., at least 90 percent) that human-caused increases
                                                 in GHGs have contributed and will continue to contribute to

                                                 The California Air Resources Board (ARB) has developed a GHG
                                                 Inventory for the State of California that identified and quantified
                                                 Statewide anthropogenic GHG emissions and sinks. California
                                                 produced 484 million metric tons (MMT) of GHG emissions in
                                                 2008 (ARB 2010). Transportation was the sector with the largest
                                                 percentage of GHG emissions, 37 percent, followed by electricity
                                                 generation (25 percent), and industrial sources (20 percent). In

conservation and Open Space Element
                                      for 16 MMT, or 46 percent of total emissions. Energy consumption,
                                      including electricity and natural gas use, is the next largest source of
                                      emissions at 34 percent of the total; see Figure 4-7.
                                      Neither mitigation nor adaptation alone can eliminate all climate
                                      change impacts, but together they can significantly reduce the risks of
                                      climate change. Near-term action is particularly important given the

                                      tions delayed several decades into the future).
                                      The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, widely known
                                      as Assembly Bill (AB) 32, requires ARB to develop and enforce regula-
                                      tions for reporting, verifying, and reducing statewide GHG emissions.
                                      The heart of the legislation is the requirement that statewide GHG
                                      emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. California would need to
                                      reduce GHG emissions to approximately 15 percent below 2005 levels
                                      and 28 percent below business-as-usual predictions of year 2020 GHG
                                      emissions to achieve this goal.
                                      Signed in September 2008, Senate Bill (SB) 375 aligns regional
                                      transportation planning efforts, regional GHG-reduction targets, and
                                      land use and housing allocation. SB 375 provides for a new planning
                                      process to coordinate land use planning and regional transportation
                                      plans (RTP), and funding priorities to help California meet the GHG
                                      reductions established in AB 32. It requires MPOs, including SANDAG,
                                      to adopt a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) as part of the RTP
                                      that demonstrates how the region would achieve GHG emission reduc-
                                      tion targets set by ARB.
                                      ARB has established regional reduction targets for GHGs emitted by
                                      passenger cars and light trucks in the region for the years 2020 and
                                      2035. San Diego County regional targets are per capita CO2 emissions
                                      reductions of 7 percent by 2020 and 13 percent by 2035 relative to 2005
                                      levels.
                                      Under SB 375, local governments retain land use planning authority,
                                      and city or county land use policies (including general plans) are not
                                      required to be consistent with the RTP. However, to meet the goals of
                                      AB 32 and reduce the adverse effects associated with global climate
                                      change, substantial GHG emissions reductions must occur within the
                                      lifetime of the City’s General Plan. Because of its geographic location,
                                      the climate change adaptation strategies for San Marcos will address
                                      water shortages, increased wildfires, and changes to flora and fauna
                                      that will together create imbalances in the natural environment making
                                      it difficult to predict exactly how the health and safety of the community
                                      will be affected. Reducing GHG emissions by increasing energy ef-

                                      Water Supply and Conservation
                                      Water is considered a limited natural resource given climate conditions
                                      and the reliance of Southern California communities on imported do-
                                      mestic water supplies from as far away as the Sacramento-San Joaquin
                                      Delta and the Colorado River. San Marcos recognizes the critical nature
                                      of water resources relative to regional growth and works with residents,
                                      businesses, and water authorities to conserve water supplies.
                                      Water Supply
                                      Surface and groundwater supplies within San Marcos include local
                                      resources: privately held and managed Lake San Marcos, Discovery
                                      Lake, South Lake, Jacks Pond, San Marcos Creek, and Agua Hedionda
                                      Creek. Imported drinking water resources include the Second San Diego
                                      Aqueduct and the Siphon Vista Canal. There are many private and
                                      municipal well systems in San Marcos that augment the local surface
                                      water and imported water supply for agricultural and municipal irriga-
                                      tion sources. Surface water impoundments such as the lakes mentioned
                                      above are not used for drinking water.
                                      San Marcos’ water supply and services are provided primarily by
                                      Vallecitos Water District (VWD). Limited portions of the Business/
                                      Industrial District and College Area Neighborhood are served by Vista
                                      Irrigation District (VID), and a very small portion of the planning area
                                      is served by Olivenhain Municipal Water District (OMWD) and Rincon
                                      Water District.
                                      VWD and VID both updated their Urban Water Management Plan
                                      (UWMP) in June 2010 to assess current and future demand for water,
                                      facilities, and storage. To lessen their dependence on imported water,
                                      local water retail agencies throughout Southern California, including
                                      VWD and other local water purveyors, are implementing water conser-
                                      vation measures and seeking alternative local sources of water.
                                      VWD buys water from the San Diego County Water Authority (SDCWA),
                                      which is the largest purchaser of water from the Metropolitan Water
                                      District of Southern California (MWD). MWD owns and operates the
                                      Colorado River Aqueduct and buys the most water from the State
                                      Water Project for the delivery of Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta water
                                      to Southern California. An additional water purchase agreement for
                                      desalinated water from the future Carlsbad Seawater Desalination
                                      Facility is in place, which would comprise 35 percent of VWD’s supply at
                                      current demand levels.
                                      VWD updated its Integrated Water Resources Plan in 2007 and UWMP
                                      in 2010 to assess current and future demand for water, facilities, and
                                      storage. To lessen their dependence on imported water, local water

                                              have caused water supplies to drop to historically low levels. It

                                              water rationing for homes and businesses will be imposed.

                                              vironmentally sound way to reduce current and future demand.
                                              Residents and businesses in San Marcos can take many actions
                                              to reduce water use, such as using water-conserving toilets and
                                              washers, fixing leaks, planting low water use landscaping, and
                                              simply avoiding overwatering plants. The City, in collaboration
                                              with all four water districts, continues to encourage the residents
                                              of San Marcos to reduce water consumption and promote water
                                              conservation.
                                              Consistent with California State mandates, the City adopted the
                                              Water Efficiency Landscape Ordinance in 2009 to reduce water
                                              usage through design, maintenance, and landscape choice.
                                              Furthermore the City, VWD, and VID currently partner to imple-
                                              ment water conservation programs in the City. These agencies
                                              have installed drought-tolerant gardens—at Heritage Park,
                                              Jack’s Pond Park, and the District’s administration offices—to
                                              demonstrate how residents can reduce outdoor water use. The
                                              City already uses water-efficient drip irrigation to maintain the
                                              majority of its more than 100 miles of roadway medians; some
                                              medians are well watered or use nonpotable irrigation. Large
                                              community parks and most other City facilities are watered
                                              using well water pumped from each site or from other nearby
                                              wells. Well water gives the City a cost-effective way to green
                                              San Marcos without using potable water supplies. The City also
                                              makes daily adjustments to irrigation controllers based upon
                                              weather conditions using a sophisticated computerized monitor-

                                      ments within the City’s watersheds through groundbreaking
                                      projects such as the voluntary nutrient abatement project for the
                                      Upper San Marcos Creek to address the impairments listed by
                                      the State for San Marcos Creek and Lake San Marcos nine years
                                      in advance of a formal order, also known as a Total Maximum
                                      Daily Load (TMDL) order. The order is intended to restore the
                                      impaired water body to the Basin Plan designations.

                                      ity in the General Plan area is implemented under the Federal
                                      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Water Act through
                                      State programs and policies under the State Water Resources
                                      Control Board (SWRCB), which in turn delegates other mandated
                                      EPA programs to a regional local agency. The local regional
                                      agency has adopted policies, plans, permits, orders, and resource
                                      designations to be protective of watershed surface and ground-
                                      water beneficial uses and water quality.
                                      The delegated authority for watershed protection of surface and
                                      groundwater quality beneficial uses in the General Plan area is
                                      the SDRWQCB (Region 9).
                                      The SWRCB has designated primary hydrographic units (HUs)
                                      and hydrographic subareas (HSAs) to define each watershed. The
                                      General Plan area is located within the Carlsbad Hydrographic
                                      Unit (HU) and is separated into four primary subwatersheds
                                      based on topographical drainage areas to creek systems:
                                          •	 904.1 San Luis Rey River ( Moosa Creek)

Each of these subwatershed areas is further refined by eight
creek system branches by HSA (list below). Figure 4-8 shows the
location of these SWRCB HSA areas in relationship to the eight
General Plan neighborhoods. Table 4-2 summarizes the acreages
                                                                              4

                                      The SDRWQCB Basin Plan identifies beneficial uses for ground-

                                      The City of San Marcos is located in the Department of Water
                                      Resources (DWR) South Coast Hydrologic Region. DWR Bulletin
                                      118 identifies the San Marcos Area as Basin 9-32. There are 27
                                      groundwater basins in San Diego County. Groundwater basins
                                      in San Diego and in the General Plan Area have mainly calcium
                                      and sodium cations and bicarbonate and sulfate anions. Local
                                      impairments of nitrate, sulfate, and TDS are common. There are
                                      generally five contaminant groups found as inorganics, radiologi-
                                      cal, nitrates, pesticides, and VOCs. The DWR San Marcos Area is
                                      2,129 acres (see Figure 4-10 ). This groundwater basin is located
                                      entirely within San Marcos Creek HSA 904.52, which is desig-
                                      nated as impaired (see Table 4-3) and has a hydrologic connec-
                                      tion to Lake San Marcos, which will be assessed under the City’s
                                      nutrient plan TMDL process currently underway. The outcome of
                                      the assessment is to understand the groundwater influence on
                                      the lake’s water quality impairment.
                                      Other minor groundwater basins and wells are located through-
                                      out the General Plan area outside of Basin 9-32; however, the
                                      DWR Basin 9-32 is the only groundwater basin formally designat-
                                      ed in the General Plan Area. Table 4-4 represents the acreage of
                                      the San Marcos Area Basin in each General Plan Neighborhood.

Recycling and Solid Waste
Solid waste and recycling services in San Marcos are provided
by EDCO, a private waste collection and recycling company. This
service is available to residential and nonresidential custom-
ers. Residents pay for EDCO service on a per household basis
for automated rubbish, recycling, and green waste (e.g., lawn
clippings) collection. EDCO also provides options for electronic
waste disposal, residential hazardous waste disposal, and
temporary-use dumpsters and roll-off containers. The City works
with EDCO to promote its construction and demolition material
waste removal and recycling program. See Chapter 2, Land Use
and Community Design Element for more information on EDCO
and solid waste disposal in the City.
Cultural and Historic Resources
San Marcos was originally founded in 1797 when, according to
legend, a small band of Native Americans stole livestock from
the Spanish settlement and fled into the hills. Spanish soldiers
pursued them, encountering a fertile valley on April 25, which
was then named Los Vallecitos de San Marcos to honor the feast
day of St. Mark.
The valley was first settled as a few scattered communities and
ranchos. In 1833, John H. Barham founded the first town in Twin
Oaks Valley called Barham. At this time, the California Southern

                                      7 miles west of Barham. By 1886, San Marcos was centered at the
                                      current intersection of Grand Avenue and Rancho Santa Fe Road.
                                      By 1887, the majority of the remaining rancho lands were sold to

                                      the San Marcos Land Company, which divided the community
                                      into lots to create a planned community of San Marcos. At this
                                      time, a train depot was built to service daily passenger, freight,
                                      and mail traffic. By 1888, four trains a day ran through San
                                      Marcos to Los Angeles and San Diego. By 1907, San Marcos was
                                      an established community with a railroad, mail delivery, tele-
                                      phone service, a general store, and several schools. Agriculture
                                      continued to be the largest industry in the San Marcos area into
                                      the 20th century.
                                      In the 1950s, the construction of State Route 78 and the diver-
                                      sion of water from the Colorado River to San Marcos increased

                                      businesses, like dairy and poultry productions, started during

                                      Cultural resources within San Marcos include archaeological
                                      and historical objects, sites and districts, historic buildings
                                      and structures, cultural landscapes, and sites and resources
                                      of concern to local Native American and other ethnic groups.
                                      Previously documented cultural resources within the City include
                                      prehistoric isolated finds, prehistoric archaeological sites, historic
                                      archaeological sites, multicomponent (prehistoric and historic)
                                      archaeological sites, and historic architectural sites. As of 2009,
                                      149 historical and archaeological resource sites were known
                                      within San Marcos. The documented history suggests that there
                                      may be several resources associated with early settlement
                                      development that could be potentially eligible for the California
                                      Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) or the National Register
                                      of Historic Places (NRHP).
                                      Historic archaeological sites include evidence of chicken coop
                                      foundations, homestead sites, refuse scatters, mining sites, rock
                                      cairns, and water storage reservoirs. There are numerous historic
                                      architectural resources that represent a variety of structures from
                                      the late 18th century to the mid-20th century including residential
                                      complexes (with privies, cabins, a shed, and a barn), eight
                                      residences, a Quonset-type industrial building, a commercial
                                      building, an adobe house, a cement silo, a farmhouse, and a
                                      historic cemetery. Of these, the Merriam House and outbuildings,
                                      dating from the 1890s, are the most notable. They are associated
                                      with one of the founding families and Florence Augusta Merriam,
                                      an important naturalist, and are potentially eligible for the CRHR.

Community Health Element
               5.1 	Introduction
               The quality of life that residents enjoy in San Marcos is en-
               hanced by many recreational amenities and community service
               programs. In its effort to create a “healthy community,” the City
               is continuously working to improve physical and social environ-
               ments. The City maintains a range of mini-parks, neighborhood
               parks, community parks, community centers, recreational
               facilities, and trails to provide a place for relaxation and enjoy-
               ment, physical activity, gathering and community building,
               and entertainment. These facilities are a part of the network of
               amenities that provide access to physical activity, healthy food,
               medical services, and community and social networks. The Parks,
               Recreation, and Community Health Element addresses the impor-
               tance of these amenities and includes goals and policies that out-
               line the role they play in achieving the City’s vision for the future.
               Purpose of the Parks, Recreation, and Community Health
               Element
               The City aims to maintain and increase access to parks, trails,
               recreational facilities, and community service programs. In addi-
               tion, it aims to provide a healthy and safe community by taking
               into consideration community health and family enrichment
               needs of community members, including older adults, children,
               persons with special needs, and residents of all ages. Parks and
               recreation amenities can increase the health and livability of
               a community, and connect people with places within the City
               by providing gathering spaces and promoting civic pride.
               Scope and Content of the Parks, Recreation, and
               Community Health Element
               The Parks, Recreation, and Community Health Element describes
               existing parks, trails, and recreation facilities located in the City,
               and outlines current plans for expansion of these amenities. It
               also identifies how access to healthy food, medical services,
               and social opportunities can enhance community health. Over
               time, the community’s preferences and recreation needs change.

5                                                 Amenities at parks and recreation facilities are now going beyond
                                                  the traditional tot-lot and picnic area to include amenities such as
                                                  lighted sports fields, climbing walls, disc golf courses, and dog

                                                  and services requires a broad range of financial and program-
                                                  matic support. The information documented here forms the basis
                                                  for goals, policies, and implementation programs that offer a
                                                  variety of healthful physical activities and recreational pursuits.

                                                   Parks and Recreation Highlights and Facts
                                                   The City of San Marcos continues to acquire and maintain
                                                   parkland throughout the community, which enhances the
                                                   natural beauty of San Marcos and provides recreation options.
                                                   In addition to parkland, the City has set aside approximately
                                                   2,499 acres of open space and preserve areas within the City.
                                                   The City maintains several types of parks: community parks,
                                                   which serve the entire City; neighborhood parks, which are
                                                   often located near schools; and mini-parks, which are small
                                                   public spaces.
                                                   San Marcos has private recreational amenities, such as Twin
                                                   Oaks Valley and Lake San Marcos golf courses, and private
                                                   trails, greenbelts, open space, and parks. These are often part
                                                   of planned residential developments.
                                                   The City is expanding its trail system for recreation and mobil-
                                                   ity purposes. Greater connectivity and mobility choices can
                                                   lead to a reduction in automobile trips and associated green-
                                                   house gas emissions.
                                                   The City has embraced emerging trends in community plan-
                                                   ning that recognize that access to fresh healthy food and
                                                   medical services can improve the quality of life for residents.
                                                   This means a greater emphasis is being placed on creating
                                                   more healthy places, fostering greater physical and social con-

                                                   quality.

           6.1 	 Introduction
           The quality and livability of San Marcos relies, in part, on the
           safety and welfare of City residents and property. The City serves
           a broad range of people with housing, business, and recreational
           activities that contribute to the highly valued quality of life.
           Natural and human-caused events have the ability to impact
           productivity by causing substantial damage to life, property,
           and economic prosperity. The Safety Element addresses these
           potential issues with goals, policies, and actions to continue to
           serve and protect San Marcos and its residents.
           Purpose of the Safety Element
           A fundamental responsibility of the City is the protection of the
           public health, safety, and welfare of residents and their property.
           The Safety Element, a state-mandated element of the General
           Plan, addresses this responsibility by identifying and planning for
           anticipated natural and human-caused safety issues affecting the
           City and its residents.
           Geologic and seismic hazards play an important role in the
           planning process with regard to the selection of development
           locations, the definition of processes necessary to develop safe
           projects, and the studies necessary to design a project to avoid or
           withstand these natural hazards. Other natural hazards, such as
           flood and fire, are also important considerations, as these have
           the potential to cause death, injuries, property damage, and/or
           substantial economic and social dislocation.
           Scope and Content
           This Safety Element documents safety conditions in the planning
           area and identifies preliminary geologic, seismic, flood (including
           dam failure or breach), fire, and airport hazards present within
           the planning area. In addition, this section discusses hazardous
           materials and emergency preparedness. Information in this
           section provides a context for evaluating potential hazards and
           creates a foundation that will help to proactively address plan-
           ning and development of the City.

6                The City maintains critical facilities for health, safety, and emer-
                 gency response. These facilities do not occur in hazard areas and
                 are identified in the Public Services, Infrastructure, and Utilities
                 section of Chapter 2, Land Use and Community Design Element.
SAFETY ELEMENT
                 Section highlights and key facts relevant to safety in San Marcos
                 are highlighted in Table 6-1.
                  Table 6-1
                  Safety Element Highlights and Key Facts
                  Seismicity and Faulting Hazards
                  No active or potentially active faults traverse the City of San Marcos; however, three surface faults and
                  one possible blind thrust fault are documented or believed to directly underlie the planning area.
                  No Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone is present within the planning area.
                  Earthquake ground shaking potential from surface faults in the region, including the planning area, is
                  relatively low.
                  Dam failure inundation flooding is an issue for relatively small, but populous, portions of the City and
                  Sphere of Influence area.
                  Geologic Hazards
                  Most of the planning area is in either the low soil-slip (debris flow/landslide) category (bedrock/hillside
                  areas) or the zero category (alluvial deposit/valley areas). Scattered moderate susceptibility areas are
                  found in the bedrock areas mainly in the Questhaven / La Costa Meadoes, Lake San Marcos, Barham /
                  Discovery Community, eastern College Area, and southwestern Twin Oaks Valley neighborhoods.
                  Potential liquefaction-induced lateral spread landslides are more of a concern in the areas adjacent to
                  San Marcos Creek and affiliated Twin Oaks Valley channels.
                  The most likely locations for collapsible soils are the current and pre-development washes and drain-
                  age channels, particularly San Marcos Creek and Twin Oaks Valley Neighborhood drainage corridors.
                  Flood Hazards
                  Federal Emergency Management Agency-designated 100-year floodplains and floodways are identified
                  around San Marcos Creek and the Twin Oaks Valley drainage, plus Lake San Marcos and smaller drain-
                  age areas west of Palomar Community College, extending south beyond State Route 78.
                   Fire Hazards
                  The San Marcos Fire Department manages urban wildland interface community hazard areas through
                  the Community Wildfire Protection Plan and brush management plans.
                  Hazardous Materials
                  The County of San Diego Department of Environmental Health (DEH) Hazardous Materials Division
                  (HMD) is certified by the California Environmental Agency as the local Certified Unified Program Agen-
                  cy. Thus, DEH HMD is responsible for implementing federal and state laws and regulations for the City.
                  Airport Hazards
                  There are no public or private airports located within City boundaries; however, the McClellan-Palomar
                  Airport is located approximately 2.5 miles west of the City within the city of Carlsbad. The majority of
                  the planning area is located within Airport Influence Area Review Area 2.
                  Emergency Preparedness
                  The City is included in the County of San Diego’s Multi-Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan.
                  The San Marcos Fire Department administers a Community Emergency Response Team program to as-
                  sist and supplement professional emergency responders during emergencies or unusual events.

6.2 	 Background and Structure
Earthquakes and Other Geologic Hazards
                                                                             6
Geologic hazards are those that may be activated with or without
                                                                             SAFETY ELEMENT
an earthquake due to some combination of geologic conditions,
groundwater, and the weather. In the City, soil and geologic unit
instability, and liquefaction carry the most risks to property and
population.
Geologic Hazards
Geologic and seismic conditions in San Marcos are similar to
conditions in other local municipalities that lie inland from the
coast and west of the mountains of Cleveland National Forest,
and that generally border Interstate 15 (e.g., Vista, Rancho
Santa Fe, Escondido, Rancho Bernardo, and Poway). This geo-
graphic area is characterized by several million years of regional
uplift and consequent erosion of basement rock formations.
Additionally, the young alluvium and minor older alluvium fill
characteristic of the area is evident in Twin Oaks Valley, San
Marcos Creek, and secondary tributaries.
Landslides, Mudflows, and General Slope Instability
Slope instability under non-earthquake (static) conditions is
considered to be a potentially significant hazard in the hillside
and mountain areas of San Marcos. As shown in Figure 6-1, most
of the City is in either the low soil-slip category (bedrock/hillside
areas) or the zero soil-slip category (alluvial deposit/valley areas).
Scattered moderate susceptibility areas are found in the bedrock
areas, mainly in the Questhaven/La Costa, Lake San Marcos,
Barham/Discovery, eastern College, and southwestern Twin Oaks
Valley neighborhoods. Figure 6-1 is based on regional informa-
tion; it is not a substitute for geologic and geotechnical studies
for specific projects. The delineated soil-slip and bedrock areas
are not necessarily unstable, but Figure 6-1 provides an opportu-
nity to consider these areas when planning for new development
or redevelopment.
Unstable Soils
Unstable soils include expansive, compressible, erodible, cor-
rosive, or collapsible soils. Collapsible and expansive soil issues
are recognized in standard geotechnical investigations mandated
by the City and other regulatory bodies. Expansive soils are
associated with soils, alluvium, and bedrock formations that
contain clay minerals susceptible to expansion under wetting
conditions and contraction under drying conditions. The nature
of the local alluvium should make expansive clays less likely;
available geotechnical reports indicate that expansive clays do
occur in these formations and in the Santiago Formation in the
hillside areas and the upper reaches of canyons where colluvium
is present (Wilson Geosciences 2009).
                       City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN | Safety | Page 6-3
6                Collapsible soils have the potential to be impacted by the weight
                 of overlying structures, which can cause damage to foundations
                 and walls. The most likely locations for collapsible soils are the
                 current and pre-development washes and drainage channels,

                 particularly the San Marcos Creek Valley and Twin Oaks Valley
                 drainages.
                 Shallow Groundwater
                 No existing database is known to delineate current or historic
                 shallow groundwater within the City. However, based on data
                 from a few geotechnical bore holes in the vicinity of San Marcos
                 Creek, there are areas within the alluvial channels and creeks
                 where unconfined groundwater appears to exist at depths rang-
                 ing from 3 to 20 feet. In such areas, shallow water levels should
                 be considered on a project-by-project basis to determine how to
                 best implement construction or exploration programs.
                 Surface (open cuts and pits) or underground (tunnels, vertical
                 large-diameter borings) excavations can encounter varying
                 degrees of shallow groundwater inflows, which may be perched
                 and local, or widespread in extent. This may affect excavation
                 stability, and, therefore, short- and long-term safety for workers
                 and post-construction stability of structures. The degree of hazard
                 for the City is generally low, but should be determined on a case-
                 by-case basis if projects requiring deep excavations are proposed
                 in the alluvial areas, particularly immediately adjacent to San
                 Marcos Creek and the La Costa Meadows area.
                 Seismic Hazards
                 Seismic hazards are those associated with an earthquake, with
                 significant effects generally triggered at a magnitude (M) 5.0 or
                 greater, although lesser magnitude earthquakes have activated
                 hazards and caused damage. Like all of Southern California, San
                 Marcos is subject to potential ground shaking in the event of an
                 earthquake.
                 No active or potentially active faults traverse the City; however,
                 nonactive faults may be present, and potential surface and blind
                 thrust faults may impact the City. Earthquake ground-shaking
                 potential from surface faults in the region is relatively low.
                 Non-ground-shaking impacts of an earthquake include potential
                 liquefaction in the abundant young alluvium areas and/or
                 potential dam failure inundation flooding, which is an issue for
                 relatively small but populous portions of the City.
                 San Marcos has experienced mild to moderate earthquake shak-
                 ing in the historic past; however, the City generally has a lower
                 potential for strong ground shaking than other areas of Southern
                 California. Instrumentally recorded events centered some

                                                    Newport–Inglewood Fault zone to the north and the Vallecitos
                                                    and San Miguel Fault system to the south; it may also connect
                                                    to the Descanso and Aqua Blanca Faults. The Rose Canyon Fault
                                                    extends inland from La Jolla Cove, south through Rose Canyon,
                                                    along the east side of Mission Bay, and out into San Diego Bay.
                                                    “New” Rose Canyon fault lines occur off the coast of Southern

                 earthquake event of M5.3 on the Thirtymile Bank Blind Thrust
SAFETY ELEMENT
                 Fault suggests that a larger event is possible on the Oceanside
                 Blind Thrust (OBT) Fault, possibly closer to the City than the
                 1800 earthquake (Wilson Geosciences 2009). Research scenarios
                 suggest ground motions, intensity, and damaging effects could
                 be much more severe than the 1986 event.
                 Fault Rupture
                 Two types of fault impacts are important to consider for the City.
                 Fault-generated earthquake ground shaking has the greatest po-
                 tential for critical impact due to its generally widespread effects
                 and the severe damage it could cause, resulting in economic
                 losses and injury to or death of people. The other important
                 potential impact relates to ground movement such as co-seismic
                 uplift, ground lurching, ground cracking, and liquefaction. While
                 these other ground movement effects are more limited in extent
                 than strong ground shaking, the impacts on structures and the
                 public can be severe depending on the size and proximity of the
                 causative earthquake. In cases where earthquakes are large or
                 hypocenters are shallow, ground rupture can occur along the
                 source fault plane where it intersects the Earth’s surface.
                 Currently no Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone (APEFZ) exists
                 within the City (California Geological Survey 2011a). Surface
                 faults and a blind thrust fault are documented outside of the
                 boundaries of San Marcos, each having different potential im-
                 pacts and levels of available information regarding their degree
                 of activity and damage-generating potential. Three short, nearly
                 northeast/southwest- and northwest/southeast-trending “non-
                 active” surface fault segments have been identified within the
                 planning area (Figure 6-2) at the far southeastern edge. The 2010
                 State Fault Map indicates that these faults are pre-quaternary
                 in age (older than 1.6 million years), suggesting that they are
                 non-active and not an earthquake or ground rupture threat
                 (California Geological Survey 2011b). These surface faults are not
                 associated with a system of surface faults with demonstrated
                 or known potential activity. These faults have been designated
                 “non-active,” which is not considered a permanent classification,
                 since detailed studies have not been conducted. The potential for
                 surface fault rupture on these faults is considered to be very low.
                 If fault movement were to occur on any of these faults, which is
                 unlikely, it could be in conjunction with a large earthquake on the
                 OBT Fault.
                 The OBT Fault is a buried low-angle fault below or adjacent to
                 the offshore Newport–Inglewood Fault zone. The location and
                 characteristics of the OBT Fault are much less well known than
                 for surface faults. The OBT Fault may have an onshore projec-
                 tion that underlies the City and surrounding communities. If
                 City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN | Safety | Page 6-8

movement were to occur on a buried fault, the most likely result
would be regional uplift. Several studies suggest that the OBT
Fault may be capable of generating large earthquakes (Wilson
Geosciences 2009).
                                                                            6
                                                                            SAFETY ELEMENT
Liquefaction
Liquefaction is the sudden loss of the soil’s supporting strength
due to groundwater filling and lubricating the spaces between
soil particles as a result of groundshaking. The results of ground
failures associated with liquefaction can include an array of
effects ranging from simple ground cracking to complex lateral
spreading landslides. The three key factors that indicate whether
an area is potentially susceptible to liquefaction are (1) severe
ground shaking, (2) shallow groundwater (within 40 feet of the
ground surface), and (3) low-density granular deposits (mainly
sand). Other quantitative estimates of liquefaction potential
require specific data from geotechnical borings and laboratory
testing. Previous studies of San Marcos indicate that where allu-
vium is sufficiently loose and groundwater is sufficiently shallow,
strong earthquake shaking could cause sediments to lose bearing
capacity, resulting in severe settlement of surface facilities and,
in some cases, uplift of buried structures such as large pipelines
(Wilson Geosciences 2009).
The County of San Diego (2004) delineated limited suspected
liquefaction-prone areas within the City based on modeling on
a regional scale. This delineation identified areas (northern Twin
Oaks Valley, southern San Marcos Creek, and the drainage area
south of Palomar Community College) for potential liquefac-
tion. It is likely that the liquefaction-prone area boundaries lie
somewhere in between, being less extensive than what the City
mapped in the 1980s and more extensive than what regional
modeling suggests. Without better knowledge of groundwater
location and depth, these liquefaction-prone areas cannot be
further identified at this time. All other factors being equal (same
earthquake, same geologic formation), liquefaction susceptibility
levels may be higher where groundwater is shallower.
Liquefaction areas have potential land use constraints, and
liquefaction assessments must be made for projects that are
substantial in scope or involve grading or underground park-
ing. The depth and intensity of study will vary depending on
the location and type of the project. Due to the lack of specific
geologic and engineering properties and groundwater depth data
for San Marcos, areas of liquefaction potential can be assumed
to correspond to the extent of the geologic formations of alluvial
flood plain deposits (Qa) and young alluvial flood plain deposits
(Qya); however, this should be considered approximate. These
guidelines should be used as general, not absolute, planning
guidelines to indicate where assessments are needed for planned

6                structures or possibly for upgrades to existing critical, essential,
                 and high-occupancy facilities. Potential liquefaction-induced
                 lateral spread landslides are more of a concern in the areas
                 adjacent to the active San Marcos Creek and Twin Oaks Valley
SAFETY ELEMENT
                 channels.
                 Earthquake-Induced Landslides
                 Areas with known landslides and bedrock formations more sus-
                 ceptible to landslides and surficial (soil-slip) failures are the most
                 susceptible to earthquake-induced landslides. Figure 6-1 shows
                 the areas designated by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) as
                 having susceptibility to soil-slips or surficial landslides or debris
                 flows in combination with groundwater and hydrological units
                 that may lead to soil failure (Wilson Geosciences 2009).
                 Flooding and Inundation Hazards
                 Human-made water reservoirs and lakes located within the City
                 or Sphere of Influence have the potential to fail and release
                 floodwaters to local areas in cases where water is impounded
                 behind them. Twin Oaks Valley and San Marcos Creek tributaries
                 form the San Marcos area groundwater basin under the City;
                 historically shallow groundwater is reported within the areas of
                 young alluvium. Where groundwater is shallow and sediments
                 are sufficiently loose, large earthquakes may cause liquefaction
                 of the alluvium and settlement of overlying built structures.
                 FEMA Floodway and Floodplains
                 Some areas of San Marcos are determined to be within a Federal
                 Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-designated 100-year
                 floodplain, 100-year floodway, and/or 500-year floodplain, as
                 shown in Figure 6-3. The City participates in the Federal Flood
                 Insurance Study to determine the mandatory insurance neces-
                 sary for identified properties. Federal Insurance Rate Maps
                 (FIRMs) designate flood areas that have a 1 percent annual
                 chance of flooding; these are in the “100-year floodplain.”
                 FEMA-designated 100-year floodplains and floodways are
                 associated with San Marcos Creek and its tributaries such as the
                 north branch in Twin Oaks Valley, the east branch east of City Hall
                 and south of Mission Road, and Lake San Marcos and a smaller
                 drainage west of Palomar Community College, which extends
                 south beyond State Route 78 (Figure 6-3). Additional zones in the
                 periphery of these flood areas may pose a flood risk, but, since
                 they are outside of the designated 1 percent annual chance flood
                 area, they are not mapped and do not require additional flood
                 insurance. Floodplains and areas of flood susceptibility are sub-
                 ject to change as development occurs. Existing planning efforts
                 will be supported by pending and future development permits to
                 facilitate flood management channelization improvements such
                 as in the San Marcos Creek District Specific Plan.

                 poses, including ensuring adequate water supply reserves, providing
                 recreational opportunities, and providing non-potable water for irriga-
                 tion. No dam or reservoir structures outside of the planning area was

                 identified that could pose a dam inundation flooding threat to the City.
                 In the event that leakage would occur from the water storage structures
                 discussed here, water release would be incremental and not flood-like.
                 Fires
                 Urban Fires
                 The San Marcos Fire Department (SMFD) is the agency responsible
                 for providing emergency services in the event of a fire emergency. The
                 department protects a diverse community consisting of large areas of
                 residential development, commercial/retail centers, office buildings,
                 industrial parks, and educational centers such as California State
                 University San Marcos and Palomar Community College. Urban fires in
                 the community have the potential to cause significant loss of life and
                 property; however, improvements in architecture, building design, con-
                 struction materials, and emergency response reduce the likelihood of
                 catastrophic occurrences. For additional information regarding service
                 levels and facilities for fire and emergency services within the City, see
                 Chapter 2, Land Use and Community Design Element, of this document.
                 Wildland Fires
                 Wildland urban interface (WUI) areas have steep slopes, limited
                 precipitation, and plenty of available fuel/combustible plant material.
                 In an effort to reduce the threat posed by wildland fire events, the
                 SMFD completed a comprehensive assessment of WUI fire hazards and
                 prepared a Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) and Hazard Risk
                 Assessment (HRA) for the San Marcos community and unincorporated
                 areas in the San Marcos Fire Protection District. This assessment and
                 the CWPP/HRA identify areas as WUI study areas to prioritize hazardous
                 fuel removal and reduce overall community fire risks (SMFD 2007).
                 The SMFD has mapped WUI areas denoting community hazard levels
                 as part of the HRA; see Figure 6-4. Brush management is required to
                 be undertaken in these areas where urban development interfaces
                 with open space so that fire fuel loads and potential fire hazards can
                 be reduced. The CWPP/HRA also identifies actions to protect one or
                 more WUI study area neighborhoods, and identifies training, public
                 education, and local resource needs (SMFD 2007). The CWPP meets the
                 requirements of the federal Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA) of
                 2003 for community fire planning (SMFD 2007).
                 In accordance with the CWPP and the Zoning Ordinance, all new
                 development in identified community hazard areas requires a Fuel
                 Management Plan. This includes clearing and maintaining defensible
                 space of 100 to 150 feet around structures, depending on the structure
                 and vegetation type. Safety development and fuel reduction zones
                 will continue to be addressed by developers and SMFD as outlined

                                                  that expose residents to certain risks associated with hazardous
                                                  materials. The use of combustibles and the use, transport, and
                                                  disposal of hazardous and toxic waste pose certain risks to the
                                                  general population. Hazardous materials require special methods
                                                  of disposal, storage, and treatment. The release of hazardous
                                                  materials requires an immediate response to protect human

                                                  of Environmental Health (DEH) Hazardous Materials Department
                                                  (HMD). The DEH HMD has been certified by Cal-EPA as the

                                                  hazardous materials used, stored, and disposed of in the City. All
                                                  business license applicants are required to complete a Hazardous

                 the risk to public health and safety and the environment, taking
                 the necessary steps to mitigate these hazards, ensuring adequate
                 cleanup of the area, and conducting necessary enforcement
                 activities. DEH-HIRT provides advice and technical support to the
                 first responder, but does not assume scene management respon-
                 sibilities. The first responder or appropriate agency maintains full
                 control and authority over the incident, and retains responsibility
                 for release of public information concerning the incident. DEH-
                 HIRT responds jointly with the SMFD to investigate and mitigate
                 chemically related emergencies and complaints (County of San
                 Diego 2007).
                 The City maintains a list of environmental consultants who can
                 prepare reports, respond to waste spills, remove waste through
                 remediation, and transport hazardous waste to the appropriate
                 waste disposal facilities.
                 Future redevelopment of existing or potential contaminated sites
                 could be impaired unless adequate remediation of such sites oc-
                 curs. Redevelopment proposals will continue to be reviewed by
                 the City to determine the presence and extent of contamination
                 affecting project sites. Remediation of contaminated sites will
                 continue to be required of developers, as necessary, to protect
                 public health and safety in accordance with the recommenda-
                 tions of appropriate environmental assessments and consistent
                 with all applicable regulations and standards. Public facilities
                 such as schools, hospitals, and fire stations are not located in or
                 near hazardous material remediation sites. Siting new facilities
                 is governed by local and state agencies to ensure that public
                 facilities are developed in safe and appropriate locations.
                 Emergency Preparedness
                 All urban areas are faced with the possibility of major disasters
                 that threaten life, safety, and property. The City uses a Standard
                 Emergency Management System (SEMS) for coordinating all
                 local emergencies. The basic framework of SEMS incorporates
                 the use of the Incident Command System, multi-agency or inter-
                 agency coordination, the state’s master mutual aid agreement
                 and mutual aid system, the operational area concept, and the
                 Operational Area Satellite Information System. In conformance
                 with the SEMS, the City maintains an extensive emergency
                 operations plan, the San Marcos Emergency Operations Plan
                 (EOP), which governs the operations of the City during a disas-
                 ter. If necessary, the City can open and staff the San Marcos
                 Emergency Operations Center. In the event of a major emer-
                 gency, the Emergency Operations Center coordinates resources,
                 assists in mitigating the emergency, and allocates emergency
                 resources and relief aid.

                        land use actions. Specifically, Review Area 1 encompasses
                        locations exposed to aircraft noise levels of 55 decibels
                        (dB) Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) or greater,
                        along with safety zones established in the ALUCP.
                     •	 Review Area 2 consists of locations beyond Review Area 1
                        but within the airspace protection and/or overflight notifi-
                                                                                          McClellan-Palomar Airport is located 2.5 miles

                        uses within Review Area 2.
                 As shown in Figure 6-5, Review Area 2 encompasses approxi-
                 mately two-thirds of the City; its boundaries fall north and south
                 of State Route 78 and extend eastward to Interstate 15. No
                 portion of the planning area lies within Review Area 1.
                 The ALUCP establishes six safety zones within the AIA to evalu-
                 ate the safety compatibility of land use actions. These safety
                 zone boundaries are based on general aviation aircraft accident
                 location data, runway configuration, and aircraft operational
                 procedures. No portion of the City lies within these established
                 safety zones (SDCRAA 2009).
                 Hazard-Related Planning, Response, and Recovery
                 The City participates in local and county-level plans to prepare
                 for and respond to disaster emergencies. Local emergencies
                 are handled using the SEMS. All safety, fire, and Emergency
                 Operations Center staff are trained to respond to emergencies.
                 Additional planning and response duties belong to the Building
                 Division, cooperating jurisdictions, and Community Emergency
                 Response Team (CERT) members.
                                                                                          The Sheriff’s Department maintains a helipad in
                 Emergency Operations Plan                                                the City.

                 approved the EOP, a regional planning document, for local
                 jurisdiction planning in 2007. The City adopted an EOP in March
                 2009 to plan for and address response to a moderate evacuation
                 emergency scenario. The EOP takes into account the Operational
                 Area Hazard Mitigation Plan, employs local safety and emer-
                 gency staff resources, uses the SEMS, and provides evacuation
                 planning. Strategies of the EOP for evacuation planning include
                 identification of evacuation points and corresponding evacuation
                 routes, traffic signal coordination and timing to direct evacuation
                 flow, closure of on- and off-ramps to local highways, and intel-
                 ligent transportation systems (City of San Marcos 2009).

6                Community Emergency Response Team (CERT)
                 The Department of Homeland Security urges communities to train and
                 prepare themselves by establishing a CERT program. The program
                 educates people about disaster preparedness and trains them in basic
SAFETY ELEMENT
                 disaster response skills, such as fire safety, light search and rescue, and
                 disaster medical operations. In the event of a disaster, CERT members
                 can use their training to attend to themselves and their families,
                 neighbors, and coworkers.
                 The San Marcos CERT program is administered by the SMFD. Its mis-
                 sion is to assist and supplement professional emergency responders
                 during emergencies or unusual events. The SMFD, in partnership with
                 Palomar Community College, sponsors CERT classes. Graduates of the
                 course can apply to become a member of the San Marcos CERT Team.
                 San Marcos CERT Team members are issued free CERT equipment kits,
                 periodically attend training refresher sessions, and participate in rescue
                 drills with the SMFD (City of San Marcos 2011).
                 Existing Evacuation Routes
                 According to the City’s EOP, evacuation routes are determined based
                 on event type, location, and variables of the emergency, in coordina-
                 tion with shelter facilities. Emergency communication systems will be
                 used to provide information on event-specific evacuation routes, and
                 the Traffic Management Center will help to manage evacuation routes
                 through traffic control systems. For this reason, official evacuation
                 routes have not been established; however, there are several main
                 thoroughfares that would serve as primary evacuation corridors for
                 most of the planning area in the event of an emergency. North/south
                 roads that should remain relatively open and passable are Twin Oaks
                 Valley Road (away from State Route 78), Las Posas Road, Rancho Santa
                 Fe Road, Woodland Parkway, and Nordhal Road. Similarly, east/west
                 streets are Mission Road, South Sante Fe Road, Barham Drive, Craven
                 Road, West San Marcos Boulevard (away from State Route 78), Borden
                 Road, Buena Creek Road, Knob Hill Road, and Montiel Road (Wilson
                 Geosciences 2009). Existing and future road/bridge crossings of San
                 Marcos Creek, including crossings at Discovery Street, Via Vera Cruz,
                 and Borden Road, would provide vital connectivity between areas of
                 San Marcos. Other major circulation thoroughfares identified in Figure
                 3-1 of the Mobility Element would also be appropriate for use as evacu-
                 ation routes, depending on the location of the emergency event.
                 Neighborhood Safety
                 Law Enforcement and Criminal Activity
                 San Marcos sets high standards for neighborhood safety and has
                 consistently reported low crime rates within the region. The City is com-
                 mitted to promoting and maintaining a high level of safety for residents
                 and businesses by providing quality law enforcement protection and
                 crime prevention programs.

Council, and other City departments, and are designed to protect the
public from harm. Sheriff’s deputies are responsible for general patrol,
traffic enforcement, criminal investigations, and other law-enforcement-
related duties. Maintaining one of the largest Sheriff’s contracts in the
county has resulted in a low crime rate for San Marcos. In addition
to personnel assigned to the San Diego County Sheriff’s San Marcos
Station, the City has immediately available the entire scope of services
offered by the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department, as discussed
under the Emergency Preparedness section above.
The City maintains local community efforts that supplement the
Sheriff’s Department with the Crime Prevention Unit. Local community-
oriented policing programs run by the Crime Prevention Unit are
free of charge and include Neighborhood Watch, Residential Security
Consultation, Operation Identification, and parking enforcement. The
Public Works Department assists in these efforts with graffiti abatement.
This partnership between county and local law enforcement helps
residents of all ages take a proactive approach to crime prevention and
protection within their own community.

Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)
The safety of a place is directly related to design, orientation, and
access of the individual space. The use and promotion of the Crime
Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) program in the
design or redevelopment of projects and buildings could be a proactive
tool in preventing crime for San Marcos.
CPTED development concepts are based on the premise that proper de-
sign and effective use of the built environment can lead to an improved
quality of life by reducing fear and crime incidences. Traditional policing
to maintain security within San Marcos will be assisted by CPTED
guidelines to create a safer environment.
CPTED is a multi-disciplinary method of using physical and psychologi-
cal strategies to deter crime. It incorporates four broad design and
usage concepts. Development and redevelopment of certain areas
within the City allows the opportunity to incorporate CPTED principles.
Possible planning techniques and strategies associated with CPTED
are included below. As this is not intended to be a comprehensive list
of strategies, the following represent a sample of the types of CPTED-
suggested actions:

                     •	 Access control. Access control is characterized by clearly      Photo credit: City of San Marcos
                        demarcating public areas from private ones so that access
                        to potential targets is reduced and perception of risk to
                        potential offenders is increased.
                             •	 Limit the number of access points into a building.
                             •	 Control access by creating both real and perceptual
                                barriers to entry and movement. Clearly mark the
                                transitions from public to private spaces, and use
                                signs, fences, borders, art, and landscaping to pre-
                                vent or discourage access into unmonitored areas.
                     •	 Territoriality. Territoriality fosters a sense of defensible
                        space, encouraging individuals to take ownership and
                        control of their environment. Potential offenders will then
                        be discouraged to engage in criminal activities nearby.
                     •	 Maintenance. Maintenance promotes the frequent upkeep
                        of CPTED measures to maintain surveillance, access
                        control, and territoriality effectiveness. While crime in San
                        Marcos is relatively low, the application of CPTED guide-
                        lines in the existing built environment can further reduce
                        the opportunity for, and the likelihood of, crime.
                             •	 Ensure buildings, yards, gardens, sidewalks, and
                                other features are well maintained, clean, and in
                                working order, which is a sign of guardianship.
                 San Marcos will continue to encourage the use of CPTED in the
                 design and redevelopment of projects and buildings to take a
                 proactive approach to crime prevention. For more information

6.3 	 Safety Plan
San Marcos faces natural and human-related hazards including
limited earthquake ground shaking, urban and wildland fires,
                                                                            6
                                                                            SAFETY ELEMENT
geologic hazards and the use of hazardous materials. Reduction
of these risks through preparedness is essential in continuing the
City of San Marcos’ guiding theme of providing “A Healthy and
Safe Community.”
San Marcos participates in the San Diego County Multi-
Jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan. This planning document
enables the City of San Marcos and County to be consistent with
federal legislation for local hazard planning and assists in meet-
ing eligibility for funding and technical assistance from state and
federal hazard mitigation programs. Continued participation in
the County plan and action efforts identified therein ensures San
Marcos is taking sufficient action in the education and prepara-
tion for such hazards.
To further the effort to provide “a healthy and safe community,”
the City of San Marcos has established goals and policies to
maintain community safety. The Safety Plan identifies specific
issues by background hazard area to provide strategies for the
minimization of hazard potential and protection of the overall
well-being of community residents.
Natural Geologic Hazards
Connection to Guiding Themes
A Healthy and Safe Community
Generally, natural and man-made geologic risks are low for
the City of San Marcos due to the specific geography of and
formations within the City of San Marcos. However, the areas of
Questhaven/ La Costa, Lake San Marcos, Barham/Discovery and
eastern College Area neighborhoods have scattered moderate
susceptibility for landslides, mudflows and instability. Potential
for surface fault rupture and significant ground shaking from
earthquakes is low. Some ground shake is considered reasonable
based on proximity to the Rose Canyon Fault, Oceanside Blind
Thrust (OBT) and Thirtymile Bank Blind Thrust Fault.
It is important that the City of San Marcos and each citizen make
every possible effort to maximize protection to lives and prop-
erty. City of San Marcos implementation of geology engineering
investigations and building code conformance requirements for
all new construction will allow for best development practices
in minimizing the risks of geologic hazards, including specific
risk factors such as shallow water, liquefaction, landslides,
liquefaction-induced lateral spread landslides, and mudflows.
                     City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN | Safety | Page 6-29

6                Goal S-1
                 Reduce risks to the community from earthquakes by regulating new
                 development and redevelopment to prevent the creation of new geo-
                 logic and seismic hazards.
SAFETY ELEMENT
                 Policy S-1.1:	     Reduce the risk of impacts from geologic and seismic
                                    hazards by applying current and proper land use plan-
                                    ning, development engineering, building construction,
                                    and retrofitting requirements.
                 Policy S-1.2:	     Investigate specific groundwater levels and geologic
                                    conditions underlying all new development or rede-
                                    velopment proposals in areas where potential fault
                                    rupture, liquefaction, or other geologic hazards are
                                    suspected.
                 Flooding Hazards
                 Connection to Guiding Themes
                 A Healthy and Safe Community
                 Risk of flooding and inundation due to dam failure is possible due
                 to the prevalence of natural drainage corridors and the presence of
                 human-made water reservoirs within the City of San Marcos. The
                 Business/Industrial District and other productive areas of San Marcos
                 lie within FEMA 100 year flood plains. Dam failures at any of the man-
                 made reservoirs such as the South Lake, Jacks Pond, Discovery Lake,
                 or Lake San Marcos could cause potential downstream inundation and
                 flooding.
                 Goal S-2
                 Minimize the risk to people, property and the environment due to
                 flooding hazards.
                 Policy S-2.1:	     Continue to provide well-maintained regional flood
                                    control facilities capable of accommodating, at a mini-
                                    mum, 100-year storm flows consistent with federal
                                    requirements.
                 Policy S-2.2:	     Require existing private development to take responsi-
                                    bility for maintenance and repair of structures to resist
                                    flood damage.
                 Fire Hazards
                 Connection to Guiding Themes
                 A Healthy and Safe Community
                 The methodology for this assessment uses the Community Wildfire
                 Hazard Rating system (WHR) developed specifically to evaluate com-
                 munities within Wildfire Urban Interface (WUI) for their relative wildfire
                 hazard. The WHR model combines physical infrastructure, and fire
                 behavior components like fuels and topography with the knowledge
                 City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN | Safety | Page 6-30
of the wildfire experts. Conformance with existing ordinances for the
provision and maintenance of separate water systems will continue to
ensure the fire department has adequate resources for emergencies.
Efforts to reduce the occurrence of fires will also be facilitated through
                                                                                   6
                                                                                   SAFETY ELEMENT
Fuel Management Plans and the promotion of appropriate hillside and
yard landscaping measures to reduce risks.
Goal S-3
Minimize injury, loss of life, and damage to property resulting from
structural or wildland fire hazards.
Policy S-3.1:	   Require development to be located, designed and
                 constructed to provide adequate defensibility and
                 reduce the risk of structural loss and life resulting from
                 wildland fires. Development will consider hazards rela-
                 tive to terrain, topography, accessibility and proximity
                 to vegetation. One such provision for development to
                 minimize the risk of structural loss and life shall be the
                 inclusion of overhead fire sprinklers.
Policy S-3.2:	   Provide sufficient level of fire protection service to
                 reduce risk from urban and wildland fire. Advocate and
                 support regional coordination among fire protection
                 and emergency service providers.
Policy S-3.3:	   Require development to provide additional access
                 roads when necessary to provide for safe access of
                 emergency equipment and civilian evacuation concur-
                 rently.
Policy S-3.4:	   Coordinate with fire protection and emergency service
                 providers to assess fire hazards before and after wild-
                 fire events to adjust fire prevention and suppression
                 needs, as necessary, commensurate with both short
                 and long term fire prevention needs.
Hazardous Materials
Connection to Guiding Themes
A Healthy and Safe Community
Certain types of development and uses within San Marcos use, handle,
and dispose of hazardous materials. The City of San Marcos continues
efforts to remediate brownfield sites through redevelopment, promote
safe use and handling of materials, and ensures responsible siting of
facilities through proper land planning and enforcement of existing
regulations.
Updates in proper site design and street access for industrial properties
that could handle hazardous materials will facilitate expedited emer-
gency response and maneuvering throughout San Marcos. Additionally,
continued enforcement of Hazardous Materials disclosures will main-
tain control of, and thus limit the risks of, these materials.

                                    storage of hazardous materials in accordance with ap-
                                    plicable federal, State, and local regulations.
                 Policy S-4.2:	     Require areas of known or suspected contamination
                                    to be assessed prior to reuse or redevelopment. Plan
                                    for reuse of contaminated areas in a manner that is
                                    compatible with the nature of the contamination and
                                    subsequent remediation efforts.
                 Policy S-4.3:	     Require that land uses using hazardous materials be
                                    located and designed to ensure sensitive uses, such
                                    as schools, hospitals, day care centers, and residential
                                    neighborhoods, are protected.
                 Policy S-4.4:	     Avoid locating sensitive uses near established haz-
                                    ardous materials users or industrial areas where
                                    incompatibilities would result, except in cases where
                                    appropriate safeguards have been developed and
                                    implemented.
                 Emergency Preparedness / Neighborhood Safety
                 Connection to Guiding Themes
                 A Healthy and Safe Community
                 The current structure of inter-agency coordination and emergency
                 readiness efforts for the City of San Marcos is sufficient based on
                 hazard risks. Public notification systems, including the City’s AM radio
                 station and Reverse 911, will be utilized in the event of an emergency
                 to notify residents of information such as appropriate evacuation
                 routes. Primary circulation corridors function to connect all parts of the
                 community to potential evacuation routes based on the location of the
                 emergency.
                 An additional crime-deterrent measure, to improve the overall safety
                 and livability of San Marcos, is the adoption of CPTED design guide-
                 lines. Requiring new construction and redevelopment projects to
                 incorporate CPTED design strategies could reduce law enforcement
                 work-load and promote safer places throughout San Marcos.

noise Element
           7.1 	Introduction
           The City of San Marcos aims to protect residents’ quality of life
           by reducing excessive or harmful noise. This includes reducing
           the community’s overall ambient noise by minimizing point-
           source (e.g., construction activities), transportation related (e.g.,
           vehicle, railroad, aircraft traffic) and stationary (e.g., air condi-
           tioner units, loading docks) noise sources. The City sets noise
           standards and identifies measures to control land uses that could
           impact sensitive receptors such as schools, libraries, hospitals,
           parks, and residential neighborhoods. The Noise Element ad-
           dresses these potential issues through the identification of noise
           sources in the community and the development of goals, policies
           and implementation programs that serve to protect San Marcos’
           residents.
           Purpose of the Noise Element
           The Noise Element is a mandatory General Plan Element,
           required by California’s Health and Safety Code Section 46050.01.
           The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify problems and
           noise sources threatening community safety and comfort and to
           establish policies and programs that will limit the community’s
           exposure to excessive noise levels. It addresses both existing
           and foreseeable future noise abatement issues.
           Recognizing that excessive or unusual noise can have significant
           adverse impacts on human health and welfare, the state has
           developed definitive guidelines for determining community
           noise levels and for establishing programs aimed at reducing
           community exposure to noise levels defined to be adverse. Goals
           and policies outlined within the Noise Element are designed to
           reduce the effects of human-caused noise in the community and
           to improve residents’ quality of life by regulating and reducing
           noise, particularly within residential areas and near such noise-
           sensitive land uses as residences, hospitals, convalescent and
           day care facilities, schools, and libraries. The Noise Element also
           provides direction regarding best practices and strategies to
           protect City residents and businesses from severe noise levels.

                The Noise Element consists of three sections, which are
                Background and Structure; Noise Plan/Goals and Policies; and
                Implementation Plan.

                 Noise Highlights and Key Facts
                 The City of San Marcos is a mix of urban and suburban areas, and is subject to
                 numerous noise sources that affect the ambient noise environment, primarily
                 vehicular traffic on major roadways (State Route 78 and major arterials such as
                 County Highway S12 and Mission Road) and rail traffic (North County Transit
                 District Sprinter and freight rail line).
                 The City of San Marcos is located approximately 2.5 miles from the McClellan-
                 Palomar Airport (Airport), within the Airport Influence Area (AIA), but is entirely
                 outside of the present and future 60 dBA CNEL noise contour for the Airport,
                 and therefore, airport operations do not significantly affect the ambient noise
                 environment of San Marcos.
                 Noise measurements were conducted within the City at various points of inter-
                 est and in proximity to major noise sources. These noise measurements will be
                 used to characterize the existing noise environment and avoid noise conflicts
                 with proposed land uses.
                 The City currently uses specific noise standards adopted by the County of San
                 Diego. A noise ordinance with specific quantitative noise standards will be ad-
                 opted in the future to control noise levels throughout the community.
                7.2 	 Background and Structure
                Measuring and Defining Noise
                Evaluating noise is complex. Although sound can be easily
                measured, the perception of noise levels is subjective and the
                physical response to sound complicates the analysis of its effects
                on people and places. Noise levels are measured as decibels (dB)
                on a logarithmic scale that quantifies sound intensity in a man-
                ner similar to the Richter scale used for earthquake magnitudes.
                Thus, doubling the energy of a noise source (e.g., traffic volume)
                would not double the noise level.
                City of San Marcos General Plan | Noise | Page 7-2

Because dB is used to measure sound humans do not perceive
changes in dB equally from one dB level to another. Based on
subjective testing humans cannot perceive changes in noise
levels less than 3 dB, a 5 dB change is clearly noticeable, and a 10
                                                                                 7
                                                                                 noise Element
dB change is roughly twice as loud or quiet (FTA 2006).
Because the human ear is not equally sensitive to all audible
frequencies, a frequency-dependent rating scale was devised
to relate noise to human sensitivity. The A-weighted dB (dBA)
scale performs this compensation by discriminating against
frequencies that are more sensitive to humans. The basis for
compensation is the faintest sound audible to the average ear at
the frequency of maximum sensitivity. The dBA scale is used by
most public agencies for the purpose of regulating environmen-
tal noise.
To provide some perspective on the relative loudness of various
types of noise, Table 7-2 lists common sources of noise and their
approximate noise levels.

Perception of noise is also sensitive to time and duration as
intensity of noise fluctuates over time. Thus, in addition to
instantaneous noise levels, sustained levels measured over
a period of time are used to assess noise limits and impacts.
Noise levels measured over one hour are usually expressed as
dBA Leq, the equivalent 1-hour noise level. Time of day is also an
important factor for noise assessment; noise levels that may be
acceptable during the day may interfere with the ability to sleep

                levels are used. The selection of a proper noise descriptor for a
                specific source depends on the spatial and temporal distribu-

                Many metrics have been developed to account for the way
                humans perceive sound, including the following:
                    •	 Leq (Equivalent Noise Level): Leq represents an average of
                       the sound energy occurring over a specified period of time.

                    •	 Ldn (Day-Night Noise Level): The 24-hour Leq with a 10-dB
                       “penalty” applied during nighttime noise-sensitive hours,
                       10 p.m. through 7 a.m. The Ldn attempts to account for
                       the fact that noise during this specific period of time is
                       a potential source of disturbance with respect to normal
                       sleeping hours.
                    •	 CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level): The cumula-
                       tive noise exposure in a community during a 24‑hour
                       period. Similar to the Ldn described above, but with an

                       between 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., which are typically reserved for
                       relaxation, conversation, reading, and watching television.
                       If the same 24-hour noise data are used, the CNEL is typi-
                       cally 0.5 dB higher than the Ldn.
                    •	 Lmax (Maximum Noise Level): The highest noise level
                       occurring during a specific period of time.
                Properly determining and evaluating potential environmental
                impact on the community is based on assigning the proper noise
                descriptor. Non-transportation noise (e.g., leaf blowers; heating,
                ventilation, and air conditioning; and loading docks) are gener-
                ally analyzed using an hourly standard (Leq) and a maximum
                standard (Lmax). Transportation noise sources (e.g., vehicular
                traffic, aircraft overflights, and train pass-bys) occur as variable,
                individual events throughout the day. Hourly descriptors are not
                effective at describing transportation noise because it occurs at
                all hours. Instead, a 24-hour descriptor (Ldn or CNEL) is used to
                analyze transportation noise sources because the evening and
                nighttime penalties are applied to reflect increased sensitivity to
                noise during the evening and nighttime hours.

                San Marcos Noise Regulation
                Currently, San Marcos relies on the San Diego County Noise
                standards to regulate land use noise compatibility, transportation
                noise, and non-transportation noise. Utilizing the County’s es-
                tablished interior and exterior noise standards, the City can rate
                compatibility using the terms normally acceptable, conditionally
                acceptable, normally unacceptable, and clearly unacceptable.
                The City’s approach to noise regulation uses the CNEL/Ldn noise
                descriptor, are intended to be applicable for land use designa-
                tions exposed to noise levels generated by transportation-related
                sources. Land use compatibility noise exposure limits are gener-
                ally established as:
                    •	 60 dBA CNEL/Ldn for exterior spaces at a majority of land
                       use designations throughout the City.

7               The City’s updated land use compatibility standards for this
                Element (Table 7-3) are based first on the General Plan land
                use designation of the property and secondly on the use of the
                property. For example, within the Residential land use designa-
noise Element
                tion, a multiple-family use exposed to transportation related
                noise would have an exterior noise standard of 60 dBA CNEL/
                Ldn. Noise standards for multiple-family and mixed-use land
                use designations shown in Table 7-4 are higher than those for
                single-family residential areas reflecting a more urban environ-
                ment planned for certain areas of the City. The standards shown
                in Table 7-3 are purposefully general in nature and not every land                            McClellan-Palomar Airport is 2.5 miles from San

Table 7-4
Noise Standards(1)
1. The exterior noise level (as defined in Item 3) standard for Category A shall be 60 CNEL, and the interior
noise level standard for indoor habitable rooms shall be 45 CNEL.
2. The exterior noise level standard for Categories B and C shall be 65 CNEL, and the interior noise level
standard for indoor habitable rooms shall be 45 CNEL.
3. The exterior noise level standard for Categories D and G shall be 65 CNEL and the interior noise level
standard shall be 50 dBA Leq (one hour average).
4. For single-family detached dwelling units, “exterior noise level” is defined as the noise level measured
at an outdoor living area which adjoins and is on the same lot as the dwelling, and which contains at least
the following minimum net lot area: (i) for lots less than 4,000 square feet in area, the exterior area shall
include 400 square feet, (ii) for lots between 4,000 square feet to 10 acres in area, the exterior area shall
include 10 percent of the lot area; (iii) for lots over 10 acres in area, the exterior area shall include 1 acre.
5. For all other residential land uses, “exterior noise level” is defined as noise measured at exterior areas
which are provided for private or group usable open space purposes. “Private Usable Open Space” is de-
fined as usable open space intended for use of occupants of one dwelling unit, normally including yards,
decks, and balconies. When the noise limit for Private Usable Open Space cannot be met, then a Group
Usable Open Space that meets the exterior noise level standard shall be provided. “Group Usable Open
Space” is defined as usable open space intended for common use by occupants of a development, either
privately owned and maintained or dedicated to a public agency, normally including swimming pools,
recreation courts, patios, open landscaped areas, and greenbelts with pedestrian walkways and eques-
trian and bicycle trails, but not including off-street parking and loading areas or driveways
6. For non-residential noise sensitive land uses, exterior noise level is defined as noise measured at the
exterior area provided for public use.
7. For noise sensitive land uses where people normally do not sleep at night, the exterior and interior
noise standard may be measured using either CNEL or the one-hour average noise level determined at
the loudest hour during the period when the facility is normally occupied.
8. The exterior noise standard does not apply for land uses where no exterior use area is proposed or
necessary, such as a library.
9. For Categories E and F the exterior noise level standard shall not exceed the limit defined as “Accept-
able” in by the City, or an equivalent one-hour noise standard.
(1) Exterior Noise Level compatibility guidelines for Land Use Categories A-H are identified in Table 3.11-6, Noise Compatibility
Guidelines.
Note: “Category(ies)” discussed in this table refer to lettered Land Use Category(ies) in Table 7-3 of this Element.

7               The noise contours are used as a guide for land use and develop-
                ment decisions. Land uses located within contours of 60 dBA
                or greater may be noise impacted depending on the use. When
                noise sensitive land uses are proposed within these contours,
noise Element
                an acoustical analysis should be required to ensure that the new
                land use is built within a compatible noise environment. For a
                project to be approved in a noise impacted area, the analysis
                must demonstrate that the project is designed to attenuate noise
                to meet the City’s compatibility guidelines as shown in Table 7-3.
                Transportation Related Noise                                           The SPRINTER light rail provides a high level
                                                                                       of mobility or the community and necessarily
                                                                                       contributes some noise to the environment.
                San Marcos contains a number of transportation-related noise
                sources including freeways, major roadways, and rail lines.            Photo credit: AECOM
                The most significant noise sources in the City are from car and
                truck traffic on State Route 78. Truck traffic is prevalent on State
                Route 78 and major roadways and generates higher noise levels
                relative to other vehicle types that travel on local roadways. In
                the future, State Route 78 and other major roadways in the City
                limits are expected to be expanded and carry more traffic than
                under current conditions. Construction of an HOV lane on State
                Route 78 is planned for the year 2020 and would affect the Level
                of Service capacity of State Route 78. Traffic noise contours
                shown in Figure 7-2 include increases in future traffic volumes
                predicted under the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and from
                the Mobility Element of this General Plan, which would include
                future projects, such as the State Route 78 HOV lane expansion.
                Train traffic on the North County Transit District Sprinter rail
                line, which is generally oriented parallel to State Route 78, is
                another major source of noise in the City. Currently, Sprinter
                traffic is limited to daily passenger transit. However, under the
                RTP the Sprinter line is planned to expand in the San Marcos
                area. Planned expansions include double tracking and increased
                service through the San Marcos corridor, which would increase
                Sprinter noise levels.
                As shown in Figure 7-3, several locations within the City experi-
                ence ambient noise levels above 60 dBA associated Sprinter and
                railroad traffic. When proposed projects are in the planning stage
                for expansion of the railway by the North County Transportation
                District, these projects should be carefully reviewed by the City
                for potential rail quiet zones or wayside horn locations due to the
                proximity of sensitive land (e.g., residential, educational) uses
                near the train tracks.
                Additional transportation noise sources within the City are the
                SDSO helipad and aircraft over flights from neighboring airports.
                As stated under the “Noise Environment” section, the McClellan-
                Palomar Airport existing and future 60 dBA CNEL noise contour
                would not extend onto the City limits and the SDSO helipad
                is located 1,200 feet from any residential areas and used for
                emergency purposes only.

The City has little direct control over noise produced by individual cars
and trucks since the State is responsible for regulating motor vehicle
noise. The most effective way for the City to ensure that transportation
noise does not affect the community is by implementing effective traffic
                                                                                  7

flow and mitigation strategies when roadways, intersections, and other
roadway improvement projects are being designed at the local level.
On the land use side, the City can proactively enforce standards during
the design review process for new development or redevelopment of
potential noise-affected properties. During this stage, the City can work
with the project applicant to identify potential impacts and reasonable
project design features. These features can include, but not be limited
to, noise-sensitive site design, landscaping, use of natural topography,
and the design and construction of noise barriers. Small noise reduc-
tions can also be achieved by use of setbacks, landscaping and architec-
tural design.
Sound walls may not be desirable in some cases, such as intersec-
tions in commercial areas where visibility and access are important.
Additionally, effective acoustical design features in new development
can provide additional interior noise reduction.

In addition to transportation related noise, excessive noise generated
by non-transportation sources, such as commercial and industrial
uses, and restaurants and bars (nightlife), have the potential to impact
sensitive receptors and standards for these land uses vary based on
property zoning. Noise is also associated with construction activity,
manufacturing or business operations, and everyday activities in San
Marcos neighborhoods, such as leaf blowing, dog barking, and lawn
mowing. Analysis of potential noise impacts during the site design
review process, compliance with CEQA, and enforcement of the City
noise ordinance are the best means to protect sensitive receptors from
non-transportation noise.
When reviewing proposed projects, the City should consider noise
generation and potential impacts to surrounding development. New
development can be made compatible with the noise environment
by using noise and land use compatibility standards and the Future
Noise Contour Diagram (see Figure 7-2) as a guide for planning and
development decisions. During the project design review process, the
City can work with the project applicant to Identify of potential impacts
and reasonable mitigation measures. For example, the City can require
an acoustical analysis for projects that will potentially generate noise
that would affect sensitive receptors. These mitigation measures can
include, but not be limited to, acoustically treated and/or quiet designs
for furnaces, fans, motors, compressors, valves, pumps and other
mechanical equipment. The City may also require limited delivery hours
and/or hours of operation in order to reduce impacts to adjacent sensi-
tive uses. In addition, all City departments must comply with State and
federal OSHA standards. Any new equipment or vehicles purchased by
the City will comply with local, State and federal noise standards.

                Certain areas of San Marcos are subject to high levels of noise
                from one or more of the following sources: freeways and arterial
noise Element
                roadways, construction activities and machinery in industrial
                areas, railroads, and aircraft. All of these noise sources impact
                the quality of life within the City. Considering noise sources in
                the planning process, identifying the noise impacts of potential
                development and transportation projects, and planning accord-
                ingly are effective methods of minimizing the impacts of noise
                on residents. The goals, policies, and implementation programs
                of the Noise Element address three issues: (1) noise and land
                use compatibility; (2) transportation related noise; and (3) non-
                transportation related noise including construction, maintenance,
                and nuisance noise.
                Noise and Land Use Compatibility
                Connection to Guiding Themes
                A Healthy and Safe Community
                Land use directly affects noise compatibility. Consideration of
                the sources and recipients of noise early in the land use planning
                and development process can be an effective way to reduce
                the impact of noise on the community. Consideration should
                be given to both reducing noise in severely impacted areas
                through rehabilitative improvements, through re-use and/or
                redevelopment, and avoiding potential noise impacts through
                effective land use planning and design. Future and proposed land
                uses should be compatible with existing and forecasted future
                noise levels. Incompatible land use noise generators should
                incorporate noise attenuation and/or control measures as part
                of project design to reduce noise levels to an acceptable interior
                level or lower, as required by state regulations (CCR Title 24) for
                residential uses.
                Goal N-1
                Promote a pattern of land uses compatible with current and
                future noise levels.
                Policy N-1.1: 	    Address the potential for excessive noise levels
                                   when making land use planning decisions in ac-
                                   cordance with Table 7-3 Land Use Compatibility
                                   Noise Standards.
                Policy N-1.2: 	    Ensure that acceptable noise levels are main-
                                   tained near noise-sensitive uses.
                Policy N-1.3: 	    Incorporate design features into residential land
                                   use projects that can be used to shield residents
                                   from excessive noise. Design features may
                                   include, but are not limited to: berms, walls,
                                   and sound attenuating architectural design and
                                   construction methods.

Policy N-1.5: 	   Require an acoustical study for proposed
                  developments in areas where the existing and
                  projected noise level exceeds or would exceed
                  the Normally Acceptable levels identified in
                  Table 7-3.
Mixed Use Development
Policy N-1.6: 	   Require the design and construction of buildings
                  to reduce the effect of commercial noise within
                  indoor areas of residential components of the
                  mixed-use development.
Policy N-1.7: 	   Through site planning techniques, noise reduc-
                  tion features, and enforcement, minimize non-
                  residential noise impacts on residential uses.
Policy N-1.8: 	   Ensure residents in mixed-use developments
                  located adjacent to commercial or retail related
                  land uses are notified that they could be affected
                  by noise from adjacent uses.
Transportation Related Noise
Connection to Guiding Themes
A Healthy and Safe Community
Transportation related noise primarily comes from three sources
in San Marcos. Vehicular traffic is the most common source of
noise experienced throughout the City of San Marcos. Primary
sources of traffic noise include State Route 78 and major arteri-
als. Train noise currently experienced within the City results from
the locomotive engines and warning horns associated with rail
operations. These daily operations tend to produce periodic
high short-term noise levels that can be a source of annoyance
to nearby sensitive uses. Although no airports or airfields are
located in San Marcos, noise generated by aircraft overflights
can be noticeable through the central portion of the City. Aircraft
operations associated with McClellan-Palomar Airport, and
the Camp Pendleton Marine Corp Air Station, and the Sheriff’s
helipad use the airspace above the City in arrival and departure
operations.
Goal N-2
Control transportation-related noise from traffic, rail, and avia-
tion sources near noise sensitive land uses.

Commercial and industrial land uses have the potential to gener-
ate noise that can be considered intrusive to sensitive land uses.
Depending on the type of activities associated with a commercial
or industrial operation, noise sources could involve mechanical
equipment, loading and unloading of vehicles and trucks, as
well as amplified or unamplified communications. The level and
intrusiveness of the noise generated also vary depending on
the size of the facility, type of business, hours of operation, and
location relative to noise-sensitive land uses.
Another source of non-transportation noise comes from
construction operations and maintenance vehicles, such as
refuse trucks and parking lot sweepers, which generate noise
throughout the City. Although these types of noise sources tend
to be short term, temporary, and limited, they can be a source
of annoyance, especially during the late night or early morning
hours.
Goal N-3
Control non-transportation-related noise from commercial, in-
dustrial, construction, and other sources on noise sensitive land
uses.
Policy N-3.1:	    When adjacent to noise sensitive receptors,
                  require developers and contractors to employ
                  noise reduction techniques during construction
                  and maintenance operations.
Policy N-3.2: 	   Limit the hours of construction and maintenance
                  operations located adjacent to noise-sensitive
                  land uses.
Policy N-3.3: 	   Limit the allowable hours of operations and de-
                  liveries for commercial, mixed-use, and indus-
                  trial uses located adjacent to residential areas.
Policy N-3.4: 	   Avoid excessive noise of commercial and indus-
                  trial land uses through site and building design
                  features.
Policy N-3.5: 	   Require industrial land uses to locate vehicular
                  traffic and operations away from adjacent resi-
                  dential areas as much as possible.

Housing ELEMENT
    8.1	Introduction
    The Housing Element provides the City with a coordinated and comprehensive strategy
    for promoting the production of safe, decent, and affordable housing for all community
    residents.
    8.1.1 Purpose of the Housing Element
    The Housing Element is a mandatory General Plan element. It identifies ways in which the
    housing needs of existing and future residents can be met. State law requires that all cit-
    ies adopt a Housing Element and describe in detail the necessary contents of the housing
    element. This Housing Element responds to those requirements, and responds specifically
    to conditions and policy directives unique to San Marcos. This Housing Element provides
    policy guidance for the 2013-2021 planning period for jurisdictions within the San Diego
    Association of Governments (SANDAG) region.
    The California Legislature has identified the attainment of a decent home and suitable
    living environment for every Californian as the state’s main housing goal. Recognizing the
    important part that local planning programs play in pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has
    mandated that all cities and counties prepare a Housing Element as part of their compre-
    hensive general plans. Section 65581 of the California Government Code reflects the legis-
    lative intent for mandating that each city and county prepare a Housing Element:
          a.	To assure that counties and cities recognize their responsibilities in contributing to
          the attainment of the State housing goal.
          b.	To assure that counties and cities will prepare and implement housing elements
          which, along with federal and State programs, will move toward attainment of the
          state housing goals.
          c.	To recognize that each locality is best capable of determining what efforts are re-
          quired by it to contribute to the attainment of the State housing goal, provided such a
          determination is compatible with the State housing goal and regional housing needs.
          d.	To ensure that each local government cooperates with other local governments in
          order to address regional housing needs.
    8.1.2 Scope and Content of the Housing Element
    The Housing Element covers the planning period of April 30, 2013 through April 30, 2021,
    identifies strategies and programs to: 1) encourage the development of a variety of hous-
    ing opportunities; 2) provide housing opportunities for persons of lower and moderate
    incomes; 3) preserve the quality of the existing housing stock
                                                    City of San Marcos General Plan | Housing | Page 8-1

in San Marcos; 4) minimize governmental constraints; and 5) promote equal
housing opportunities for all residents.
Toward these ends, the Housing Element consists of:
    •    An introduction of the scope and purpose of the Housing Element
    •    An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
    •    A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints
         to meeting the City’s identified housing needs
    •    An evaluation of land, administrative, and financial resources available to
         address the housing goals
    •    A review of past accomplishments under the previous Housing Element
    •    A Housing Plan to address the identified housing needs, including housing
         goals, policies, and programs
8.1.3 Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The San Marcos General Plan consists of the following elements:
    •    Land Use and Community Design
    •    Mobility
    •    Conservation and Open Space
    •    Parks, Recreation and Community Heath
    •    Safety
    •    Noise
    •    Housing
When any element of the General Plan is amended, the City will review the Housing
Element and if necessary, amend it to ensure continued consistency among
elements. State law requires that the Safety and Conservation Elements include an
analysis and policies regarding flood hazard and management information upon
revisions to the Housing Element.             The City of San Marcos completed a
comprehensive General Plan update in 2012. As such, information on flood hazard
and management is up to date. Moving forward, the City will ensure compliance
with this requirement by reviewing its Safety and Conservation Elements upon
future Housing Element revisions.
The Housing Element contains policies and programs that are consistent with policy
directives in all other General Plan elements. Hazards, the natural environment,
and infrastructure considerations discussed in detail in the General Plan relate
specifically in the context of potential constraints to future residential development.
Development policies contained in the Land Use and Community Design Element—
which establishes the location, type, density, and distribution of local land uses,
including housing—most directly relate to the Housing Element. The policies and
priorities of both the Housing and Land Use and Community Design Elements have
been carefully balanced to maintain internal consistency.
Two of the key topics addressed in the General Plan are smart growth and mixed
use development. Smart growth advocates compact, transit-oriented, walkable,
bicycle-friendly land use patterns, including neighborhood schools, complete
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-2

streets, and mixed-use development with a range of housing choices. Specifically,
goals in the Land Use and Community Design Element aim to:
    •  Achieve a balanced distribution and compatible mix of land uses to meet the
       present and future needs of all residents and the business community;
    •  Promote development standards and land use patterns that encourage long-
       term environmental sustainability; and
    •  Provide for land use patterns that are compatible with and support a variety
       of mobility opportunities and choices.
The establishment of mixed land uses in the Land Use and Community Design
Element is a key tool in implementing the goals of the Plan.
8.1.4 Community Context
The City of San Marcos covers just over 24 square miles in the North County area
of the region. The City is located in the central portion of northern San Diego
County, approximately 40 miles north of downtown San Diego. The City is bounded
by the cities of Vista and Carlsbad to the west, the city of Escondido to the east,
and unincorporated areas within the County of San Diego to the north and south.
Regional access is provided by State Route 78, an east/west highway that links
Interstate 5 with Interstate 15, both of which provide north/south access.
The City incorporated in 1963; however, the community was established much
earlier than that. In the late 1700s, the Spaniards came upon a valley which they
named “Los Vallecitos de San Marcos” (Little Valley of Saint Mark) in honor of the
day it was discovered. In 1956, San Marcos began to grow rapidly when Colorado
River water arrived in the City. At that time, businesses started up and people
moved to the area. Since then, San Marcos has grown faster than any other
jurisdiction in the region.
As indicated in the Housing Needs Assessment, between 2000 and 2010, the City’s
population increased by 52 percent. San Marcos offers a mix of housing types.
Single-family homes make up about 61 percent of the housing stock, multi-family
comprises about 28 percent, and mobile homes comprise the remaining 12 percent.
Between 2000 and 2010, the City’s housing stock increased by 52 percent, equal to
the population growth in the same period. San Marcos is now home to two of the
region’s major education facilities: Palomar Community College and California State
University, San Marcos.
8.1.5 Public Participation
The Housing Element must reflect the values and preferences of the San Marcos
Community; therefore, public participation plays a role in the development of this
Element. Section 65583(c)(6)(B) of the Government Code states: “The local
government shall make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all economic
segments of the community in the development of the housing element, and the
program shall describe this effort.” This process not only includes residents of the
                                City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-3

community, but also coordinates participation among local agencies and housing
groups, community organizations, and housing sponsors.
On February 21, 2013, the Planning Commission conducted a study session prior to
submitting the draft Housing Element to the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) to discuss the Draft Housing Element. Notification
of the study session was published in the U-T San Diego newspaper. To ensure that
the housing concerns of low- and moderate-income and special needs residents
were addressed, the City notified agencies and organizations that serve the low-
                                           and moderate-income and special needs
                                           communities in San Marcos and surrounding
                                           areas.     Local    stakeholders     such    as
                                           developers, neighboring jurisdictions and
                                           housing advocates were invited to review

                                           was provided on the front page of the City’s
                                           website with the full notice, and ability to
                                           access the Draft Housing Element through a
                                           dedicated     vanity   button.    The    notice
                                           contained a link to a page dedicated to
                                           information on the study session and on the
                                           Housing Element in General.
                                           Public comments received at the Study
                                           Session included the need for more parking
                                           spaces for multi-family developments. City
                                           staff explained that requirements in San
                                           Marcos are sufficient based on feedback from
                                           developers of multi-family housing.          As
                                           discussed     in   Section    8.3.2,    parking
                                           requirements in San Marcos are reasonable
                                           and are not considered a significant
                                           constraint to housing development. A
                                           member of the public also commented on
the concentration of affordable housing in the Richmar area and on graffiti and
crime issues experienced by neighboring residents. City staff explained that the
Richmar area had experienced a tremendous improvement over the past few years
and that the conversion of many developments from market-rate multi-family
housing to affordable housing has improved the quality of housing for residents in
that area. Staff also noted that previous owners did not maintain their
developments adequately while affordable housing developers are highly invested in
their properties and ensure that maintenance of the properties is a priority. Staff
explained that affordable housing developments are subject to strict on-site
management requirements and maintenance plan. Overall, the City’s effort to
provide quality, affordable housing in this high-need area significantly improved the
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-4

quality of life for residents in this formerly dilapidated and crime-ridden
neighborhood. As appropriate, their comments and concerns have been integrated
into the Housing Element.
The draft Housing Element was made available to the public at the following
locations:
    •  San Marcos City Hall
    •  City website
    •  San Diego County Library – San Marcos Branch
Further opportunity for public participation was provided at the Planning
Commission and City Council adoption hearings (held May 6 and June 25, 2013
respectively). The San Diego Housing Federation submitted comments in letter form
prior to the hearings, attended the City Council adoption hearing to present the
letter, and supported adoption of the Housing Element. A copy of the letters is
included in Appendix C. In their letters, the San Diego Housing Federation
encouraged the City to:
    •  Endorse pending legislation which would provide a permanent source of
       funding for affordable housing (SB 391); and clarification of the Palmer
       decision to allow local jurisdictions to control their inclusionary housing
       ordinances (AB 1229);
    •  Proactively acquire or preserve land near transit for development of
       affordable housing;
    •  Continue to fund affordable housing production; and
    •  Augment the density bonus ordinance to include a local program that allows
       developers to utilize the density bonus at an offsite location.
City staff indicated that the City has proactively acquired land near transit
opportunities and that City will continue to fund affordable housing to the maximum
extent feasible but that future action on both items was dependant on replacement
funding to be made available in the post-RDA environment. In regards to
augmenting the City’s density bonus ordinance, Staff indicated that further study
would be required. No other public comments were received.
8.1.6 Data Sources and Methodology
Data from several resources informed the crafting of the San Marcos Housing
Element. One of the most cited sources is the 2010 Census. The 2010 Census
provides consistent demographic characteristics that are widely accepted. Several
data sources supplement the Census data on topics of income, housing, and
household characteristics, including:
    •  American Community Survey (ACS) 1-, 3-, and 5- year data estimates from
       the Census Bureau
    •  California Department of Finance 2012 Population and Housing Estimates
    •  Additional information has been drawn from the 2009 Comprehensive
       Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data. CHAS data are based on special
                                 City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-5

         tabulations for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
         (HUD) from sample Census data.
Compared to the 2000 Census, the data provided by the 2010 Census are limited
and in most instances, instead of providing 100 % population data for demographic
factors, provide estimates. Many of these estimates (such as the 1-, 3-, and 5- year
American Community Survey data and California Department of Finance data) are
shown solely as percentages, as the raw numbers carry a significant margin of
error, especially for smaller geographies such as cities and Census-designated
places. Nonetheless, the percentages give a general indication of population and
employment trends. The information contained in the CHAS is based on special
tabulations from sample Census data. Thus, the number of households in each
category often deviates slightly from 100 percent due to extrapolations to the total
household level. Because of this, interpretations of CHAS data should focus on
proportions and percentages rather than on precise numbers.
Data for specific topics were obtained from a range of sources, including but not
limited to housing cost information from Dataquick and the San Diego County
Apartment Association and special needs data from the California Department of
Developmental Services (DDS) and The Regional Task Force on the Homeless.

8.2 Housing Needs Assessment
To understand housing needs of current San Marcos residents, this section
describes population characteristics, employment patterns, and income levels in
San Marcos. The information illustrates how the City of San Marcos has grown and
changed, and identifies patterns and trends that serve as the basis for crafting the
City’s housing policies and programs. Projections show how the community is
expected to change over the next two decades. Where relevant, conditions in San
Marcos are compared with surrounding communities and San Diego region in
general.
8.2.1 Population Characteristics and Trends
The City’s close proximity to regional freeways, strong employment base, stable
residential neighborhoods, and strong quality of life have made San Marcos a prime
destination for homebuyers and renters. To clarify the type of housing that will be
needed to meet future demand, Housing Element law requires that this element
assess population and economic characteristics. Population, income, and
employment characteristics provide insight regarding current and future housing
need in San Marcos. Characteristics such as age, ethnicity, and employment
influence the type and cost of housing needed or in high demand. Tracking changes
in the City’s demographics can also help City leaders better respond to or anticipate
changing housing demand.
Population Growth
Founded in the late 1800s and incorporated in 1963, the City of San Marcos has
been one of the fastest growing cities in the San Diego region and the State in
recent years. During the 1980s, San Marcos doubled its population. As shown in
Table 8-1, growth continued to increase between 1990 and 2010, when the City
more than doubled its population again. In 2010, the population had grown to
83,781. The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) growth forecasts
predict a steady increase in population through 2050 (Figure 8-1). From 2010 to
2020, SANDAG estimates that the City’s population will grow by 8 percent while
regionwide population is expected to increase by 14 percent (Figure 8-1).

Age
Age distribution is a key indicator of housing needs, as housing needs and
preferences change as individuals and households age. Housing needs for young
families may focus more on cost and the ability to become first-time homebuyers.
For seniors, cost and access to services are important, as seniors may be on fixed
incomes and have mobility limitations. Table 8-2 shows the age distribution of San
Marcos residents.
In 2010, young adults (25-44 years) constituted the largest age group, at 30
percent, followed by the school age group (5-19 years), at 23 percent. Since 2000,
the largest change has been the increase in the middle age group (45-64 years).
While the proportion of residents in the young adult group (25-44 years) dropped 2
percent, the proportion of residents in the senior adult group (65+ years) increased
2 percent. Although the City’s population is still young overall, this trend shows that
City residents are becoming older. An aging population indicates that in the future,
demand will be higher for smaller housing units, and housing programs such as
housing repair services for seniors will become more necessary.
                                        City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-9

In 2010, the median age in San Marcos was 32.9 years, only slightly higher than
the median age in 2000 (32.1). Compared to the region average, the City has a
younger population, as the median age regionwide was 34.6 in 2010.

Race/Ethnicity
Different racial and ethnic groups often have different household characteristics and
cultural backgrounds that may affect their housing needs and preferences. Figure
8-2 shows the racial/ethnic distribution of population in San Marcos. Figure 8-2
shows that in San Marcos, the population is predominately White, although the City
has a higher percentage of Hispanic residents than the region as a whole. In 2010,
approximately 49 percent of San Marcos’ residents were White, 37 percent were
Hispanic, 2 percent were Black, and 9 percent were Asian/Pacific Islander. Since
2000, there has been a decrease in the proportion of White residents, with an
accompanying increase in the Asian/Pacific Islander population. The proportion of
Hispanic residents has remained unchanged.

  Ethnic diversity also influences other                demographic characteristics such as age,
  family, household size, and income.                  For example, 2011 American Community
  Survey (ACS) data (2009-2011) show                   that Hispanic workers living in San Marcos
  had lower median earnings than Asians               and Whites and the population as a whole.
  Employment Trends
  Labor and employment characteristics have a direct impact upon current and future
  housing needs within San Marcos. Different industries and occupations within a
  particular industry often translate into different wage levels. These differences in
  wages directly impact a household’s ability to afford certain types of housing, the
  ability to rent or own housing, and the ability to adequately maintain housing.
  In September 2012, both the San Diego region and the City of San Marcos had
  unemployment rates of 8.4 percent. The unemployment rate in the City and region
  was lower than the State unemployment rate of 9.7 percent, demonstrating that
  San Marcos is located in a strong employment market. 1 In 2012, the State
  Employment Development Department estimated that San Marcos had a labor force
  of approximately 31,800 persons, 2 or 2 percent of the regional labor force. SANDAG
  2050 Growth Projections estimate that by 2020 the City’s labor force will have
  increased to 40,830 persons, an increase of 28 percent from 2012. This is a
  significant change as, according to SANDAG, the San Diego region as a whole is
  expected to see only a 0.4 percent increase in the labor force in that same time
  period.
  Employment growth typically leads to strong housing demand, while the reverse is
  true when employment contracts. In some cases, the types of jobs themselves can
  affect housing needs and demand (such as in communities near military
  installations, college campuses, and large amounts of seasonal agriculture). Table
  8-3 shows the employment compositions of the City’s labor force.

  Compared to the Region, San Marcos has a very similar employment composition.
  The most noticeable differences are that the City has a higher proportion of
  residents employed in the manufacturing industry and a lower proportion employed
  in public administration. These are important trends, as jobs in these industries
  have some of the highest earnings. On the lower end of the earning scale, 10
  percent of residents held jobs in the arts, entertainment, and recreation, and
  accommodation and food services industry which had a median income (12 months
  prior to the Survey being conducted) of $18,803.
  The top three employers in San Marcos are educational institutions (San Marcos
  Unified School District, California State University San Marcos, and Palomar
  College). Combined, these three institutions employ 2,592 persons. 3
  Household Income
  Household income is the most important, although not the only factor, affecting
  housing opportunity because it determines a household's ability to purchase or rent
  housing and balance housing costs with other necessities. Income levels can vary
  considerably among households, affecting preferences for tenure, location, and
  housing type. While higher-income households have more discretionary income to
  spend on housing, low- and moderate-income households have a more limited
  choice in the housing they can afford.

The median household income in San Marcos is $58,897 according to the 2010
Census, or 93 percent of the region median income of $63,069. As seen in Figure
8-3, San Marcos has a higher median income than the neighboring cities of
Escondido ($47,180) and Vista ($46,759), but lower than Carlsbad ($84,728)
Encinitas ($86,845), Oceanside ($63,577), and Poway ($97,285).
For housing planning and funding purposes, the HCD uses five income categories to
evaluate housing need based on the Area Median Income (AMI) for the
metropolitan area:
    •   Extremely Low-Income Households earn between 0 and 30% of AMI
    •   Very Low-Income Households earn between 31 and 50% of AMI
    •   Low-Income Households earn between 51 and 80% of AMI
    •   Moderate-Income Households earn between 81 and 120% of AMI
    •   Above Moderate-Income Households earn over 120% of AMI
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data provides special Census
tabulations (developed for HUD) and calculates household income adjusted for
family size and tenure. As shown in Table 8-4, in San Marcos, moderate/above
moderate-income households comprise the largest share of all households, and low-
income households comprise the second largest category. According to the 2009
CHAS, 10 percent of the City's total households were classified as extremely low
income (0-30% of AMI), 13 percent were classified as very low income (31-50% of
AMI), and 18 percent were classified as low income (51-80% AMI). Fifty-eight
percent of the City’s households had incomes above 80 percent of the median
household income in 2009.

 presented may have significant margins of error, particularly for smaller geographies. The intent of
 the data is to show general proportions of household need, not exact numbers.
Tenure refers to whether a housing unit is owner occupied or renter occupied.
Tenure is closely correlated with income, as those households with lower incomes
most usually cannot afford to buy a home. Consistent with this fact, renters in San
Marcos earned lower incomes overall, with 20 percent of renters (1,650
households) earning extremely low incomes (Table 8-5). There was a significant
difference in income between renter and owner households, with the proportion of
owners earning extremely low incomes at 6 percent (950 households). Elderly
renters and large family renters are shown to be in the most precarious financial
situation, with 54 percent and 45 percent respectively earning extremely low and
very low incomes.

8.2.2 Households Characteristics
Household characteristics and types can impact the type of housing needed. For
instance, single-person households often occupy smaller apartment units or
condominiums, such as studio and one-bedroom units. Married couples often prefer
larger single-family homes, particularly if they have children. This underscores the
need to provide a diversity of housing opportunities to provide households of
different ages and types the opportunity to live in San Marcos.
The U.S. Census Bureau defines a household as all of the people who occupy a
housing unit. A household is different than a housing unit, as a housing unit is a
house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied
(or if vacant, intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. A household
consists of all the people who occupy a housing unit.
In 2010, there were 27,202 households in the City, up from 18,176 in 2000 (a 50
percent increase). San Marcos households make up 2.5 percent of the 1,086,865
households in the San Diego region. As Table 8-6 indicates, San Marcos appears to
be a family-oriented community, with 73 percent of all households classified as
families. The City has a higher proportion of family households as compared with
the region (66%). This proportion has not changed significantly since 2000. The
proportion of non-families (such as persons living alone) has also remained stable.
The average household size and tenure distribution have remained stable, with 37
percent of households renting and 63 percent owning their home (compared to the
regionwide distribution of 46 percent renters and 54 percent owners). The average
household size is 3.05 persons (larger than the regionwide average household size
of 2.75).

8.2.3 Special Needs
Certain groups have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
their special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one's income
                                  City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-15

earning potential, family characteristics, the presence of physical or mental
disabilities, or age-related health issues. As a result, certain groups typically earn
lower incomes and have higher rates of overpayment for housing, or they live in
overcrowded residences. A central goal of the Housing Element is to assist persons
with special needs in meeting their housing needs.
The special needs groups analyzed include the elderly, people with disabilities,
single parents, large households, homeless people, farm workers, and students
(Table 8-7). Many of these groups overlap; for example, many farm workers are
homeless and many elderly people have a disability of some type. The majority of
these special needs groups would be assisted by an increase in affordable housing,
especially housing located near transit stations.

Seniors
Many senior-headed households have special needs due to their relatively low
incomes, disabilities or limitations, and dependency needs. Specifically, many
people aged 65 years and older live alone and may have difficulty maintaining their
homes, are usually retired and living on a limited income, and are more likely to
have high health care costs and rely on public transportation, especially those with
disabilities. The limited income of many elderly persons often makes it difficult for
them to find affordable housing. In the San Diego region, the elderly spend a higher
percentage of their income for food, housing, medical care, and personal care than
non-elderly families.
In 2010, there were 8,527 senior persons in San Marcos. Between 2000 and 2010,
the senior population in San Marcos grew by approximately 31 percent (from 6,525
seniors). Twenty percent of households have elderly heads of household. Among
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-16

the 5,355 elderly households (homes with a senior head of household), three-
quarters were owners and only one quarter were renters.
The housing needs of seniors (over 65 years of age) are diverse. Senior
homeowners often have limited retirement income and/or increasing physical
limitations, and could benefit from homeowner assistance. In addition to
disabilities, seniors who rent housing have greater needs, in that rental assistance
may be required to continue affording housing. According to the CHAS database, in
San Marcos close to 60 percent of elderly households earned low incomes (<80%
AMI).
The following affordable senior apartments are located in San Marcos, most of
which have long waiting lists:
    •  Hacienda Vallecitos; 736 Center Drive, 10 units
    •  Casa Vallecitos: 852 Avenida Ricardo, 22 units
    •  Grandon Village: 1607 Grandon Avenue, 160 units
    •  Royal Oaks: 650 Woodward Avenue, 12 units

    •  Madrid Manor Mobile Home Park: 1401 El Norte Parkway, 330 units
    •  Casitas Del Sol Mobile Home Park: 1195 La Moree Road, 195 units
    •  La Moree Mobile Home Park: 1175 La Moree Road, 122 units
    •  Valle Verde Mobile Home Park: 1286 Discovery Street, 147 units
    •  Rancho Vallecitos: 3535 Linda Vista Drive, 340 units
    •  Palomar East Mobile Home Park: 650 S. Rancho Santa Fe Road, 372 units
    •  Palomar West Mobile Home Park: 1930 W. San Marcos Boulevard, 474 units
Several programs address the non-housing needs of seniors in the City. The senior
nutrition program operated by the San Marcos Senior Center provides
transportation services to bring seniors to the Center for meals. Two other
organizations that assist in feeding low-income seniors are Meals on Wheels and
Angels Depot. Meals on Wheels provides home delivery of meals five days a week
to seniors who are homebound and to persons with disabilities that make it difficult
for the person to get out. Angel’s Depot offers an emergency meal box program to
low-income seniors at the San Marcos Senior Center once a month. The North
County Food Bank, which delivers food to direct distribution sites, also provides
senior outreach initiatives and other emergency food relief services. The Sheriff
Department’s Senior Volunteers provides a daily "you are not alone” check on the
welfare of seniors and persons with disabilities who are living alone.
Persons with Disabilities
The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) identifies persons as
having a disability as those who exhibit difficulty with specific functions and may, in
the absence of accommodation, have a disability. According to the ACS, disability
exists where this interaction results in limitations of activities and restrictions to full
participation at school, at work, at home, or in the community. For example,
disability may exist where a person is limited in his or her ability to work due to job
discrimination against persons with specific health conditions; or, disability may
                               City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-17

exist where a child has difficulty learning because the school cannot accommodate
the child’s deafness 4.
Both mentally and physically disabled residents face housing access and safety
challenges. Disabled people, in most cases, are of limited incomes and often receive
Social Security income only. As such, the majority of their monthly income is often
devoted to housing costs. In addition, disabled persons may face difficulty finding
accessible housing (housing that is made accessible to people with disabilities
through the positioning of appliances and fixtures, the heights of installations and
cabinets, layout of unit to facilitate wheelchair movement, etc.) because of the
limited number of such units. A small segment of San Marcos residents have
disabilities that prevent them from working, restrict their mobility, or make it
difficult to care for themselves. As reflected in Table 8-8, 8 percent of the
population reported a disability in 2011. Senior residents had the highest incidence
of disability (43 percent).

The Census does not record developmental disabilities. The California State Council
on Developmental Disabilities estimates that nationwide 1.8 percent of the
population meet the federal definition of a developmental disability. This equates
to 1,508 persons in the City of San Marcos with developmental disabilities, based
on the 2010 Census population.
According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a "developmental
disability" means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18
years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a
substantial disability for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral
palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes disabling conditions found to be
closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required
for individuals with mental retardation, but does not include other handicapping
conditions that are solely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a
group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected
individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and

physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before
adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is
the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
community-based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental
disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers,
four developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The San Diego
Regional Center (SDRC) is one of 21 regional centers in California that provides
point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. SDRC has 5
locations to serve clients throughout the County, including an office in the City of
San Marcos. The center is a private, non-profit community agency that contracts
with local service providers to offer a wide range of services to individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families. In San Marcos, 363 persons are
reported as consumers of the services provided at the local Regional Center (Table
8-9).

The City works with a number of local agencies that provide housing and/or service
to persons with special needs and their families. T.E.R.I., Inc. provides small group
home residential facilities for adults with developmental disorders, and
opportunities for work and therapy as appropriate to the individual. T.E.R.I.
provides education as appropriate to developmentally disabled children on behalf of
local school districts across the North County region. There are two Mountain
Shadows Community Homes located in San Marcos serve persons with
developmental disabilities. The homes provide physician/nursing services, physical,
occupational, speech, and recreational therapies, behavior management, and
nutrition services.
Female-Headed Families
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of
the greater need for day care, health care, and other services. In particular,
female-headed households with children tend to have lower incomes and a greater
need for affordable housing and accessible daycare and other supportive services.
The relatively low incomes earned by female-headed households, combined with
the increased need for supportive services, severely limit the housing options
available to them.
                                   City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-19

In 2010, 3,056 female-headed households resided in San Marcos, representing 11
percent of all households in the City. Female-headed households with children made
up 7 percent of all households.
Large Households
Large households, defined by HCD as households containing five or more persons,
have special housing needs due to the limited availability of adequately sized,
affordable housing units. Larger units can be very expensive; as such, large
households are often forced to reside in smaller, less expensive units or double-up
with other families or extended family to save on housing costs, both of which
results in unit overcrowding. The 2010 Census reported 4,833 large households
with 5 or more members in San Marcos (18% of all households). Among large
households, 46 percent (2,212 households) were renter-households and 54 percent
(2,621 households) were owner-households. Housing problems include
overcrowding, cost burden, and substandard conditions. Approximately 71 percent
of large-renter families earned below 80 percent of the County median family
income.
Homeless Persons
Throughout the country and the San Diego region, homelessness has increased.
Factors contributing to the rise in homelessness include a lack of housing affordable
to low- and moderate-income persons, increases in the number of persons whose
incomes fall below the poverty level, reductions in public subsidies to the poor, a
weak economy with high unemployment and high rates of home foreclosures, and
the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill.
The Regional Task Force on the Homeless (Task Force) is San Diego County’s
leading resource for information on issues of homelessness. Established in 1985,
the Task Force promotes a regional approach as the best solution to ending
homelessness in San Diego County. The Task Force is a public/private effort to build
a base of understanding about the multiple causes and conditions of homelessness.
The Task Force uses the McKinney-Vento Act definition of homeless, which is an
individual (not imprisoned or otherwise detained) who:
    •    Lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence;
    •    Has a primary nighttime residence that is a supervised publicly or privately
         operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accommodations
         (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, and transitional housing for
         the mentally ill);
    •    An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
         be institutionalized; or
    •    A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular
         sleeping accommodation for human beings.
The term “homeless” does not include any individual imprisoned or otherwise
detained.
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-20

According to the Task Force, the San Diego region’s homeless population can be
divided into two general groups: 1) urban homeless and 2) rural homeless,
including farm workers and day laborers who live in the hillsides, canyons, and
fields of the northern regions of the county. It is important to recognize that
homeless individuals may fall into more than one category (e.g., a homeless
individual may be a veteran and a substance abuser), making it difficult to
accurately quantify and categorize the homeless.
The homeless population is very difficult to quantify. Census information on
homeless populations is often unreliable due to the difficulty of efficiently counting a
population without permanent residences. Given this impediment, local estimates of
the homeless and anecdotal information are often where population numbers of the
homeless come from. The Task Force produces estimates that are obtained using
observations of homeless service providers; estimates from local officials; reports
from local surveys and studies; utilization rates of homeless facilities, services, and
meal programs; and estimated counts of persons observed at known location.
The Task Force conducted a Point-In-Time (PIT) count in 2012 which resulted in an
estimate of 9,641 individuals who are homeless in the San Diego region (both
sheltered and living on the street). This represents a regional increase of 6.9
percent since the PIT count in 2011. In San Marcos, 37 homeless persons were
identified living on the streets during the 2012 PIT count. Among neighboring cities,
only Poway had a lower homeless count, while Escondido, Oceanside, and Vista had
the highest homeless counts.

In addition to the homeless population living in shelters or on the streets, many
residents—due to high housing cost, economic hardships, or physical limitations—
live on the brink of homelessness yet are housed temporarily through friends or
families. Experts estimate that 2 to 3 families are on the verge of homelessness for
every family staying in a homeless shelter. The "at-risk" population is comprised of
families and individuals living in poverty, who, upon loss of employment or other
emergency requiring financial reserves, would lose their housing and become
homeless. These families are generally experiencing a housing cost burden, paying
more than 30 percent of their income for housing. According to the CHAS data, 85
percent of the City’s extremely low-income renter-households (0-30% AMI) and 77
percent of the City’s very low-income owner-households (31-50% AMI) were paying
                                  City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-21

more than 30 percent of their income on housing.                These households are
considered most vulnerable and at risk of becoming homeless.
The following inventory lists some of the homeless resources located in the North
County area of the region.
    •    The Alliance for Regional Solutions is a coalition of Northern San Diego
         County social service agencies, municipalities, the County of San Diego,
         United Way, educational entities, healthcare providers, other agencies and
         philanthropic bodies. Alliance for Regional Solutions, located in San Marcos,
         runs a Winter Shelter System consisting of six shelters that provide up to
         244 shelter beds each night (Bread of Life Rescue Mission, Interfaith
         Community Services North Inland Shelter, Salvation Army, Community
         Resources Center North Coastal Shelter, Operation Hope, and Catholic
         Charities La Posada de Guadalupe).
    •    North County Health Services, located in San Marcos, provides health
         services to uninsured people experiencing homelessness. Services provided
         include emergency medical care, emergency dental care, vision care
         (depending on availability) and outreach/case management.
    •    North County Solutions for Change, located in Vista, offers a comprehensive
         approach to homelessness through emergency, transitional, and permanent
         housing coupled with education and supportive services.
    •    Brother Benno’s Foundation operates 10 facilities providing housing for men
         and women in recovery from drug and alcohol abuse and for homeless
         women and women with children. The foundation provides hot meals and
         sack lunches at the main facility in Oceanside.
    •    M.I.T.E. Todd House, located in Oceanside, provides treatment and shelter
         for men with substance abuse issues.
    •    North Coastal/North Inland Mental Health Services (Oceanside and Poway)
         mental health management services, individual counseling, group therapy,
         homeless outreach, case management and transition age youth services.
    •    Women’s Resources Center, located in Oceanside, provides supportive
         services, counseling, shelter, and education to North County women,
         children, and men involved in or threatened by domestic violence or sexual
         assault.
    •    Center for Community Solutions, located in Escondido, provides emergency
         domestic violence shelters.
    •    Interfaith Community Services, located in Escondido and Oceanside, provide
         two-dozen different housing programs, such as emergency shelters,
         throughout North San Diego County. Two “Fairweather Lodges,” in San
         Marcos and Escondido, provide permanent shared housing and supported
         part-time employment for mentally ill adults.

Farm Workers
Due to the high cost of housing and low wages, a significant number of migrant
farm workers have difficulty finding affordable, safe, and sanitary housing. It is
estimated that a number of migrant and/or farm worker camps are located
throughout the San Diego region, primarily in rural areas. These encampments
range in size from a few people to a few hundred and are frequently found in fields,
hillsides, canyons, ravines, and riverbeds, often on the edge of their employer’s
property. Some workers reside in severely overcrowded dwellings, in packing
buildings, or in storage sheds.
The housing needs of farm workers are frequently overlooked due to the migratory
nature of farm labor. Thus, farm workers are given low priority when addressing
housing needs, and often receive the least hospitable housing.
The 2011 ACS data estimates that the San Diego region employed a total of 11,091
workers in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting; of these, 556 were employed
in San Marcos. Workers in agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting made up 2
percent of the City’s employed population (16 years and over) compared to 4
percent each for cities of Vista and Escondido. These are generous estimates due to
limitations in the ACS data, which do not count actual farm workers and does not
distinguish between a farm worker and other jobs in the same field. Of the 56
homeless persons identified in San Marcos by the Regional Task Force on the
Homeless 2010 Point-In-Time count, 25 were identified as farm/day laborers. The
2011 ACS data also suggests that workers in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and
hunting, and mining industry have wages significantly below the general population.
While these indicators do not directly measure total farm worker population, they
do suggest that farm workers are a special housing needs population.
San Marcos is host to two farm worker housing developments. Firebird Manor is an
affordable farm worker housing development of 38 two- and three-bedroom
apartments. The second development is Chinaberry Apartments, which houses 12
farm worker families. Both developments require that one family member be legally
employed in the agriculture business. These two farm worker communities
contributed substantially to the reduction in the number of un-sheltered farm
workers in San Marcos. In addition to this permanent housing, one of the 6 winter
shelters in the Alliance network targets migrant farm workers and provides 25
beds. Consistent with State law, farm employee housing up to 36 beds and 12 units
is also allowed with approval of a Director’s Permit in these zones.
Students
The need for student housing is another factor affecting housing demand in San
Marcos. Although students may produce only a temporary housing need, the impact
upon housing demand is critical in areas that surround universities and colleges.
Typically, students have limited incomes and are, therefore, competing for the
same limited amount of affordable housing in the community, especially within easy
commuting distance from campus. They often seek shared housing situations to
decrease expenses, and can be assisted through roommate referral services offered
on and off campus. The lack of affordable housing also influences choices students
                                City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-23

make after graduation, often with a detrimental effect upon the region’s economy.
College graduates provide a specialized pool of skilled labor that is vital to the
economy; however, the lack of affordable housing often leads to their departure
from the region.
The 2011 ACS data indicate that 7,946 San Marcos residents were enrolled in
undergraduate or graduate studies. The two main educational institutions located in
San Marcos are Palomar Community College and California State University San
Marcos (CSUSM). Palomar College is a two-year institution. Palomar Community
College enrolled 27,534 students during the fall of 2010. Community colleges
typically do not provide housing because they are colleges that serve the
educational needs of students already residing in nearby communities.
CSUSM enrolled 9,722 students during the fall of 2010. The campus has more than
one million square feet of facilities, all of which have been constructed since 1990.
CSUSM houses 625 students at the University Village Apartments and 899 at the
off-campus Quad apartments (when all phases are constructed). The Quad is a
student housing facility located across from California State University, San Marcos.
The development is privately owned but affiliated with the University and governed
by University policies. Beginning with the Fall 2012 semester, CSUSM joined a
number of other CSU campuses in requiring that first-year students from outside of
the local area live in University or University-affiliated housing during their first year
(on a space available basis). The CSUSM Master Plan forecasts an ultimate build-
out of approximately 25,000 full-time equivalent students (FTES). The Master Plan
emphasizes the need for strong community relations and integration of sustainable
design principles for all future facilities.
In an effort to increase the supply of quality student housing, the University District
Specific Plan includes diverse housing options, including student housing.
Consistent with the City’s Inclusionary Housing requirement, 15 percent of all
dwelling units will be reserved as affordable for low- and moderate-income
households (exclusive of student housing). While full-time students cannot occupy
these affordable units, they will be an important resource for the CSUSM
community. The housing needs of the student population will also be met through
general multi-family development and mixed used development in other areas of
the City such as the San Marcos Creek District.
8.2.4 Housing Profile
A community’s housing stock is defined as the collection of all housing units located
within the jurisdiction. The characteristics of the housing stock, including growth,
type, age and condition, tenure, vacancy rates, housing costs, and affordability are
important in determining the housing needs for the community. This section details
the housing stock characteristics of San Marcos to identify how well the current
housing stock meets the needs of current and future City residents.
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-24

 Housing Growth
 Table 8-11 shows that since 1990, the City’s housing stock almost doubled. Only
 Carlsbad (+64%) came close to equaling the type of growth seen in San Marcos.
 The majority of neighboring jurisdictions saw housing growth increase during the
 same period between 13 and 26 percent. Since 2000, the housing stock in San
 Marcos increased by 52 percent, more than the growth experienced by neighboring
 jurisdictions and the region. In comparison, Carlsbad had the second greatest
 growth rate, with a 32 percent increase in units.

 According to the SANDAG Regional Growth Forecasts (2010), between 2010 and
 2020 San Marcos is projected to gain five percent in housing stock (Figure 8-4). In
 comparison, region-wide, approximately eight percent more units will be added to
 the housing stock. Between 2010 and 2035, San Marcos is expected to see an
 increase of 16.7 percent in housing stock. Housing growth is projected to level off
 between 2035 and 2050, as housing unit growth is projected to be less than one
 percent. In comparison, the region is expected to grow by 22 percent between
 2010 and 2035 and by eight percent from 2035 to 2050. By 2050, SANDAG
 estimates that the City will have 33,596 units (a 17% increase from 2010).By
 comparison, the regional housing stock is expected to increase by 31 percent, and
 the City of Vista is expected to see a 42 increase in its housing stock.

   Housing Type
   In 2010, the majority of housing units in San Marcos were single-family homes,
   comprising approximately 61 percent of all units. Multi-family units comprised 28
   percent of all homes. Mobile homes comprised 12 percent of all homes. Since 2000,
   the proportion of single-family and multi-family units has increased (6 and 3
   percentage points, respectively) while the proportion of mobile home units has
   dropped 7 percentage points.

Housing Tenure and Vacancy
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owned or rented. The changes in the
distribution of owner- versus renter-occupied units and the vacancy rates of the
housing stock between 2000 and 2010 are presented in Table 8-14. In 2010, 63
percent of the occupied housing units in San Marcos were owner-occupied.
Regionwide, 54 percent of all housing units were owner-occupied. The tenure
distribution has remained at levels close to those seen in 2000, reflecting a balance
of housing types among the significant number of new units.
Vacancy rates often influence the cost of housing. In general, vacancy rates
between 5 and 6 percent for rental housing and between 2 and 3 percent for
ownership housing are considered healthy and suggest a balance between housing
supply and demand. According to the 2010 Census, the overall vacancy rate in San
Marcos was 5 percent. Specifically, ownership housing had a vacancy rate of 2.5
percent, but the rental vacancy rate was 7.6 percent. According to the California
Department of Finance, the vacancy rate in San Marcos in 2012 was 5 percent.

Housing Age and Condition
The age and condition of the housing stock in San Marcos is an indicator of
potential rehabilitation needs. Commonly, housing over 30 years of age needs some
form of major rehabilitation, such as a new roof, foundation work, plumbing, etc.
The age of a jurisdiction’s housing stock is an important characteristic because it is
often an indicator of housing condition and indicative of potential rehabilitation
needs. Many federal and state programs use age of housing as one factor to
determine housing needs and the availability of funds for housing and/or
community development. The housing stock in San Marcos is relatively new. The
median year built for the housing stock is 1989. The housing stock is newer than in
neighboring cities (median year built for Vista is 1980 and Escondido is 1978) and
the San Diego region (1977). Housing units that were built before 1980 make up
about 33 percent of the housing stock (99,135 units). Although the Census does
not include statistics on housing condition based upon observations, it includes
statistics that correlate closely with substandard housing conditions such as lack of
plumbing or kitchen facilities (135 units or 0.5% of all units).
The information presented above can only give indirect indication of housing
conditions. Units in need of substantial rehabilitation are few, as most of the
housing stock is relatively new. Based upon observations and experiences of the
code enforcement and planning staff, the City estimates that potentially 20 housing
units may be considered to be in severe need of replacement or substantial
rehabilitation due to housing conditions.
Housing Cost and Affordability
The cost of housing in a community is directly correlated to the number of housing
problems and affordability issues. High housing costs can price low-income families
out of the market, cause extreme cost burdens, or force households into
overcrowded or substandard conditions.
Ownership Housing
The median price for single-family homes sold in San Marcos in 2012 was
$419,772. Prices in the North County area of the region ranged from $755,000 in
Encinitas to $316,174 in Vista. Compared with the region, the median home price in
San Marcos is just under the median regionwide home price of $444,559. The
median cost of a condominium in 2012 was $233,913, about $30,000 less than the
regionwide median ($263,449).

Prices are rising throughout Southern California mainly because the share of
foreclosures, which are typically lower priced, has fallen significantly in the last year
or so. DataQuick reported that foreclosure resales made up 16.3 percent of the
resale market in Southern California in October 2012, down from 16.6 percent in
September 2012 and down from 32.8 percent a year prior.
Although home prices have dropped substantially since the peak in 2006,
affordability is still out of reach for many. The California Building Industry
Association publishes a quarterly housing affordability index. The index calculates
the percentage of homes that were sold during a three-month period that would be
affordable to a family earning the region’s median income. During the second
quarter of 2012, the San Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos metropolitan area ranked
twelfth in a listing of the least affordable metro areas in the country. According to
the Index, only 53 percent of homes were affordable to a family earning the
region’s median income.

Rental Housing
The primary source for renter cost data in the San Diego region is the San Diego
County Apartment Association. The Apartment Association typically conducts two
surveys of rental properties per year. For Spring 2012, the average monthly rent in
San Marcos ranged from $883 for a one-bedroom apartment to $1,477 for a three-
bedroom apartment. Apartment rents in San Marcos tend to be lower than those of
neighboring cities and the San Diego region as a whole. These rents generally fall
within the range for rents specified by the HUD fair market rent for the San Diego
region.

Housing Affordability by Income
Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a
home in the City with the maximum affordable housing costs for households at
different income levels. Taken together, this information can generally show who
can afford what size and type of housing, and indicate the type of households most
likely to experience overcrowding and overpayment.
The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) conducts annual
household income surveys nationwide to determine a household’s eligibility for
federal housing assistance. Based on this survey, the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) developed income limits that can be
used to determine the maximum price that could be affordable to households in the
upper range of their respective income category. The maximum affordable home
and rental prices for residents in San Diego County are shown in Table 8-17. Table
8-17 shows the maximum amount that a household can pay for housing each
month without incurring a cost burden (overpayment). This amount can be
compared to current ownership housing prices and rental rates to determine what
types of housing opportunities a household can afford.

Comparing housing costs and maximum affordable prices for low-income
households shows that low-income households are being priced out of the San
Diego region rental and ownership market. Given the median home prices
presented in Table 8-15, single-family home ownership is beyond the reach of
most low-income households. Condominiums are affordable to moderate-income
smaller families. While condominiums may be affordable to lower-income five-
person families, those units may be too small for their needs. In the rental market,
extremely and very low-income households generally cannot afford the market
rents in San Marcos (Table 8-16). While low- and moderate-income households
may be able to afford one- or two-bedroom units in the City, such units are too
small for large households. Moderate-income four person and large families may
also be able to afford reasonable priced rental homes.
8.2.5 Housing Problems
Overcrowding
In response to a mismatch between household income and housing costs in a
community, some households may not be able to buy or rent housing that provides
a reasonable level of privacy and space. Residents may accept smaller-sized
housing or double up with other families to afford the housing costs. The federal
government defines overcrowding as a situation where a household has more
members than habitable rooms in a unit. An overcrowded household is defined as
one with more than one person per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways,
and porches. Severely overcrowded households are households with more than 1.5
persons per room. Overcrowding contributes to increases in traffic within a
neighborhood, accelerates deterioration of homes and infrastructure, can
overburden utilities and services such as sewers, and results in a shortage of on-
site parking.
Table 8-18 displays the prevalence of overcrowding in San Marcos. As indicated by
the 2011 ACS, two percent of households in San Marcos were overcrowded. The
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-32

incidence of overcrowding (1-1.5 persons/room) was half as much as the San Diego
region (four percent). The percentage of severely overcrowded households (>1.5
persons/room) in San Marcos was one percent in 2011, half of the region
percentage of two percent. Overall, three percent of households lived in
overcrowded (overcrowded and severely overcrowded) conditions, compared to six
percent regionwide.
The extent of overcrowding varies significantly by income, type, and size of
household. Generally, very low- and low-income households and large families are
disproportionately affected by overcrowding. However, cultural differences also
contribute to overcrowding conditions since some cultures tend to have larger
household sizes. Overcrowding is typically more prevalent among renters than
among owners. Six percent of renter households experienced overcrowding in
2011, compared to two percent for owner households.

Overpayment (Cost Burden)
State and federal standards specify that households spending more than 30 percent
of gross annual income on housing experience a housing cost burden. Federal and
state agencies use overpayment indicators to determine the extent and level of
funding and support that should be allocated to a community. Housing cost burdens
occur when housing costs increase faster than household income. When a
household spends more than 30 percent of its income on housing costs, it has less
disposable income for other necessities such as health care. In the event of
unexpected circumstances such as loss of employment and health problems, lower-
income households with a burdensome housing cost are more likely to become
homeless. Homeowners with a housing cost burden have the option of selling the
                                 City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-33

homes and become renters. Renters, on the other hand, are vulnerable and subject
to constant changes in the housing market.
Table 8-19 demonstrates the extent of cost burden (overpaying for housing costs)
by household type (elderly households, large households, all households) and
income. Overall, half of San Marcos residents experience cost burden. In general,
renters (62%) experienced cost burden more than homeowners (44%), and
households with lower incomes (extremely, very low, and low incomes) experienced
cost burden at a higher proportion than upper income households. Very low-income
elderly owner households had the highest level of cost burden (97%) followed by
extremely low-income elderly renter households (91%). Table 8-19 also shows that
the proportion of households experiencing cost burden declined significantly as
income increased. For example, while 91 percent of extremely low-income renters
experienced cost burden, that figure was much lower (25%) for above moderate-
income renters. Also, while 74 percent of extremely low-income homeowners
experienced cost burden, the proportion dropped to 36 percent for moderate-
income homeowners. Overall, half of all households in San Marcos experienced cost
burden.

Assisted Housing
The Housing Authority of the County of San Diego Housing Choice Voucher Program
(formerly known as Section 8) serves San Marcos and provides rent subsidies for
very low-income households. The Housing Choice Voucher Program provides rental
subsidies to very low-income families that spend more than 30 percent of their
gross income on housing costs. As of September 2012, the Housing Authority
provides Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance to 308 households in San
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-34

Marcos, and there are 1,223 applicants on the waiting list residing in San Marcos.
The Housing Authority has an extensive waiting list. The wait for rental assistance
after a family is placed on the waiting list is several years.
The City uses various funding sources to preserve and increase the supply of
affordable housing through new construction and the acquisition and/or
rehabilitation of renter-occupied units. Affordability covenants in San Marcos
include developments that hold federal subsidy contracts, received tax credits or
mortgage revenue bonds, were created through the City’s Inclusionary Housing
Program, and/or were financed by redevelopment funds or non-profit developers.
Table 8-20 presents the inventory of affordable housing developments in San
Marcos. In 2012, 42 affordable housing developments were located in San Marcos,
providing approximately 3,142 affordable units to lower-income households.

Included in Table 8-20 are nine mobile home parks with affordable, deed-restricted
units. The City requires that the housing be kept available to low- to moderate-
income residents. A recorded deed restriction serves as an affordability covenant
that restricts the income level of a person who occupies the property, and ensures
the property will remain available for low- to moderate- income persons through
the foreseeable future.
Units at Risk Analysis
Housing Element law requires jurisdictions to provide an analysis and program for
preserving affordability of assisted housing developments for the next 10 years. A
large portion of the affordable housing stock was created via the City’s inclusionary
housing requirement. This requirement stipulates a 55-year affordability term. As
many of these units were built in the early 2000s, the affordability covenants do not
expire within the next 10 years. Another subset of affordable units was developed
by non-profit, affordable housing developers which do not intend to convert their
units to market-rate apartments. According to The California Housing Partnership
Corporation (CHPC), there are no federally assisted units in the City at risk of
market rate conversion.
Based on City records and information from the California Housing Partnership
Corporation, in the next 10 years (2013-2023) there are no assisted housing
developments subject in San Marcos at risk of losing affordability.
8.2.7 Estimates of Housing Need
Several factors influence the degree of demand, or "need," for housing in San
Marcos. The major needs categories considered in this element include:
    •   Housing needs resulting from the overcrowding of units
    •   Housing needs that result when households pay more than they can afford
        for housing
    •   Housing needs of "special needs groups" such as elderly, large families,
        female-headed households, households with a disabled person, farm
        workers, students, and the homeless
                                    City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-37

State law requires that cities quantify existing housing need in their Housing
Element. Table 8-21 summarizes those findings.

8.3 Housing Constraints
Actual or potential constraints to the provision of housing affect the development of
new housing and the maintenance of existing units for all income levels.
Governmental and non-governmental constraints in San Marcos are similar to those
in other jurisdictions in the region and are discussed below. One of the most, if not
the most, significant and difficult constraints to housing in San Marcos and
elsewhere in the San Diego region is the high cost of land. This section describes
various governmental, market, and environmental constraints on the development
of housing.
8.3.1 Market Constraints
A number of private sector factors contribute to the cost of housing and affect the
availability of affordable housing: land costs, construction costs, and financing. The
following is a discussion of these factors and their impact on housing development.
Land Costs
The cost of land is a major impediment to production of affordable housing. Land
costs are influenced by many variables, including scarcity and developable density
(both of which are indirectly controlled through governmental land use regulations),
location, unique features, site constraints and the availability of public utilities.
In December 2012, the cost of advertised vacant single-family land in San Marcos
yielded an average price of $84,085 per acre (Table 8-22). The cost per acre of
smaller single-family lots (i.e., lots under 1.0 acre) was substantially higher than
the price per acre of larger single-family lots. Single-family lots larger than 2.5
acres can be assumed to have significant slope and/or habitat constraints that
would make subdivision difficult or impractical.

                 Overall average $/acre                                     $84,085

                 Note: Prices for single-family lots were derived from MLS listings of
                 vacant land for sale in the City of San Marcos.
No vacant multi-family or mixed use lots were listed for sale in the Multiple Listing
Service (MLS) database in December 2012. Undeveloped multi-family and mixed
use lots are typically more valuable on a per-acre basis when compared to single-
family lots. Higher density residential lots in San Diego region often command
more than four times the cost per acre than single-family lots.

Construction Costs
Construction cost is determined primarily by the cost of labor and materials. The
relative importance of each is a function of the complexity of the construction job
and the desired quality of the finished product. As a result, builders are under
constant pressure to complete a job for as low a price as possible while still
providing a quality product. This pressure has led (and is still leading) to an
emphasis on labor-saving materials and construction techniques.
The price paid for material and labor at any one time will reflect short-term
considerations of supply and demand.                Between 2003 and 2008, residential
construction costs rose in response to an extremely active housing market. Since
2008, construction costs have moderated due to the housing industry downturn.
Future costs are difficult to predict given the cyclical fluctuations in demand and
supply that in large part are created by fluctuations in the state and national
economies. Such policies unilaterally impact construction in a region and therefore
do not deter housing construction in any specific community.
For the average home, the cost of labor is generally two to three times the cost of
materials and therefore represents a substantial component of the total cost of
construction. Most relatively small residential construction jobs in the San Diego
region are performed with nonunion contractors; as a result, labor costs are
responsive to changes in the residential market. The relative ease by which a
skilled tradesperson can get a contractor’s license further moderates the pressures
that force labor costs to rise. Construction costs in San Marcos are about the same
as in other parts of Southern California. For standard housing construction, costs
may average $106 to $122 per square foot for single-family residences depending
on the level of amenities provided, and $96 to $124 per square foot for multi-family
residential structure, depending on construction type and excluding parking. 5
A reduction in amenities and quality of building materials (above a minimum
acceptability for health, safety, and adequate performance) could lower sale prices.
Economy building techniques may reduce costs. In addition, prefabricated, factory-
built housing may provide for lower-priced housing by reducing construction and
labor costs. Another factor related to construction costs is the number of units built
at one time. As the number of units is increased, construction costs over the entire
development are generally reduced based on economies of scale. This reduction in
costs is of particular benefit when density bonuses are used for the provision of
affordable housing.
Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a
home. Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are
required to disclose information on the disposition of loan applications and the
income, gender, and race of loan applicants. The primary concern in a review of
lending activity is to determine whether home financing is available to a City’s
5

                                   City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-41

residents. The annual HMDA report for 2011 (the most recent available at the
writing of this element) was reviewed to evaluate the availability of residential
financing within the City. The data presented in this section include the disposition
of loan applications submitted to financial institutions for home purchase, home
improvement, and refinance loans in San Marcos.
In 2011, 1,639 households applied for conventional mortgage loans in San Marcos.
As shown in Table 8-23, 72 percent of the conventional mortgage applications
were approved, 15 percent were denied, and 13 percent were withdrawn or closed
for incompleteness. Government-backed home purchase loans 6 were less popular
in 2011 than conventional purchase loans. Of the 773 applications for government-
backed loans, 77 percent were approved, 13 percent were denied, and 11 percent
were withdrawn or closed for incompleteness.
Another 138 San Marcos households applied for home improvement loans in 2011;
of these, only 59 percent were approved and 23 percent were denied. In general,
home improvement financing is less accessible during market downturns, compared
to home purchase financing.              High debt-to-income ratios coupled with lower
property appraisals can make it more difficult to qualify for additional financing.
Applications to refinance existing mortgages were most common with a total of
5,085 applications.         The approval rate for refinance loans (68 percent) was
somewhat lower than the approval rate for conventional home purchase loans (72
percent) and government-backed purchase loans (77 percent). The lower approval
rates for refinance loan applications may reflect the tightening of credit markets
that has occurred since 2008.
More than 62 percent of loan applicants had incomes that exceeded 120 percent of
the Area Median Income (AMI). Approximately 72 percent of applications filed by
these upper-income households were approved and 13 percent were denied.
Lower-income households, particularly very low-income households, had the lowest
loan approval rates and highest denial rates. Only 51 percent of very low-income
and 64 percent of low-income applicants were approved.
Given the high rates of approval, refinancing and home purchase loans are
generally available and not considered to be a significant constraint in San Marcos.
However, the relatively low approval rate and high denial rate for home
improvement loans, limited access to this type of financing may be a constraint to
the maintenance of the City’s housing stock over time.
6
  Government-backed loans include loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration
(FHA), Veteran Administration (VA), and Farm Service Agency (FSA)/Rural Housing Services (RHS).

Financing Issues in 2012-2013
After record increases in sale prices, mortgage payments, and negative equity due
to use of subprime loans and other creative financing, San Marcos, like most other
communities in Southern California, experienced a high incidence of foreclosures
during 2008-2012. Changes to the mortgage industry since 2008 have made it
harder to qualify for home purchase or refinance loans. Families that have
overextended financially to purchase a home and have lost or are facing loss of
their home continue to have difficulty in securing funds necessary to purchase even
smaller homes. Although the market has been showing some sign of stabilization,
restricted credit markets and a relatively high incidence of foreclosures compared to
pre-2008 foreclosure levels can be expected to continue beyond 2013. Also, the
direct or indirect impacts on housing prices and availability of financing could
potentially extend longer into the planning period for this Housing Element.
Foreclosures
Between 2000 and 2005, with low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero
down, interest only, adjustable loans), and predatory lending practices (e.g.
aggressive marketing, hidden fees, negative amortization), many households
purchased homes that were beyond their financial means.                     Under the false
assumptions that refinancing to lower interest rates would always be an option and
home prices would continue to rise at double-digit rates, many households were
(and still are) unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration of short-term
fixed rates, and decline in sales prices that set off in 2006. Suddenly faced with
                                   City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-43

significantly inflated mortgage payments, and mortgage loans that are larger than
the worth of the homes, many had to resort to foreclosing their homes.
While foreclosures remain an issue, particularly for the region, the situation has
improved dramatically since 2011. In San Diego County 3,727 Notices of Default
(NODs) were recorded in the third quarter of 2012, compared to 5,048 NODs filed
during the same period in the previous year (for a 26.2 percent decrease). 7 In
November 2012, 330 homes in San Marcos were listed as foreclosures for sale. 8
These homes are listed at various stages of foreclosure (from pre-foreclosures to
auctions) and range in price from $40,000 (mobile home) to $1,485,000 (estate
home). The range in prices of these homes facing foreclosure indicates that the
impact of foreclosure extends to households with higher incomes as well as lower
income households.
8.3.2 Governmental Constraints
Housing affordability is affected by factors in both the private and public sectors.
Actions by the City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing in
San Marcos. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes,
fees, and other local programs intended to improve the overall quality of housing
may serve as a constraint to housing development.                         These governmental
constraints can limit the operations of the public, private, and nonprofit sectors,
making it difficult to meet the demand for affordable housing and limiting supply in
a region.
Land Use Controls
Local land use policies and regulations impact the price and availability of housing,
including affordable housing. This section discusses the General Plan land use
designations and provisions in the Zoning Ordinance relative to the types of housing
allowed within San Marcos as a potential governmental constraint.
General Plan Land Use Designations
The General Plan Land Use and Community Design Element set forth land use
designations that guide the location, type, and intensity or density of permitted
uses of land in the City of San Marcos. The Zoning Ordinance (Title 20 of the
Municipal Code) implements the General Plan by providing specific direction and
development standards for each general land use categories. Table 8-24 shows
residential land uses, the corresponding zoning designation, and permitted densities
allowed for housing.

Specific Plans
A specific plan is a comprehensive planning document that guides the development
of a defined geographic area in a mix of uses including residential, commercial,
industrial, schools, and parks and open space. Specific plans typically include more
detailed information than the General Plan about land use, traffic circulation,
affordable housing programs, resource management strategies, development
standards, and a comprehensive infrastructure plan. Specific plans are also used as
a means of achieving superior design by providing flexibility in development
standards beyond those contained in the Zoning Ordinance.
The City Council has adopted 48 specific plans. Each one contains detailed
regulations, conditions, programs, and design criteria unique to a defined
geographic area within San Marcos and is intended to implement the General Plan.
The adopted specific plans are consistent with the General Plan. Future specific
                                 City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-45

plans, specific plan amendments, and development projects must be consistent
with policies contained in the General Plan, including the General Plan Land Use and
Community Design Element. The following discussion summarizes the two primary
specific plans that will accommodate a significant portion of the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA) through the planning period.
San Marcos Creek Specific Plan
The San Marcos Creek Specific Plan represents an effort to create a downtown for
San Marcos. The plan outlines framework for future growth and redevelopment of
the approximately 214-acre area along San Marcos Creek. All new construction
within the plan boundaries will be guided by a form-based development code, which
provides the guidance needed to implement the District’s intended urban form and
character.      The Regulating Plan identifies seven spatial zones, including the
following zones that allow residential development:
    •    Downtown Core (DTC)
    •    Bent Avenue Center (BAC)
    •    San Marcos Boulevard (SMB)
    •    West End / Midtown / East End (WME)
    •    Creekside (C)
Build out of the planning area is expected to produce 2,300 multi-family,
townhouse, and live/work units.
University District Specific Plan
The University District spans 194 acres at the core of the City, near California State
University, San Marcos. The specific plan envisions an urban mixed-use center with
a variety of housing types, as well as a strong emphasis on pedestrian movement
and mass transit. Although the entire University District is zoned for mixed-use,
individual neighborhoods may have an emphasis on one or more uses.
Neighborhoods identified in the specific plan include:
    •    Commercial / Retail Core
    •    Student Housing Village
    •    Mixed-Use Center
    •    Office Park
    •    Residential
The specific plan identifies a capacity for up to 2,600 multi-family residential units.
These units will be found in a combination of building types: mixed-use with
residential uses located on upper floors above ground floor commercial uses,
townhouses, and shopkeeper type live/work units. Residential uses are located
throughout the specific plan area. Another 800 student housing units are also
anticipated.

Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
State housing element law requires that jurisdictions facilitate and encourage a
range of housing types for all economic segments of the community. As shown in
Table 8-25, the San Marcos Zoning Ordinance accommodates a wide variety of
conventional and special needs housing.

Single-Family
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: A building containing one dwelling unit located on a single lot. These
  include mobile homes and factory-built housing.
       1. Attached. A form of single-family residential development allowing for two units to be attached,
           designed in character, style, and massing, to match the setting and scale of a single-family
           detached neighborhood.
       2. Detached. Individual single-family units not attached to any other unit or structure.
Detached single-family dwellings and subdivisions are permitted within the A-1, A-
2, A-3, R-1-20, R-1-10, and R-1-7.5 zones. Attached single-family dwellings are
allowed within the R-2 zone. Single-family projects within an approved Specific
Plan and attached single-family units are subject to Site Development Plan Review
(administrative). Projects proposing between two and nine attached single-family
units are heard by the Planning Commission. City Council approval is required for
projects proposing 10 or more units.
Duplex
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: A building comprised of two attached living units with independent unit
  entrances.
Duplexes are allowed within the R-2, R-3-6, and R-3-10 zones, subject to Site
Development Plan Review. Projects proposing between 2 and 9 units are heard by
the Planning Commission, and City Council review is required for 10 or more units.
Live/Work Units
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: An integrated dwelling unit and working space, in which the work
  component is the primary use and the residential component is secondary, occupied by a single
  housekeeping unit in a structure, that has been designed or structurally modified to accommodate joint
  residential occupancy and work activity, and which includes:
       1. Complete kitchen space and sanitary facilities in compliance with the Building Code; and,
       2. Working space reserved for and regularly used by one or more occupants of the unit.
Live/Work units are limited to the Mixed Use zones (MU-1 and MU-2).                                      All
development within the Mixed Use zones is subject to Site Development Plan
Review.
Multi-Family
 Zoning Ordinance Definition: Two or more dwelling units on a lot. This does not apply to second
 dwelling units built on single-family residential lots.
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-48

Multi-family developments are permitted in the R-2, R-3-6, R-3-10, MU-1, and MU-
2 zones. Projects proposed within the R-2 zone are limited to duplexes, three- and
four-unit buildings designed in massing and character to appear as a single-family
home, except where modified by a Planned Residential Development (PRD).
Dwellings are not allowed on the ground floor of mixed use developments within the
MU-1 and MU-2 zones if facing a “Primary” street as identified in the General Plan
Mobility Element.
All attached residential developments outside of a specific plan area require a Multi-
Family Site Development Plan (MFSDP) review (regardless of zone). Attached
residential developments within specific plan areas require Site Development Plan
(SDP) review. The Planning Commission considers development applications for 2
to 9 units. Applications for multi-family projects with 10 or more units are heard by
the City Council. Multi-family uses are also subject to design guidelines contained
in Section 20.215.060 of the Zoning Ordinance. Design guidelines and criteria for
multi-family residential housing are provided to ensure that quality architectural
design and construction are achieved from project inception to completion. The
guidelines are intended to facilitate and encourage multi-family development that is
functional in use, enhanced by architecturally pleasing massing and building
orientations, and maximizes open space areas and other facilities. The guidelines
provide prospective developers with greater review and approval certainty by
establishing clear and objective standards for the required open space, child play
area amenities, on-site circulation, mechanical equipment screening, laundry
facilities, storage, mailboxes, site planning and building orientation, building form
and relief, site features, architectural projections, featured architecture, and design
and materials.
Second Dwelling Unit
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: A detached or attached residential dwelling unit that provides complete
  independent living facilities for one or more persons on the same parcel as a legal single-family
  residence. A second dwelling unit shall include permanent provisions that include, but are not limited to,
  living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation.
Second dwelling units are allowed in the A-1, A-2, A-3, R-1-20, R-1-10, and R-1-
7.5 as an accessory use provided that the parcel is at least 10,000 square feet in
size, has an existing single-family detached dwelling, and a second dwelling unit
does not already exist on the lot. Ministerial building permit applications for second
dwelling units are subject to the site planning and development standards of the
Zoning Ordinance, including Chapter 20.410 of the Municipal Code.                                   Second
dwelling units are considered an accessory residential use that is consistent with
the General Plan density and zoning designation for the lot.
                                        City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-49

Manufactured Home
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, that in the traveling
  mode is eight or more feet in body width or 40 feet in body length, or that when erected is 320 or more
  square feet in area and is built on a permanent chassis and is designed to be used as a dwelling with or
  without a foundation system when connected to the required utilities, and that contains required
  plumbing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical systems. A mobile home which was constructed after
  1974 in accordance with California Department of Housing and Urban Development standards or after
  1976 in accordance with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) standards is
  considered to be a manufactured home.
To increase the supply and variety of housing types available to the public,
manufactured homes may be placed on individual lots that allow residential uses
provided that the homes are attached to a foundation system in compliance with all
applicable building regulations and Section 18551 of the Health and Safety Code
and occupied only as a residential use. Manufactured homes are subject to all
Zoning Ordinance provisions applicable to residential structures.
Mobile Home Park
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: Any parcel, area, or tract of land, or portion thereof where two or more
  mobile home lots are rented, leased, or offered for rent or lease to accommodate mobile homes used
  for human habitation.
Mobile home parks, including manufactured home parks and recreational vehicle
parks, that conform to the State Mobile Home Parks Act (Division 13, Part 23.1 of
the California Health and Safety Code, commencing with Section 18200) or the
implementing state guidelines (Title 25, Part 1, Chapter 2 of the California
Administrative Code) and Section 18300 of the State Health and Safety Code, are
allowed within the MHP zone, subject to Chapter 20.245 of the San Marcos
Municipal Code. Mobile home subdivisions are also permitted on lots outside of the
MHP zone if the units conform to all development standards of the applicable Zone
and Manufactured Home standards.
Residential Care Facility
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: Any State licensed facility, place, or structure that is maintained and
  operated to provide non-medical residential care, day treatment, or foster agency services for adults,
  children, or adults and children as defined in Article 1 of Chapter 3 of the California Health and Safety
  Code, Section 1500 et seq. This use includes the administration of limited medical assistance (e.g.,
  dispensing of prescribed medications).
“Small” residential care facilities (those serving 6 or fewer clients) are allowed by
right in all zones that allow residential uses and in the SR zone subject to the same
development standards and permit processing standards as other residential uses
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-50

in those zones, pursuant to the California Lanterman Developmental Disabilities
Services Act. “Large” residential care facilities require approval of a Director’s
Permit (DP) in the A-1, A-2, A-3, MHP, R-3-6, R-3-10, SR, MU-1 and MU-2 zones.
Large residential care facilities are subject to development standards contained in
Section 20.400.110 of the Zoning Ordinance.
Emergency Shelters
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: Housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is
  limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be
  denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.
Emergency shelters are allowed without discretionary review in the I zone. The
purpose of the I zone is to provide a setting for the full range of indoor
manufacturing, distribution, warehousing, processing, and general service uses that
are adequately served by vehicular arterials and utilities. In addition to the same
land use regulations and development standards that apply to all development
within the I zone (e.g., lot size, setbacks, building height, etc.), an emergency
shelter proposed in this district must comply with the following operational
standards found in Section 20.400.080 of the Zoning Ordinance:
     •   The shelter shall be available to residents for no more than 6 months. Staff
         and services shall be provided to assist residents to obtain permanent shelter
         and income;
     •   Adequate external lighting shall be provided for security purposes. The
         lighting shall be stationary, directed away from adjacent properties and
         public rights-of-way, and of an intensity compatible with the neighborhood;
     •   Onsite management of the facility shall be required during all open hours of
         operation; and,
     •   The emergency shelter provider/operator shall have a written management
         plan including, as applicable, provisions for staff training, neighborhood
         outreach, security, screening of residents to ensure compatibility with
         services provided at the facility, and for training, counseling, and treatment
         programs for residents.
The I zone includes more than 362 acres on 275 parcels. According to County
Assessor data, over 120 acres on 52 parcels have no reported improvement value
and are assumed vacant. Of these vacant parcels, 21 are larger than one acre in
size. The undeveloped I-zoned parcels could accommodate an emergency shelter
for at least 37 homeless individuals (identified unsheltered homeless population in
San Marcos as of January-February 2012), including at least one year-round
emergency shelter. The I zone is suitable for emergency shelters because:
     •   Shelters are compatible with a range of uses that are common in suburban
         communities and allowed in the I zone (e.g., government and corporate
         office buildings, places of assembly, and health and athletic clubs, etc.);
     •   Clusters of I-zoned parcels located along East Mission Road, East Barham
         Drive, and Las Posas Road are served by three different North County Transit
                                     City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-51

         District (NCTD) BREEZE bus routes that connect to regional transit, including
         light rail service;
    •    There are a mixture of existing uses in the I zone that include light
         industrial, manufacturing, warehousing, office uses, and non-industrial uses
         (a separate zone (I-2) exists for intensive industrial uses); and
    •    Although hazardous materials may be present and used on some of the
         properties within the I zone, the vast majority of parcels are not known to be
         constrained by the presence of hazardous materials.
Emergency shelters are also allowed within a religious place of assembly without
separate discretionary approval, subject to the standards of Section 20.400.080
and the following requirements:
    •    The primary place of assembly land use was authorized through a CUP
         approval;
    •    No rent of fees of any kind shall be charged for emergency shelter services
         offered to homeless persons;
    •    Within Residential Zones, emergency shelter accommodations shall be
         limited to 10 persons at a single time;
    •    Appropriate design accommodations for the emergency shelter was included
         in the original facility design, and listing of transitional housing as an
         accessory use was identified in the original CUP application;
    •    Operation of the emergency shelter use commences upon the religious place
         of assembly receiving a Certificate of Occupancy consistent with the
         operational commencement of the primary assembly use; and
    •    A person residing at the facility shall be limited to 60 days.
Transitional Housing
 Zoning Ordinance Definition: Buildings configured as rental housing developments, but operated under
 program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to
 another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less
 than six months. Transitional housing that is provided in single-, two-, or multi-family dwelling units,
 group residential, residential care facilities, or boarding house uses shall be permitted, conditionally
 permitted or prohibited in the same manner as the other single-, two- or multi-family dwelling units,
 group residential, residential care facilities, or boarding house uses under this code.
Transitional housing facilities meeting the Health and Safety Code Section
50675.2(h) definition are considered a residential use and allowed by right in all
zones that allow residential uses, consistent with SB2. These facilities are subject
to the same development standards and permit processing criteria required for
similar uses in the same zones.
Supportive Housing
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-52

  Zoning Ordinance Definition: Housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target
  population, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in
  retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and,
  when possible, work in the community. "Target population" means persons, including persons with
  disabilities, and families who are "homeless," as that term is defined by Section 11302 of Title 42 of the
  United States Code, or who are "homeless youth," as that term is defined by paragraph (2) of
  subdivision (e) of Section 11139.3 of the Government Code. Supportive housing that is provided in
  single-, two-, or multi-family dwelling units, group residential, residential care facilities, or boarding
  house uses shall be permitted, conditionally permitted or prohibited in the same manner as the other
  single-, two- or multi-family dwelling units, group residential, residential care facilities, or boarding house
  uses under this code.
Supportive housing meeting the Health and Safety Code definition in Section
50675.14(b), like transitional housing facilities, is considered a residential use and
is allowed in all zones that allow residential uses, consistent with SB2. Supportive
housing is subject to the same development standards and permit processing
criteria required similar uses in the same zones.
Senior/Age-Restricted Dwelling
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: Dwelling units or a residential development for the restricted purpose of
  serving and housing adults over a specified age. This use may include supportive medical and non-
  medical services directly affiliated with the treatment of on-site patients.
Senior, or age-restricted, dwellings are allowed by right in the MHP and SR zones.
The SR zone was created and applied to sites already developed with senior
housing. If a senior housing developer would like to use the SR zone, rezoning of
the property would be required. Senior developments require Site Development
Plan Review.
Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC)
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: CCRCs any establishment that offers a long-term continuing care contract
  that provides for housing, residential services, and nursing care, usually in one location, and usually for a
  resident's lifetime. All providers offering continuing care contracts must first obtain a certificate of
  authority and a residential care facility.
CCRCs are allowed with approval of a CUP in the R-3-10 zone, subject to
development standards contained in Section 20.400.110 of the Zoning Ordinance.
Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) Units
                                          City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-53

  Zoning Ordinance Definition: A facility providing dwelling units where each unit has a minimum floor
  area of 150 square feet and a maximum floor area of 220 square feet. These dwelling units may have
  kitchen or bathroom facilities and shall be offered on a monthly basis or longer.
SROs are a housing type that is considered suitable to meet the needs of extremely
low-income households. Buildings that provide SRO dwellings require a CUP in the
R-3-6 and R-3-10 zones.
Farm Employee Housing
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: Any living quarters, dwelling, boarding house, bunkhouse, or other housing
  accommodations, consisting of beds in a group quarters or units or spaces designated for use by a
  single-family or household, and which is for the exclusive occupancy of farm employees and their
  families in connection with any farm work or place where farm work is being performed, and the
  premises upon which they are situated.
The Zoning Ordinance identifies three agricultural zones and three residential zones
that permit commercial agricultural operations with approval of a DP. Consistent
with State law, farm employee housing up to 36 beds and 12 units is also allowed
with approval of a DP in these zones. A CUP is required for farm employee housing
with more than 36 beds or 12 units in these zones.
Lodging, Rooming House
  Zoning Ordinance Definition: A building containing three or more bedrooms or other rooms used,
  designed, or intended to be used, rented, leased, let or hired to be occupied or which are occupied by
  five or more individuals under five or more separate oral or written leases, subleases or any other
  contractual agreement designed to effectuate the same result, with or without meals, for compensation,
  as permanent guests pursuant to an arrangement for compensation for definite periods, by the month or
  greater term. A “Rooming House” does not require a property owner, or an agent, or a rental manager, to
  be in residence. A “Rooming House” may or may not have individual or group cooking facilities. A
  “Rooming House” may or may not provide free access to common living areas beyond the bedrooms or
  guest rooms. A “room” means any rented, leased, let or hired room, living space or other square footage
  within the building that is used or designed to provide sleeping accommodations for one or more
  persons. A property permitted accessory dwelling unit, second unit, or “granny flat” shall not be
  considered a rooming house if used, designed, or intended to be used, rented, leased, let or hired, to be
  occupied or which is occupied by two or fewer individuals under two or fewer written leases, subleases or
  any other contractual agreement designed to effectuate the same result, with or without meals, for
  compensation, as permanent guests pursuant to an arrangement for compensation for definite periods,
  by the month or greater term.
Rooming Houses are accommodated in the R-3-6 and R-3-10 zones, subject to CUP
approval. This housing type is often most suitable to meet the housing needs of
students and single residents. The Planning Commission considers rooming house
development applications.
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-54

Development Review Process
The City reviews all applications for development to ensure the construction of
projects that contribute in a positive manner to the community and improve quality
of life. Residential development projects typically undergo several types of
approvals— ministerial, discretionary actions (either with or without a public
hearing), and legislative actions. This section outlines the timeline for typical
residential development review and describes the permitting requirements and
procedures for Multi-family Site Development Plan (MFSPD), Site Development Plan
(SDP), Director’s Permits (DP), and Conditional Use Permits (CUP). Given the
housing growth experienced by the City prior to the economic downturn in 2008,
the City’s processing and permit procedures do not appear to unduly constrain the
development of housing.

Processing times for applications in San Marcos vary, based upon the scope and
type of project. The amount of time involved in processing applications depends on
the type of project, the applicant’s compliance with the City’s ordinances, and the
completeness of the applications. Certain types of applications/permits are
discretionary and require a public hearing, while others are processed
administratively. Through administrative approval, the applicant bypasses the
public hearing requirement and shortens the processing time.
Some projects may take an extended period of time for final approval. However,
these projects generally have significant environmental impacts, involve plan
amendments and rezonings, or need community workshops. The developers may
be responsible for delays by failing to provide information or requesting
continuances. Permit approval under these circumstances requires more time for
public notice, public hearings, and negotiation of design modifications to resolve
problems.
On average, “Case Review” of an application takes about 6 to 8 weeks of City staff
time and applicant dependent time. This period covers application review and basic
environmental review (e.g., exemptions and negative declarations). Projects with
potential to cause significant environmental impacts take additional time to process.
Site Development Plan (SDP)
SDP review applies to detached single-family projects within an approved Specific
Plan, all projects involving attached units, and all mixed use developments.
Projects proposing between 2 and 9 units require MFSDP/SDP through Planning
Commission approval. Projects with 10 units or more require SDP through Planning
Commission recommendation with final approval by the City Council. Projects that
require CUP approval by the Planning Commission/and or City Council are exempt
from the SDP review procedures. The purpose of SDP review is to ensure:
   •   That the development, buildings, or structures will conserve the values of
       adjacent properties and will not prove detrimental to the character of
       buildings or uses already established in the area;
                                City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-55

    •    That the proposed development will be properly related to its site and to
         surrounding sites and structures, and to prevent the erection of structures
         that would be inharmonious with their surroundings;
    •    That projects and structures subject to Site Development Plan Review are
         developed with due regard for the aesthetic qualities of the natural terrain
         and landscape and that trees and shrubs are not indiscriminately destroyed;
    •    That the design and exterior architecture of proposed structures will not be
         so at variance with either the design or exterior architecture of the structure
         already constructed or being constructed in the immediate neighborhood as
         to cause a substantial depreciation of property values in the neighborhood;
    •    That open space, parking areas, and landscaping are designed to enhance
         the visual and physical use of the property and to screen deleterious uses;
    •    Effective concealment of electrical and similar mechanical equipment and
         trash and storage areas, when feasible;
    •    Adequate improved access to all developments;
    •    That developments are in compliance with City adopted Design Manuals and
         guidelines; and
    •    Conformance with the City adopted General Plan, any applicable Specific
         Plan, and all provisions of the Zoning Code.
The reviewing body must make the following findings prior to approval of any site
development plan pursuant to Section 20.515.060 of the Zoning Ordinance:
    •    The project conforms to the General Plan, any applicable Specific Plan, and
         all provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and San Marcos Municipal Code;
    •    As feasible, the project preserves mature trees and will not unnecessarily
         remove trees and natural vegetation;
    •    The project will preserve natural landforms and ridgelines, does not include
         excessive or unsightly grading of hillsides, and otherwise will not adversely
         affect the natural setting;
    •    The project provides adequate buffering between residential and
         nonresidential uses, and otherwise is in the best interests of the public
         health, safety, and general welfare;
    •    The structure(s) and landscaping are in scale and harmonious with existing
         and future development and with the landforms and vegetation adjacent to
         and in the vicinity of the site;
    •    The structure(s) and landscaping create an internal sense of order, provide a
         visually pleasing setting for occupants, visitors and the general community,
         are appropriate to the function of the site, and provide safe and convenient
         access to the property for pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles;
    •    To the maximum extent feasible, the project includes the maintenance,
         rehabilitation and improvement of existing sites, structures, and landscaping,
         and will correct any violations of the Zoning Ordinance, Building Code, or
         other Municipal Codes that exist on the site;
    •    The design and location of signs are consistent with the character and scale
         of the buildings to which they were attached or that are located on the same
         site, the signs are visually harmonious with surrounding development, and
         there are no illegal signs on the site; and
    •    The project provides all required on-site and off-site public improvements
         deemed necessary by the Development Advisory Committee.
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-56

These findings apply to all uses that require SDP; no special or unique findings are
required for residential uses.
Director’s Permits (DP)
The DP enables the Planning Division Director to administratively review the
location, site development, and/or conduct of certain land uses. No public hearing
is required. A DP is required for the following residential uses:
    •  Farm employee housing up to 36 beds and 12 units within the A-1, A-2, and
       A-3 zones; and
Residential care facilities serving seven or more clients in the A-1, A-2, A-3, MHP,
R-2, R-3-6, R-3-10, SR, MU-1, and MU-2 zones.
The Director may approve, conditionally approve, or deny a Director’s Permit
application after making the following findings pursuant to Section 20.510.040 of
the Zoning Ordinance:
    •  Approval of the DP would not result in detrimental impacts to adjacent
       properties or the character and function of the neighborhood;
    •  The design, development, and conditions associated with the DP are
       consistent with the goals, policies, and intent of the General Plan, the
       purpose and intent of the applicable Zone, and the character of any
       applicable Specific Plan; and
    •  The land use allowed in conjunction with the DP is compatible with the
       existing and future land uses of the applicable zone, and the general area in
       which the proposed use is to be located.
These findings apply to all uses that require a DP; no special or unique findings are
required for residential uses.
Conditional Use Permits (CUP)
Land uses that require a CUP generally have a unique and distinct impact on the
area in which they are located or are capable of impacts to adjacent properties
unless given special review and conditions. The following residential uses require a
CUP:
    •  Continuing Care Retirement Communities within the R-3-10 zone;
    •  Rooming Houses in the R-3-6 and R-3-10 zones; and
       Farm employee housing with more than 36 beds or 12 units within the A-1,
       A-2, and A-3 zones.
The Planning Commission may approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove a CUP
application unless the application includes concurrent processing of a permit that
requires City Council action, in which case the Planning Commission makes a
recommendation to the City Council. The approving body must make the following
findings prior to approval, pursuant to Section 20.520.040 of the Zoning Ordinance:
                                City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-57

    •    Approval of the CUP would not result in detrimental impacts to adjacent
         properties or the character and function of the neighborhood;
    •    The design, development, and conditions associated with the CUP are
         consistent with the goals, policies, and intent of the General Plan, the
         purpose and intent of the applicable zone, and the character of any
         applicable Specific Plan; and
    •    The land use allowed in conjunction with the CUP is compatible with the
         existing and future land uses of the applicable zone, and the general area in
         which the proposed use is to be located.
These findings apply to all uses that require a CUP; no special or unique findings
are required for residential uses.
Development Standards
Development standards directly shape the form and intensity of residential
development by providing controls over land use, heights and volumes of buildings,
and open space on a site. Site development standards also ensure a quality living
environment for all household groups in the City, including special groups such as
lower- and moderate-income households and senior citizens.
Zoning Ordinance
New construction and alterations to existing structures and sites within the
residential and agricultural zones must conform to the development standards
summarized in Table 8-26 (A, R-1, and R-2 zones) and Table 8-27 (R-3 zones).

The maximum height of residential buildings in the A, R-1, R-2, and R-3-6 zones is
35 feet or 2 stories. Up to 45 feet and 3 stories are permitted within the R-3-10
zone. Based on recent project history, these maximum building heights are
sufficient to achieve 20 units per acre in the R-3-10 zone and 30 units per acre in
the R-3-6 zone.
The City has not established maximum lot coverage standards for residential zones.
In single-family neighborhoods, open space requirements are established by the
cumulative application of minimum lot size and setbacks that allow for a sizable
front yard, setbacks, and a backyard. In this manner, each home has adequate
open space and the setting is conducive and consistent with lower-density
residential settings.
In recognition that multi-family residences create a need for recreational amenities,
open space requirements apply. Each ground-floor unit is required to have at least
250 square feet of fenced patio or private courtyard area, and each second floor
unit must provide a minimum of 50 square feet of private open space within a
balcony or outdoor area. Common open space is also required for multi-family
development within the R-3 zones. Common usable open space or recreation areas
equal to 30 percent of livable ground floor area of all units area shall include
recreational amenities (enclosed tot lot, court facilities, pool, open lawn area, etc.)
based on the size of the complex.

The mixed use zones that allow residential uses (MU-1 and MU-2) are governed by
form-based codes, which focus regulations on the intended character and type of
place, with secondary regulations related to land use permissions. Form-based
regulations are intended to facilitate building placement, form and use,
complemented by landscape installation and parking accessibility that contributes to
the physical definition of streets, pedestrian pathways, and civic spaces.

     Additional building height up to 15 feet may be permitted by the Director of Development
   Services to allow for special architectural features and roof line variation as long as such
   variation does not exceed 15 percent of the area of the building floorplate and is not used to
   create additional leasable/habitable space.
University District Specific Plan
The University District Specific Plan also relies on a form-based code and regulating
plan to guide development within the district’s planning area. The specific plan
describes the following building types (that allow residential uses) for implementing
the form-based code:
     •    Mixed-Use Building A:              A multi-story building that contains a mix of
          commercial and residential uses. Along the front face, the ground floor
          generally contains store fronts for retail, dining, and entertainment uses.
          Upper floors generally contain residential units or office uses.
     •    Mixed-Use Building B:              A multi-story building that contains a mix of
          commercial, office, and residential uses. The ground floor generally contains
          storefronts, offices, or live-work units.             Upper floors generally contain
          residential units or office space.
     •    University Flats: Residential units within a multi-story building that includes
          forecourts and a central courtyard. The residential units may be apartments,
          condominiums, or student housing. Retail, live-work, or office space may be
          provided on the ground floor.
     •    Townhomes/Flats: Townhomes are multi-story residential units that are
          placed side-by-side and share side property lines with adjacent units. Flats
          are residential units that are stacked vertically to create a multi-story
                                       City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-61

            building.      Both townhomes and flats may be combined within one
            development. Building heights for townhouses and flats generally range
            from two to five stories. Creek side townhomes/flats have a separate form-
            based code than townhomes/flats proposed elsewhere within the University
            District.
   The form-based code and related development standards for each of these building
   types are summarized in Table 8-30.

Parking Requirements
Parking is an important development regulation in communities. Adequate parking
for residential projects contributes to the value of a project, the safety of residents,
and its appearance. However, excessive parking standards can pose a significant
constraint to the development of housing because it reduces the land and financing
availability for project amenities or additional units. Parking requirements for
residential uses in San Marcos are summarized in Table 8-31. Mixed use parking
requirements are provided in Table 8-32.

The provision of off-street parking can increase the cost of housing; however,
requirements in San Marcos are reasonable because the standards for multi-family
and mixed use development are equal to or less than requirements for single-family
detached dwellings (2 spaces per unit) and comparable to the parking requirements
established in the State density bonus law for affordable housing.                              Parking
standards in San Marcos are not considered a significant constraint to housing
development.

Flexibility in Development Standards
Development standards affect the financials of a residential project, both from the
revenue side (through achievable density) and through the costs of accommodating
specific development standards. However, there is no specific threshold that
determines whether a particular standard or combination constrains the
affordability or supply of housing. Many factors determine project feasibility.
Moreover, during the building boom of the 2000s, few development standards or
fees appeared to be a constraint. While prior sections discussed how to reduce
development costs, the following describes ways that the Zoning Ordinance offers
flexibility in development standards.
Planned Residential Development (PRD)
PRDs allow flexibility in residential development and design to supplement the
development standards of the residential zones, subject to approval of a Conditional
Use Permit (CUP). The PRD standards in Chapter 20.435 of the Municipal Code are
intended to encourage and facilitate the use of contemporary best practices for the
development of innovative, compact single-family and multi-family residential
neighborhoods in a range of configurations, which may include standard
subdivision, alley-loaded, cluster or small-lot development, or courtyard site plans.
Developers who apply for a PRD may deviate from the height, setback, building
separation, and parking requirements of the base zone.
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-64

Density Bonus Ordinance
The City’s Density Bonus Ordinance (Chapter 20.305 of the Municipal Code) allows
up to a 35 percent increase in density where units are reserved for lower-income
(minimum 10 percent) or very low-income (minimum 5 percent) units, or
condominium units are reserved for moderate-income residents (minimum 10
percent). Density bonuses are also available to applicants who donate at least 10
percent of their land for affordable housing (15 to 35 percent density bonus
increase) or when a childcare facility is involved (matching square footage
increase). Projects that are eligible to receive a density bonus can benefit from
other incentives, including reduced parking requirements and waiver or modification
of certain development standards. The Density Bonus Ordinance is consistent with
California Government Code Section 65915.
Lot Averaging
Lot averaging may be applied for single-family residential development of five or
more units in the A-1, A-2, A-3, R-1-20, R-1-10, and R-1-7.5 zones to reduce the
minimum lot size required by the applicable zone, subject to a CUP. Lot averaging
is intended to reduce the amount of required grading, thereby leaving more natural
ungraded slopes in the project area.
Alternative Parking and Reduction Measures
The Zoning Ordinance includes several provisions for alternative parking measures
or reduced parking requirements:
    •  Mixed Use Projects: A reduction may be granted based on the characteristics
       of the uses and a parking demand study determines a reduction is justified.
       A parking management plan may be required.
    •  Transit-Accessible: A reduction may be granted for multi-family and mixed
       use developments proposed within ¼ mile of local or regional transit lines or
       routes based on transit characteristics of patrons and employees of
       prospective uses documented in a parking management plan.
    •  Off-Site Parking for Multifamily Projects Within Mixed Use Development: At
       least 1 space for each residential unit shall be located on site; Other required
       parking spaces may be located off-site within 800 feet of the primary
       entrance to a site and connected via ADA-compliant pedestrian route not
       more than 600 feet in length may be used to satisfy a portion of the parking
       requirement. An off-site parking agreement and Site Development Plan
       Review or DP approval is required.
    •  Tandem Parking: Up to 10 percent of parking requirement for multi-family
       housing components of mixed use projects, subject to approval of a DP.
    •  Park Once Program: A “park once” parking strategy may be established for
       mixed use sites in a city-owned parking lot, parking assessment district, or
       other areas where opportunities exist to provide a centralized parking area,
       within a walkable distance of 1,320 feet if adjoining businesses and
       residential uses that encourages patrons to park once and walk to their
       destinations. City approval of a parking management plan and parking
       agreement is required.
                               City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-65

    •    In-Lieu Fees: Projects located within 600 feet of a City parking facility or
         within a parking assessment district may meet the off-site parking
         requirements through payment of an in-lieu fee.
Residential Growth Management
The City’s Growth Management Ordinance (Chapter 20.315 of the Municipal Code)
was adopted to implement the General Plan and to the projected growth of
residential, industrial, and commercial development. The ordinance requires that
all new development bear the cost of providing the public facilities and services
needed to effectively serve the new development. The Growth Management
Ordinance does not limit density of development or cap the number of residential
building permits that can be issued within the planning period. To the contrary, the
ordinance will ensure that public facilities and services are, or will be, provided to
serve future residential development anticipated by the RHNA.
Inclusionary Housing
The City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance, established in May 2000, requires
housing developers of one or more units to contribute to housing for extremely low,
very low-, low-, and moderate-income households as defined by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Developers of for-sale single-
family projects and rental projects of six or fewer units may pay an in-lieu fee in
accordance with Section 20.310.050 of the Municipal Code. In-lieu fees are
deposited into an interest-accruing account to provide housing opportunities for
target households. The City has the discretion to accept an irrevocable dedication of
land or other non-monetary contribution that is not less in value than the otherwise
required in-lieu fee if the non-monetary alternative furthers the goals and policies
of the Housing Element. Rental projects of 6 or more units may set-aside at least
15 percent of the units for the target households.
The Inclusionary Housing Ordinance exempts the following projects:
    •    Projects developed pursuant to the terms of a development agreement that
         existed prior to the adoption of the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance;
    •    Non-residential uses, except in the case of SROs;
    •    Construction of a new structure that replaces a residential construction that
         was destroyed or demolished within two years prior to the application of a
         building permit, provided that the number of residential units is not
         increased;
    •    Second dwelling units;
    •    Density bonus units; and
    •    New residential rental projects, unless the developer has otherwise agreed by
         contract with the City to build affordable housing.
The impact on the cost of inclusionary housing certainly is arguable. The high and
rapidly appreciating housing market in San Marcos and the San Diego region
suggests that it is highly unlikely that the City’s inclusionary programs substantially
impact the price of market rate housing. The market is a very important
determinant of the price, the inclusionary “costs” would likely be absorbed as part
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-66

of market pricing mechanisms. The impact would be to somewhat diminish the
profit margin on a highly profitable enterprise without much impact on the overall
cost. For Housing Element purposes, the program is seen less as a cost factor and
more as an essential program for the development of affordable housing, not unlike
other housing related requirements (parking or open space).
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities have a number of specific housing needs, including those
related to design and location. Design needs generally include the removal of
architectural barriers that limit the accessibility of dwelling units and construction of
wheelchair ramps, railings, etc. Location needs include accessibility to public
transportation, commercial services, healthcare, and supportive services. Some
persons with disabilities need group housing opportunities, especially those who are
lower-income or homeless.
California statutes require that the Housing Element include an analysis of the
Zoning Ordinance, permitting procedures, development standards, building codes,
and permit processing fees to identify potential constraints for housing for persons
with disabilities. The following discussion addresses these issues and determines
that no specific City policy or regulation serves to impede the access that persons
with disabilities have to housing that suits their specific needs.
Zoning and Land Use
The General Plan and Zoning Ordinance provide for the development of multi-family
housing in the R-2, R-3-6, R-3-10, MU-1, and MU-2 zones. Traditional multi-family
housing for persons with special needs, such as apartments for the disabled, are
considered regular residential uses permitted by right in these zones. The City’s
land use policies and zoning provisions do not constrain the development of such
housing.
Under State Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act (aka Lanterman
Act), small State-licensed residential care facilities for 6 or fewer persons must be
permitted in all zones that allow single- or multi-family uses, subject to the same
permit processing requirements and development standards; San Marcos is
compliant with the Lanterman Act. “Large” residential care facilities serving 7 or
more clients require approval of a CUP in the A-1, A-2, A-3, MHP, R-2, R-3-6, and
R-3-10 zones. A CUP is also required for large residential care facilities proposed
on the first floor of a mixed use development in the MU-1 or MU-2 zones. A DP is
required if located in the SR zone or above the ground floor in a mixed use
development. Potential conditions for approval may include hours of operation,
security, loading requirements, and management. Conditions would be similar to
those for other similar uses in the same zones and would not serve to unduly
constrain the development of residential care facilities for more than 6 persons.
Occupancy standards for residential care facilities are the same as occupancy
standards for all other residential uses. The City has not adopted a spacing
requirement for residential care facilities.
                                City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-67

The Zoning Ordinance also accommodates transitional and supportive housing in all
zones that permit single- and multi-family uses. These facilities may serve persons
with disabilities.
Definition of Family
The Zoning Ordinance does not define “family.”
Building Codes
Building procedures within San Marcos are also required to conform to the 2010
California Building Code, as adopted in Title 17 of the City’s Municipal Code.
Standards within the Code include provisions to ensure accessibility for persons
with disabilities.     These standards are consistent with the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA). No local amendments that would constrain accessibility or
increase the cost of housing for persons with disabilities have been adopted.
Reasonable Accommodation
Both the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing
Act direct local governments to make reasonable accommodation (i.e.,
modifications or exceptions) in their zoning laws and other land use regulations to
allow disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For
example, it may be a reasonable accommodation to waive a setback requirement so
that elevated ramping can be constructed to provide access to a dwelling unit for a
resident who has mobility impairments. Whether a particular modification is
reasonable depends on the circumstances and must be decided on a case-by-case
basis.
Reasonable accommodation refers to flexibility in standards and policies to
accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities. The City’s zoning and building
codes, as well as approach to code enforcement, allow for special provisions that
meet the needs of persons with disabilities without the need for variances. The
City’s Reasonable Accommodation Ordinance is codified in Chapter 20.440 of the
Municipal Code.
The City’s Planning Division Director has administrative/ministerial authority to hear
and decide applications for reasonable accommodation as provided by the federal
Fair Housing Amendments Act and California’s Fair Employment and Housing Act to
allow reasonable remedy from zoning standards for individuals with physical or
mental impairment. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a
modification or exception to the rules, standards, and practices for the siting,
development, and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate
regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to
housing of their choice.
Reasonable accommodation applications are not charged a fee for review and the
Director must consider the following findings:
    •    Whether the housing, which is subject of the request for reasonable
         accommodation, will be used by an individual disabled under the Acts;
    •    Whether the request for reasonable accommodation is necessary to make
         housing available to an individual with a disability under the Acts; and
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-68

    •   Whether the requested accommodation would impose an undue financial or
        administrative burden on the jurisdiction;
    •   Whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental
        alteration in the nature of a City program or law, including but not limited to
        land use and zoning;
    •   Potential impact on surrounding uses;
    •   Physical attributes of the property and structures; and
    •   Alternative reasonable accommodations which may provide an equivalent
        level of benefit.
Development Standards
ADA accessible features or structures required for accessibility are permitted to
encroach into any required setback consistent with applicable Building Codes,
pursuant to Section 20.215.050(B) of the Zoning Ordinance.                   This provision
obviates the need for homeowners and landlords to submit a separate and
additional application for reasonable accommodation.
Conclusion
Current and proposed planning policies and zoning regulations have mitigated
potential constraints to the availability of housing for persons with disabilities. The
City has analyzed its Zoning Ordinance and procedures to ensure that it is providing
flexibility in, and not constraining the development of, housing for persons with
disabilities.
Development Fees
The City of San Marcos charges fees to process plans submitted for residential
projects and to finance the provision of important services that are needed to
accommodate housing and population growth. Fees and exactions are used to
finance public facilities, roadways, water and sewer infrastructure, schools, and
other community services. Nearly all of these fees are assessed through a pro rata
share system, based on the magnitude of the project’s impact or the extent of the
benefit that will be derived. Failure to adequately plan for residential development
is a key reason why jurisdictions are so financially constrained today. Furthermore,
the City’s fees have not been found to act as a constraint to the development of
housing in San Marcos.
For new residential projects, developers in San Marcos may be required to pay one
or more of the following fees depending on the location, type, and size of the
project:
    •   Planning, Building, and Environmental Fees: The City of San Marcos charges
        developers standard plan check fees, fees for processing applications,
        building permits, tentative tract maps, environmental initial study, variance,
        conditional use permit, or other permits to pay for the cost of processing
        applications and conducting inspections for specific projects. This does not
        include additional fees paid by the developer for project-specific
        environmental impact reports.
                                 City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-69

    •    City Impact Fees: The City charges impact fees to finance new or expanded
         infrastructure and public facilities required to serve residents. The fee must
         have a reasonable relationship to the infrastructure costs and represent the
         marginal cost of improvements required to serve residents of the new
         residential projects. The City charges fees to offset impacts to public streets,
         drainage facilities, water quality, parks, and habitat.        Other fees and
         assessments may apply depending on the location.
    •    Regional Impact Fees:         Regional impact fees include sewer/water fees
         collected by the water districts and school impact fees collected by San
         Marcos Unified School District, as allowed by State law to finance the
         construction and expansion of schools to accommodate student enrollment.
         The water and school districts have the authority to set the fee levels; the
         City does not have any ability to adjust these fees.

Table 8-34 provides a fee worksheet for two prototypical housing projects based
on applications processed in the City. Altogether, developer fees for a prototypical
single-family subdivision are approximately $55,717 per unit.                        Fees for a
prototypical multi-family project are somewhat lower on a per-unit basis at
$33,632.

   Notes: Single-family prototype is a 2,249 square-foot home with 463 square-foot attached
   garage within a 57-lot subdivision. Fees include an inclusionary housing in-lieu fee. Multi-
   family prototype is a two-story apartment complex with 84 units and 143 parking spaces (107
   open and 36 covered). The average unit size is 1,000 square feet with a range of 565 square
   feet for one-bedroom to 1,320 square feet for a three-bedroom.
Planning and permitting fees are charged on an at-cost basis to cover staff services
and     administrative       expenses        for    processing      development      applications.
Development impact fees are required to provide essential services and
infrastructure to serve new residents. Impact fees are governed by State law to
demonstrate a nexus between development and potential impacts. State law also
requires the proportionality test to ensure the pro rata share of costs to provide
services and infrastructure by individual developments is reasonable.
The City recognizes that planning/permitting and development fees add to the cost
of residential development. To mitigate the impact of planning/permitting and
impact fees on the cost of residential development, the City uses HOME, CDBG, and
                                    City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-71

Inclusionary Housing In-Lieu funds, as well as other funding sources to gap-finance
affordable housing development.
On- and Off-Site Improvements
Site improvements in the City consist of those typically associated with
development for on-site improvements (fronting streets, curbs, gutters,
sewer/water, and sidewalks), and off-site improvements (drainage, parks, traffic,
schools, and sewer/water). These improvements are required dependent on the
project. On- and off-site improvements add relatively little to total cost of housing,
but are costs associated with the provision of services necessary for the health and
safety of the public. Because residential development cannot take place without the
addition of adequate infrastructure, site improvement requirements are not seen as
a constraint to the development of housing.
San Marcos does not impose citywide or standardized infrastructure requirements.
Adopted policies in other elements of the General Plan call for street and sidewalk
improvement standards adequate to serve and protect public safety, but are
tailored to specific community and neighborhood design needs. This is expected to
result in requirements less stringent and less costly than if citywide engineering
requirements were imposed.           The improvements and exactions required for
residential development are limited to those improvements needed to allow the
project based on its impacts.
For vacant single-family residential developments, examples of typical on-site
improvements might include storm water detention facilities, roads, sidewalks,
perimeter walls, fire hydrants and emergency access drives, and recreational trails.
The Fire Department may require fire breaks and fuel management areas if a
project is within or near brush areas. Multi-family developments also may include
common open space and recreation areas, as well as lockable storage areas.
For residential projects, there is no fixed landscaping requirement as a percentage
of the total site. However, projects subject to design review, such as single-family
subdivisions and multi-family projects, are required to submit landscaping plans as
part of the overall project. Multi-family projects are required to maintain a
landscape buffer when adjacent to a rural residential or single-family zone. Specific
landscaping requirements may vary from city-wide standards in the various specific
plan areas. For projects not subject to design review (e.g., a new single-family
home on an individual lot), an approved landscaping plan generally is not required.
Open space requirements will apply to residential projects under certain
circumstances such as the presence of steep slopes, flood plains, sensitive habitat,
or other environmentally constrained features. The purpose of such restrictions is to
protect environmentally or geologically sensitive areas from the adverse effects of
development.
Open space requirements can be applied through Lot Area Averaging and Planned
Residential Development (PRD) projects. A primary purpose for lot averaging and
PRD projects is to allow design flexibility to protect sensitive areas and significant
topographic features while maintaining the ability to achieve planned densities.
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-72

Open space reservations also provide a recreational amenity for the residents of
such developments.
Typical off-site improvements for both single-family and multi-family developments
might include new curbs, gutters, and sidewalks; recreational trail facilities; road
improvements and traffic control needed to serve the development; street trees;
and landscaping. Utilities may need to be upgraded or installed to serve the
development, including water mains, sewer mains, storm water pollution prevention
measures, and undergrounding of electric utilities.
Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of San Marcos adopted the 2010 California Building Code with minor
administrative amendments. The Code establishes minimum construction standards
for residential construction and is structured to be the minimum necessary to
protect the public health, safety, and welfare, while not unduly constraining the
development of housing. The code is determined by the International Conference
of Building Officials and the state. No local amendment to the code has either been
initiated or approved that directly impacts housing standards or processes.
Code enforcement is conducted by the City and is based upon systematic
enforcement in areas of concern and on a complaint basis throughout the City. The
Code Compliance Section of the Housing and Neighborhood Services Division works
with property owners and renters to assist in meeting state health and safety
codes.
8.3.3 Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
Environmental Constraints
The City has identified areas within San Marcos where land development should be
carefully controlled.      For example, future residential development can be
constrained in areas with known or potential sensitive habitat, hillsides with steep
slopes, prominent ridgelines, flood prone areas, and geologic hazards, and areas
along the urban/wildland interface.
Biological Resources
Although the extent of native habitat in San Marcos is limited, several local natural
communities support unique habitats like vernal pools and sensitive plant and
wildlife species endemic to the region. Even the lush landscaping and ornamental
plantings in suburban areas can provide greenbelts of vegetative cover and
separation between developed urban and suburban areas and natural communities.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has identified critical habitat to protect four
species: the thread-leaved brodiaea, the spreading navarretia, the San Diego fairy
shrimp, and the coastal California gnatcatcher. Portions of the City’s planning area,
which includes the Sphere of Influence, are identified as a subarea in SANDAG’s
Multiple Habitat Conservation Program (MHCP). In addition, other portions of the
                                City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-73

planning area occur within the boundaries of the County of San Diego’s North
County Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP).
Sensitive habitats and sensitive species are federal-, state- or local-listed species
that are afforded a higher level of protection because of their status. Applications
for development with potential to impact these habitats will have to demonstrate
that proposed projects will not impact biological resources or implement mitigation
measures for any possible negative effects. Permit authorization from regulatory
agencies and mitigation would be required if a proposed project were to have the
potential to impact sensitive biological resources. Costs related to obtaining permit
authorization and mitigating impacts could be significant.
Hillsides and Steep Slopes
Where steep slopes (typically greater than 25 percent) are evident, development
difficulties often include the provision of proper access, utility service, and site
improvements. Development in these areas, where possible, must retain the
natural skyline, ridges, drainage courses, and natural outcrops. All significant
development is subject to environmental impact review procedures and the City’s
Ridgeline Protection and Management Overlay Zone development standards and
regulations (Municipal Code Chapter 20.260).
Flood Hazard Areas
Although some areas of San Marcos are determined to be within a Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-designated 100-year floodplain, 100-year
floodway, and/or 500-year floodplain, flood hazards are not anticipated to be a
significant constraint on residential development in the Housing Element planning
period. Most of the land within a FEMA 100-year floodplain is located in areas
designated for business or industrial development.              Furthermore, future
development will be subject to the City’s Flood Damage Prevention Overlay Zone,
which is intended to mitigate or avoid potential flood hazard impacts (Municipal
Code Chapter 20.255). This issue is also addressed in the General Plan Safety
Element.
Geologic Hazards
Geologic and seismic conditions in San Marcos are similar to conditions in other
local municipalities that lie inland from the coast and west of the mountains of
Cleveland National Forest. No active or potentially active faults traverse the City;
however, nonactive faults may be present and potential surface and blind thrust
faults may impact the City. Earthquake ground-shaking potential from surface
faults in the region is relatively low. Impacts of an earthquake include potential
liquefaction in relatively small but populous portions of the City identified in the
General Plan. An evaluation of these areas is recommended to be included in a
required environmental review prior to development and, as appropriate, avoidance
or mitigation measures would be required to reduce any potential hazard.
Wildland Fires
Much of the land within the San Marcos city limits is characterized by
wildland/urban interface (WUI). WUI areas have steep slopes, limited precipitation,
and plenty of available fuel/combustible plant material. In an effort to reduce the
threat posed by wildland fire events, the San Marcos Fire Department completed a
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-74

comprehensive assessment of WUI fire hazards and prepared a Community Wildfire
Protection Plan (CWPP). In accordance with the CWPP and Zoning Ordinance, all
new development in identified community hazard areas requires a Fuel
Management Plan. This includes clearing and maintaining defensible space of 100 to
150 feet around structures, depending on the structure and vegetation type.
Safety development and fuel reduction zones will continue to be addressed by
developers and the Fire Department as outlined by the CWPP or applicable City
ordinances. This issue is also addressed in the Safety Element.
Infrastructure Constraints
Another factor adding to the cost of new construction is the provision of adequate
infrastructure: major and local streets; curbs, gutters, and sidewalks; water and
sewer lines; storm drains; and street lighting. All of these improvements are
required to be built or installed in conjunction with new development. In most
cases, these improvements are dedicated to the City, which is then responsible for
their maintenance. The cost of these facilities is borne by developers, added to the
cost of new housing units, and eventually passed on to the homebuyer or property
owner.      As noted in the Resources section of this Housing Element, public
infrastructure and services are available, or are programmed to be made available,
for all the sites included in the inventory, including the capacity to accommodate its
total share of the regional housing need (RHNA).
Water and Sewer
San Marcos’ water supply and services are provided primarily by Vallecitos Water
District (VWD). Limited portions of the Business/Industrial District and College
Area Neighborhood are served by Vista Irrigation District (VID), and a very small
portion of the planning area is served by Olivenhein Municipal Water District
(OMWD) and Rincon Water District (RWD). VWD and VID both updated their Urban
Water Management Plans (UWMP) in June 2010 to assess current and future
demand for water, facilities, and storage.           The 2010 UWMPs indicate that the
districts expect to have adequate water supply available to meet the projected
demand within their jurisdictions through 2030 due to facility developments or
expansions and/or meeting State-mandated water conservation goals.
Wastewater services for the majority of the planning area are provided by VWD.
VWD utilizes two wastewater treatment facilities, a land outfall, and a sludge
pipeline to treat and convey wastewater flows: the Encina Water Pollution Control
Facility (EWPCF) and the Meadowlark Water Reclamation Facility (MRF). The
Vallecitos Water District Master Plan projects that wastewater generation from land
uses consistent with the City’s recently adopted General Plan would exceed the
district’s current treatment capacity. These needs are addressed through master
planning and phasing efforts. General Plan policies aimed at reducing the impacts
on wastewater quality standards and wastewater facilities direct the City to work
closely with local service providers to ensure that an adequate wastewater system
for existing and future development is in place, and ensure development approval is
related to commitments for the construction of primary wastewater systems.
Furthermore, will-serve letters cannot be issued for development unless treatment
facilities are in place.     With VWD coordinating its planning and construction
                                 City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-75

consistent with General Plan land use policy, future needs, including the 2013-2021
RHNA, can be met.
Senate Bill 1087 (enacted 2006) requires that water providers develop written
policies that grant priority to proposed development that includes housing
affordable to lower income households.             The legislation also prohibits water
providers from denying or conditioning the approval of development that includes
housing affordable to lower-income households, unless specific written findings are
made. Senate Bill 1087 also mandates priority sewage collection and treatment
service to housing developments providing units affordable to lower income
households. The Development Services Department will provide a copy of the
adopted 2013-2021 Housing Element to the VWD, VID, RWD, and OMWD within 30
days of adoption.        The Development Services Department will continue to
coordinate with the VWD, VID, RWD, and OMWD to ensure priority service provision
to affordable housing developments.
Community Facilities Districts
On June 7, 1988, voters in San Marcos approved Proposition “R” to ensure that
adequate public facilities and services are available to meet the needs created by
new development. To finance these facilities and services, it became necessary for
the City to form Community Facilities Districts (CFDs). The City has several CFDs
to finance a variety of public facilities required to serve new development, including
street improvements, sewer lines, water lines and facilities, drainage facilities,
schools, parks, lighting and landscaping, and congestion management.
Although the costs associated with CFDs could increase the overall cost to provide
new housing in San Marcos, implementation provides a means of orderly and
efficient provision public facilities to serve new development. Therefore, the
benefits of Public Facilities Financing Plan for new development greatly outweigh
the cost constraints.

8.4 Housing Resources
State law requires that jurisdictions provide an adequate number of sites to allow
for and facilitate the production of their regional share of housing. To determine
whether a jurisdiction has sufficient land to accommodate its share of regional
housing needs for all income groups, that jurisdiction must identify “adequate
sites.” Under State law (California Government Code section 65583[c][1]),
adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and development standards—with
services and facilities—needed to facilitate and encourage the development of a
variety of housing for all income levels.
The resources available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation of
housing in San Marcos are addressed here. This section provides an overview of
available sites for future housing development, and evaluates how these resources
can work toward satisfying future housing needs. Also discussed are the financial
and administrative resources available to support affordable housing. Per State
law, this section also covers energy conservation opportunities.
8.4.1 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
California General Plan law requires each city and county to have land zoned to
accommodate its fair share of the regional housing need. HCD allocates a numeric
regional housing goal to the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG).
SANDAG is then mandated to distribute the housing goal among the city and county
jurisdictions in the region. This share for the SANDAG region is known as the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation, or RHNA. The major goal of the RHNA is to
assure a fair distribution of housing among cities and the County within the San
Diego region so that every community provides for a mix of housing for all
economic segments. The housing allocation targets are not building requirements;
rather, they are planning goals for each community to accommodate through
appropriate planning policies and land use regulations. Allocation targets are
intended to assure that adequate sites and zoning are made available to address
anticipated housing demand during the planning period.
The RHNA for the SANDAG region was adopted in October 2011. This RHNA covers
an 11-year planning period (January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2020) 9 and is
divided into four income categories: very low, low, moderate, and above moderate.
As determined by SANDAG, the City of San Marcos’ fair share allocation is 4,183
new housing units during this planning cycle, with the units divided among the four
income categories as shown in Table 8-35.
  The Housing Element planning period differs from the RHNA Planning period. The Housing
9
Element covers the planning period of April 30, 2013 through April 30, 2021.

              Source: San Diego Association of Governments
              Note: Pursuant to AB 2634, local jurisdictions are also required to
              project the housing needs of extremely low-income households (0-
              30% AMI). In estimating the number of extremely low-income
              households, a jurisdiction can use 50% of the very low-income
              allocation or apportion the very low-income figure based on Census
              data. There are 5,825 extremely low- and very low-income
              households, with extremely low-income households comprising
              44.6% of the total. Therefore, the City’s very low-income RHNA of
              1,043 units can be split into 465 extremely low-income and 578 very
              low-income units.
Progress towards the RHNA
Since the RHNA uses January 1, 2010 as the baseline for growth projections for the
2013-2020 planning period, jurisdictions may count toward the RHNA housing units
developed, under construction, or approved since January 1, 2010. Since January
2010, 1,731 housing units have been developed, under construction, or approved in
San Marcos (Table 8-36). These units have the following income distribution: 207
very low-income units, 86 low-income units, 920 moderate-income units, and 518
above moderate-income units.
Affordability of Units Credited Towards the RHNA
Units credited towards the RHNA are distributed among the four affordability groups
(extremely/very low, low, moderate, and above moderate) based on affordability
restrictions (as is the case with affordable housing projects) or housing cost for
those specific types of units. For example, the market rate rents and sale prices for
apartments and condominiums fall within levels affordable to the households
earning moderate incomes (81-120% AMI) and are allocated as such.
According to the 2012 San Diego County Apartment Association Spring Vacancy and
Rental Rate Survey, the weighted average rents reported were $591 for studio
apartment units, $883 for 1-bedroom apartments, $1,137 for 2-bedroom
apartments, and $1,477 for apartments with three or more bedrooms. Based on
this data and the housing affordability thresholds shown in Table 8-17 of the
Needs Assessment, apartment units and second units are affordable to moderate-
income (81-120% AMI) households.
Condominium units are considered entry-level homes and based on pricing are
allocated as affordable to moderate-income households. The 2012 the median price
                                  City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-79

for condominiums sold in the City was $233,913. This price is well within the
affordability level for a 3-person, moderate-income family and is allocated as such.
As the maximum affordable price for a 3-person, moderate-income family to
purchase a home (as shown in Table 8-17, of the Needs Assessment) is $362,901,
even if the condominiums were priced significantly higher, they would still be
considered affordable. The market rate cost of single-family units and off-campus
student housing is considered affordable to above-income households.
Units Constructed or Under Construction
According to City building permit records, since January 1, 2010, 1,087 new units
have been constructed or are under construction in San Marcos, of which 653 units
are affordable to lower-income households (extremely low income to moderate
income households) based on affordability restrictions or market rate rents that fall
within affordable levels). Constructed/under construction units include the
following:
    •    The 108-unit Campus Pointe II mixed-use development (located at Twin
         Oaks Valley Road and Village Drive) was under construction as of January
         2013. The development will be comprised of one and two-bedroom units.
         Rental rates have not yet been established. While the units at Campus Pointe
         II will be rented at market-rate prices, based on housing affordability
         thresholds shown in Table 8-17, the units are allocated in the RHNA credits
         as affordable to moderate-income (81-120% AMI) households.
    •    Westlake Village is a 105-unit affordable, mixed use development (divided
         into two phases) with 6,140 square feet of ground floor retail space on a
         4.84-acre property on the south side of Autumn Drive, east of Knoll Road.
         Phase I of the development (49 units) was under construction as of January
         2013, and permits for Phase II have already been issued. The project utilized
         a 28.8 percent density bonus and was funded through redevelopment funds
         prior to the termination of redevelopment by the State of California; the
         project received a Low Income Housing Tax Credit.
    •    The Quad is a student housing facility located across from California State
         University, San Marcos. The development is privately owned but affiliated
         with the University and governed by University policies. Phase I of the
         development has been completed and includes 61 units (289 beds). As of
         January 2013 Phase II was under construction with 49 units (308 beds).
         Phase III is approved for 64 units, and the City is processing building permit
         applications.
    •    Candera is a market-rate project consisting of 50 condominiums and eight
         single-family homes. The units are located on the west side of Bougher Road.
         The development was approved in January 2011 and was under construction
         as of early 2013.
    •    Also included in the credits are two second units that are allocated as
         affordable to moderate-income households. While the City does not collect
         rental information on these units, rents for similar units fall within the
         affordable levels for small moderate-income households.

*Note: These units do not have affordability restrictions. Market rate rents and sale prices for
apartments and condominiums fall within levels affordable to the households earning moderate
incomes (81-120% AMI) and are allocated as such.
Units Entitled/Approved
Based on City records, since January 1, 2010, 644 new units have been approved in
San Marcos, of which 560 are affordable to lower-income households (extremely
low income to moderate income households; based on affordability restrictions or
market rate rents that fall within affordable levels). Units approved but not yet
constructed include the following:
    •  Promenade at Creekside is an affordable mixed use development that
       includes 105 affordable units, one managers unit, and 26,491 square feet of
       commercial space. The projected is located in the 214-acre San Marcos Creek
       District, a mixed use district that will including housing, shops and offices,
       along with a linear park and 73-acre preserve along San Marcos Creek. The
       project was approved in December of 2011.
    •  The Parkview Apartments are within a mixed use development and include
       6,490 square feet of ground floor retail space, 82 affordable apartment units,
       and one manager’s unit on a 4.01-acre property on Chinaberry Lane, south
       of Autumn Drive. The development includes one to three-bedroom units and
       70,000 square feet of green space.
                                  City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-81

    •    Palomar Station is a 15-acre mixed use project consisting of 370
         apartment/condominium homes, plus 30,000 square feet of stand-alone
         retail space. The development is located across from Palomar College and
         near the Sprinter Light Rail station. While the units are expected to be rented
         at market-rate prices, based on average condominium sale prices in 2012 the
         units are allocated as affordable to moderate-income households.
    •    TSM470 is a 22-lot single-family development approved December 2012.
         The development will include 2 very low-income, affordable for-sale homes.
         The development utilized a 35 percent density bonus.
    •    Also approved is the final phase (64 units/302 beds) of The Quad student
         housing development. The development is privately owned but affiliated with
         the University and governed by University policies. Phase II was under
         construction as of January 2013. When complete, all three phases of the
         project will provide a total of 174 units and 899 beds)
Remaining RHNA
The City has already achieved approximately one-third of its RHNA with housing
units constructed, under construction, or approved. Specifically, 1,731 units have
been constructed, under construction, or approved. With these credits, the City has
fulfilled its allocation of moderate income units and has a remaining RHNA of 2,452
units (836 extremely low/very low income units, 707 low income units, and 909
above moderate income units).

8.4.2 Residential Sites Inventory
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the Housing Element that the
land inventory is adequate to accommodate that jurisdiction’s share of the region’s
projected growth. Due to a healthy building record, the City has met a significant
portion of its identified regional need. The City has a remaining RHNA of 2,452 units
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-82

in the extremely/very low, low, and above-moderate income categories. The City
has many residential development opportunities with sufficient capacity to meet
and exceed the identified housing need (Figure 8-6). The opportunities shown here
consist predominantly of vacant sites with proposed developments, general
scattered vacant sites, and vacant land within two mixed use specific plan areas.
Altogether, these sites ensure that adequate sites beyond the remaining RHNA are
provided for in the planning period. There are no identified constraints on these
sites that would prevent development or reuse during the Housing Element period.
Sites Inventory Considerations
Realistic Capacity
Consistent with HCD Guidelines, methodology for determining realistic capacity on
each identified site must account for land use controls and site improvements. A
realistic density calculation of 80 percent of the maximum density has been applied
to non-mixed use sites outside of Specific Plan areas. The 80 percent realistic
capacity figure is also consistent with development standards in urbanized areas
such as San Marcos where required site improvements and standards are conducive
to achieving higher densities. Achievable density on a property is often influenced
by how much a developer is willing to spend on a development, which is beyond the
discretion of the local agency. In a tight housing market, achieving maximum
density is financially feasible because the developer is able to recuperate the
investment even at high density products that do not usually command the highest
market value.
The realistic capacity for mixed use development is based on a density of 30 units
per acre. The Mixed Use 1 allows for a maximum density of 30 units per acre, and
the Mixed Use 2 designations allow for a maximum density of 45 units per acre.
Mixed use designations in Specific Plan Areas do not have established densities for
mixed use developments. To establish a realistic capacity for mixed use
development, typical densities of existing and proposed mixed use developments
was examined. Table 8-38 shows that built and approved mixed use developments
in San Marcos have achieved densities of 19 to 59 units per acre. Reflecting the
high demand for housing in the community, densities for mixed use developments
that are in the preliminary planning stages (not yet approved) range from 17.7 to
over 100 units per acre. Table 8-38 lists 10 built or approved mixed use projects
and 3 proposed mixed use projects. Of these projects, 9 are affordable housing
developments. The average density based on total units and total acres for the
developments is 32.9 units per acre. Based on this substantial mixed use
development history in San Marcos, the assumption that new mixed use
development may occur at densities of at least 30 units per acre represents a
realistic and reasonable assumption.

*Density for proposed/tentative projects is shown to demonstrate the types of densities developers have
expressed interest in developing in San Marcos. In some cases the density will change as the development
process moves forward. The densities are shown solely for the purpose of demonstrating typical densities
for constructed, approved, and proposed mixed use developments and no guarantees of approval are
intended.
   Zoning Appropriate to Accommodate Housing Affordable to Lower-Income
   Households
   The capacity of sites that allow development densities of at least 30 units per acre
   are credited toward the lower-income RHNA based on State law. The California
   Government Code states that if a local government has adopted density standards
   consistent with the population based criteria set by State law (at least 30 units per
   acre for San Marcos), HCD is obligated to accept sites with those density standards
   (30 units per acre or higher) as appropriate for accommodating the jurisdictions
   share of regional housing need for lower-income households. Per Government Code
   Section 65583.2(c)(3)(B), the City’s Mixed Use and Medium High Density and High
   Density designations are consistent with the default density standard (30 units per
   acre) for metropolitan jurisdictions such as San Marcos and therefore considered
   appropriate to accommodate housing for lower-income households.
   City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-86

        Additionally, developments in San Marcos have demonstrated that affordable
        housing can be constructed at substantially less than the densities normally
        associated with affordable housing due to the City’s aggressive and diverse set of
        affordable housing programs. The City also addresses this issue through rezoning of
        commercially zoned lands for affordable housing construction, rezoning to specific
        plan area to obtain greater density flexibility, and specific plan requirements that
        include conditions for the provision of affordable units.
        A significant number of affordable housing developments in the City have been
        constructed at densities lower than the 30 units per acre density standard set by
        the State. Specifically, affordable housing (with units affordable to extremely, very
        low, and low-income households) has been developed most commonly in the zones
        with densities ranging from 15 to 20 units per acre. Table 8-39 presents a sample
        history of affordable developments in the City. Densities in the developments
        presented ranged from 4.81 units per acre at Firebird Manor (due to a significant
        portion of the property being set aside for habitat preservation) to 40 units per acre
        at Rancho Santa Fe village, a mixed use affordable development. The actual
        densities at these developments average 22.8 units per acre.
        The City’s record of producing affordable housing at lower densities is best
        exemplified in the Richmar area. Located in this neighborhood are several of
        affordable developments, including Westlake Village, Autumn Terrace, Firebird
        Manor, Villa Serena, Ventaliso, Mariposa, and Royal Oaks, among others. The City’s
        effort to provide quality, affordable housing in this high-need area significantly
        improved the quality of lives for residents in this formerly dilapidated and crime-
        ridden neighborhood. Many of the developments in this area were built on land
        designated for residential uses in the 15 to 20 units per acre range.

                                Units
       The City’s strong history of affordable housing development listed in Table 8-39
       demonstrates that affordable housing developments are and will continue to be
       achieved in lower density areas. Based on this track record, sites identified in
       zones allowing at least 8 units per acre are considered appropriate to accommodate
       housing affordable to lower-income households consistent with Table 8-40.

       Although the RHNA moderate-income allocation has been satisfied with credits from
       projects constructed, under construction, or approved since January 1, 2010, it is
       important to mention that much of the moderate-income need would have been
       met by private market construction of non-subsidized rental units and entry-level
       condominiums. As mentioned previously, based on the 2012 San Diego County
       City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-88

Apartment Association Vacancy and Rental Rate Survey and the housing
affordability thresholds presented in Table 8-17, apartment units and second units
are considered affordable to moderate-income households. In 2012, the median
price for the condominiums sold was well within the affordability range for a 3-
person, moderate-income family. Single-family units and off-campus student
housing are considered affordable to above-income households.
Proposed Development Sites
Six projects in various stages of planning are included as sites. These mostly vacant
sites are included although there is no certainty those units will be achieved, as the
proposals have not been approved. In place of using the total units included in the
proposals, a realistic density for the sites has been used to calculate realistic
capacity. Since there is no guarantee that the projects will be approved or
developed, using a realistic capacity ensures that in the case a proposed
development falls through, the sites are still available to accommodate those
identified units. At a minimum, the six sites can yield 690 units.
The status of the following projects is as of January 2013.
Davia Village (application submitted)
Located near Palomar College and the
Palomar College Station of the Sprinter
Light Rail system, Davia Village is a
proposed mixed use development that
includes 348 residential apartments,
close to 20,000 square feet of retail
commercial retail space, and 8,900
square feet of live/work units. The 11.6-
acre project is adjacent to Palomar
Station, an approved 370-unit mixed-
use development. The site is partially
vacant and includes an industrial
business, Signet Armorlite.              The
company will be relocating. While the
project is proposed at densities that are
appropriate to accommodate housing              Site: Davia Village
affordable to lower-income households
(30 units per acre), the developer has not included affordable units in the
submitted proposal and rental costs are not yet known. As such the units (348
total) are allocated as affordable to moderate-income households, as are other
multi-family units in this sites inventory.

East Gate Mixed Use Affordable Housing
(application under review)
East Gate is a proposed mixed use affordable
housing development located in the San Marcos
Creek District Specific Plan, a block and a half
south of State Route 78. The 2.8 acre project
consists of 42 units affordable to very low- and
low-income households and 11,285 square feet
of commercial retail space. The proposed
project is being developed by Affirmed Housing
Group. The realistic capacity of 42 affordable
units (14.7 units per acre) reflects the details of
the submitted application. The site is currently
vacant.
                                                         Site: East Gate
Main Street Plaza (application being processed)
Main Street plaza is a proposed mixed use development located in the San Marcos
Creek District Specific Plan, two blocks south of State Route 78. The proposed
development encompasses 6.5 acres and consists of 428 units at densities upwards
of 60 units per acre and close to 66,500 square feet of commercial space. As the
                                            proposal has not yet been approved, the
                                            realistic density used to calculate capacity
                                            reflects a conservative estimate based on
                                            the     City’s    history   of    mixed use
                                            developments (30 units per acre). Based on
                                            this density, the site has the realistic
                                            capacity of 194 units. While the project is
                                            proposed at densities that are appropriate
                                            to accommodate housing affordable to
                                            lower-income households, the developer
                                            has not included affordable units in the
                                            submitted proposal and rental rates have
                                            not yet been established. As a result, the
                                            units are allocated as affordable to
                                            moderate-income households, as are other
Site: Main Street Plaza
                                            multi-family units in this sites inventory.
The site is mostly vacant with three acres developed with an office and outdoor
storage for building materials.
El Dorado II (preliminary planning stages)
El Dorado II is a tentative mixed use, affordable
housing development proposed on mostly vacant
properties owned by an affordable housing
developer. The 2.5-acre project is at the
preliminary planning stages, and the details of
the housing are not yet known. The City envisions
a development of approximately 50 units. The
realistic density used to calculate capacity (20
units per acre) reflects the City’s history of             Site: El Dorado II
affordable housing developments. The site has a
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-90

realistic capacity of 50 units, although the number of units may fluctuate as the
project progresses. Most of the 10 parcels that comprise the site are vacant, with
two still containing active business operations.
Richmar Senior Village (preliminary
planning stages)
Richmar Senior Village is a tentative
senior affordable housing development
(potentially mixed use) proposed on
vacant sites owned by the City of San
Marcos. The parcels total 0.8 acres. The
City     anticipates    development       of
affordable housing, but a developer has
not yet been identified. The vacant site
is located in the Richmar Specific Plan.
While the City envisions a development
with upwards of 40 units (53.7 units
per acre), there are no proposals yet.
Therefore, a realistic capacity of 30
units per acre is used to reflect the
City’s    history    of  senior    housing Site: Richmar Senior Village
developments. Based on this density,
the site has a realistic capacity of 24 units although the number of units may
fluctuate as the project progresses.
UK Investments (application under review)
The UK Investments development proposal includes 35 rental apartment units on
two parcels totaling 3.4 acres. The site is located just west of Vineyard Road and
north of Borden Road. The proposal is in the initial development review stage. The
properties are designated for Low Medium Density Residential which allows for a
                                             maximum of 12 units per acre. One of the
                                             parcels that make up the site is currently
                                             vacant and one contains a single family
                                             home. The realistic density used to
                                             calculate capacity (80 percent of the
                                             maximum) yields a realistic capacity of 32
                                             units.    The developer has not included
                                             affordable units in the submitted proposal,
                                             apartment developments are not subject
                                             to    the   City’s     inclusionary    housing
                                             requirement, and rental costs are not yet
                                             known. As such the units (32 total) are
                                             allocated as affordable to moderate-
                                             income households, as are other multi-
                                             family units in this sites inventory.

 Notes:
     1. There are no established densities for projects in Mixed Use Designations or Specific Plan
         Areas.
     2. Davia Village: While the project is proposed at densities that are appropriate to accommodate
         housing affordable to lower income households (30 du/ac), the developer has not included
         affordable units in the submitted proposal, the units are allocated as affordable to moderate
         income households, as are other multi-family apartments in this sites inventory.
     3. East Gate: The density included in the submitted application is used in place of the 20 units
         per acre most typically seen for affordable housing developments.
     4. Main Street Plaza: As the proposal has not been approved yet, the realistic capacity reflects a
         conservative estimate based on the City’s history of mixed use developments. While the
         project is proposed at densities that are appropriate to accommodate housing affordable to
         lower income households, the developer has not included affordable units in the submitted
         proposal and rental rates have not yet been established, the units are allocated as affordable
         to moderate income households, as are other multi-family units in this sites inventory.
     5. El Dorado II and Richmar Senior Village: These projects are at the preliminary planning
         stages and the details of the type of housing are unknown at the time. The realistic density
         reflects the City’s history of affordable housing developments.
     6. UK Investments: The units are allocated as affordable to moderate income households, as
         are other multi-family apartments in this sites inventory.
Vacant Land Inventory (exclusive of Specific Plan Areas)
The inventory of vacant residential land (exclusive of those in proposed/tentative
developments and specific plan areas) in San Marcos totals 978.1 acres. The
majority of these vacant parcels are designated for lower-density development.
These vacant properties, identified in Table 8-42, have the potential to yield 1,611
units, 402 of which can facilitate lower-income housing, as defined by State law.

 Notes:
 1) Potential Units do not reflect straight application of maximum density to vacant land. A realistic
 density calculation of 80 percent of the maximum density has been applied to non-mixed use sites
 outside of Specific Plan areas. This estimate is based on existing patterns of development in
 residential areas.
 2) Affordability is allocated to the very low- and low-income categories as the properties are owned
 by an affordable housing developer or by the City of San Marcos and development of affordable units
 is anticipated.
Vacant Land in Mixed Use Specific Plans
State law (Government Code Section 65583.2) requires the City to “identify sites
that can be developed for housing that are sufficient to provide for the jurisdiction’s
share of regional housing need for all income levels (i.e. RHNA)”. Several Specific
Plans in San Marcos have remaining residential capacity. Two Specific Plans offer
residential development opportunities in a higher-density, mixed use environment:
the San Marcos Creek District Specific Plan and the University District Specific Plan.
Although the two specific plans combined offer opportunities for development of up
to 5,700 units, for the purpose of this Housing Element and reflecting the remaining
units needed to meet the City’s assigned housing need, only vacant residential
mixed use parcels within the Plan boundaries are included in this portion of the
sites inventory.
                                      City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-93

 San Marcos Creek District Specific Plan
 The San Marcos Creek District Specific Plan was adopted by the City of San Marcos
 on August 14, 2007. The Creek District is a 214-acre site located immediately
 adjacent to and west of the University District Specific Plan. It is envisioned as an
 active pedestrian-oriented and mixed use commercial center for the downtown area
 of San Marcos. The intent of the Specific Plan and the associated infrastructure
 improvements is to provide a framework that will support the creation of a
 “Downtown” area. In addition to accommodating the development of a new
 downtown for San Marcos, a key objective of this Specific Plan is to preserve and
 enhance important natural resources within the Creekside District, as the San
 Marcos Creek runs through the Plan area. The Plan includes a Habitat
 Restoration/Wetlands Mitigation Program that ensures that disturbed areas will be
 appropriately restored and/or replaced consistent with the requirements of the
 responsible resource agencies, and that remaining habitat areas will be enhanced.
 With respect to standards and regulations, the Plan’s form-based development code
 provides detailed regulations for all new development within the Creekside District.
 This code provides the guidance needed to implement the District’s intended urban
 form and character. All residential development in the District is subject to the
 City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.
Site: San Marcos Creek District Vacant Parcels
 Previously approved in the District is the Promenade at Creekside development, an
 affordable mixed use development that includes 105 affordable units, one
 manager’s unit, and 26,491 square feet of commercial space. As of January 2013,
 two applications were under review for mixed use developments within the District.
 The proposals include a 42-unit affordable mixed use development and a 428-unit
 mixed use development.
 While many properties with existing uses within the District are considered
 underutilized and have a realistic potential for redevelopment, the sites inventory
 analysis is limited to vacant properties designated for mixed use, as these have the
 best potential for achieving housing to address the City’s identified housing need in
 the near term. Within the 214-acre specific plan, there are currently 55.4 acres of
 vacant land intended for residential mixed use, of which 28.6 acres are owned by
 the City of San Marcos. Based on the City’s substantial mixed use development
 history, the realistic capacity calculations assume that vacant mixed use parcels in
 the San Marcos Creek District can and most likely will be developed at densities of
 at least 30 units per acre. The vacant mixed use properties in the San Marcos
 City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-94

district have the potential to yield over 1,600 units. In the event that only a fraction
of this development occurs, sufficient sites will still be available to fulfill and exceed
the allocated housing need. For this reason, only half of the aggregate realistic yield
has been used for the RHNA allocation. With a fraction (half) of the yield accounted
for, the sites in the San Marcos Creek District have the potential to produce 828
units.
University District Specific Plan
The University District is a 194-acre planned development near Cal State San
Marcos, located on both sides of Twin Oaks Valley Road just south of State Route
78. Approved in November 2009, the District was envisioned as a mixed use center
with a variety of housing types, as well as strong emphasis on pedestrian
movement and mass transit. As in the San Marcos Creek District, special
preservation and integrated design considerations have been given to the portion of
San Marcos Creek that runs east to west along the northernmost boundary of the
Plan area. Concentration of land uses within the core area of the project site, as
well as building orientation and placement along the northernmost boundary,
preserve the natural buffer between the project and Creek. With respect to
standards and regulations, the Plan’s form-based development code provides
detailed regulations for all new development within the University District. All
residential development in the District is subject to the City’s Inclusionary Housing
Ordinance.
Though        the     entire
District is zoned to be
mixed use, individual
neighborhoods          may
have an emphasis on
one or more uses, and
certain uses or building
types may be prohibited
that      are     otherwise
allowed        in     other
neighborhoods        within
the District. While many
properties with existing
uses within the District
are              considered
underutilized/underdevel
oped and have a realistic
potential                for Site: University District Mixed Use Vacant Parcels
redevelopment, the sites
inventory analysis is limited to vacant properties designated for mixed use, as these
have the best potential for achieving housing to address the City’s identified
housing need.
Based on Figure III.D in the Specific Plan document, vacant parcels that fall within
the districts that allow and encourage housing (in a mixed use setting) have been
selected. Although the boundaries of the land uses in the Specific Plan are
somewhat amorphous, this approach was used as a method to identify those parts
                                City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-95

of the specific plan within which housing is most likely to develop. Within the 194-
acre specific plan, 68.9 acres of vacant land are intended for residential mixed use,
of which 15.5 acres are owned by the City. Based on the substantial mixed use
development history in San Marcos, the realistic capacity calculations assume that
vacant mixed use parcels in the University District can and most likely will be
developed at densities of at least 30 units per acre. The vacant mixed use
properties in the University District have the potential to yield over 2,000 units. In
the event that only a fraction of this development occurs, sufficient sites will remain
to fulfill and exceed the City’s allocated housing need. For this reason, only half of
the aggregate realistic yield has been used to illustrate achieving the RHNA
allocation. With a fraction (half) of the yield accounted for, the sites in the
University District have the potential to yield 1,035 units.

 Notes:
 *Development within the San Marcos Creek and University Districts is regulated by a form-based
 code. No densities are established for residential uses within the two areas. The 30 du/ac realistic
 density is based on the City's history of mixed use developments.
 **In the event that only a fraction of this development occurs, it will still yield sufficient sites to fulfill
 and exceed the City’s allocated housing need. For this reason, only half of the overall realistic yield will
 be used to meet the RHNA allocation.
Environmental Constraints
The sites inventory analysis reflects land use designations and densities established
in the recently adopted Land Use and Community Design Element. Thus, any
environmental constraints that would lower the potential yield (e.g., steep slopes)
have already been accounted for. Any additional constraints that would occur on a
more detailed site review basis would be addressed as part of the individual project
review process. In the San Marcos Creek and University Districts, a strong
emphasis has been placed on preserving and enhancing important natural
resources such as the San Marcos Creek that runs through portions of both
Districts. In the Creek District, significant flood control improvements are planned.
The City’s capacity to meet its regional share and individual income categories are
not constrained by any environmental conditions.
Adequacy of Sites for RHNA
The City’s site inventory has identified capacity for 4,164 units, 2,955 of which are
on sites suitable for development of lower-income housing. Overall, the City has the
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-96

ability to adequately accommodate the remaining RHNA of 2,452 units. Table 8-44
summarizes the RHNA status.

8.4.3 Availability of Site Infrastructure and Services
Site development potential analyzed indicated in the sites inventory is consistent
with (and in most cases lower than) the development capacity reported in the Land
Use and Community Design Element. Full urban-level services are available
throughout the City and specifically to each site in the inventory. Such services are
more than adequate for the potential unit yield on each site. Specifically, water and
sewer service are available or are programmed to be made available for all the sites
included in the inventory, including the capacity to accommodate its total share of
the regional housing need (RHNA).
Water and Sewer Infrastructure
The Land Use and Community Design Element contains policies and programs
designed to reduce impacts associated with the construction of new water facilities
primarily by limiting the need for additional water supplies. These policies direct the
City to actively promote water conservation programs aimed at reducing demand,
and encourage exploration and use of deep underground wells to reduce reliance on
imported water. Implementation of these policies would regulate the construction of
new water facilities and establish impact fees to fund future extensions of reclaimed
water lines (for non-potable uses).
General Plan policies aimed at reducing the impacts on wastewater quality
standards and wastewater facilities direct the City to work closely with local service
providers to ensure that an adequate wastewater system for existing and future
development is in place, and ensure development approval is related to
commitments for the construction of primary water, wastewater, and circulation
systems. With service providers coordinating its planning and construction
consistent with General Plan land use policy, future needs, including the 2013-2021
RHNA, can be met.
The 2010 Urban Water Management Plans for service providers in San Marcos
indicate that the water districts expect to have adequate water supply available to
                               City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-97

meet the projected demand within their jurisdictions through 2030 due to facility
developments or expansions and/or meeting State-mandated water conservation
goals.
Wastewater services for the majority of the planning area are provided by the
Vallecitos Water District (VWD). The VWD Master Plan projects that wastewater
generation from land uses consistent with the City’s recently adopted General Plan
would exceed VWD’s current treatment capacity, and additional capacity will need
to be developed to accommodate future growth. These needs are addressed
through master planning and phasing efforts. Will-serve letters cannot be issued
for new development unless treatment facilities are in place.            With VWD
coordinating its planning and construction consistent with General Plan land use
policy, needs can be met.
8.4.4 Financial Resources
The City currently utilizes several sources of funding to assist in the provision of
quality housing to lower-income residents. The following section describes the
available funding sources: federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG),
federal HOME Investment Partnership Program Funds (HOME), and the Section 8
rental assistance program operated by the County of San Diego.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Grants
Several funding programs from HUD allow the City to fund community development
and housing activities. The City of San Marcos receives federal funding as an
entitlement jurisdiction for the CDBG program and also receives funds from the
HOME Investment Partnership (HOME) program, although HOME funds are received
through the San Diego County HOME Consortium.
For fiscal year 2012/13, the City of San Marcos expects to receive approximately
$606,858 in CDBG funds, $117,000 in HOME funds for programs, and $3,567 for
HOME program administration to carry out the objectives of the program. The City
has assumed consistent funding of HUD programs throughout the Housing Element
planning period. However, funding and appropriations of HUD programs are
uncertain and subject to change from year to year. Therefore, should funding for
these programs be reduced in the future, the City’s accomplishment projections and
planned activities would be affected.
Housing Choice Voucher Program
The Department of Housing and Community Development of the County of San
Diego is funded by HUD grants to provide rental subsidies to low-income families
through the Housing Choice Voucher Program (formerly known as Section 8 Rental
Assistance). The Housing Choice Voucher Program assists low-income families by
paying the difference between 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income and the
fair market rent standard for the area. The program assists over 308 income-
qualified families in San Marcos, with an additional 1,223 applicants on the waitlist
(as of January 2013).
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 8-98

San Marcos Successor Housing Agency
The elimination of redevelopment agencies in the State of California prompted the
creation of the San Marcos Successor Housing Agency (SMSHA) and an Oversight
Board to perform the City‘s housing functions, administer Recognized Obligation
Payment Schedule (ROPS), liquidate the Redevelopment Agency‘s (RDA) assets,
and pay off debts. The loss of the San Marcos RDA may significantly impair the
production of affordable housing in the future unless the City can identify an
alternate funding source. The status of obligated funds is unknown at this time.
SMSHA is waiting for the State Department of Finance to issue a Finding of
Completion that will indicate whether any obligated funds can be retained.
8.4.5 Administrative Resources
Agencies with administrative capacity to implement programs contained in the
Housing Element include the City of San Marcos and local and regional nonprofit
private developers. The City of San Marcos Planning, Housing and Neighborhood
Services Division, and Building Divisions take the lead in implementing Housing
Element programs and policies. The City also works closely with non-profit
developers to expand affordable housing opportunities in San Marcos.
Development Services Department and Housing and Neighborhood
Services Division
The Development Services Department consists of two divisions: Building and
Safety and Planning. The department coordinates development activity within the
City to ensure the planned orderly growth. Additional responsibilities include
program management of code enforcement, affordable housing, and assistance to
the City Manager’s office in the area of economic development. The Planning
Division administers the General Plan and zoning and environmental regulations,
and provides primary staff assistance to the Planning Commission. The Housing and
Neighborhood Services Division manages the City’s housing programs, code
enforcement, crime prevention, solid waste disposal and recycling programs.
Non-Profit Developers
The City collaborates with a number of affordable housing developers and service
providers to accommodate the housing needs of San Marcos residents. The
following are housing developers and service providers active in the City; several
are included in the State’s list of entities with the legal and managerial capacity to
acquire and manage at-risk projects.
    •  Affirmed Housing Group
    •  Bridge Housing
    •  Enhanced Affordable Development
    •  Hitzke Development Corporation
    •  National Community Renaissance (National CORE)
    •  Opportune Companies

8.4.6 Energy Conservation Opportunities
Energy-related housing costs can directly impact the affordability of housing. While
State building code standards contain mandatory energy efficiency requirements for
new development, the City and utility providers are also important resources to
encourage and facilitate energy conservation and to help residents minimize energy
-related expenses. Efficient energy use can be encouraged by changing customer
behavior, rewarding use of energy-saving appliances, and employing building
design and construction approaches that reduce electric power and natural gas
usage. The primary sources of energy in San Marcos are electricity and natural gas
from SDG&E. SDG&E provides technical assistance and incentives for residents and
businesses to increase energy efficiency through energy audits, appliance rebate
programs, and smart energy metering.
The City promotes sustainable building practices for affordable housing
developments. All affordable housing in the City is required to be built to LEED
Silver standards (certification is not required). The 100-unit Autumn Terrace is the
largest mixed use, multi-family development in the State to be certified LEED
Platinum. Platinum is the highest rating in the LEED green building rating system.
Building projects that have attained this rigorous level of certification are among
the greenest in the world. Project features include solar panels, special windows,
low-energy appliances, drought-resistant plants, and non-toxic pest control in order
to meet the stringent LEED Platinum standards.
The City’s commitment to energy conservation and addressing climate change is
also reflected in the General Plan. The primary avenues to address climate change
in San Marcos are through lowering of transportation emissions (through better use
of transit and walkable residential and commercial environments) and encouraging
energy conservation and efficiency (through energy efficient appliance, green
building, and sustainable water policies).
Specific programs in the San Marcos General Plan Conservation and Open Space
Element direct the City to:
    •    Encourage energy conservation and the use of alternative energy sources
         within the community (Policy COS-4.5)
    •    Promote efficient use of energy and conservation of available resources in the
         design, construction, maintenance and operation of public and private
         facilities, infrastructure and equipment (Policy COS-4.6)
    •    Requires City facilities and services to incorporate energy and resource
         conservation standards and practices as they are constructed or upgraded
         (Policy COS-4.7)
    •    Encourage and support the generation, transmission and use of renewable
         energy (Policy COS-4.8)
The Land Use and Community Design Element and the Mobility Element provide
further guidance for sustainable and energy efficient future development. These

elements establish policies and programs that encourage new development near
transit and in areas with existing transportation infrastructure; promote the location
of housing, jobs and recreation uses close to transit lines, bicycle routes and
pedestrian improvements; and strive to develop complete mixed-use streets that
are safe for pedestrians, bicyclists, and all travel modes.

8.5 Review of Past Accomplishments
To develop appropriate programs to address the housing issues identified in the 2013-
2021 Housing Element, the City of San Marcos has reviewed the housing programs
adopted in the 2005-2010 Housing Element (extended by law to cover through 2012),
and has evaluated the effectiveness of these programs in delivering housing services
and assistance. Table 8-45 summarizes the City’s quantified accomplishments for new
construction for the 2013-2012 period, Table 8-46 summarizes the City’s
acquisition/rehabilitation and conservation accomplishments for the 2005-2012
planning period, and Table 8-47 provides a detailed program-level assessment of
accomplishments under the prior Housing Element.

This section presents the goals and policies the City will implement to address
constraints and needs. The City’s overarching objective is to ensure that decent,
safe housing is available to all current and future residents at a cost that is within
the reach of the diverse economic segments which comprise San Marcos. To this
end, goals and policies focus on:
         1) Encouraging the development of a variety of housing opportunities;

            Policy 4.4: Balance the need to protect and preserve the natural

                         opportunities.
8.6.2 Implementing Programs
The City will continue to provide affordable housing through a variety of existing
and revised programs that were successful during the 2005-2012 Housing Element
cycle. These programs will also continue to be provided in “packages” so as to
provide the most effective combination of programs for the appropriate
development in accordance with the City objectives.
New Construction
Program 1: Land Use Policy and Development Capacity
The City of San Marcos has a remaining RHNA of 2,452 units for the 2010-2021
RHNA period after credits for constructed or approved units are taken into
consideration. The remaining 2,452 units include 836 extremely/very low-income,
707 low-income, and 909 above moderate-income units. The residential sites
City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 120

inventory consists of over 1,100 acres of vacant and developable land with capacity
to yield at least over 4,100 new units. These sites can accommodate the remaining
RHNA for all income levels through year 2020. The City will maintain an inventory
of available sites for residential development and provide it to prospective
residential developers upon request.
    Responsible Agencies:           Development        Services    Department,      Planning
                                    Division; Housing and         Neighborhood      Services
                                    Division
    Funding Sources:                General Fund
    2013-2021 Objectives:           Maintain an inventory of the available sites for
                                    residential development and provide it to
                                    prospective residential developers upon request.
                                    Monitor development trends to ensure continued
                                    ability to meet the RHNA as sites identified in this
                                    Housing Element are being developed.
    Timeframe:                      Ongoing implementation and           annual    reporting
                                    throughout the planning period
Program 2: Facilitate Affordable Housing Construction
Dissolution of the City’s Redevelopment Agency by the State in 2012 eliminated the
Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund (LMIHF), formerly the City’s primary
mechanism for providing direct funding support of affordable housing development.
Actions taken by the California Department of Finance (DOF) during the “meet-and-
confer” process and continuing reductions in federal funding of HUD programs such
as CDBG and HOME also constrain the City’s ability to offer committed funding
assistance to future affordable housing during the planning period. The City will
encourage qualified housing developers to pursue affordable housing development
in the City and utilize the following funding and regulatory incentives to encourage
affordable housing production in San Marcos:
      Collaborate with Affordable Housing Developers:                 Affordable housing
       developers work to develop, conserve, and promote rental and ownership
       affordable housing. An affordable housing developer can help meet the goals
       for additional housing by implementing or assisting with the implementation
       of programs described in this element. The City will continue to collaborate
       with affordable housing developers to identify potential sites, write letters of
       support to help secure governmental and private-sector funding, and offer
       technical assistance related to the application of City incentive programs
       (e.g., density bonus).
      Regulatory Concessions and Incentives: The City will continue to work with
       developers on a case-by-case basis to provide regulatory concessions and
       incentives to assist them with the development of affordable and senior
       housing. In a relatively small city like San Marcos, this is the most effective
       method of assisting developers, as each individual project can be analyzed to
       determine which concessions and incentives would be the most beneficial to
       the project’s feasibility. Regulatory concessions and incentives could include,
                                  City of San Marcos GENERAL PLAN │Housing Element │ Page 121

         but are not limited to, density bonuses, reductions in required parking, fee
         reductions or deferral, expedited permit processing, and modified or waived
         development standards pursuant to Chapter 20.305 (Density Bonus) of the
         Municipal Code.
        Redevelopment Agency Funding: The Redevelopment Agency was terminated
         by the State of California effective February 1, 2012. The Successor Housing
         Agency (SHA) was created on January 10, 2012 to administer the remaining
         San Marcos Redevelopment Agency housing assets. The City will use any
         remaining low income housing set-aside from redevelopment tax increment
         funds to provide the necessary financing. This remaining amount is still
         subject to final determination by the DOF following completion of the “meet
         and confer” process. Final determination by DOF is on a timeline that is
         unknowable at the present time, making accurate prediction of the outcome
         impossible. The remaining LMIHF may be absorbed by the State, or the City
         may be permitted to retain some of these funds. The City will use any
         remaining LMIHF to assist affordable housing development to the extent
         possible and allowable by DOF.
        Multi-Family Mortgage Revenue Bonds: The City will utilize multi-family
         mortgage revenue bonds for the development of affordable multi-family
         housing to the maximum extent feasible and allowable by DOF at a future
         time yet to be determined. Mortgage revenue bonds are bonds sold by the
         City to create a pool of money for subsidized mortgages. DOF staff has
         questioned the bond issuance even though it conforms to the law. The net
         effect of this DOF action is to render the bonds unusable pending a final
         determination by DOF at a time and manner yet to be determined. The
         bonds are serviced through a return rate on the mortgage or resold on the
         bond market. The City plans to develop as many low-income housing units
         as practically possible through this program, depending on the amount of
         bonds, if any, that DOF allows. If DOF does not allow any bonds, then the
         program will be terminated.
        Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC): The City will assist developers in
         gaining funding for the development of affordable housing through the LIHTC
         program. Investors receive a credit against federal tax owed in return for
         providing funds to developers to build or renovate housing for low income
         households. In turn, the capital subsidy allows rents to be set at below
         market rates.
        Affordable Housing Fund (In-Lieu Fees): Developers of residential projects of
         6 units or fewer must pay an in-lieu fee pursuant to the Inclusionary Housing
         Ordinance described in Program 3 (Chapter 20.310 of the Municipal Code).
         In-lieu fees are spent to provide housing opportunities for extremely low-,
         very low-, low-, and moderate-income households.

                                housing for lower-income households—especially
                                housing for extremely low-income households—
                                with site identification, supporting applications,
                                conducting pre-application meetings, assisting with
                                design and site requirements, and providing
                                regulatory incentives and concessions.

                                throughout the RHNA period
Program 3: Inclusionary Housing
The City will continue to implement the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (Chapter
20.310 of the Municipal Code), which requires the including of housing affordable to
lower and moderate income households within a project, or payment of an in-lieu
fee. The Ordinance is consistent with City policies and will help the City meet its
housing needs for lower- and moderate-income households.               The number of
affordable units that may be produced via the inclusionary program depends
entirely on the strength of the economy in the private sector and on how many
market rate residential units are ultimately built during the 2010-2021 RHNA
period. Any inclusionary in-lieu fees collected will be used to provide housing
opportunities for extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income
households.

Homeownership Opportunities
Program 6: San Diego Regional Mortgage Credit Certificates (MCC)
The City will continue to participate in the San Diego Regional MCC program. This
established program entitles qualified first-time home buyers to take a federal
income tax credit of a percentage of the interest paid on the mortgage used to buy
their home. The credit reduces the buyers' income taxes and increases net
earnings, thereby increasing the buyers' ability to qualify for a mortgage loan.

Program 7: Downpayment Assistance Program (DAP)
The City will continue to participate in the DAP program. This popular program,
when reinstated in 2013 following its suspension as the result of the State’s
dissolution of the RDA, will offer low-interest, deferred payment loans of up to
$56,000 for lower-income first-time home buyers using CalHOME as the exclusive
funding source. These funds are used to provide a “silent second” mortgage for the
purchase of a qualifying new or resale home, including qualifying manufactured or
mobile homes. This program may be used in conjunction with other homeowner
programs, and also including homes in the San Marcos Affordable Homeownership
Program (SMAHP) discussed below.

Program 8: San Marcos Affordable Homeownership (SMAHP)
The City will continue to offer homes to qualified home buyers at the rate at which
they are made available to the private sector under the City’s Inclusionary
Ordinance. This new program, initiated in 2012, offers deed restricted, sales price-
reduced homes to qualified home buyers in a “for sale” affordable housing venue.
Homes in the SMAHP may also be paired with a DAP loan, if the buyer is otherwise
qualified.

Rental Assistance and Conservation
Program 9: Housing Choice Vouchers
The City will continue to contract with the San Diego County Housing Authority to
administer the Housing Choice Voucher Program, which provides rental assistance
to eligible extremely low- and very low-income households (i.e., households
earning <50 percent AMI).

                                   throughout the planning period
Program 11: Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units
In 2012, 42 affordable housing developments were located in San Marcos, providing
approximately 3,142 affordable units to lower-income households. A large portion
of the affordable housing stock was created via the City’s inclusionary housing
requirement, which requires a 55-year affordability term. Another subset of
affordable units was developed by non-profit affordable housing developers, who do
not intend to convert their units to market-rate apartments. Also, the City has nine
mobile home parks with affordable, deed-restricted units that must remain
affordable through the foreseeable future. Consequently, no assisted housing
developments in San Marcos are at risk of losing affordability in the next ten years
(2013-2023).
Although the City has not identified any housing units at risk of converting to
market rate during the 2013-2023 period, City staff will monitor the status of
existing and future affordable housing. Should any of the properties become at risk
of converting to market rate, the City will work with property owners, interest
groups, and the State and federal governments to conserve the affordable housing
stock.

                                 •   Tenant Education: The California Legislature
                                     extended the noticing requirement of at-risk
                                     units opting out of low-income use restrictions
                                     to one year. Should a property owner pursue
                                     conversion of the units to market rate, the City
                                     will ensure that tenants were properly noticed.
   Timeframe:             Ongoing implementation and annual monitoring and
                          reporting throughout the planning period. Within 60 days
                          of notice of intent to convert at-risk units to market rate
                          rents, the City will work with potential purchasers using
                          HCD’s        current      list    of     Qualified      Entities
                          (http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/hrc/tech/presrv/),               and

Maintenance and Rehabilitation
Program 12: Residential Rehabilitation Loan Program (RRLP)
The City will continue the RRLP using HOME funds (federal HOME) administered by
the County of San Diego for a consortium of municipalities to which San Marcos
belongs, to provide funds for low interest/no interest loans for qualified
homeowners to rehabilitate substandard housing. Although the County of San
Diego administers the funds, the City is directly responsible for the planning,

Remove Governmental Constraints
Program 14: Monitor Changes in Federal and State Housing, Planning, and
Zoning Laws
State law requires that Housing Elements address, and where appropriate and
legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the maintenance,
improvement, and development of housing. While the 2013-2021 Housing Element
does not identify any significant governmental constraints to the development or
maintenance of housing in San Marcos, the City will continue to monitor its
development processes and zoning regulations to identify and remove constraints
to the development of housing. The City will monitor development within the R-3-6
zone and determine whether the cumulative application of development standards
in this zone could accommodate development at the upper end of the
allowable      density.     If   development        standards  are   found     to   be
constraining, the City will consult the development community to modify
the development standards as appropriate.
The City will also continue to monitor federal and State legislation that could impact
housing and comment on, support, or oppose proposed changes or additions to
existing legislation, as well as support new legislation when appropriate. The City
will also continue to participate in the SANDAG Technical Working Group and
Regional Housing Working Group, which monitor State and federal planning, zoning,
and housing legislation.       Special attention will be given by the City in the
minimizing of governmental constraints to the development, improvement, and
maintenance of housing.

                                   development at the upper end of the allowable

                                   constraining, consult the development community
                                   to     modify     the  development       standards     as
                                   appropriate.
    Timeframe:                     Ongoing implementation and annual reporting

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the Planning Commission of the City of San Marcos will hold a study 
session  on  February  21, 2013,  at  6:30  P.M.  in  the  City  Council  Chambers,  1  Civic  Center  Drive,  San 
Marcos, CA 92069 to consider the following: 
 
Project Title: 2013‐2021 General Plan Housing Element 
 
Description:  
The City is in the process of updating the General Plan Housing Element. The Housing Element is one of 
the  seven  State‐mandated  elements  of  the  General  Plan.  The  General  Plan  is  a  long‐range  planning 
document  that  sets  forth  policy  for  the  growth  and  improvement  of  the  City.    The  Housing  Element 
provides  an  assessment  of  the  existing  and  projected  housing  needs  of  all  economic  segments  of  the 
community.  The Element identifies sites that have the capacity to accommodate new development of 
various housing types.  Also, the Element presents goals, policies, and implementation programs for the 
preservation, improvement, and development of housing.  
 
Objective:  
The study session is a forum for City staff to receive input from the Planning Commission, residents, and 
other  stakeholders  regarding  the  content  of  the  updated  Housing  Element.    These  comments  will  be 
considered for integration into the Housing Element.  
 
Subsequent to review by the Planning Commission, the 2013‐2021 Housing Element will be submitted to 
the  State  Department  of  Housing  and  Community  Development  (HCD)  for  a  60‐day  review  period. 
During this time, the Element will remain available for review by the public. The draft Housing Element 
will be posted on the City’s website (www.ci.san‐marcos.ca.us), at City Hall, and at the San Diego County 
Library  –  San  Marcos  Branch  beginning  February  12,  2013.    For  those  persons    unable  to  attend  the 
study session, written comments can be submitted to the City by 5:30 P.M. April 30, 2013 (attn: Karen

BRIDGE Housing Corporation

                               ments on the City of San Marcos’ Draft Fifth Housing Element.

Paul Shipstead
U.S. Bank                      impact on the ability of the City to meet its affordable housing production goals. The Federation
                               respectfully requests that the Planning Commission consider taking actions today that will begin
Ex-Officio Members
                               to move these key items forward.
Susan Riggs Tinsky, Secretary
Executive Director
                                   1.   Endorse the California Homes and Jobs Act. We recommend that the City of San
                                        Marcos endorse SB 391, the California Homes and Jobs Act. This state legislation intro-
                                        duced by Senator Mark DeSaulnier would create a permanent source of revenue for the
                                        development and preservation of affordable housing throughout the state. The Homes
                                        and Jobs Act would leverage federal, state, and private revenue sources and create a
                                        permanent source of funding for affordable housing. This new source of revenue will be
                                        critical to replace now nearly exhausted Proposition 46 and Proposition 1C bond pro-
                                        ceeds.
                                   2.   Transit-oriented development. Draft Housing Element Policies 1.1 and 1.2 identify an
                                        emphasis on the development of affordable homes in proximity to transit and employ-
                                        ment centers as goals of the City’s housing plan. We applaud the City for including
                                        these concepts in the plan and encourage steps be taken to ensure that these policies
                                        are implemented. These efforts could include proactively acquiring or preserving land
                                        near transit for development of affordable homes and integrating affordable housing into
                                        proposed market-rate housing development. Studies have shown that providing afford-
                                        able homes in proximity to transit has many community co-benefits, including helping to
                                        reduce traffic and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of single passen-
                                        ger vehicles.
                                   3.   Inclusionary zoning ordinance. We applaud the City’s commitment to its inclusionary
                                        housing ordinance that requires a percentage of new units be set aside for low income
                                        households. Inclusionary housing policies provide the opportunity to develop mixed-
                                        income communities that allow cities to thrive. Unfortunately, the Palmer vs. City of Los
                                        Angeles court decision has led to some uncertainty regarding inclusionary housing poli-
                                        cies for rental apartments. In response to the ambiguity of the ruling, Assemblymember
                                            San Diego’s Voice for Affordable Housing
                                                                                                                       Page 8-154

         Toni Atkins has introduced AB 1229 to provide clarity to jurisdictions on inclusionary housing ordinances.
         This bill has the support of the Housing Federation and many other organizations, including the League
         of California Cities. AB 1229 will return local control to cities to implement their own inclusionary housing
         policies and we encourage the City of San Marcos to support this bill.
    4.   Boomerang funds. With Redevelopment elimination, the City will receive additional General Fund rev-
         enues that would have otherwise been dedicated in part to the creation and preservation of affordable
         housing. We urge the City to consider continuing to dedicate a portion of the funds returned to the City
         to help meet the need for affordable housing.
We thank you for consideration of these requests and look forward to working with you to increase the supply of
affordable housing in the City of San Marcos.
Sincerely,
Susan Riggs Tinsky

                                   League of California Cities, this bill has already passed in the Assembly and is likely to pass
                                   in the Senate and be signed by the Governor this year. AB 1229 will return local control to
                                   cities to implement their own inclusionary housing policies and we encourage the City of San
                                   Marcos to continue to implement a strong inclusionary housing policy for rental communities
                                   as soon as possible following passage of the bill.
                               2. Endorse the California Homes and Jobs Act. We recommend that the City of San Marcos

    market-rate housing development. Studies have shown that providing affordable homes in proximity to transit
    has many community co-benefits, including helping to reduce traffic and greenhouse gas emissions
    associated with the use of single passenger vehicles.
4. Off-site density bonus. The City’s density bonus program could be significantly strengthened by allowing an
    option to construct affordable homes at an offsite location. The provision of an offsite density bonus option
    would allow developers to pool their affordable units in a 100% affordable development in order to create a
    market-based funding program to support the financing of affordable housing and maximize the use of
    outside funding sources. We recommend that the City augment their density bonus ordinance to include a
    local program that allows developers to utilize the density bonus at an offsite location.
We thank you for consideration of these requests and look forward to working with you to increase the supply of
affordable housing in the City of San Marcos.
Sincerely,
Susan Riggs Tinsky
