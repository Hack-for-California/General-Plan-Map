plans that comprise the following elements:
     The Land Use Element designates the general distribution and intensity of land use and
         development contemplated within the land area included within Compton’s corportate boundaries
         and its Planning Area.
     The Housing Element details plans and programs for the rehabilitation and maintenance of
         existing housing in the City and the development of new housing to accommodate future demand.
     The Circulation Element identifies the location and extent of existing and proposed streets and
         roadways, intersection improvements, public transit facilities, railroads, transportation terminals,
         and other transportation facilities.
     The Conservation, Open Space, and Parks and Recreation Element indicates the City's policies
         with respect to the conservation and preservation of important natural and man-made resources.
         This element complies with the state requirements for both a conservation element and an open
         space element.
     The Public Safety Element identifies the City's policy relative to the reduction and mitigation of
         natural and man-made hazards as a means to improve the safety of its citizens.

         in Compton. This Element is also an optional element.
     The Air Quality Element focuses on ways the local community may contribute to the betterment of
         air quality. This Element is optional in that it is not one of the mandatory seven elements that is
         required under the State’s Planning laws.
     The Economic Development Element is closely linked to the Land Use Element in that the
         Economic Development Element identifies opportunities for commercial and employment related

The City of Compton was established in 1888 when 30 families moved from Stockton led by Griffith
Dickenson Compton. Today, over 100 years later, it is home to more than 100,000 residents and is known
as the "Hub City" because of its unique location in the center of Los Angeles County, the most populated
County in the nation. The City is located approximately six miles north of downtown Long Beach and is
bounded by the City of Paramount to the east, the City of Lynwood and an unincorporated County area
(the Willowbrook community) to the north, unincorporated County areas to the west, and unincorporated
County areas and the Cities of Carson and Long Beach to the south.

proportionally smaller senior population than that of the County of Los Angeles. Compton has been
described as a family-oriented community because over 83% of its households are made up of families, a
higher percentage than for Los Angeles County as a whole. Compton’s family size is also larger than Los
Angeles County, 4.13 persons per household versus 2.93 persons per household for the County.

                                              industrially zoned land are attractive to manufacturing and
                                              distribution businesses alike and have attracted such
                                              corporate giants as Ralphs-Food for Less Distribution Center,
                                              Nissan North and America. Compton has also attracted
                                              important private investment in the form of new development
                                              in recent years, both in housing and retail, which have
                                              enhanced the City’s image as a great place to raise a family.
                                              The Gateway Towne Center, a regional shopping center
                                              located along Alameda Street off the Artesia Freeway has
brought many new retail opportunities to households in Compton such as a 24-Hour Fitness, Home
Depot, Petco, and TGI Friday’s Restaurant. The North Downtown renaissance initiated by the City’s
redevelopment of the Martin Luther King Transit Center, Willow Walk Townhomes, and plans for new
senior housing along with the preparation of a Specific Plan is already invigorating the community
downtown.

                                         1.3 PLANNING PROCESS
The City initiated a comprehensive visioning process as a means to identify the policy framework of the
General Plan. Stakeholders were shown how the City of Compton has an opportunity to realize important
goals for the region, including increased connectivity; economic development through the creation of new
jobs; and creation of compact, mixed-use, walkable, transit-oriented developments with new residential
development and commercial activity. The residents and stakeholders have voiced their vision for
Compton and are ready to support its implementation. The Mission of the City of Compton is to be a
"viable, affluent, self-reliant, and safe community." The City's key goals include the following:
     To beautify the City and enhance its infrastructure;
     To enhance and sustain a vibrant local economy;
     To provide effective and efficient public safety services; and
     To stimulate public awareness and social empowerment for citizens of all ages, races, and cultures.
The planning effort culminated with the preparation of a visioning document that included broad goals
and preferred land use development patterns expressed by the community that can be applied to guide the
General Plan update. These guiding principles represented a "checklist" of community values that will be
used to guide public decision-making in the coming years. Thousands of community members contributed
ideas and concerns that were used to create the guiding principles, which are the foundation of Compton's
Vision. They represent the collective values and ideals of a diverse mix of people. The guiding principles
are outlined on the following page in Table 1-2 as they relate to each of Compton's General Plan elements.

1.4 SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
                                           The City of Compton recognizes the surrounding
                                           unincorporated areas on the south and west as within its
                                           natural Sphere of influence and will annex these lands into the
                                           City of Compton in a phased plan. The unincorporated areas
                                           most likely to be the first areas targeted for annexation include
                                           the East Compton unincorporated islands and the Rancho
                                           Dominguez area (located to the south of the City). The East
                                           Compton area is developed largely in industrial uses while the
                                           Rancho Dominguez area contains residential, commercial, and
                                           industrial land uses.
                                           The East Compton area extends from the City’s western-most
                                           boundary continuing westerly to the I-110 Freeway. The
                                           Rancho Dominguez area is generally bounded by the SR-91
Freeway and Victoria Street on the north, Wilmington Avenue on the west, Del Amo Boulevard on the
south, and Susana Road on the east. After adoption of the General Plan 2030, a General Plan amendment
will be undertaken to formally amend the Land Use Map to include this area followed by a formal request
to LAFCO to annex this area into the City. A second potential area of annexation interest is the western
unincorporated area west of Central Avenue from the SR-91 Freeway to El Segundo. This area would be
analyzed and potentially annexed in phases.

                    SECTION 2.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
2.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
This Land Use Element serves as a guide for land use and development for the City of Compton. This
Element addresses a wide range of issues regarding existing and future land use and development in the
City and indicates the location and extent of development that will be permitted over the life of the General
Plan. Finally, the Land Use Element indicates those areas where existing land uses and development will
be maintained as well as those areas where new infill development will be promoted. The primary
objectives of this Land Use Element are to manage future growth, to improve the City's physical
appearance, and to minimize potential land use conflicts as new development occurs. The precise scope
and content of the Land Use Element is governed by State of California Planning law that indicates the
following:
       The Land Use Element must indicate the distribution, location, and extent of land uses for
           housing, business, industry, open space, recreation, and public facilities;
       The Land Use Element must indicate standards for population density and building intensity for
           each land use category covered by the plan; and,
       The Land Use Element must indicate appropriate land uses in those areas subject to development
           constraints including flooding.1

     Section 2.3 Land Use Plan identifies the City policies related to land use goals along with those
         programs that will be effective in implementing these policies. This section also describes the
         location and extent of future development permitted in the City as well as standards for
         development. Finally, the Land Use Plan indicates those areas that may be targeted for
         redevelopment or Community Plans
      SECTION 2.2 LAND USE ELEMENT BACKGROUND REPORT
This section of the Compton Land Use Element describes the existing characteristics and conditions in the
City as they pertain to land use and development. The background information included in this section
provides the basis for the development of land use policies, programs, and plans.
2.2.1 EXISTING LAND USES IN THE CITY
The City of Compton land use and development patterns are
well established through the long-term implementation of the
City’s General Plan and Zoning ordinances. Commercial land
uses generally extend along the major arterial roadways in the
City with residential neighborhoods located in the interior
areas behind the commercial frontages.                Residential
development is the predominant land use in Compton and is
scattered throughout the City. Industrial development is
generally concentrated along the Artesia Freeway (SR-91)
corridor and along Alameda Street.           The total land area
governed by the City of Compton General Plan (referred to as
the Planning Area) consists of approximately 7,102 acres (11.1
square miles) of which 588 acres are unincorporated “island”
areas of Los Angeles County. The total land area located
within the City’s corporate boundaries is 6,514 acres (10.2 square miles). The City’s existing land uses and
development are arranged according to the categories listed below.
     Low Density Residential. Land uses and development included in this category are characterized
         by single-family home and lower density residential development. The majority of the parcels
         located within the City consist of lower density residential development.
     Medium Density Multifamily Residential. This category of land use includes duplexes and smaller
         multifamily residences. Medium density multifamily residential land uses are generally found
         within the central portion of Compton where parcels that were previously developed as single-
         family uses have been developed at even greater densities.
     High Density Multifamily Residential. This land use category is characterized by higher density
         residential development that includes town-homes, condominiums, and apartments. These uses
         are generally found along key arterials and in the central portion of the City.
     Mixed Use. This category of land use represents a mixture of different land uses such as
         commercial, industrial, and residential land uses within a well defined and visually specific area.
SECTION 2 – LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                        PAGE 24

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     General Commercial. This category of land use includes a broad set of commercial retail and
          service-oriented uses. This type of development includes smaller neighborhood centers,
          community shopping centers, and strip commercial developments located along the arterial
          roadways in the City.
     Industrial. Development included in this category consists of a range of industrial, manufacturing,
          and warehousing uses. The largest concentration of industrial land uses is located along the
          Artesia Freeway corridor. Other industrial areas are located east of Alameda Street and north of
          Oaks Street and along the east side Alameda Street between Rosecrans Avenue on the north and
          Greenleaf Boulevard on the south.
     Public/Quasi Public. This land use category applies to a variety of public facilities that include
          public schools, libraries, fire stations, City-owned facilities (the Civic Center, City Yard, etc.), and
          other governmental facilities. This land use category applies to a variety of non-public
          institutional facilities that include private schools and churches.
     Open Space/Parks Land. Open space lands included in this category include public parks, utility
          easements, open space used for water recharge, and other preserved open space (freeway rights-of-
          ways, river channels, etc.).
     Transportation. This land use category includes streets, railways, and freeways.
The distribution of existing land uses and development within City is summarized in Table 2-1.                                      A
generalized land use map is provided in Exhibit 2-1.

2.2.2 RESIDENTIAL LAND USES
The California Department of Finance (DOF) estimated the City's population in January 2013 to be 97,549
persons. According to the same Department of Finance figures, there are 24,112 housing units located in
the City.2 Even though Compton has been fully developed since World War II, the City has experienced
consistent population growth over the past five decades. In 1960, the City’s population was 71,812 persons
increasing to the current population of nearly 100,000 persons. This growth translates into an addition of
27,430 persons or 38.2% since 1960.3 This increase is due partly to the construction of new housing units.
However, a significant component of the City’s population growth is related to increased average
household size. In 1960, the average household size was 3.4 persons per unit compared to the current 4.35
persons per unit. This increase in household size alone accounts for more than 19,000 persons.
Of the 24,112 housing units in the City, the majority were classified as single-family detached units, 16,086
units. A total of 2,150 units were single-family attached, 2,325 units were in structures containing between
two to four units, and 2,903 units were included in multifamily developments containing five or more units
per structure. In addition, there were 648 mobile homes in the City.4
Much of the City’s housing stock is over fifty years old. In the 1950s and 1960s, many single family
neighborhoods in the central portion of the City were zoned for higher density residential development.
Recent residential development in Compton has focused on providing more opportunities for home
ownership. A significant number of recent single-family attached and condominium developments have
been approved. The majority of these developments have occurred on neglected properties that were
previously occupied by non-residential uses.
A 2007 land use survey of the Compton Planning Area found residential land uses on approximately 3,093
acres or 55% of the developable land area.
The Compton Planning Area is made up of
the incorporated City of Compton and three
unincorporated County island areas within
the City boundary. Within the City, 2,733
acres or 42% of the land was residential and
360 acres or 86% of the land was residential
within the three unincorporated County
island areas. The location and extent of
existing residential development is shown
in Exhibit 2-2.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
2.2.3 COMMERCIAL LAND USES
Because of the City’s size and age, the commercial base is varied. Until recently, virtually all of the
commercial retail and service uses were located along the City’s major arterial corridors such as Long
Beach Boulevard, Compton Boulevard, Alondra Boulevard, Rosecrans Avenue, and Central Avenue.
Commercial development in these areas is characterized by strip commercial development and smaller
neighborhood commercial centers on relatively shallow lots. In most cases, the rear yards of the
neighboring residential development abuts the commercial properties that line the arterial roadways.
The original Central Business District (CBD) extends along Compton Boulevard to the east of Willowbrook
Avenue. This area has undergone economic uncertainty similar to that experienced in other local
downtown areas in Southern California. Small lot sizes, parking, and ageing infrastructure have all
contributed to the area’s decline. As commercial retailers sought larger locations, older commercial
developments including many downtowns built before 1960 were left behind. In recent years, a number of
new commercial centers have been constructed in Compton and have attracted national chain retailers.
This has widened the shopping opportunities for local residents.
General commercial uses, which include a
broad set of commercial retail and service
oriented land uses, totaled approximately
447 acres or 8% of the land within the
Compton Planning Area in the 2007 land
use survey. Commercial land uses totaled
425 acres or 8% of the City and 22 acres or
5% of the unincorporated County areas. The
location and extent of commercial
development in the City are shown in
Exhibit 2-3.
2.2.4 INDUSTRIAL LAND USES
The industrial land uses in the City are quite varied, reflecting Compton’s long history as an industrial,
manufacturing, and warehousing force in Southern California. Older and generally more specialized
manufacturing uses were located along Alameda Street to take advantage of the railroad. The railroad has
since been placed below grade and is now exclusively used for goods movement from the facilities in the
Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to the rail yards located south and southeast of downtown Los
Angeles and is referred to as the Alameda Corridor.
Many of the older industrial uses that were located along Alameda Street have transitioned into other uses
as part of redevelopment activities. The majority of the remaining older industrial uses are found in the
northernmost portion of the City along the east side of Alameda Street, north of Rosecrans Avenue. Many
of these industrial properties are not suitable for the more modern manufacturing and industrial activities.
A second, and much larger area of the City where industrial land uses are found, is situated to the south of
Greenleaf Street continuing southerly to the southern boundary of the Planning Area. This area is well
served by the Artesia Freeway and rail access.

                                                                 Exhibit 2-4.
2.2.5 PUBLIC LAND USES
This land use category applies to a variety of public facilities that include public schools, libraries, fire
stations, City-owned facilities (the Civic Center, City Yard, etc.), and other governmental facilities.
Compton-Woodley Airport is also included in this land use category. Overall, public and quasi-public land
uses account for approximately 668 acres of land within the City and an additional 20 acres within the
unincorporated portions of the Compton Planning Area. Altogether, 12% of the developable land area
within the Planning Area is public. The various types of uses considered in this land use category are
further described below.
      Libraries. The Compton Library is operated as a branch of the County of Los Angeles Library. The
        library is a 20,000 square foot facility located in the Compton Civic Center, (240 W Compton
        Boulevard). Specialty collections include 16mm films on African American history and the
        Multicultural Collection highlighting African American, Latino, and Samoan cultures. The
        Compton Library offers adult, children's and Spanish language materials, reference service, and a
        public multipurpose room. Programs within the library include the Literary Center and the
        Homework Center. The Literacy Center’s special services include literacy tutoring, English as a
        Second Language (ESL) group instruction, and self-help instruction in audio-visual and computer-
        based training. The Homework Center has six computer workstations with Internet access, word
        processing capability, and various games for young children.
      Schools and School Facilities. The City is located within the service area of the Compton Unified
        School District (CUSD). The District’s K-12 enrollment was 26,173 students in 2009. CUSD has a
        total of 24 elementary schools, 8 middle schools, 3 comprehensive high schools, and 5 alternative
        high schools. The locations of the existing schools that serve the City are shown in Exhibit 2-4.
      Fire and Emergency Medical Facilities. The Compton Fire Department operates four stations
        within the City of Compton and provides fire protection services in the City of Compton. The four
        stations include Station #1 (201 South Acacia Avenue); Station #2 (1323 East Palm Street); Station
        #3 (1133 West Rosecrans Avenue); and Station #4 (950 West Walnut Street). Resources from
        neighboring agencies, including those operated by the Los Angeles County Fire Department, are
        available if needed. The locations of the existing fire stations in the City are shown in Exhibit 2-5.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
      Public Safety Facilities. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, under contract with the
         City of Compton, provides law enforcement services in the City. The City is served by the Compton
         Station located at 301 South Willowbrook Avenue adjacent to City Hall. Emergency response
         times throughout the City averages approximately 2.5 minutes.
      Sewage and Wastewater Treatment Utilities. The County Sanitation Districts maintain and
         operate the sewer system in the City of Compton. The City is served by the Los Angeles County
         Sanitation District No. 2. Sewer lines are maintained by the County Department of Public Works.
      Water Distribution. Compton is located over the Central Basin Pressure Area that contains several
         aquifers that, in turn, are confined by numerous aquicludes. Water supply in the City is derived
         from local groundwater wells operated and maintained by the Compton Municipal Water
         Department and imported water from the Metropolitan Water District (MWD).
      Compton Airport. There is a single general aviation airport located in the southwestern portion of
         the City. The Compton/Woodley Airport has several runways, the longest being a paved runway
         extending 3,670 feet. The designated runway protection zone is discussed further in the Safety
         Element.
      Government/Municipal Service Properties. Land uses in this category include the Civic
         Center/City Hall, the Public Works Yard, parks, and the Senior Center.
The location and extent of public facilities and land uses in the City are shown in Exhibit 2-5.
2.2.6 OPEN SPACE
Land included in the category includes both
undeveloped vacant parcels that will be developed
at some time into the future and preserved open
space land. This latter category includes public
parks, utility easements, open space used for water
recharge, and other preserved open space such as
river channels. Open space and vacant land
account for approximately 276 acres or 6% of the
City and 16 acres or 5% of the unincorporated
portions of the Planning Area.
The Compton Recreation Department oversees
thirteen (13) parks totaling almost 60 acres.
Recreational facilities also include the Compton Par Three Golf Course, equestrian and bike trails, and the
new Dollarhide Senior/Recreation Center. The City-owned public parks are noted in Exhibit 2-6. A
major open space area in Compton includes a utility easement that extends through the City along the
south side of Greenleaf Boulevard which will be developed into a recreational area. Other open space areas
are found along the river channels of the Los Angeles River and Compton Creek. Both “rivers” have been
modified so that they are now essentially concrete-lined flood control channels. However, there are major
initiatives underway that would return a portion of these channels to a more natural state that would be
used for multiple-use recreation. Major open space areas within the City are depicted in Exhibit 2-6.

2.2.7 EXISTING ZONING
The type, location, density and scale of development in the City are regulated through the City of Compton
Zoning Ordinances. The Compton Zoning Ordinance is contained in Chapter XXX of the City of Compton
Municipal Code. Brief descriptions of the various Zone districts are provided in the following paragraphs.
     R-A Residential Agricultural. The RA zone provides for the development of large one-family
        home sites in a limited agricultural environment.
     R-L Low-Density Residential. The zone district provides for the development of single-family
        housing with ample yard space.
     R-M Medium-Density Residential. The RM zone provides a suitable environment for family life in
        areas where a mixture of dwelling unit types is permitted at medium density.
     R-H High-Density Residential. The RH zone district provides for a suitable residential
        environment through the predominant development of multi-family dwellings.
     C-L Limited Commercial. This zone district establishes land use and development standards for
        neighborhood, community, and regional commercial retail and service activities.
     C-M Commercial Manufacturing. The CM zone provides for highway-related commercial
        enterprises, wholesaling, warehousing, and certain limited manufacturing operations.
     M-L Limited Manufacturing. This zone district applies to light industrial uses.
     M-H Heavy Manufacturing. The M-H zone provides for general industrial development while
        controlling those uses which might be obnoxious, offensive, or dangerous.
        Buffer. The Buffer Zone provides physical separation between conflicting land uses.
In addition, the City of Compton Zoning Ordinance includes a number of “overlay zones” that expand the
permitted uses.
        Automobile Parking.       This overlay zone provides for off-street parking for residential,
        commercial, industrial, public, and other uses in the City.
        Planned Development. The D zone provides more flexibility in permitted land uses than is
        allowed by the base zone and greater environmental and architectural control over specific
        developments than would otherwise be imposed.
The following overlay zones will be added to the zoning ordinance when it is updated to conform to the
General Plan.
     Specific Plan. The SP zone would provide flexibility in permitted land uses and development
        standards for an area that will be guided by a Specific Plan.
SECTION 2 – LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                      PAGE 35

      Transit Overlay District. The TOD zone will provide flexibility in development standards for TOD
           development with ¼ mile of the Compton and Artesia stations. The TOD will be implemented
           through a Specific Plan.
                    Conformity between the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance…
      The State of California Planning, Zoning, and Development Laws (PZDL) require that there is conformity between the
      General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. This conformity requirement also extends to the General Plan Land Use Map and the
      Zoning Map. For example, if the General Plan designates an area for low density single-family residential development,
      this permitted land use must also be reflected in both the Zoning Map and the corresponding Zoning Ordinance text. This
      requirement is because the Zoning Ordinance represents the key mechanism that will be used in the implementation of
      General Plan land use policy. The City will continue to review the Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map to ensure that the
      development standards are consistent with those identified in the Land Use Element. The City will also initiate appropriate
      changes to the Zoning Map to ensure conformity between the Land Use Element and Zoning Map.
2.2.8 LAND USE CONSTRAINTS - FLOODING
The terms “100-year flood zone” and “500-year flood zone” refer to the statistical probability of a severe
flood condition occurring during a period of extreme rainfall or runoff once every 100 or 500 years. The
eastern half of the City of Compton was previously located within the Los Angeles River 100-year
floodplain. The Los Angeles County Drainage Area Project, through the County of Los Angeles
Department of Public Works, reduced potential overflow by increasing the flood carrying capacity of the
lower Los Angeles River, the Rio Hondo just to the east of Compton and the lower portion of Compton
Creek. The height of 21 miles of existing levees was raised and modifications were made to railroad, traffic,
utility and pedestrian bridges. These improvements, completed in 2001, now provide protection for
Compton residents in the eastern and southern part of the City. Since the completion of the preventative
measures, Compton property owners in the floodplain are no longer required to purchase flood insurance.
                                                                           The Whittier Narrows Dam is located

would continue to spread throughout the entire City. The Sepulveda Dam is 29 miles upstream from the
City. If this dam experienced a failure, the flooding would reach Compton within eleven (11) hours with a
one foot depth. Areas of the City subject to potential dam inundation or flooding are shown in Exhibit 2-7.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
2.2.9 LAND USE CONSTRAINTS - SEISMIC
The City is located in the highly seismic Southern California region that is subject to the influence of a
number of fault systems that are considered to be active or potentially active. These active and potentially
active faults are capable of producing potentially damaging seismic shaking in the City. The Newport –
Inglewood Fault Zone is an active fault zone that lies within the City of Compton. The fault zone is 75
kilometers in length and a segment of this fault, the Compton Fault, traverses the southwest corner of the
City. The larger Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone extends through other nearby cities, such as Inglewood,
Gardena, Long Beach, and Culver City. The Compton Fault may result in substantial ground shaking and
possible fault rupture with en estimated probable magnitude of between 6.0 and 7.4. The fault trace
extends in a northwesterly to southeasterly direction between Central Avenue and Avalon Boulevard
crossing Rosecrans Avenue, Compton Boulevard, Alondra Boulevard, Walnut Street, and Artesia
Boulevard. The location of the Compton Fault is shown in Exhibit 2-7.
The most recent earthquake from this fault was the Long Beach earthquake in 1933, which had a
magnitude of 6.4. However, no surface rupture occurred in the City during that earthquake. Other active
faults without surface expression (blind faults) are also capable of generating a damaging earthquake in the
area. In addition, recent experience and current research indicates that blind faults (faults that apparently
have not broken the surface and display little or no surface expression) underlie adjacent areas within both
Los Angeles and Orange Counties. These blind thrust (buried fault trace) faults are known to be
responsible for both the magnitude 5.9 Whittier Narrows earthquake (1987) and the magnitude 6.7
Northridge earthquake (1994). The majority of the City is also located in an area that has been identified
as having a potential for liquefaction. Liquefaction typically causes the soils to lose a portion or all of their
sheer strength. This strength is typically regained sometime after the shaking stops. The areas of the City
that may be subject to potential liquefaction are shown in Exhibit 2-7.
2.2.10 LAND USE CONSTRAINTS – AIRPORT OPERATIONS
The Compton/Woodley Airport, a general aviation airport facility, was established in 1924 and is the
oldest, continuously operating airport in the Los Angeles basin and the only one without a traffic control
tower. The airport covers 77 acres, of which 47 are used
for the runway/taxiway system and 30 for the existing
building area. According to the August, 1991 Airport
Master Plan, the limited availability of land will keep the
maximum at 500 based aircraft. The airport has several
runways, one is 60 feet wide and 2,800 feet long for
landing and the longest being a paved runway extending
3,670 feet for takeoff. The largest aircraft the airport can
support weighs 12,500 pounds. The designated accident
potential zone extends for a short distance east of
Wilmington Avenue (on the east) and Central Avenue, on
the west.

2.3.2 LAND USE GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Land Use Element were developed in response to land use issues identified in
the technical background report and on issues and opportunities identified in community workshops that
were conducted as part of a comprehensive outreach program.
LAND USE ISSUE - A SUSTAINABLE MIX OF LAND USES
The Underlying policies provide for a sustainable mix of land uses. Citizens felt that the current mix of
land uses was balanced. At the same time they understood the need to increase density to provide more
housing and economic opportunities for the community. Stakeholders wanted more oversight of land use
decisions so that new developments provide what the community needs.
     Land Use Goal 1. The City of Compton will ensure that zoning designations citywide correspond to
     development policy as shown on the General Plan Land Use Policy Map.
      Land Use Policy1.1. The City of Compton will rewrite the City’s Zoning Ordinance to conform to
         the General Plan to ensure land use compatibility.
      Land Use Policy 1.2. The City of Compton will maintain consistency between adopted specific and
         master plans, consolidated plans, and the General Plan goals and policies.
      Land Use Policy 1.3. The City will develop and maintain an updated Development Tracking

2.3.3 LAND USE MAP/DESIGNATIONS FOR THE 2030 GENERAL PLAN
The Land Use Map serves as the foundation for the Land Use Plan and indicates the location and extent of
permitted development in the City. With the City of Compton completely urbanized, the Land Use Map’s
focus is on the conservation, maintenance, and rehabilitation of existing development in the City.
However, the Land Use Map is also sensitive to the potential opportunities for new infill development and
redevelopment. The City of Compton is first and foremost home to many thousands of persons,
and it is not surprising that the dominant land use in the City will continue to be residential
development. This Element will largely maintain the integrity of the existing residential
neighborhoods that predominate.

housing types at varying densities. The challenge          Guidelines Concerning the General Plan Map…

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
in strategic areas of the City. In recent years, the City has been proactive in attracting new housing
development in the City. Unlike the majority of the cities in the Southern California region, Compton has
experienced a resurgence in new housing that includes town-homes, condominiums, and single family
homes. The Land Use Element promotes the continuation of new residential infill on those underutilized
and underperforming parcels. The City of Compton is not immune to the recent economic troubles that
have affected the nation. In recent years, mortgage lending practices had a dramatic and negative effect on
those lower income households that, for the first time, were able to realize the dream of home ownerships.
Many of these households have lost their homes through foreclosure. The challenge for the City is to
minimize the negative effects of these foreclosures on the neighborhoods in which they are located. The
Land Use Element represents a continued commitment of the City in the maintenance of the existing
residential neighborhoods.
The City is home to nearly 100,000 residents. In most States, the City would represent a major
metropolitan area. However, the City is undeserved by commercial service and retail uses that would
typically be found in a City of similar size. For this reason, the Land Use Plan promotes the maintenance
and/or development of key commercial centers so that residents may shop and conduct business in the
City. The new regional shopping center is a first step in placing the community in the spot-light of national
retailers. Compton is located in the geographic center of this economic powerhouse and is strategically
placed to be a leader. To capitalize on the City’s location, the General Plan maintains and promotes the
ongoing redevelopment and revitalization of the Artesia Freeway corridor as well as targeting new areas for
new planned development. Few cities have the transit advantages that Compton is able to draw upon. The
Artesia Freeway corridor provides easy and direct access to the businesses located along its 2.5 mile length
through the City. The City is also well served by public transit including two stations along the Blue Line.
The Land Use Element promotes transit-oriented development to capture the advantages of the City’s
location along the Blue Line transit corridor. Through the implementation of the Land Use Plan, the City
of Compton seeks to accomplish the following:
     Establish and maintain an orderly pattern of development in the City;
     Establish a land use classification system as a means to implement the City’s overall land use
         policy;
     Identify permitted land uses throughout Compton and their general location and distribution; and,
     Establish standards for population density and development intensity for both existing and future
         development.
The Land Use Map indicates the location and extent of development through designation of land use types
throughout the City and Planning Area of Compton. This Land Use Element contains two residential land
use categories and a single category each for commercial, mixed use, business park, industrial, public, and
open space/parkland uses. These land use designations are described in greater detail in the remainder of
this section. The City of Compton Land Use Plan is shown in Exhibit 2-9. Table 2-2 summarizes these
land use designations.
SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL (1 TO 12 UNITS/NET ACRE)
The Single Family Residential category permits low scale residential development at densities of up to
twelve units per acre. Based on an average household size of 4.4 persons per dwelling, the maximum
SECTION 2 – LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                      PAGE 44

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
population density is 53 persons per acre. Development included within this land use category consists of
single-family houses that may include both detached and attached units. Other permitted uses include
schools, churches, day care homes, public utilities and facilities, and similar uses generally considered
compatible with and serving the needs of residential neighborhoods. Existing single-family housing
development in Compton consists of conventional subdivisions as well as large lot developments (10,000
square feet and larger lot sizes), in the Richland Farms community. Thus, two zone district categories may
be used to implement the Low Density Residential designation – one which allows up to four units per acre
and a second for densities up to twelve units per acre.
MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL (12.1 TO 34 UNITS/NET ACRE)
Multifamily Residential development includes apartment complexes, town-homes, condominium projects,
as well as any of the uses permitted in the lower density residential categories. This land use designation
permits development at densities of up to 34 units per acre. Based on an average household size of 4.4
persons per dwelling, the maximum population density is 150 persons per acre. Only those development
projects that incorporate superior design characteristics or provide amenities for residents, such as onsite
recreation or open space above the minimum requirements parking will be allowed to build at densities
over 20 dwelling units per acre. Developments involving housing for senior citizens or other City-
identified special needs groups may achieve higher densities. Two zones will be created to implement this
multi-family designation based on the number of dwelling units per acre. Density bonuses above 34 units
per acre maximum are permitted if a housing development meets the requirements set forth in Section
65915 of the State Government Code.
GENERAL COMMERCIAL (MAXIMUM FLOOR AREA RATIO OF 0.5)
The General Commercial category allows for a wide range of retail and service commercial uses designed to
meet communitywide and sub-regional shopping and service needs. The City’s zoning regulations more
specifically identify uses permitted in commercial areas. In recognition that not all General Commercial
uses may be compatible with adjacent residential developments, the zoning regulations will provide for
retail/service commercial districts for neighborhood-oriented uses and for larger scale commercial
developments. The developments should be pedestrian oriented and limited to sites of less than one acre
in size. The neighborhood commercial district will prohibit uses with operating characteristics which are
considered incompatible with residential living, such as fast-food restaurants and auto service facilities
which generate high traffic volumes and noise levels.
MIXED USE (MAXIMUM FLOOR AREA RATIO OF 1.0 AND 34 UNITS PER ACRE)
The Mixed Use land use category is established to allow for a wide variety of commercial uses, including
retail and service businesses, professional offices, and restaurants, in conjunction with residential
development. For projects consisting of low and very low income affordable units, the 34 units per acre
maximum may be exceeded to accommodate additional units for those affordable categories in accordance
with the provisions of the density bonus ordinance. All existing uses within the Mixed Use area at the time
of this plan’s adoption are considered consistent with the General Plan.
BUSINESS PARK (MAXIMUM FLOOR AREA RATIO OF 1.5)
This designation allows a mix of commercial, office, and light industrial uses which, by the high quality of
their development and the nature of their operations, demonstrate compatibility with adjacent commercial
SECTION 2 – LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                      PAGE 45

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
and residential uses. In addition, smaller commercial establishments that serve on-site employees such as
business services and local-serving retail uses are allowed. Adherence to landscaping, buffering and design
standards provides the means for achieving a high level of amenity for employees and neighboring uses.
INDUSTRIAL (MAXIMUM FLOOR AREA RATIO OF 0.55)
The Industrial land use designation is established to accommodate a wide range of industrial activities,
from light manufacturing and warehousing to more intensive uses such as materials processing and large
scale product fabrication. Service and retail uses incidental to and supportive of the primary industrial
activities are also permitted. The specific types of uses permitted are governed by zoning regulations. Two
zone districts will be maintained to differentiate between light industrial and heavy industrial uses. The
types of activities permitted will depend upon environmental constraints and adjacent land uses.
PUBLIC (MAXIMUM FLOOR AREA RATIO OF 1.0)
The designation applies to lands and facilities that are owned and/or operated by government agencies and
quasi-government entities such as school districts and public utility companies excepting open space and
parks. Permitted uses in this category include County facilities, City Hall, public schools, fire stations,
flood control facilities, Compton Airport, and similar uses.
OPEN SPACE/PARKS
All public parks and City-owned recreational facilities, as well as permanent open space features such as
Compton Creek, the Los Angeles River and cemeteries are designated Open Space/Parks. The only
structures permitted include community facility buildings within parks, appurtenant maintenance
facilities, and buildings housing uses typically associated with cemeteries.

SECTION 2 – LAND USE ELEMENT                                                                           PAGE 46

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The City has identified the following target areas where specific land use initiatives will be implemented
over the life of this General Plan.
     Willowbrook Blue Line Station. The properties adjacent to the Willowbrook Blue Line Station will
        be the focus of a planning effort to create a transit-oriented neighborhood to take advantage of the
        station’s links to the cities of Long Beach and Los Angeles. The land use designation has been
        changed to mixed use from industrial for those blocks immediately west of the Blue Line.
     Compton Boulevard between Alameda Street and Santa Fe Avenue: Potential Office District.
        This area was geographically the original downtown business district of Compton. The City
        proposes to redevelop this commercial corridor so that it once again becomes a center for
        community activity, a downtown destination for residents, and a place to bring guests. Specific
        actions call for a Compton Boulevard Streetscape Master Plan which is currently under
        development by the Compton Redevelopment Agency. The master plan will redesign Compton
        Boulevard, transforming the street into a thriving, mixed use, pedestrian-oriented
        retail/restaurant destination. The overall planning concept also calls for enhanced connections to
        the Civic Center Complex and the Compton Blue Line Station.
     Long Beach Boulevard between Rosecrans Avenue and Alondra Boulevard. Long Beach
        Boulevard is an important commercial corridor that has the potential to become more walkable
        with the introduction of new pedestrian-oriented
        development in the section designated Mixed Use along
        the south side of the street near Compton Boulevard. A
        streetscape design will be developed for this corridor.
     Rosecrans Avenue east of Long Beach Boulevard. A
        planning initiative is envisioned that will focus on
        concentrating smaller commercial centers at key
        intersections and to facilitate commercial and mixed use
        infill development within those parcels that have
        remained        vacant    or    are     underutilized    or
        underperforming.
     Alondra Boulevard at Atlantic Avenue. A planning
        initiative will focus on revitatalizing smaller commercial
        parcels located along the roadway’s length and at key intersections. Alondra Boulevard is a major
        entryway into the City, therefore, the major initiative will be to improve the area located at the
        Atlantic Boulevard intersection continuing eastward to the City’s boundary.
     Artesia Blue Line Station Area. The properties adjacent to the Artesia Blue Line Station will be
        the focus of a planning effort to create a transit-oriented neighborhood to take advantage of the
        station’s links to the cities of Long Beach and Los Angeles. The land use designation has been
        changed to mixed use from industrial for those blocks immediately west of the Blue Line.
     Compton Boulevard at Central Avenue. Infill development opportunities exist in this target area
        that will be the focus of this planning initiative to prevent piecemeal [*need to describe what
        this is] development and to maximize development opportunities.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
                SECTION 3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
3.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
The Circulation Element of the Compton General Plan is one of seven State-mandated Elements and is
intended to serve as a guide for the ongoing improvement of the City's roadways and transportation
infrastructure. New development in the City and in the surrounding communities will place additional
demands on the City's roadways in the coming years. A primary objective of this Circulation Element is to
ensure that sufficient roadway and transportation-related infrastructure is provided to meet existing and
future demand.
The purpose of the Circulation Element is to provide for the development of a safe and efficient circulation
system for the City. According to California Government Code Section 65302(b), this Element must
identify the following:
     The location and extent of existing and proposed roadways;
     The existing and proposed transportation facilities including rail facilities and airports;
     The level of service criteria for roadways and intersections; and,
     A plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of the
         streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel.
                                            This Circulation Element provides the planning framework for
                                            Compton’s roadway system that will be needed to accommodate
                                            existing and projected demand resulting from the land uses and
                                            development permitted under the Land Use Element. Traffic
                                            volumes included in this Circulation Element are also used to
                                            determine future traffic noise levels within the Noise Element.
                                            The circulation criteria specific to public safety such as the
                                            emergency evacuation routes and minimum road widths
                                            required to accommodate emergency vehicles are fond in the
                                            Public Safety Element. Finally, the Circulation Element is
                                            responsive to regional transportation plans, such as the
                                            Congestion Management Program, that focuses on the
                                            development of a regional transportation system to
                                            accommodate the future traffic demands.
3.1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
The Circulation Element consists of the following sections:
     The Introduction to the Element provides an overview of the Element’s scope and content.
     The Circulation Element Background Report discusses a wide range of transportation and
         circulation issues that must be considered in future planning and development in the City.
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                   PAGE 51

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     The Circulation Plan identifies the City policies related to transportation and circulation along
        with those programs that will be effective in implementing the policies. This section also
        establishes design and service standards for the various types of roadways to serve the existing and
        projected transportation needs of the community.
   SECTION 3.2 CIRCULATION ELEMENT BACKGROUND REPORT
The Circulation Element Background Report provides an overview of the key issues that are related to
transportation planning, infrastructure, roadway levels of service, and transit-related issues.
3.2.1 REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING
A variety of agencies are responsible for the circulation infrastructure of streets, freeways, rails, and buses.
Arterials and local streets in Compton are generally under the jurisdiction of the City of Compton.
Regional transportation planning is coordinated by the Southern California Association Governments
(SCAG). The resulting regional strategy is comprised of the following elements:
     The Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). SCAG’s RTP establishes overall long term mobility
        policies for the movement of people and goods, including congestion relief strategies for all
        regionally significant facilities and activities.
     SB 375 Enhanced Regional Planning Process. SB 375 relies upon regional planning processes
        already underway in the 17 Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in the state to
        accomplish its objectives. The provisions related to GHG emissions only apply to the MPOs in the
        state, which includes 37 of the 58 counties. Most notably, the measure requires the MPO to
        prepare a Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) within the Regional Transportation Plan
        (RTP), which sets forth a vision for growth for the region taking into account the transportation,
        housing, environmental, and economic needs of the region. The SCS is the blueprint by which the
        region will meet its GHG emissions reductions target if there is a feasible way to do so. Due to the
        size and complexity of the SCAG region, SB 375 allows sub-regional councils of government such
        as the Gateway Cities Council of Government (Gateway Cities COG) to prepare their own SCS and
        submit it to SCAG for inclusion in the regional SCS. The law suggests that the sub-region work in
        collaboration with the county transportation commission – in this case, the Los Angeles County
        Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) – in developing a sub-regional SCS. During 2009
        the Gateway Cities COG retained the services of a consulting team to evaluate the pros and cons of
        accepting what became known as “delegation” of SCS preparation to the sub-region. The
        consultant team surveyed the Gateway Cities COG member cities and held a series of workshops
        involving planning directors, city managers, and elected officials. In January 2010 a majority of
        the Gateway Cities COG board voted to accept delegation of the sub-regional SCS, subject to
        ratification by a majority of the member city councils. Ratification of this decision by a majority of
        cities occurred in Spring 2010 and a sub-regional SCS is currently under development by the
        Gateway Cities COG. SCAG is requiring the completion of the sub-regional SCS by June 2011.
     The Los Angeles County Congestion Management Program (CMPs). The City of Compton is
        included in the Los Angeles County Congestion Management Plan (CMP), which is prepared and
        maintained by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro). The
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                       PAGE 52

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
        requirements of the CMP became effective with voter approval of Proposition 111. The purpose of
        the CMP is to link land use, transportation, and air quality decisions, to develop a partnership
        among transportation decision-makers in devising appropriate transportation solutions that
        include all modes of travel, and to propose transportation projects that are eligible to compete for
        State gas tax funds. The intersection of Alameda Street, at Compton Boulevard, and the SR-91
        east-bound highway ramps located in the City of Compton are also CMP-designated facilities in the
        City.
     The Regional Transportation Improvement Program (RTIP). The RTIP defines congestion relief
        projects and programs and is updated every two years. The RTIP must include all federally funded
        projects and CMP projects that will need federal or state funds. The RTIP must also be consistent
        with the Regional Transportation Plan.
3.2.2 ROADWAY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM
Because Compton is a built-out city, the street grid is well-
established.    To assist in the understanding of the City’s
system of roadways, a roadway classification system has been
developed according to a hierarchy that indicates the optimal
configuration of a particular street. This classification system
considers the roadway’s desirable width, the number of travel
lanes, and its function. The classification system provides a
logical framework for the design and operation of those
roadways that serve Compton. The categories of roadways
included in this classification system differentiate the size,
function, and capacity of each type of roadway. The various
roadway classifications are described below and are shown in
Exhibit 3-1.
     Major Highway. Major arterial roadways typically consist of four to six travel lanes with two to
        three lanes travel in each direction separated by either a raised or painted median. These
        roadways are designed to carry high volumes of traffic and typically provide the necessary links to
        the regional freeway system. These roadways also serve the major developments in the City that
        generate higher traffic volumes. For example, these roadways typically serve larger commercial
        developments, employment generating uses, and educational facilities.
     Secondary Highway: Secondary Highways typically consist of four travel lanes with two lanes in
        each direction that is either undivided or separated by a painted median. These roadways are
        designed to also accommodate relatively high volumes of traffic providing connections to other
        streets within the City.
     Residental Collector Street. This category of Collector Street is designed to move traffic to and
        from the residential neighborhoods in the City. This category of roadway may include between two
        and four travel lanes. The primary function of this type of roadway is to discourage through traffic
        within the individual residential neighborhoods.
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                    PAGE 53

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Industrial Collector Street. This type of Collector Street is designed to carry moderate to relatively
        high volumes of traffic between major and secondary highways and industrial areas. These
        roadways are specifically designed to accommodate the larger volumes of truck traffic and typically
        have wider lanes to accommodate large trucks.
     Local Streets. Local streets are designed to provide direct public access to those parcels that are
        not served by the aforementioned categories of roadways. Local streets typically consist of two
        travel lanes (one in each direction) that are undivided.
Freeways are controlled-access, high-speed roadways with
grade-separated interchanges. They are intended to carry high
volumes of traffic from region to region. Caltrans is responsible
for the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of
freeways in California. The freeway facilities that are located
nearest to the City include the following:
     Interstate 105- The Century Freeway (I-105) is an east-
        west freeway that connects the South Bay/LAX area to
        the I-605 freeway in Norwalk. This freeway is located a
        few miles north of Compton in the City of Lynwood. Off
        ramps that provide direct access to Compton, from west
        to east, are Central Avenue, Wilmington Avenue, and
        Long Beach Boulevard.
     State Route 91 – The Artesia Freeway (SR-91) is an east-west freeway that connects the local area
        to north Orange County and the Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties). The
        freeway right-of-way extends alongside Artesia Boulevard within the City of Compton. Off ramps
        that provide direct access to City (from west to east) are located at Central Avenue, Wilmington
        Avenue, Alameda Street, and Long Beach Boulevard.
     Interstate 110 – The Harbor Freeway (I-110) is a major north-south freeway that extends through
        the greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area. This freeway traverses the City of Los Angeles
        immediately west (approximately two miles) of the city limits of Compton. Off ramp locations that
        provide direct access to Compton (from north to south) include El Segundo Boulevard, Rosecrans
        Avenue, Redondo Beach Boulevard, and State Route 91.
     Interstate 710 – The Long Beach Freeway (I-710) is a north-south freeway which roughly parallels
        Atlantic Boulevard and the Los Angeles River from Long Beach north to Los Angeles where the
        freeway terminates near Alhambra. The I-710 Freeway extends along the eastern edge of the City.
        Freeway ramp connections that provide direct access to the City of Compton (from north to south)
        are located at Rosecrans Avenue, Alondra Boulevard, and the SR-91.

3.2.4 SECONDARY HIGHWAYS
Secondary Highways traversing Compton in an east-to-west
orientation include (in order, from north to south) Compton
Boulevard, Greenleaf Boulevard, and Artesia Boulevard.
Alameda Street is the one Secondary Highway that traverses
Compton in a north-to-south orientation. These roadways
are described in greater detail below.
     Compton Boulevard:             This four-lane roadway
        extends east-west through the center of Compton.
        The roadway is the main downtown arterial and
        borders the Civic Center on the north. This roadway
        has a right-of-way width that varies from 80 feet to
        100 feet.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
3.2.5 COLLECTOR STREETS
Collector Streets within Compton connect the east-west and
north-south trending arterial roadways. Collector Streets located
in a north-to-south orientation include Willowbrook Avenue and
Alameda Street (east). These roadways are described in greater
detail below.
      East and West Willowbrook Avenue: Willowbrook
          Avenue is separated by the Metro Blue Line. The
          roadway is a residential Collector Street with a 65 foot
          right-of-way on both sides of the Blue Line right-of-way
          providing two-way traffic on each side.
      Alameda Street (East): The eastern segment of this
          roadway is a two-lane north-south industrial Collector Street bounded on the west by the Alameda
          Corridor freight rail expressway. This roadway has a right-of-way of 65-feet. Parking is permitted
          on the east side of the street.
3.2.6 LOCAL STREETS
Local streets are subordinate to the basic circulation network
described above, yet constitute the majority of the City’s
streets. These streets provide access to individual parcels and
only provide circulation within a neighborhood block. Local
streets in Compton are generally 40 to 50 feet wide, with a
pavement width between 24 to 30 feet. Most streets have
been improved with curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. The City
standard for local streets is 60 feet (with a curb-to-curb
pavement width of 36 feet, two lanes, and on-street parking on
both sides). The various roadway classifications are shown in
Exhibit 3-1.
3.2.7 LEVELS OF SERVICE DEFINITIONS
To ensure that the roadway segments and intersection are designed to accommodate existing and future
traffic, some measure of performance is needed. These measures must consider how well these facilities
are handling traffic. A roadway or intersection that is heavily congested is considered to have a poor level
of service. A roadway or intersection where traffic moves efficiently and quickly is said to have a good level
of service.
A qualitative measure, Level of Service, or LOS, is often used in describing the operating condition of a
roadway segment or intersection. The LOS is a sliding scale (A through F), where LOS A represents
optimal traffic conditions, while LOS F equates to significant congestion and is generally considered to
represent an unacceptable condition.
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                     PAGE 57

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
A more quantitative measure used to define an intersection’s level of service employs a ratio between an
intersection’s design capacity (as measured in traffic volumes that can be accommodated by the roadway)
and the existing and/or projected traffic volumes.
The City of Compton has established LOS "D" as a target LOS standard, and LOS "E" as a threshold
standard. The City recognizes that not all intersections within the City can meet the target LOS D. In these
instances, the City Council must find that the improvements necessary to meet the target LOS D are not
feasible because of one or more of the following reasons:
      The cost of the necessary improvements exceeds available funding sources;
      The design of the necessary improvements is not compatible with the surrounding land uses; or,
      The design of the necessary improvements is contrary to other established City policies.
This method, referred to as the Intersection Capacity Utilization, or ICU, is correlated to LOS definitions
in Table 3-1 and the concept is illustrated Exhibit 3-2.

The characteristics that help define the Levels of Service are summarized in Exhibit 3-2. These roadway
capacities are “rule of thumb” figures only, and should only be used for an area wide circulation evaluation.
The actual level of service levels are affected by such factors as intersections (number and configuration),
degree of access control, roadway grades, and design geometrics. The performance criteria used for
evaluating volumes and capacities of the City street and highway system include average daily traffic (ADT)
volumes for individual roadway segments. Table 3-2 summarizes capacity and level of service criteria used
to perform a general assessment of the adequacy of the arterial roadways throughout Compton.
The Level of Service was determined for each of the primary roadway segments in the City based on recent
traffic counts and the current number of traffic lanes provided to accommodate these volumes (refer to
Table 3-2 for the current volumes). The Levels of Service for the roadway segments summarized in Table
3-2 are shown in Exhibit 3-3.

3.2.8 EXISTING TRAFFIC VOLUMES
The completion of the Century Freeway in 1993 had a substantial affect on traffic patterns and volumes
when it opened. Traffic levels initially decreased on parallel routes to the Freeway but have since grown
on those streets closest to the freeway as drivers avoid rush hour freeway congestion. Traffic levels have
increased on routes that provide access to the freeway, including Central Avenue, Wilmington Avenue, and
Long Beach Boulevard. Routes extending through the City in a north-south orientation have either stayed
at the same level of service or have increased as population and cars have increased over the last fifteen
years. The effects of the freeway corridor on the surrounding street system were predicted to be negligible
after a distance of approximately four miles from the freeway. Almost all of the City of Compton falls
within the four-mile area of influence; however several routes located parallel to the Freeway have
decreased levels of congestion. The current average daily traffic (ADT) volumes for selected roadway
segments are summarized in Table 3-3 and are illustrated in Exhibit 3-4.

The Century Freeway (I-105) has off-ramps at Central Avenue, Wilmington Avenue, and Long Beach
Boulevard. Traffic levels on these routes were expected to increase in proportion to the distance from the
freeway corridor. However, this did not hold true for Long Beach Boulevard. Current estimates of ADT
show that Levels of Service along Long Beach Boulevard (freeway access street) are highest south of
Compton Boulevard, with an LOS E or F, while all other segments, including those closest to the Century
Freeway, are LOS C.
Along Wilmington Avenue, the greatest increase in level of service occurred in segments located nearest to
the freeway, with the area south of El Segundo Boulevard having service degrading from LOS C to LOS E.
Heading south along Wilmington Avenue, south of Rosecrans, ADT increased by 7,000 trips but the LOS
improved from LOS C to LOS B due to the addition of medians and left-turn pockets. The same is true for
Central Avenue, with the segment closest to the freeway, south of El Segundo, having the LOS degrading
from LOS B to LOS F. However, on the next segment south of Rosecrans, ADT increased by only 400 trips
just bumping the LOS to E. If medians were added to this segment the LOS would improve to LOS C.
Growth in traffic on certain arterials can be attributed to ongoing development within the City, along with
the completion of the Century Freeway. The historic (1991) and current (2005) level of service for key
roadway segments are shown in Table 3-4.

3.2.9 SCENIC CORRIDORS
A number of roadway corridors were highlighted for improvement by the City through design guidelines
and regulations, public investment, and private incentives under the 1998 Corridor Improvement Plan.
The roadways designated as scenic corridors are Alameda Street, Alondra Boulevard, Artesia Boulevard,
Central Avenue, Compton Boulevard, El Segundo Boulevard, Long Beach Boulevard, Rosecrans Avenue,
Santa Fe Avenue, Willowbrook Avenue, and Wilmington Avenue. Several programs have been
implemented to improve the physical condition of these corridors and to enhance pedestrian safety.
Recent improvements implemented in the City include the addition of Gateway Monuments, plazas, and
bridge crossings on Alameda Street at Palmer and bridge crossings at El Segundo, Pine, Elm, Alondra, and
Greenleaf. The City is also conducting a citywide street improvement project for residential streets in
eligible census tracts.
3.2.10 METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION
         AUTHORITY METRO BLUE LINE
The 22 mile Metro Blue Line light rail connects downtown Los
Angeles with downtown Long Beach and travels along
Willowbrook Avenue in Compton with two stops, the Compton
Civic Center station and the Artesia Station. There are three
additional stations within a 10 minute drive from the City on
the Metro Green Line. Starting on the east, they are Long
Beach/I-105, Imperial /Wilmington, and Avalon/I-105. Metro
light rail provides connectivity throughout much of greater Los
Angeles with the Red, Purple, and Gold lines. Expo and
Crenshaw lines will provide needed service to western sections
of greater Los Angeles.
The Metro Blue Line was the first project completed as part of Los Angeles County’s rail mass transit
system in 1990. The Blue Line begins at 7th Street and Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles and
extends through the cities of Vernon, Huntington Park, South Gate, and the Watts community before
arriving at its first stop in Compton at the Compton Civic Center Station. The Blue Line’s second stop in
Compton, the Artesia Station, is located behind the Gateway Towne Center Shopping Plaza and the Crystal
Park Hotel near the SR-91 freeway. From there, the Blue Line continues out of Compton into Carson to
downtown Long Beach. The location of the Blue Line right-of-way through the City is shown in Exhibit 3-5
along with the two local stations.
The Compton Civic Center station is adjacent to the Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) Transit Center, located
on East Willowbrook Avenue north of the Renaissance Shopping Center. Ridership at the MLK Transit
Center is estimated at between 2,300 and 2,700 passengers per day. This multi-modal terminal serves
patrons of the light rail, urban and intercity buses, local Dial-A-Ride services, taxicabs, and Greyhound
buses. The multi-modal terminal is scheduled for completion in 2011. The Artesia Station features a 650
vehicle capacity park-and-ride lot. Ridership at the Artesia Station is estimated at between 2,700 and
3,700 passengers per day.
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                  PAGE 67

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
3.2.11 PUBLIC BUS TRANSIT
The Compton Renaissance Transit System provides daily local
transit services throughout the City as shown in Exhibit 4-5.
Established in October 1995 with Metro Proposition A and C
Local Return grant funding, the Compton Renaissance Transit
System operates five buses covering five fixed routes that
connect directly to the Compton Station of the Blue Line. All
Renaissance vehicles are equipped with wheelchair ramps.
Currently operated by MV Transportation, Inc., ridership in
2009-2010 totaled 289,498 with passengers traveling a total of
135,095 miles.
The Compton area is also well served by eleven Metro Bus Lines
operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, three
bus lines from Long Beach Transit, and one bus line from
Gardena Municipal Bus Lines. These buses connect Compton residents to the Metro Blue Line stops and
to neighboring cities and employment centers. Three of the routes serve as a part of a coordinated bus
network to connect residents in neighboring cities to the City’s light rail transit stations. The Gardena
Municipal Bus Route 3 connects the Compton Transit Center with the Gardena and South Bay Galleria
Transit Centers.
3.2.12 PARA-TRANSIT
The Dial-A-Ride Program provides curb-to-curb bus service for seniors 60 years of age and older and
eligible handicapped persons. Service is provided Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
There is no service on weekends or holidays. The cost is 25 cents per round trip. Service is provided
within Compton City limits, however, a limited amount of service is available for medical appointments to
local area hospitals.
The City of Compton Dial-A-Taxi Program provides eligible residents with reliable transportation to and
from areas within the City and to designated satellite facilities. Eligible Compton residents include
disabled persons who are at least eighteen years of age and senior citizens 62 years and older. Service is
provided 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
3.2.13 OTHER REGIONAL TRANSIT SERVICES
Amtrak offers statewide passenger rail service in California. The Pacific Surfliner route runs through Los
Angeles (Union Station) to San Diego. The Pacific Surfliner offered twelve daily round-trip journeys
between San Diego and Los Angeles, and between Santa Barbara and San Diego. The Coast Starlight route
runs from Los Angeles through San Jose, Oakland, and Sacramento to Seattle. Residents of Compton can
take the Blue Line to Union Station in Los Angeles. A Greyhound bus terminal is located at the MLK
Transit Center at 305 North Willowbrook Avenue, providing connections throughout the U. S.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
3.2.14 COMPTON/WOODLEY AIRPORT
The County of Los Angeles owns a general aviation airport in
Compton at 901 W. Alondra Boulevard, the Compton/Woodley
Airport. The 77-acre airport is bounded by Alondra Boulevard,
Wilmington Avenue, 158th Street, and Central Avenue. In
addition to two 3,322-foot runways, the airport has
accommodations for almost 200 planes, either in hangers or
tied down. The airport is currently managed by a private firm,
American Airports Corporation. The airport has operated
continuously since 1929 and serves training, private business,
and law enforcement functions.
The airport is also home to a museum with a flight school, in-
flight helicopter training, and several flight clubs. Tomorrow’s
Aeronautical Museum is a unique compilation of a living
interactive museum, youth programs, and adult flight school. The museum features pictures, flight
simulator, antique aircraft, and visits and lectures from surviving members of the Tuskegee Airmen.
Tomorrow’s Aeronautical Museum is home to Positive Vibration/Aviation Explorers After School Youth
Flight Training Programs, Aero Squad flight school for adults, and the Skycap Café. Tours are free of
charge and include behind-the-scenes views of the facility, aircraft, and airport. The Compton Airport also
holds a yearly air fair and is a popular film location site.
3.2.15 REGIONAL COMMERCIAL AIRPORTS
Compton is centrally located in Los Angeles County placing it within a 40 to 60 minute drive from five (5)
commercial airports. Ten miles southeast of Compton, Long Beach Airport is the closest airport to
Compton.
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), 14 miles northwest of Compton, is a 20 minute drive using the I-
105 freeway. LAX is one of the busiest airports in the world, handling 75% of the passengers, 78% of the
air cargo, and nearly 100% of the international passengers and cargo traffic in the five-county Southern
California region. LAX is served directly by shuttle, bus, and taxi. Public buses serving LAX include:
Culver City Bus Lines, Santa Monica Big Blue Bus, and Torrance Transit.
John Wayne Airport (SNA) is owned and operated by the County of Orange and is located about 32 miles
southeast of Compton. North of Compton in the San Fernando Valley, Burbank Airport is a small regional
airport approximately 40 miles from Compton. Ontario International Airport lies 46 miles east of
Compton in Orange County, providing additional domestic and international flights.
3.2.16 RAILROADS
Two railroads cross Compton in a north-south direction, the Metro Blue Line passenger rail and the
Alameda Corridor freight rail expressway. Passenger rail traffic affects circulation in Compton in two
ways. The Metro Blue Line railroad crossings impact traffic movement. There are seven east-west streets
connecting each side of the City. Of the City’s major east-west arterials, Rosecrans and Artesia have
overpasses while Compton, Alondra, and Greenleaf have at-grade crossings. The other streets that have
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                 PAGE 70

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
crossings are El Segundo, Palmer, Pine, Myrrh, and Elm Streets. There is also one pedestrian crossing at
Caldwell Street. Second, the use of the Metro Blue Line by Compton residents reduces traffic in and out of
the City. Strong bus connections to the Blue Line stations and increased housing opportunities adjacent to
the stations are expected to expand ridership.
An important element of the Alameda Corridor is the Mid-Corridor Trench located in Compton. This
facility carries freight trains in an open trench that is ten miles long, 33 feet deep, and 50 feet wide between
State Route 91 in Carson and 25th Street in Los Angeles. Along the southern route, corridor tracks remain
at-grade to maintain access to the Dolores Railroad Classification Yard and access to the Intermodal
Container Transfer Facility (ICTF). This also allows the corridor to cross over Compton Creek.
3.2.17 TRUCK ROUTES
The State of California Vehicle code establishes regulations on the use of local streets and roads by trucks
and other heavy vehicles. The Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles generate many truck trips that must
cross the City in a north-south direction. The businesses located along the Alameda Corridor or in the
industrial area in the south of the City also generate many truck trips as well as local delivery truck trips.
Exhibit 3-6 identifies the streets that trucks are allowed on in Compton. Trucks often use streets that are
not designed for their weight. Appropriate signs should be erected in order to designate streets as “Limited
Truck Traffic Routes” and “Unlimited Truck Traffic Routes” for the movement of commercial vehicles
exceeding a maximum gross weight of 6,000 pounds to reduce unnecessary wear and tear on the City’s
streets. Impact fees assessed to land uses requiring heavy trucks will help the city in maintaining its
streets used by trucks.
3.2.18 PARKING
The City of Compton allows on-street parking in most areas of the City. The City provides a few off-street
parking facilities. The largest being the proposed park and ride structure at the Dr. Martin Luther King
Transit Center. An expansion of this structure is slated to be complete in 2015 and will offer 350 total
parking spaces for the Senior Center and the Park and Ride. The City also provides off-street parking lots.
A public parking structure is available at the Los Angeles County Compton Courthouse. The Artesia Metro
Light Rail station offers a surface lot for commuters. On-street parking is regulated by posted signs; there
are no parking meters in Compton. The City’s off-street parking requirements have been established by
zoning regulations. The parking requirements for key land use categories in the City include the following:
      Residential. All residences must provide a minimum of 1.5 to 2.0 enclosed, off-street parking
     spaces.
      Commercial Office. The parking requirement for office uses is one parking stall for every 300
          square feet of floor area.
      Commercial Retail. The parking requirement for retail uses is one parking stall for every 250
          square feet of floor area.
      Industrial and Manufacturing. The parking requirement for industrial uses is one parking stall
          for every 850 square feet of floor area.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Parking problems in the City are largely confined to older areas where a limited amount of parking was
provided as part of the original development. For example, older churches, schools, or businesses provide
limited off-street parking since it was assumed that most parishioners, students, or patrons would walk
instead of drive. However, the increased mobility provided by the personal automobile has also led to an
increased in dependence on this form of transportation and the need for parking.
Parking problems have also become increasingly evident in residential neighborhoods. When many of the
City’s homes were first constructed (immediately before and following the Second World War) most
households only had a single car. In fact, most of the homes with enclosed garages had room for only one
car. Today, in contrast, many households today have three or more cars per household. Because of the
lack of parking for these additional cars, the availability of on-street parking on many residential streets is
limited. In 2010, the City established a permit parking program in the Richland Farms neighborhood to
address parking issues.
3.2.19 BIKEWAY AND HIKING TRAILS
Caltrans has developed statewide standards and definitions for the planning and design of bicycle facilities.
The following is a summation of these standards:
      Class I (Bicycle Path) - Provides a completely separated right of way for the exclusive use of
         bicycles and pedestrians with cross flow minimized.
      Class II Bikeway (Bike Lane) - Provides a striped lane for one-way bike travel on a street or
         highway.
      Class III Bikeway (Bike Route) - Provides for shared use with pedestrian or motor vehicle traffic.
All bike facilities in the City of Compton are Class I or Class II bicycle routes.
Since 1992, Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit has provided
about $102 million for bike projects throughout the county
including: bike maps, education and safety programs, bicycle
parking facilities, racks on buses, and bike paths. The Metro
makes provisions for bikes on both rail and bus transit lines.
The Metro also just completed a Metro Bicycle Transportation
Strategic Plan and Bicycle Transportation Account (BTA)
Compliance Document. The project mapped 3.5 Class I bike
path miles along the east side of Compton Creek and 10.25 Class
II bike lane miles along four (4) streets in the City of Compton.
The location and extent of these facilities are noted in Exhibit 3-
7.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
New bike paths are proposed along the remainder of Compton Creek as well as inside the Southern
California Edison right-of-way when it is redeveloped into a greenbelt. The bike paths along Greenleaf
Boulevard and Central Avenue will also be extended to the City boundaries. There are two major bicycle
trails in the City of Compton. The 29 mile Los Angeles River (LARIO) trail extends alongside the Los
Angeles River at Rio Hondo and continues to the ports of Long Beach passing through Compton. The
second path travels alongside the Compton Creek for roughly two (2) miles. The City of Compton has
developed a bikeway on the east side of Compton Creek and an equestrian trail on the west side of
Compton Creek.
The equestrian trail services existing regional equestrian clubs providing a link to coastal trails near Los
Angeles harbor. The multipurpose trail has been completed from El Segundo Boulevard to Greenleaf
Boulevard. The remaining segment of the trail will be completed in 2011 connecting the trail to the Artesia
Freeway (I-91) and eventually to the multipurpose trail along the Los Angeles River.
                            SECTION 3.3 CIRCULATION PLAN
3.3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN
The Circulation Plan identifies the City’s goals for 2010 through 2030 related to the safe and efficient
movement of goods and persons through the City and sets the policies and programs for achieving them.
The plan also provides details on the accommodation of bicyclists, children, motorists, commercial drivers,
disabled persons, and senior citizens in the planning, design, construction, and operation of streets, roads
and highways, to ensure reasonably safe and convenient travel. The City’s vision for Circulation is to
utilize Smart Growth principles to increase the use of alternate forms of transportation.
3.3.2 CIRCULATION GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Circulation Element were developed in response to circulation issues
identified in the technical background report and on issues and opportunities identified in community
workshops that were conducted as part of a comprehensive outreach program.
CIRCULATION ISSUE - REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING
The City of Compton is centrally located in Los Angeles County and truly lives up to its name as “the Hub
City.” This is due to the City’s centralized location within the region’s freeway network. The City is also
well served by region’s first mass transit line constructed since the dismantling of the old Red-Car system.
For this reason, it is imperative that Compton remain proactive in the on-going regional transportation
planning efforts.
     Circulation Goal 1. Participate in regional transportation planning efforts to support consistency
     with the goals of the City’s General Plan.
      Circulation Policy 1.1. The City of Compton will participate in regional transportation planning
         efforts coordinated by the Southern California Association of Governments to ensure that the
         needs of the City are considered.
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                    PAGE 75

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
      Circulation Policy 1.2. City of Compton will participate in the development of the sub-regional
          Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS) being prepared by the Gateway Cities Council of
          Government to ensure that the City of Compton is represented in the development of the SCS.
      Circulation Policy 1.3. The City of Compton will comply with the adopted Los Angeles County
          Congestion Management Plan (CMP).
      Circulation Policy 1.4. The City of Compton will participate with the Los Angeles County Airport
          Land Use Commission in their land use planning efforts for Compton Airport.
      Circulation Policy 1.5. The City of Compton will coordinate with the Los Angeles County
          Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the cities of Gardena and Long Beach, and the Compton
          Renaissance Transit System to maintain bus routes and regular bus schedules citywide for both
          local and regional trips.
CIRCULATION ISSUE - MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE AND GOODS
The General Plan defines the land use for the City’s future. Stakeholders want to ensure that the increase
in density will not adversely affect existing residents and businesses by overwhelming the circulation
system of Compton. Truck traffic further impacts the roadways because of their weight and size.
Compton must regulate the development, maintenance, and use of the City’s roadways to achieve the
vision for a safe and efficient circulation system.
     Circulation Goal 2. Maintain a street system that meets current and future City needs and that
     facilitates the safe and efficient movement of people and goods throughout Compton.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
CIRCULATION ISSUE - TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS
There are limited opportunities for significant new transportation-related infrastructure. Future
transportation improvements will most likely focus on fine-tuning the existing roadway network through
improved intersection controls, traffic calming measures, and ways to promote pedestrian and alternative
modes of transit.
    Circulation Goal 3. Improve infrastructure for public transportation, bicycle, and pedestrian
    transportation modes.
     Circulation Policy 3.1. The City of Compton will maintain and promote the Martin Luther King Jr.
         (MLK) Transit Center as a multi-modal transit stop.
     Circulation Policy 3.2. The City of Compton will encourage new large-scale commercial and
         residential projects to incorporate into project design: bus bays, bus shelters, transit stops, bicycle
         racks, and other similar features that promote the use of alternative forms of transit.
     Circulation Policy 3.3. The City of Compton will work with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
         Transportation Authority to provide sheltered, clearly marked, and safely located bus stops.
     Circulation Policy 3.4. The City of Compton will encourage integrated, mixed use developments
         which locate retail and service commercial uses within easy walking distance of the residential
         neighborhoods they are intended to serve.
     Circulation Policy 3.5. The City of Compton will support the efforts of the Los Angeles County
         Metropolitan Transportation Authority to expand light rail service along the Blue Line route.
     Circulation Policy 3.6. The City of Compton will encourage development along major roads and
         secondary highways and collector streets to establish landscaping or similar buffers to better
         protect pedestrians from vehicular traffic.
CIRCULATION ISSUE - PARKING
Too much parking can be just as bad as too little parking. Parking should support transit-oriented
development while, at the same time, ensuring that the lack of parking does not lead to congestion on local
streets.
    Circulation Goal 4. Provide adequate, properly designed off-street parking facilities for all types of
    development.
     Circulation Policy 4.1. The City of Compton will require new development projects to provide
         parking facilities consistent with zoning code requirements that are convenient and safe.
     Circulation Policy 4.2. The City of Compton will promote joint-use or shared parking
         arrangements where it can be shown that such arrangements will not create on-street parking
         problems.
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                      PAGE 77

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
      Circulation Policy 4.3. The City of Compton will explore potentials for developing a joint use
         municipal parking structure in downtown commercial areas to promote redevelopment of the
         older commercial areas.
CIRCULATION ISSUE – SAFE WALKING AND CYCLING ENVIRONMENT
Developing infrastructure that promotes residents walking and bicycling for travel to work, school or
recreational purposes is a marker of a sustainable and healthy community. One of the metrics used to
measure communities engaged in Smart Growth is the number of residents walking or cycling to undertake
personal trips. The goal and policies below are designed to support efforts to create this environment in
Compton.
     Circulation Goal 5. Provide a safe physical environment that encourages bicycling and walking as a
     means of transportation and recreation.
      Health Policy 5.1. The City of Compton will adopt a Complete Streets policy that encourages a
         multi-modal approach to street design and meets the intent of providing access for all modes of
         transportation on the city’s roadways.
      Health Policy 5.2. The City of Compton will develop design standards for new roadways that
         incorporate elements of the City’s Complete Streets policy to ensure the policy is implemented in
         all future roadway infrastructure improvements. Site design standards will be updated to support
         the Complete Street policy.
      Health Policy 5.3. The City of Compton will support constructing grade separations of Railroad
         and Los Angeles County Metro Light Rail tracks at crossings of key arterial roadways to provide
         safe pedestrian and bicycle access across tracks and to reconnect neighborhoods and commercial
         districts.
3.3.3 ROADWAY CLASSIFICATIONS & STANDARDS
The roadway classification system described herein is used to identify the function of each roadway in the
City. The classification system provides a logical framework for the design and operation of roadways
serving Compton. The roadway system in Compton has been defined using a classification system that
describes a hierarchy of roadway types. The categories of roadways included in this classification system
differentiate the size, function, and capacity of each type of roadway and relate to the land use demands of
the community. Streets in the City are also classified according to their primary function, consisting of four
types of roadways. The roadways are described below and are shown in Exhibit 3-8.
      Major Highways. The main function of a Major Highway is to provide regional, sub-regional, and
           intra-city travel service. Through-traffic comprises the bulk of traffic volumes on these roadways.
           These streets typically provide two traffic lanes in each direction, and the lanes may be separated
           by either a median strip or a two-way, left-turn lane. The roadway cross-section includes up to
           84 feet of paving within a 100-foot right-of-way. Lanes are 12 feet wide, and the center median
           or turn lane is 16 feet wide. Signalized intersections include pedestrian signals.
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                      PAGE 78

SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                         PAGE 79

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Secondary Arterials. Secondary Streets serve a similar function as Major Arterials, except the
        design capacity of the former is not as great as the latter. Secondary Arterials typically consist of
        four travel lanes that are undivided. This roadway classification has a typical right-of-way width of
        80-feet with 64 feet of paving. Two roadway configurations are used. A Secondary Arterial may
        contain two, 12-foot wide traffic lanes in each direction separated by a 16-foot wide, two-way left-
        turn lane. Alternatively, the center left-turn lane may be replaced by 8-foot wide curb parking
        lanes on each side of the street.
     Collector Streets. A Collector Street provides circulation in a defined geographic area of the City
        and connects this area to secondary streets, arterials, and freeways. The majority of the traffic use
        collector streets to move to roadways carrying intra-city or through-traffic. Collector streets
        typically consist of two travel lanes.
     Local Streets. Local streets are subordinate to the basic circulation network described above, yet
        constitute the majority of the City’s streets. These streets provide access to individual parcels and
        only provide circulation within a neighborhood block. Most streets have been improved with
        curbs, gutters, and sidewalks. The City standard for local streets is 60 feet (with a curb-to-curb
        pavement width of 36 feet, two lanes, and on-street parking on both sides).
The functional designation of a roadway does not necessarily indicate the existing conditions (i.e., traffic
volume, width, and available right-of-way). Instead, the classification indicates the intended use and
ultimate design of the roadway to accommodate the anticipated travel demand.
3.3.4 TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS
There are a number of key programs the city will continue to implement or undertake as part of the
implementation of this General Plan. These existing and proposed programs are identified below.
     Caltrans Coordination. The City will coordinate efforts with Caltrans to upgrade area freeways.
        The purpose of this undertaking is to ensure that the city is fully appraised of the improvement
        efforts in the early stages of planning and design. The City will continue to work with Caltrans and
        the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), as appropriate, and will request to be on all
        notification lists for future projects that may impact the City.
     Compliance with AB 1358: Accommodation of Users Based on Land Use Context. The Public
        Works Department will periodically conduct traffic studies including counts of automobiles,
        bicycles, and pedestrians.
     Residential Neighborhoods will be designed or improved when possible to accommodate bicyclists,
        children, motorists, commercial drivers, disabled persons, and senior citizens. The Richland
        Farms neighborhood will accommodate these users without the use of sidewalks to preserve the
        rural nature of this neighborhood.
     Commercial Districts and Mixed Use Districts will be designed or improved when possible to
        accommodate all users of alternative forms of transportation.
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                      PAGE 80

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
    Industrial Districts will be designed or improved when possible to accommodate motorists,
       commercial drivers, disabled persons, and senior citizens.
    Bicyclists will be accommodated. The City will implement the Metro Bicycle Transportation
       Strategic Plan and Bicycle Transportation Account compliance document. In addition, new bike
       paths are proposed along the remainder of Compton Creek as well as inside the Southern
       California Edison right-of-way when it is redeveloped into a greenbelt. The bike paths along
       Greenleaf Boulevard and Central Avenue will also be extended to the City boundaries. The City
       will prepare a Bicycle Master Plan to identify locations for additional bicycle lanes and routes and
       bicycle projects for inclusion in its Capital Improvement Plan.
    Children will be accommodated through the development of safe routes to school in partnership
       with the Compton Unified School District through the provision of bike lanes, crosswalks, stop
       signs or signals based on traffic studies. The City will include plans for needed upgrades to
       existing infrastructure in its Capital Improvement Plan.
    Motorists will be accommodated through Compton’s existing roadway classification system that
       describes a hierarchy of roadway types. The categories of roadways included in this classification
       system differentiate the size, function, and capacity of each type of roadway and relate to the land
       use demands of the community.
    Commercial drivers will be accommodated through Compton’s existing roadway classification
       system and the City’s development standards which regulate circulation-related needs of
       commercial and related uses.
    Transit Riders will be accommodated through the development of a Transit Roadway network that
       classifies roadways that can support local transit service. Regional transit access will be
       accommodated by the Metro Blue Line Light Rail Corridor and policies to improve access to the
       Compton and Acacia Blue Line Stations. The City’s street standards will be updated to include
       improvements to access to and from transit stops in the City. The City’s development standards
       will include provision for transit access and stops for new development located adjacent to a
       transit line.
    Disabled persons will be accommodated through the City’s parking requirements for handicapped
       parking and through the provision of curb cuts to facilitate wheelchair access. The City will require
       new developments that require installation of pedestrian crossing signals to include audible
       signals.
    Senior citizens will be accommodated through development of safe routes to shopping and services
       through the maintenance of sidewalks and the provision of crosswalks and stop signs or signals
       based on traffic studies. The City will include plans for needed upgrades to existing infrastructure
       in its Capital Improvement Plan.
    Intersections will be controlled if they exceed established standards for safe circulation of
       motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Standards include eleven warrants such as a minimum
       vehicular volume over 600 per hour and pedestrian volume over 190 per hour.
SECTION 3 – CIRCULATION ELEMENT                                                                      PAGE 81

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
    Pedestrian crossings will be required at controlled intersections as well as curbing at the midpoint
       for refuge by pedestrians when crossing the roadway when recommended by a traffic study.
       Standards will be adopted to ensure that adequate detection of pedestrians, ample crossing time in
       signal timing, and visual and audio displays of crossing time are provided at controlled
       intersections.
    Capital Improvement Planning. The City's Capital Improvement Program (CIP) is a five-year plan
       that indicates the timing of major capital expenditures. Individual projects are reviewed and
       ranked on an annual basis, and may include streetscape upgrades, installation of traffic signals,
       slurry seal for streets, sidewalk repair, and sewer line upgrades. The City will continue to update,
       review, and implement its CIP to consider transportation-related improvements.
    Enforcement of Truck Parking. The City will enforce the ordinances governing trucks use of non-
       designated truck routes, illegal on-street parking, and other traffic laws.
    Environmental Review. The City shall continue to evaluate the environmental impacts of new
       development and provide mitigation measures prior to development approval, as required by the
       California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Environmental review shall be provided for major
       projects and those that will have a potential to adversely impact the environment. Among those
       issues that may be addressed in the environmental analysis are traffic, parking, and circulation. In
       compliance with CEQA, the City shall also assign responsibilities for the verification of the
       implementation of mitigation measures. The City’s environmental review procedures are currently
       in place.
    Public Transit Review Program. The City will evaluate the need to modify routes, schedules, and
       fares of the Compton Renaissance Transit System and other local transit service to achieve
       circulation goals and policies (e.g., coordinate the local transit system with the regional transit
       system). The City will also continue to work with the MTA and other transit service agencies in
       adjacent communities to identify the most beneficial route and stops in Compton. The City will
       provide development plans to service providers for review for those projects that may affect public
       transit services.
    Signalization. The City will strive to provide optimum signalization on major thoroughfares to
       maximize circulation efficiency, such as participation in a regional signalization program. City
       staff will outline both the need and strategy for improved signalization.
    Truck Route Planning. Compton will work with other cities, public agencies, and stakeholders to
       establish a system of truck route plans for the sub-region.
    Transit Centers. Transit centers consisting of bus turnouts and loading areas, weatherproof
       shelters, information centers, emergency phones, and in some areas park-n’-ride facilities, will be
       implemented as part of new development. The lead city agency to study the feasibility of
       developing “transit centers” will be designated by the City Manager.

                SECTION 4.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
4.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
The Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Element of the Compton General Plan combine the
required elements of conservation and open space with an optional parks and recreation element. The
purpose of the conservation element is to provide direction regarding the conservation, development, and
utilization of natural resources. Resources (both natural and man-made) that are considered in this
Element include water, minerals, areas of historic or cultural value, and open space resources used for
recreation. The Element focuses on those remaining natural resources in Compton that must be
considered in future planning and development in the City, and identifies those programs that will aid in
preventing their loss or wasteful exploitation.
The purpose of the open space element is to guide the comprehensive and long-range preservation and
conservation of “open space land”. Open space land is defined as any parcel or area of land or water that is
essentially unimproved and devoted to open space use (§65560(b)).
Public parks are considered improved open space providing passive and active recreation opportunities.
The quantity and quality of park lands greatly impact the quality of life of a community. Because of the
value placed on parks and recreation, more than 40 percent of the cities and counties in California adopted
some form of a parks and recreation element, according to the Governor’s Office of Planning and
Research’s 2002 local government planning survey. In addition, when policies and standards for parks
and recreation facilities are defined in the General Plan, the city is authorized to require the dedication of
land or the payment of in-lieu fees as a condition of tentative subdivision map approval. These exactions
are limited to the impacts caused by new residential development and must bear a reasonable relationship
to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the area under the Quimby Act.
4.1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
The Conservation, Open Space, and Parks and Recreation Element consist of the following sections:
      The Introduction to the Element provides an overview of the Element’s scope and content.
      The Background Report discusses a wide range of issues affecting the natural and manmade
         resources of the City that must be considered in future planning and development in the City.
      The Resource Management Plan identifies the policies related to natural and manmade resources
         along with those programs that will be effective in implementing the policies. This section also
         identifies standards for the dedication of land or payment of fees for park and recreational
         purposes.
                        SECTION 4.2 BACKGROUND REPORT
The Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Element Background Report provide an overview of
existing characteristics and conditions of the City’s natural resources, open space, and parks. This
background information serves as the basis for the Resource Management Plan.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
4.2.1 SURFACE WATER RESOURCES
Surface water resources include Compton Creek, a major
tributary of the Los Angeles River, and it is an important part of
the regional Los Angeles Watershed and a small reach of the Los
Angeles River between Compton Boulevard and Alondra
Boulevard. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers maintains the
majority of the creek, which is concrete-lined. A small portion of
the southern section of the creek contains a wetland/riparian
habitat maintained by the Los Angeles County Department of
Public Works. The beginning of the earth-bottomed portion of
the Compton Creek is located between the Artesia Freeway on the
south and Greenleaf Boulevard on the north.
The Los Angeles County Watershed Management reports that the
lower portion of the Los Angeles River Watershed, including
Compton Creek, has impaired water quality due to polluted storm water runoff conveyed from the
surrounding urban areas. Impairments to water quality are similar throughout the region and include a
number of metals, ammonia, trash, coliform bacteria, algae, oil, the insecticide - chlorpyrifos as well as
other pesticides, and volatile organics. Storm water run-off from parking lots along the river is also a
major contributor to poor water quality.
The City is covered by the Los Angeles County National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit. This permit is administered by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board. As
required by the NPDES permit, the City has developed a Storm Water Quality Management Plan (SQMP)
to improve and protect the quality of storm water runoff within Compton. The SQMP is implemented by
City ordinances, requirements, and policies that govern public and private construction projects, site
management, and operations.
In order to discourage the dumping of waste in sewers, storm drains, or dumps, the City of Compton
Municipal Water Department works in conjunction with Los Angeles County to hold one-day Household
Hazardous Waste disposal events in the city. Outside of these events, Compton residents can take
                                             household hazardous materials to permanent hazardous waste
                                             collection centers throughout the County. The Department
                                             also operates an oil recycling program to encourage residents
                                             to recycle their used motor oil and used oil filters. The
                                             program provides public education information on the
                                             environmental hazards of dumping used motor oil and door-
                                             to-door collection.
                                             In June 2005 the Los Angeles San Gabriel River Watershed
                                             Council released the Compton Creek Watershed Management
                                             Plan that includes a strategy for the revitalization of Compton
                                             Creek. The principles established in the Compton Creek
                                             Watershed Management Plan were used to develop the City’s
                                             Compton Creek Regional Garden Park Management Plan,
                                             which was adopted in November 2006. Events such as the

Coastal Cleanup Day are helping to improve the quality and appearance of the creek. Organizations
involved in local clean-up efforts include the City of Compton, Heal the Bay, the California Coastal
Commission and the Pacific American Volunteer Association.
4.2.2 GROUNDWATER RESOURCES
In the late 1800's, the Los Angeles River and the adjoining tributaries were an undependable source of
water supply during most of the year. Fortunately, this problem was solved by drilling wells on local farms.
An ample supply of excellent quality water was obtained. In fact, the natural pressure was such that most
of the wells flowed continuously and had to be capped with a shut-off valve or with a tall standpipe to
prevent flooding. These artesian wells rarely required pumping except during the dry summer months.
For nearly twenty years after the first settlements, the volume of artesian water in one well could have
provided for most of the homes within the City. Increased demand in later years caused significant drain
on local water levels, and wells within the City are now pumped from a depth of several hundred feet to
provide domestic water.
Regionally, groundwater quality is of some concern. Historic over pumping caused water levels to fall
below sea level, which allowed for seawater intrusion. The Central Basin is now protected by the Los
Alamitos Barrier in Long Beach. The Water Replenishment District uses recycled water to maintain the
barrier through an agreement with the Orange County Water District.
The Central Basin consists of nine aquifers that are confined by numerous aquicludes, which are clay and
silt layers that restrict vertical percolation into underlying aquifers. The only named aquiclude in the area
is the near-surface Bellflower Aquiclude that extends from near-surface grade to approximately 40-feet
deep.     The underlying aquifer, Exposition Aquifer, is located approximately 40 feet below ground.
Aquifers located beneath the Exposition Aquifer include the Gage, Hollydale, Jefferson, Lynwood,
Silverado, and Sunnyside Aquifers. According to water well data from the State of California Department
of Conservation, groundwater depths in the City typically occur at approximately 122 feet below the ground
surface.
4.2.3 COMPTON’S WATER SUPPLY
The City of Compton Municipal Water Department (CMWD)
provides water delivery to customers in Compton; its water
supply has consistently met or exceeded the State’s standards
for potable water. CMWD currently has two sources of water
supply: local groundwater contained in the Los Angeles County
Central Basin and imported water from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California (MWD).                Water quality
management is a joint concern of the CMWD, the Compton
Public Works Department, the MWD, and the County of Los
Angeles Department of Public Works.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The City has seven water wells with a pumping capacity of 14.4 million gallons per day. There are four
reservoir tanks with a combined storage capacity of 12.8 million gallons. CMWD owns and maintains
approximately 163 miles of water lines ranging in diameter from 4-inches to 24-inches. CMWD is
currently planning for the installation of two new wells and implementing a capital improvement program
to replace the over-aged and undersized pipelines throughout the City.
In order to prevent over pumping, the courts have limited pumping in the Central Basin to 217,367 acre
feet per year. The City of Compton has the right to pump 5,780 acre-feet per year (AFY) regulated by the
Water Replenishment District of Southern California. Additional groundwater must be obtained through
leasing or buying another entity’s rights to groundwater in the Central Basin.
During 2003-2004, the City of Compton pumped 6,853 acre-feet from the aquifer. The city leased water
rights from California Water Service Company and Angeles Abbey Memorial Park to obtain additional
acre-feet over their limit. In addition, 3,205 acre-feet was imported from the State Water Project and
Colorado River. The City of Compton does not participate in a recycled water reclamation program at this
time. In addition, CMWD imports potable water from MWD (from the State water project and the
Colorado River). CMWD has three connections with MWD; C-1, C-3, and C-4. The maximum
capacities for these connections are 20 cubic feet per second (CFS) for C-1, 7.5 CFS for C-3, and
10 CFS for C-4. This translates into a maximum yearly draw of approximately 27,149 AFY.
Generally, CMWD operates this connection at less than 14% of this maximum capacity.
An agreement between the City of Compton and MWD signed in February 2005 should provide drought
protection and water reliability to the region, while $2.42 million in State Proposition 13 funds was used to
upgrade CMWD’s pipeline and wells. MWD will pump 2,289 acre-feet of water into the local groundwater
aquifer to be stored and used by the City of Compton. The arrangement will reduce demands on MWD and
upgrade the City’s infrastructure. The project was completed October 2009. The average daily per capita
demand is a useful measure for evaluating the historic water demands in connection with population and
planning projections. The average per capita consumption rate between 2000 and 2004 was 92.5 gallons
of water per persons per day. Water quality management is a joint concern of CMWD, MWD, and the
County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works.
                                            The City has the pumping and importing capabilities to serve
                                            undeveloped areas within its boundaries, however additional
                                            system improvements would be required in order to provide
                                            service. The system needs upgrades or replacements for water
                                            mains, wells, storage facilities, building structures, and a
                                            construction yard. Some of these upgrades will take place
                                            within the next five years by utilizing funds generated by the
                                            bonds sold by the City in 2009.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
4.2.4 SOILS
The City of Compton is located within the Los Angeles Basin. The
soil in this area is comprised of more than 20,000 feet of sediments.
This thickness of rock is composed of alternating layers of sandstone
and shale, due to change in geologic conditions as it was deposited
over many centuries.
The soils covering the eastern half of the City are comprised of
Hanford Fine Sandy Loam. These soils are well-drained soils that
formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium, predominantly from
granite. Hanford soils are found on stream bottoms, floodplains, and
alluvial fans. Fine Sandy Loam is dark brown, moist, and weak, with
a fine granular structure. It is slightly hard, very friable, non-sticky,
and non-plastic.
Chino Silt Loam comprises about 30% of the City. Silt Loam is
indicative of the location of the historic creek bed. In certain non-urban areas of Los Angeles County, the
Chino soils association is considered a Prime Farmland soil. However, this designation does not apply to
those soils found in the City of Compton. Ramona Loam, which is a coarse sandy loam, makes up another
15% of the area. There are no other soils in the City designated as “Prime Farmland,” “Unique Farmland”
or “Statewide Importance.” Soils resources in the City are shown in Exhibit 4-1.
4.2.5 MINERAL RESOURCES
The City is located in close proximity to a number of active oil fields. The Rosecrans oilfield is located
approximately two miles to the west, the East Los Angeles oilfield is located approximately seven miles to
the northeast, and the Dominguez oilfield is located approximately five miles to the south. There are also a
number of oil and natural gas wells located in the City of Compton. The location of both active and
abandoned oil and gas wells are shown in Exhibit 4-2. The majority of these wells are located in the
southern portion of the City.
The State Mining and Geology Board (SMGB) is the lead agency for the City of Compton under the Surface
Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA). SMGB recently approved the closure of the Atkinson Brick
Pit No. II site. Surrounded by industrial and residential developments on all sides, the Atkinson Brickyard
site is divided into three areas: Areas I, II and III. Area II was a former surface mining operation that has
been remediated to an acceptable condition for its future re-use. The entire site is covered under a
reclamation plan that was approved by the City of Compton Planning Commission in 1987. The soils
found on this site are unconsolidated, laterally discontinuous sand and clay deposits.
The State Division of Mines and Geology has not designated any lands in Compton as a classified mineral
resource deposit area. Due the urban nature of Compton, it is unlikely that mineral resources will be
discovered and utilized in the future.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
4.2.6 AGRICULTURAL AND FARM LANDS
The City of Compton is primarily an urban environment with no agricultural land under commercial
cultivation. However, there are two areas of the City adjacent to Greenleaf Avenue that are zoned as
residential agricultural. The area bounded by E. Greenleaf Avenue, Compton Community College, and
Tarter Lane is designated as a residential agricultural area. The second area that is zoned as a residential
agricultural area is located north of W. Greenleaf Boulevard between Oleander Avenue and S. Wilmington
Avenue, and both sides of Raymond Street on the north. The properties on S. Wilmington Avenue are not
zoned residential agricultural. Residential agriculture areas in the City are used primarily as single family
homes, small child day-care centers, and nurseries. Residents within this area are allowed to own a limited
number of farm animals such as poultry, rabbits, sheep, goats, aviary, horses, or cows for private use.
4.2.7 FLORAL AND FAUNAL RESOURCES
As Compton became urbanized, native vegetation was replaced by imported species. The area’s climate is
Mediterranean, like the rest of the Southern California region, with moderate temperatures, rainy winters
and dry summers, supporting a wide range of imported vegetation. The wetland habitat in the soft-
bottomed portion of Compton Creek includes cattails, aquatic grasses, killdeer, red-winged blackbirds, and
great blue heron.
Animal life in Compton is predominantly domesticated though other animal species that are capable of
living in close proximity to man, such as birds, skunks, and squirrels, are found in the area. The special
interest/sensitive animal species identified as potentially occurring in the area is the Pacific pocket mouse
(Perognathus longimembris pacificus). The special interest/sensitive plant species identified as
potentially occurring in the project area includes the southern tarplant (Centromadia parryi ssp.
australis), the Coulter's goldfields (Lasthenia glabrata ssp. coulteri), the Parish's brittlescale (Atriplex
parishii), the coastal dunes milk-vetch (Astragalus tener var. titi), the Brand's phacelia (Phacelia
stellaris), the spreading navarretia (Navarretia fossalis), the prostrate navarretia (Navarretia prostrata),
and the California orcutt grass (Orcuttia californica). No rare or endangered plant species are known to
currently exist in the City.
4.2.8 OPEN SPACE RESOURCES
Compton’s open spaces resources range from the Southern
California Edison right-of-way along Greenleaf Boulevard to two
local cemeteries with Compton Creek running through the middle
as shown in Exhibit 5-3. The Southern California Edison right-of-
way bisects the City and parallels Greenleaf Boulevard. The land
contains power transmission lines and nurseries. The City has
negotiated with Edison to provide a greenway through the City
with a multipurpose trail.
Compton Creek is a 42.1 square mile sub-watershed of the Los
Angeles River watershed. The watershed is highly urbanized; only
3.3% of the land is open space, park land, agricultural, or vacant.
The portion of the watershed inside the city is predominantly
residential with single family homes. There remainder contains

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
commercial and industrial uses. The Compton Creek Regional Garden Park Master Plan will guide
development of park and open space resources along and near the creek with the goal of providing a linear
parkway. Linkages to the linear parks along the Los Angeles River are included. The master plan also
includes strategies for restoring wildlife habitat.
Two cemeteries are located within the Compton sphere of influence. Angeles Abbey Cemetery is located at
1515 E. Compton Boulevard in a county unincorporated section of Compton and contains the historic
Angeles Abbey Mausoleum. Woodlawn Cemetery is located at 1715 W. Greenleaf next to the Southern
California Edison right-of-way and is the final resting place of 18 civil war veterans. It has been a Los
Angeles County Historic Landmark since 1946.
4.2.9 BICYCLE PATHS AND RECREATIONAL TRAILS
Of the 8.5 Miles of Compton Creek that flow through City, five
miles contain a multipurpose trail run alongside the creek. The
main branch of Compton Creek contains three miles of paths along
the east bank. This trail is designed for cyclists and pedestrians
and extends from West El Segundo Boulevard to Greenleaf
Boulevard. The final segment of the trail from Greenleaf Boulevard
to I-91 Freeway is scheduled for completion by 2011.              An
additional two miles of paved trail exists south of the Blue Line,
under the Artesia Freeway, and along the shorter east fork of
Compton Creek. This section ends where Compton Creek enters
the Los Angeles River. This portion of the bike path passes the
natural bottom portion of Compton Creek where path users can
observe native vegetation and wildlife.
The City will start construction on a multipurpose trail within the Southern California Edison right-of-way
along Greenleaf Boulevard. The project is proposed to be constructed in phases and will provide
continuous trails running east and west of the City, eventually connecting to the LA River and Hemingway
Park in Carson. Additional bicycle lanes have been constructed along Alondra Boulevard, Central Avenue,
Greenleaf Boulevard, and Santa Fe Avenue. Compton residents also benefit from regional bike paths such
as the Lario Trail, a 28-mile bike path that extends alongside the LA River from Rio Hondo to the Ports of
Los Angeles and Long Beach. Several parks will be outfitted with recreational trails including Raymond
Street Park, South Park, Ellerman Park, and Kelly Park. Gonzales Park will have a perimeter trail that will
meander throughout the entire park. For map of bicycle paths and recreation trails throughout Compton,
please see the Circulation Element map 4-3.
4.2.10 PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES
The City of Compton Parks and Recreation Department maintains 18 local parks that encompass 60 acres
of parkland. These City parks are shown in Exhibit 4-4 and are summarized in Table 4-1. The Department
oversees activities the parks listed below as well as the Compton Par 3 Golf Course, the new Dollarhide
Community Center, and recreational trails. The Department also utilizes playgrounds at local schools for
residents’ recreational purposes through joint-use agreements.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
                                             Three major park projects are underway in Compton. They
                                             include the completion of the Compton Creek Regional Garden
                                             Park, redevelopment of Gonzalez Park, and development of
                                             Greenleaf Regional Park. All three parks will be connected via
                                             a multipurpose trail offering more than 10 miles of trail
                                             connectivity inside the City as well as access to the trail along
                                             the LA River. The Compton Creek Regional Garden Park
                                             Master Plan (Plan) was adopted by the City Council in 2006.
                                             The Plan outlines a series of improvements along Compton
                                             Creek designed to redevelop the City’s existing flood control
                                             channel and adjacent land into a safe, ecologically beneficial,
                                             multi-use, public greenway to be called the Compton Creek
                                             Regional Garden Park.
The plan identifies 10 “creek systems” or uses along the creek such as parks, pedestrian bridges, and creek
streets. Systematic improvements are illustrated for each of these typical spaces and urban types
throughout the creek corridor. The “creek system” diagrams are synthesized into a green map illustrating
the vision for a continuous network of multi-use open spaces, which are organized into three creek zones.
The master plan describes each of the programmatic systems which make up this green network and
illustrates where they occur in the garden park.
One example is Raymond Street Park, an existing park along Compton Creek in the Richland Farms
neighborhood. The planned addition of a recreational trail will tie it more closely to the Creek. Across the
creek lies a vacant 1-acre lot. The Plan recommends acquiring it to enhance the creek environment and
balance amenities on both sides of the creek in this community.
Implementation of the Master Plan will result in a 3.75 mile-long park system of gardens, plazas, trails,
habitats, outdoor classrooms, promenades, and integrated Best Management Practices that promote
watershed enhancement and protection. Transforming Compton Creek into a beautiful, economically
beneficial asset for the City begins by reestablishing a healthy waterway. With this in mind, an integrated
network of water improvement strategies serves as the foundation for the Compton Creek Regional Garden
Park. Potential funding for this network from multi-benefit, clean water bonds, grants, and public/private
partnerships, will allow Compton to redesign the Creek as a vibrant central corridor that will catalyze
future urban investment. The Master Plan seeks to replace and redefine the many benefits the Creek once
provided within today’s complex urban context. The City Council in May of 2014 adopted the City of
Compton Parks Master Plan. A 4.8 million dollar parks capitol improvement project that will be
completed in May 2015.
Gonzalez Park is another major park project in Compton. The redevelopment of Gonzales Park will expand
the existing park by renovating the existing Jackie Robinson Stadium and adding the following new
amenities, two new baseball fields, commercial spaces for retail, a two-story gymnasium featuring an
indoor/outdoor running track above an Olympic-sized swimming pool, classroom and dance studios, and a
museum. In addition, a leisure pool is proposed for toddlers as well as a tot lot. The third major park
project underway, Greenleaf Regional Park, is proposed within the right-of-way of Southern California
Edison (SCE) that is located on the south side of Greenleaf Boulevard. The park will include California
native and drought tolerant plants, a meandering trail, public art, and lighting. The park will extend from

Central Avenue on the west, including connecting to Hemingway Park in Carson, to the I-710 Freeway and
LA River on the east.
The County of Los Angeles maintains the following parks within
Compton’s Sphere of Influence: Athens Park, Earvin “MAGIC”
Johnson Recreation Area, East Rancho Dominquez Park,
Enterprise Park, George Washington Carver Park, Mona Park,
and Roy Campanella Park. The regional parks share similar
amenities as parks in Compton. East Rancho Dominquez Park is
also located within the Compton Planning Area. Earvin “MAGIC”
Johnson Recreation Area is the only nearby park that currently
offers soccer fields. It is located north and slightly west of the
City on El Segundo Boulevard.
The National Recreation and Parks Association recommends five
acres for every 1,000 residents. However, the Quimby Ordinance
enables cities in California with standards of 3 acres per 1,000
residents to assess new developments an impact fee for park development. Given the City’s current
population of nearly 100,000 residents, a total of 500 acres of parkland would be required to meet the
NRPA’s standard of 5 acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents. A total of 300 acres of parkland would
be needed to meet the 3 acres of open space for every 1,000 residents. Though Compton does not have
much buildable land for potential parks, the city is looking at other alternatives such as revitalizing existing
vacant or abandoned lots. One such plan is to turn the numerous vacant lots along the Compton Creek
into small parks, bicycle paths, and scenic open space.
Since Compton is 90 percent built out, the City is looking to convert existing rooftops as new areas for park
and recreation area. There are at least 25 buildings in the City that offer prime roof areas that can
incorporate recreational amenities such as putting greens, batting cages, driving ranges, outdoor running
tracks, and rooftop gardens.
4.2.11 HISTORIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
Compton is located on one of the oldest communities in Los Angeles
County, dating back to 1784, when it was once a part of Rancho San
Pedro. One of Compton’s first homes, the Heritage House was built in
1869 and is a State Historic Landmark. The oldest house in Compton, it
was restored as a tribute to early settlers and was relocated to the Civic
Center.
Other historical sites include the First United Method Church, which is
the second oldest protestant church in Southern California, and the
Angeles Abbey Mausoleum, which serves as the final resting place for
many of Compton’s earliest notable public figures. The 170-year-old
Dominguez Rancho Adobe Seminary is located just south of the City and
is currently utilized as a museum for the public that educates visitors on
early settlement life in California.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The City of Compton lies within the original boundaries of the Rancho San Pedro land grant that was
owned by the Dominguez family. In 1866, Francis Temple and Fielding Gibson purchased a tract of land
north of the Dominguez homestead. This land, known as the Temple and Gibson Tract, was subdivided
and lots were first purchased by Harmon Higgins in 1866, and then by a group of pioneers in 1867 led by
G.D. Compton.
                  SECTION 4.3 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN
4.3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN
The Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Plan identifies the City’s goals for 2010 through 2030
related to the water, minerals, areas of historic or cultural value, open space resources, and recreational
facilities and sets the policies and programs for achieving them. The plan also identifies standards for the
dedication of land or payment of fees for park and recreational purposes. The City’s vision for
Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation is to utilize Smart Growth principles to integrate
neighborhoods with local resources and create connections within the City that encourage the enjoyment
of the City’s natural and manmade resources, particularly along Compton Creek.
4.3.2 CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE, AND PARKS AND RECREATION GOALS
AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Element were developed in
response to issues identified in the technical background report and on issues and opportunities identified
in community workshops that were conducted as part of a comprehensive outreach program.
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUE – WATER CONSERVATION
Water is a scarce commodity in Compton despite the presence of Compton Creek and the Los Angeles
River. The majority of the water supply needed to support the needs of residents and businesses is
imported. New development must not be allowed to deplete supplies, nor endanger the quality of
Compton’s water. Future development opportunities in the City will primarily be related to commercial
and industrial redevelopment and increasing density in residential neighborhoods where allowed.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Goal 1. Conserve and protect water resources.
      Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 1.1. The City of Compton will protect
          groundwater resources from depletion and contamination.
      Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 1.2. The City of Compton will conserve water by
          educating residents and businesses about water conservation techniques.
      Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 1.3. The City of Compton will promote and
          utilize drought-resistant landscaping where feasible.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUE –COMPTON CREEK
Open Space is limited in Compton by the development patterns of the previous century. The Compton
Creek is one of the few undeveloped areas, yet most of it is lined with concrete. Before settlement, it was a
riparian habitat, home to a diversity of plant life, birds, insects, and fish. One section of the Creek retains
some of its original character with its earthen-bottom. This portion lies adjacent to the 91 freeway and the
new Gateway Towne Center development on Alameda Street.
    Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Goal 2. Preserve and rehabilitate the Compton
    Creek Open Space corridor.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 2.1. The City of Compton will support the
        efforts of the Los Angeles River and San Gabriel Rivers Watershed Council in the goals and
        objectives of the Compton Creek Watershed Management Plan.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 2.2. The City of Compton will support efforts to
        seek private, state, and federal funding for the restoration of the habitat along the earthen-
        bottomed portion of Compton Creek.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 2.3. The City of Compton will implement the
        Compton Creek Regional Garden Park Master Plan.
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUE – PARKS AND RECREATION FACILITIES
Compton is a densely developed urban city and has been for many years. As the population density
increases the demand for recreational space also increases. The City has determined that there are six
important issues relating to community recreation planning which must be addressed through the goals,
objectives, and implementation plan related to Parks and Recreation Facilities:
     A Parks, Recreation, and Special Services Master Plan, which will require a                   through a
        comprehensive planning process;
     A need for additional recreation facilities in the City;
     A need for enhanced safety and maintenance of City’s parks;
     A need for a variety of recreation and educational facilities for the development of the community’s
        youth (the new 30,000 square foot Douglas F. Dollarhide community center will provide
        additional senior services;
     A need to address the recreation and social needs of the community’s emotionally and physically
        challenged resident (increased special needs programming for school-aged children established
        the Compton Council on Disabilities).
 With few vacant parcels of land in the City, increasing public park space is costly. Opportunities exist for
joint-use agreements with schools, pocket parks, bicycle lanes, and linkages to the Compton Creek and Los
Angeles River walking and biking paths. Innovative options include rooftop recreational facilities such as
putting greens or batting cages. The Compton collaborative was established between the City of Compton,
Compton Unified School District, and Compton Educational Center of ____.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Utilizing the implementation of the 2014-2015 Parks Master Plan means that continual maintenance is
required to maximize use and enjoyment. Other factors affecting the use of the existing parks include the
programming of facilities and activities in partnership with community partners.
    Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Goal 3. Provide well-maintained open space,
    park, and recreational facilities that meet the needs of residents.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 3.1. The City of Compton will provide active
         and passive parks and recreational facilities to serve the needs of residents of all ages, economic
         levels, and physical conditions.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 3.2. The City of Compton will maintain existing
         park and recreation facilities in such a manner so as to protect the public's investment and
         facilitate their use.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 3.3. The City of Compton will require new
         larger residential developments to provide sufficient recreational space (including pedestrian and
         bicycle linkages) to meet the local need.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 3.4. The City of Compton will work with
         Southern California Edison to maintain the utility right-of-way along Greenleaf as open space.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 3.5. The City of Compton will assist private
         owners to install recreational amenities on tops of building roofs.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 3.6. The City will prepare and adopt a Parks
         Master Plan describing a hierarchy of parks, facilities, needs of the residents, and methods to
         increase the parkland acreage within the City.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 3.7. The City of Compton will initiate the
         preparation of a Park’s Master Plan to identify the existing and projected needs of the community.
     Conservation, Open Space, and Recreation Policy 3.8. The City of Compton will strive to meet the
         parkland standards identified in the Conservation, Open Space, and Parks and Recreation
         Element.
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUE – MAINTENANCE AND PRESERVATION OF CULTURAL
AND NATURAL RESOURCES
The City has a rich and varied history that predates its incorporation by many decades. These historic
resources underscore the area’s contribution to the development of Southern California. The City has also
determined that there is an important issue relating to community recreation planning which must be
addressed through the goals, objectives, and implementation plan related to Cultural and Natural
Resources. The following policies will ensure that the City’s contribution to the region’s history will be
preserved for future generations and culturally stimulating activities are developed in the community.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Conservation, Open Space,and Recreation Goal 4. The City of Compton will initiate a cultural
     arts and facilities program to create a City image.
      Conservation, Open Space,and Recreation Policy 4.1. The City of Compton will continue with the
         development of the community art program.
      Conservation, Open Space,and Recreation Policy 4.2. The City of Compton will identify and
         preserve those sites/buildings that are important to the community for the benefit of the future
         generations that will reside or work in the City.
4.3.3 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STANDARDS
The Resource Management Plan for the City of Compton calls
for maximum protection of the local environment and available
resources.      The plan's major components address the
conservation of the remaining resources and the provision of
parks and recreation facilities for City residents. The plan
consists of programs for preservation of significant resources
and standards for development in areas with identified
resources. The plan also addresses parks, recreation facilities,
and open space.
According to the standards of the National Recreation and Park
Association (NRPA), there should be one tot lot/mini park of
2,500 square feet to one-acre in size for every 500 to 2,500
persons. The application of this standard means that the City should have a minimum of 11 tot lot/mini
parks; however, this standard is impractical due to the lack of suitable sites, along with land, development,
and maintenance costs. The development of two or three facilities of this kind may be an achievable
objective in the years ahead. Exhibit 4-5 illustrates the service areas of the existing parks. Future
investments will target those areas outside current service areas such as the area northwest of Rosecrans
Avenue and Central Avenue and along Greenleaf Boulevard east of Central Avenue. The City’s parks are in
the process of being renovated through Community Development and Block Grant (CDBG) and park grant
funds. New tot lot equipment for these parks will be designed to meet the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) standards. [*5 other sources]
According to most conventional park and open space standards, between 2.5-acres and 5.0 acres of park
land for every 1,000 persons is considered to be optimal. Assuming a standard of 2.5-acres of open space
land per 1,000 persons, the City would need to provide more than 250-acres of open space to meet this
standard. However, this standard will be difficult to achieve given the City’s urbanized character. As a
result, this standard’s application to the City is not feasible.
The Planning Commission may, as a condition precedent to the approval of a residential subdivision map,
require the dedication of land, or fees in lieu thereof, for park or recreational purposes. The size, shape,
and location of the land to be dedicated shall be approved by the Planning Commission as to the suitability
of the land for park and recreational purposes.

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The amount of the land dedicated shall be a proportion of the total land contained in the subdivision which
will be determined by the application of the following standards:
      5 dwelling units per acre or less - (2% of the total gross land area reserved for open space)
      6 through 9 dwelling units per acre - (3.5% of the total gross land area reserved for open space)
      10 through 14 dwelling units per acre - (5.3% of the total gross land area reserved for open space)
      15 through 20 dwelling units per acre - (7.4% of the total gross land area reserved for open space)
      21 through 27 dwelling units per acre - (9.7% of the total gross land area reserved for open space);
         and,
      28 or more dwelling units per acre - (12.3% of the total gross land area reserved for open space).
In subdivisions containing fifty (50) lots or less, only the payment of fees may be required. Land dedicated
for park and recreational facilities may be used for another purpose, provided that, the City Council
commits an amount equal to the required in lieu of fee for park and recreational facilities in order to meet
the expanded needs due to the subdivision development.
4.3.4 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS
There are a number of programs that will be effective in implementing City policy relative to conservation,
open space, and parks and recreation. They are summarized below.
      Water Conservation Ordinance. The City will continue to implement its water conservation
         ordinance. In addition, the City will review the ordinance to ensure that it promotes the use of
         xeriscape (drought-tolerant) landscaping, water-conserving materials, and devices that reflect
         current technology. Finally, the City shall review, and as appropriate, develop water conservation
         programs for public facilities (civic center, parks, maintenance yards, etc.).
      Park Development & Renovation Program. The City will continue to evaluate strategies to
         renovate and protect existing public open space from encroachment or conversion to other uses.
         Potential improvements will be programmed into the City’s Capital Improvements Program (CIP).
         This program will also evaluate the feasibility of new park development in the City. This program
         also would be of value to the City's transit-dependent population.
      Parks Gift Catalogues Program. The City will assess the feasibility of preparing and distributing a
         gift catalogue for specific items that will be used for the community's benefit. The catalogue will
         identify improvements that may be purchased for use in City parks. The first step will require City
         Council authorization to determine how this program will be implemented. The Council will then
         consider the staff’s findings and will provide direction to the City’s Parks and Recreation
         Department regarding how to proceed.
      Park Watch/Adopt a Park. The City will consider the feasibility of implementing an “adopt-a-
         park” program along with a "park watch" program. Individual neighborhoods will be encouraged
         to become more involved with the operation, maintenance, and safety of their parks through an
SECTION 4 – CONSERVATION, OPEN SPACE, AND PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT                               PAGE 104

CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
       expanded neighborhood watch program.             The first step of implementation will involve
       coordination with the Sheriff’s Department to expand the scope of the neighborhood watch
       program to include the monitoring of local parks. The City will then establish a program by which
       individuals, organizations, and businesses can “adopt” a local city park. Qualifications for “park
       adoption” will be identified by the City Parks and Recreation Department.
    Cultural Awareness. A cornerstone of this program will be the continued use of the Heritage
       House as a depository for the storage and collection of artifacts, photographs, books, and displays.
       The City will cooperate with local organizations (such as the local historical society, Chamber of
       Commerce, etc.) and individuals to acquire resource materials concerning local history and
       culture. These materials include books, photographs, artifacts, furniture, etc., that may be
       displayed in the future. The City will continue to support cultural resource conservation and
       preservation efforts in Compton.
    Cultural Resource Management.              Should archaeological or paleontological resources be
       encountered during excavation and grading activities, all work would cease until appropriate
       salvage measures are established. Appendix K of the California Environmental Quality Act
       (CEQA) Guidelines shall be followed for excavation monitoring and salvage work that may be
       necessary.
    Historic Building Code. The City will investigate the feasibility of adopting alternate building code
       standards for historic structures, as authorized by the State Historical Building Code. The initial
       step will require City staff to amend the development code to include provisions for the
       maintenance, rehabilitation, and preservation of historic structures.

                  SECTION 5.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
5.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
The Public Safety Element of the Compton General Plan is one of seven State-mandated Elements and is
intended to identify natural and manmade hazards and ways to reduce the risk of property damage, injury or
loss of life associated with living in an urban environment. The public’s health and safety is an important
component of the Compton General Plan due to the City’s location in a seismically active region. The
Element’s scope includes emergency preparedness and response for potential flooding, fire, hazardous
materials and other public safety threats.
The Public Safety Element establishes City policies relative to the reduction and mitigation of natural and
manmade hazards that must be considered in future planning and decision-making. State law requires every
Public Safety Element to consider the following:
     The identification, mapping, and appraisal of seismic hazards that should be of concern to planning
         and future development, including areas subject to liquefaction, ground-shaking, surface rupture or
         seismic sea waves (Government Code Section 65302(f));
     An appraisal of mudslides, landslides, and slope stability that might occur as a result of seismic
         disturbance (Government Code Section 65302(f)); and,
     The identification of the potential for fires and other natural and manmade disasters and measures
         designed to reduce the loss of life, injury, and damage to property (Government Code Section
         65302(i)).
The Element contains a plan that identifies evacuation routes and the location of emergency shelters. It also
emphasizes the importance of emergency preparation in reducing the impacts of natural and manmade
disasters. Effective disaster response requires the cooperation of many governmental agencies.
5.1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
The Public Safety Element consists of the following sections:
     The Introduction to the Element provides an overview of the Element’s scope and content.
     The Public Safety Element Background Report discusses a wide range of natural and manmade
         hazards that must be considered with regards to future planning and development in the City.
     The Public Safety Plan identifies the City’s policies related to public safety and emergency
         preparedness, along with those programs that will be effective in implementing the policies. This
         section also establishes Public Safety Standards for each issue area.
SECTION 5 – PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                  PAGE 109

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
            5.2 PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT BACKGROUND REPORT
The Public Safety Element Background Report provides a detailed overview of the existing conditions in
Compton with respect to safety hazards. This background information is the basis for the Public Safety
Element of the City of Compton General Plan.
5.2.1 SEISMIC AND GEOLOGIC HAZARDS
The known seismic and geologic hazards for the Los Angeles Basin
are shown in Exhibit 5-1. Compton is marked on the map with a
red star between Dominguez Hills and Baldwin Hills in the center
left portion of the map. The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault
Zoning Act restricts development on active fault zones and requires
the State Geologist to identify active faults and determine what if
any construction is allowed in these zones.
The Newport – Inglewood Fault Zone is the only active fault zone
that lies within the City of Compton. The fault zone is 75
kilometers in length and runs through the southwest corner of
Compton. The fault runs northwest to southeast between Central
Avenue and Avalon Boulevard crossing Rosecrans Avenue,
Compton Boulevard, Alondra Boulevard, Walnut Street, and
Artesia Boulevard. It extends through other surrounding cities such as Inglewood, Gardena, Long Beach, and
Culver City.
Because the Newport – Inglewood Fault extends through Compton, in the event of an earthquake, the City will
be subject to surface rupture or ground breakage along the surface of the fault. The most recent major rupture
in this fault zone was the Long Beach earthquake in 1933, which had a magnitude of 6.4. However, no surface
ruptures occurred in that earthquake.
The City of Compton is at moderate risk for serious damage from an earthquake. The Newport-Inglewood
Fault is estimated to have probable magnitudes between 6.0 and 7.4. In addition, a major earthquake on any
of the faults in the Los Angeles Basin could cause significant damage to the City of Compton. These faults
include the San Andreas, San Fernando, San Jacinto, Sierra Madre, and Whittier-Elsinore Faults. Recent
significant earthquakes in the Los Angeles Basin include the San Fernando (1971), Whittier (1987), and
Northridge (1994) Earthquakes. Between 1769 and 1999, there were 33 earthquakes in Southern California
with a magnitude of 5.0 and above.
The faults in the Los Angeles Basin are very active and have the potential to do massive destruction if the City
is unprepared. After 1993, building codes were changed to ensure that new construction would be safer in the
event of an earthquake. The older buildings in the City have a higher risk of being damaged in an earthquake
since they were built prior to the new codes. A number of buildings on Rosecrans Avenue, Long Beach
Boulevard, Compton Boulevard, and Alameda Street need to undergo the requisite seismic retrofit.
SECTION 5 – PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                    PAGE 110

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
5.2.2 SEISMICALLY INDUCED GROUND FAILURE
The seismically induced ground failure risk in Compton is liquefaction. Liquefaction occurs when areas that
have loose, fine-grained, sandy soils are disturbed by high-intensity ground shaking, which allows the shallow
groundwater to rise to the surface and mix with the soil. When this happens, structures often sink or become
severely damaged as the land they are built on becomes soft and unstable. Liquefaction hazards are often
found in areas where ground water depth is 40 feet or less. Water levels during an earthquake are not easily
anticipated because of the unpredictable fluctuations caused by natural processes and human activities,
historical levels can be used as an indicator. , thus, historical high ground water from twenty feet west of the
Compton Creek to eight feet near Compton College north to the boundaries of the City.
Compton’s soil is part of alluvial fan deposits in the region which
form when a fast flowing stream flattens, slows, and spreads out.
These deposits consist largely of sand, silt, and gravel, and to a
lesser extent, clay. Because historical ground-water levels are
within 40 feet of the surface where there is the presence of loose,
sandy soils, these deposits are judged susceptible to liquefaction.
Exhibit 5-1 identifies the area considered at risk for liquefaction
conditions are used to evaluate the risk for liquefaction. Historical
high ground water in the City of Compton ranges.
5.2.3 SEISMICALLY INDUCED DAM FAILURE
The Whittier Narrows Dam is 11 miles upstream from Compton. A
dam failure would result in flood waters reaching Compton in
approximately 15 hours with a depth of four feet. Dominguez High School and the adjacent golf course east of
the 710 Freeway have the potential to be flooded if the Whittier Narrows Dam has a dam failure.
The Hansen Dam is 30 miles upstream from Compton. If this dam fails, the water would reach Compton
within twenty hours with a depth of one foot. The northern portion of Compton would flood first and then it
would continue to spread throughout the entire City. School, industrial, commercial, and residential areas
would all be affected by a flood caused by a failure of the Hansen Dam. The Sepulveda Dam is 29 miles
upstream from the City. If this dam has a failure, the flooding would reach Compton within eleven hours with
a one foot depth. School, industrial, commercial, and residential areas would be affected by a Sepulveda Dam
failure. Exhibit 5-1 identifies the area of the City which would be affected by flood waters due to a dam failure
noted as the Dam Inundation Zone.
5.2.4 LAND SUBSIDENCE, LIQUEFACTION, AND OTHER SEISMIC HAZARDS
Los Angeles land subsidence has been caused by clay soil compaction due to extraction. The Long Beach
harbor is the primary area affected by subsidence; however, areas throughout the Los Angeles Basin used for
oil extraction have had various degrees of land subsidence. Compton’s soil is low in clay content reducing the
subsidence caused by clay soil compaction. A landslide can also be one of the hazards left behind by an
earthquake. According to the City of Compton’s Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan, there is a potential for slope
failure along the southern banks of the Compton Creek near Artesia Boulevard.

5.2.5 FLOOD HAZARDS AND FLOOD CONTROL
The Los Angeles River drops 800 feet to the ocean over its fifty mile course, nearly sixteen feet per mile.
This steep decent increases the speed of the water and its danger to citizens. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) identifies where property owners are required to carry flood insurance to
mitigate the impact of known flood hazards.
Flood insurance was required for the 100-year flood plan of the southern end of the Los Angeles River until
2002 when the US Army Corp of Engineers completed the Los Angeles River Drainage Area (LACDA) flood
control project. The purpose was to strengthen and raise the banks of the Los Angeles River and its
tributaries against the possibility of a "100-year flood" which once threatened to devastate an 82 square
mile area from Pico Rivera to Long Beach, including Compton. As a result, Compton homeowners within
the Los Angeles River’s 100-year flood plan are no longer mandated by FEMA to purchase flood insurance.
The location of the previously mandated Flood Insurance Zone is noted in Exhibit 5-1.
Compton lies in the floodplain of the Los Angeles River and Compton Creek. Between 1811 and 1994, there
were 30 floods along the Los Angeles River. A 100-year flood is a flood that has a 1% chance of occurring
every year. Most of the area in the City east of Wilmington Avenue was subject to potential inundation by a
100-year flood from the Los Angeles River, which flows from north to south just inside the eastern border.
However, due to the efforts of the US Army Corps of Engineers, this threat no longer exists. Much of
Compton Creek, a tributary of the Los Angeles River, runs through the City and is a potential source of
flooding; although the amount of water running through the creek limits the threat to a much smaller area
and a much smaller incidence of occurrence. The threat of flooding is increased by the “high concentration
of impermeable surfaces that either collect water or concentrate the flow of water in unnatural channels”.
As a result, localized flooding may occur when storm drains become congested and water collects in the
street.
Flood Control and Flood Management in the City of Compton is a combined effort between the US Army
Corp of Engineers, the California Department of Water Resources Division of Flood Management, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and local infrastructure. The infrastructure for flood control of
the Los Angeles River system includes five major flood control reservoirs operated and maintained by the
US Army Corp of Engineers and fifteen dams, 143 sediment entrapment basins and 29 spreading grounds
operated and maintained by the Los Angeles Department of Public Works (LADPW). The LADPW also
maintains 470 miles of open flood control channels, 2,400 miles of underground storm drains and 70,000
street drains. The open flood channels range in size from 2 to 600 feet in width and from 2 to 40 feet in
depth.
5.2.6 FIRE HAZARDS AND PROTECTION
The City of Compton is an urban environment with little danger of wildfires. There are only three
properties in the City that have over twenty acres of grass that can burn, leaving the City a low risk for any
wildfires beyond a minor brush fire. There are nine high-occupancy facilities in addition to the schools in
the City that have the potential to be urban fire hazards. These facilities are the Courthouse, City Hall, the
Crystal Park Hotel, the Compton Fashion Center, the Gateway Towne Center, and four senior-citizen
housing complexes.
SECTION 5 – PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                       PAGE 113

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
                                            The Compton Fire Department has four stations serving the
                                            City. The City’s fire services include ten front-line vehicles:
                                            four front-line engines, one ladder truck, one air/light unit,
                                            two paramedic ambulances and two basic life support
                                            transport units. The Fire Department responds to an average
                                            of 9,900 emergency calls per year. Over 3,000 emergency calls
                                            involve medical emergencies, hazardous materials, explosions,
                                            trapped victims, and a variety of residential, commercial, and
                                            other fires. In addition to routine emergencies, the fire
                                            department helps develop and implement response plans for
                                            potential disasters and other emergencies. The department’s
                                            non-emergency services include a reserve firefighter program,
                                            a fire fighter training program in association with El Camino
                                            College Compton Center and the Fire Explorers Program.
5.2.7 LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES
The City of Compton provides security and law enforcement services through its Code Enforcement and
Park Security Divisions and through a contract with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Compton’s Security Services oversees City security, parking enforcement, and code enforcement. Officers
patrol City parks, shopping centers and assist the Compton Sheriff's Department with crowd control. The
Code Enforcement Division is responsible for aggressively enforcing the City's codes and ordinances and
pursuing the elimination of slum and blight conditions in the residential, commercial, and industrial areas
of the City. The department is also responsible for ensuring citizen compliance with codes affecting
zoning, property maintenance, and vehicle violations.
The Compton Station of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department is located at 310 S. Willowbrook Avenue and has a
dedicated staff of 200. Eighty-nine sworn officers patrol an area
of ten square miles. Six service area officers and one sergeant
are dedicated to addressing quality of life issues. Compton
Sheriff's Department is comprised of many different
departments, namely: a Traffic Department, Narcotics Unit,
Two Gang Units (Operation Safe Streets and Gang Enforcement
Team), and an Aerial Bureau. The location of the Sheriff Station
is shown in Exhibit 5-2. Other services provided by the Sheriff’s
department include: DUI Checkpoints, a Directed Traffic Patrol,
Traffic Safety Fairs, a Youth Referral Program, a Youth Athletic
League, and an Explorer Program.
5.2.8 EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT
The existing peak load water supply and road widths and turnarounds are adequate to satisfy the needs of
the fire department to respond to known fire and geologic risks. There are plans to make some
improvements to the water supply system in the southern and eastern sections of the City to increase peak
water supply. The grid system of streets provides alternate routes in the event of street blockage, and the
City’s permit process ensures that new construction must provide turnarounds large enough for fire trucks.

5.2.9 TERRORISM HAZARDS
The density and metropolitan nature of Southern California make it a significant target for terrorism. LAX
and the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have all been subjected to numerous threats. The
Department of Homeland Security has allotted significant resources to the Southern California region.
Some possible terrorist targets may include the Los Angeles Superior Court, the Compton City Hall,
Alameda Corridor, Ralph’s warehouse, the Gateway Towne Center, water supply systems, fire department,
and the Sheriff’s department.
                                5.3 PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN
5.3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN
The Public Safety Plan identifies the City’s goals for 2010 through 2030 related to public safety and
emergency preparedness and sets the policies and programs for achieving them. The plan also establishes
Public Safety Standards for each issue area. The City’s vision for Public Safety is to utilize Smart Growth
principles to foster a greater sense of community with pedestrian-friendly residential and commercial
districts that employ crime prevention through environmental design.
5.3.2 PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Public Safety Element were developed in response to hazards identified in the
technical background report and on issues and opportunities identified in the community workshops that
were conducted as part of a comprehensive outreach program. The goals and policies listed below address
the City’s risk reduction and emergency response strategies.
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE - SEISMIC HAZARDS
Seismic activity is a regular occurrence in California, and Compton contains an Alquist-Priolo Zone around
the Newport-Inglewood Fault west of Compton Creek which requires special planning and development.
The following policies guide the City in planning for seismic hazards through emergency response
strategies and quality construction.
    Public Safety Goal 1. Provide vital services and functions following a major earthquake.
     Public Safety Policy 1.1. The City of Compton will comply with all regulations and standards for
         the seismic performance of new buildings.
     Public Safety Policy 1.2. The City of Compton will continue to implement the City’s seismic hazard
         abatement program for existing un- reinforced buildings and ensure that retrofit plans are carried
         out.
     Public Safety Policy 1.3. The City of Compton will consider the cultural and historic significance of
         buildings to be upgraded for seismic safety and avoid, if possible, the demolition or alteration of a
         building’s historic character in retrofitting buildings for seismic safety.
     Public Safety Policy 1.4. In the Alquist-Priolo Zone, the City of Compton will require geologic
         review in the development approval process to determine surface rupture potential and regulate
         development as appropriate.
SECTION 5 – PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                      PAGE 116

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Public Safety Policy 1.5. In areas with liquefaction potential, the City of Compton will require the
         review of soils and geologic conditions, and if needed, on-site borings, to determine liquefaction
         susceptibility of the proposed site.
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE - FLOODING
Although most flooding incidents are historically rare, shallow flooding is possible over the eastern half of
the City. Flooding from the Los Angeles River is less of a hazard in Compton since the banks were raised.
However, a dam breach could result in the release of waters that would cause damage to adjacent
properties. The following policies guide the City in reducing flood hazards.
    Public Safety Goal 2. Protect residents, workers, and visitors from flood hazards.
     Public Safety Policy 2.1. The City of Compton will work with the Los Angeles County Department
         of Public Works to identify and construct needed local and regional storm drain improvements to
         prevent flooding problems in Compton.
     Public Safety Policy 2.2. The City of Compton will require local drainage-related improvements as
         part of new development approvals.
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE - URBAN FIRES
The City of Compton maintains its own Fire Department for fire protection. Certain structures in
Compton, due to their age and composition, pose a greater challenge for fire protection, such as multi-
story, wood frame, high density apartments, multi-story office buildings, continuous developed areas with
combustible roofing materials, and structures involved in the storing, handing, and use of hazardous
materials. The following policies guide the City in reducing the risk of fire to life and property.
    Public Safety Goal 3. Protect life and property in Compton from urban fires with efficient fire
    protection services.
     Public Safety Policy 3.1. The City of Compton will maintain an ongoing fire inspection program to
         reduce fire hazards associated with older buildings, critical facilities, public assembly facilities,
         industrial buildings, and commercial buildings.
     Public Safety Policy 3.2. The City of Compton will maintain building code requirements for new
         construction that ensures the provision of adequate fire protection.
     Public Safety Policy 3.3. The City of Compton will require all new commercial and multiple-unit
         residential development to install fire protection systems.
     Public Safety Policy 3.4. The City of Compton will maintain mutual aid agreements with
         surrounding jurisdictions for fire protection.
     Public Safety Policy 3.5. The City of Compton will assess the impacts of incremental increases in
         development density and traffic congestion on fire hazards and emergency response time, and
         ensure, through the design review process, that new development will not result in the reduction of
         emergency services.
SECTION 5 – PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                     PAGE 117

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030

      Public Safety Policy 4.4. The City of Compton will support the coordination of crime prevention
         activities with other jurisdictions.
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE - EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
The City of Compton maintains an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) that documents City policies for
responding to major emergencies that threaten life, safety, and property. The plan establishes a chain of
command and outlines the responsibilities of various City departments in the event of an emergency. The
following Policies guide the City in being prepared for emergencies.
     Public Safety Goal 5. Protect residents, visitors, and workers in an emergency and provide
     continuity of vital services and functions.
      Public Safety Policy 5.1. The City of Compton will maintain and regularly update the City’s
         Emergency Operations Plan and procedures for dealing with fire, earthquakes, flooding, hazardous
         materials, and terrorism.
      Public Safety Policy 5.2. The City of Compton will implement a Multi-Year Training and Exercise
         Plan and conduct routine exercises with City staff, residents, business owners, and other Compton
         stakeholders to be prepared in emergency situations.
      Public Safety Policy 5.3. The City of Compton will sponsor and support bilingual public education
         programs on emergency preparedness and disaster response.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
         design review process, that new development will not result in reduced emergency services below
         acceptable levels.
      Public Safety Policy 5.6 The City of Compton Office of Emergency Management will research and
         develop an Access and Functional Needs Plan which will address the sheltering and evacuation
         needs of elderly, homebound, and other special needs populations in the City which are
         particularly vulnerable to disasters and other emergencies.
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE - HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Many of the industrial businesses in Compton rely on the use of hazardous materials to conduct their
business. Hazardous materials are transported through the City on freight trains and trucks. If not
handled properly, these substances pose a threat to the health of residents and employees working in
Compton. The following policies guide the City in reducing risks associated with hazardous materials.
     Public Safety Goal 6. Minimize risks to health and safety associated with handling, transporting,
     treating, generating, and storing hazardous materials.
      Public Safety Policy 6.1. The City of Compton will require businesses to disclose hazardous
         material use and generation to the Compton Fire Department.
      Public Safety Policy 6.2. The City of Compton will encourage and support the proper disposal of
         hazardous materials.
      Public Safety Policy 6.3. The City of Compton will vigorously prosecute unlicensed dumping of
         toxic or hazardous materials into the ground or water or released as fumes into the air.
      Public Safety Policy 6.4. The City of Compton will support efforts to enforce the State’s “right to
         know” laws, which outline the public’s right to information about local toxic producers.
PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE - UNDERGROUND PIPELINES
Compton is crisscrossed by numerous high pressure natural gas and petroleum pipelines. Although these
pipelines are generally well-constructed and maintained, construction and evacuation in the vicinity of
these lines creates a potential hazard if the lines are ruptured. Hazards include explosion, fire, or spillage,
resulting in earth and groundwater contamination.
The Office of Pipeline Safety of the U.S. Department of Transportation is the primary agency responsible
for the inspection and maintenance of pipelines running through the City. Compton has no regulatory
authority over the pipelines, but it does control land use within the area most affected by them. The
following policies guide the City in reducing risks from underground pipeline hazards.
     Public Safety Goal 7. Minimize risks to life and property from underground pipeline hazards.
      Public Safety Policy 7.1. The City of Compton will ensure that the Fire Department and other
         disaster response agencies have access to route, depth, and shut-off information regarding each
         underground pipeline.
      Public Safety Policy 7.2. The City of Compton will maintain procedures to deal with pipeline
         accidents in the City’s Emergency Plan.
SECTION 5 – PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                       PAGE 119

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Public Safety Policy 7.3. The City of Compton will avoid locating new residential development or
        other sensitive land uses in close proximity to major pipelines with a significant potential for
        explosion or fire.
5.3.3 PUBLIC SAFETY STANDARDS
Actions resulting from the goals and policies are necessary to reduce hazards within Compton. Each
hazard issue is addressed in this section with the corresponding City actions.
SEISMIC HAZARDS
The City will continue to implement the hazard abatement program to correct deficiencies in un-reinforced
structures. The City will also require geologic studies for development in the Newport-Inglewood Alquist-
Priolo Zone to establish appropriate setbacks and other building restrictions.
FLOODING
The City will continue to work with the Los Angeles County Flood Control District in protecting the City
from potential flooding. Areas identified with storm drainage inadequacies will be provided with needed
drainage facilities. The City will encourage and cooperate with studies to return Compton Creek and the
Los Angeles River to their natural habitats where feasible for recreation purposes while providing for
adequate flood control along both channels.
URBAN FIRES
The City of Compton's Fire Department currently provides a high level of service. The City will continue to
coordinate with the Fire Department by requiring the following standards for access and water pressure.
Width of access lanes or routes shall be:
     Twenty feet for driveways or streets serving two to four dwelling units;
     Twenty-six feet for driveways or streets serving more than four dwelling units, commercial
        development, or industrial development;
     Twenty-eight feet for driveways or streets serving development which would require the Fire
        Department to employ aerial equipment; and,
     Twenty-six feet for a linear distance of twenty-five feet on both sides of a fire hydrant for driveways
        or streets where hydrants are required.
Dimensions of turnarounds shall be:
     Suitable for fire protection equipment where driveways or streets extend further than 150 feet and
        are of single-access design;
     Approximately 200 feet for single-access driveways or streets extending further than 350 feet and
        dual-access driveways or streets extending further than 700 feet;
     At least 40 feet for cul-de-sacs; and,
     At least 60 feet for "T-turns" and "hammer heads"
SECTION 5 – PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                      PAGE 120

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Parking is allowed on two sides of a street or driveway which is at least 36 feet wide, but no parking is
allowed on driveways which are used for emergency access and are less than 28 feet wide.
Fire flow requirements shall be:
      For residential projects, 1,250 gallons per minute at 20 pounds per square inch residual pressure
         for two-hour duration and up to 3,000 gallons per minute at 20 pounds per-square-inch for a
         three-hour duration.
      For commercial and industrial projects, 5,000 gallons per minute at twenty pounds per-square-
         inch for a five-hour duration.
The City will act to ensure that inadequate water systems are retrofitted.
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
The City will continue to maintain an adequate Emergency
Operations Plan. Revisions will be made whenever federal, state, or
local legislation mandates. The City will also prepare and distribute
educational pamphlets and materials to educate the general public
of proper emergency preparedness procedures. The Emergency
Operations Plan (EOP) was last updated in 2013. The EOP is
intended to minimize the loss of life and property, assist in
responding to needs of households affected by disaster, and to
provide for the rapid recovery of City services, utilities, schools,
commerce, and industry. In the event of a disaster, the EOP will be
the guidebook which City officials will use to restore normal
conditions as quickly as possible.
The EOP sets forth assignments to be carried out by City Departments in a time of emergency. In addition
to their normal law enforcement assignment, the Municipal Law Enforcement Department has the primary
responsibility of warning the population and conducting emergency communications. The Fire
Department, beyond its fire prevention and communications roles, is responsible for rescue operations.
The Parks and Recreation Department is assigned the task of establishing shelters. They are in the process
of establishing a Memorandum of Understanding with the American Red Cross so that their services will
be available. Both emergency shelters and mass care centers will be needed. The mass care centers would
be supported by paramedic units from the Fire Department. Mass care centers will be located at local
parks and, if necessary, schools. If the disaster is epidemic or threatens to spread by contaminated air or
water, the Los Angeles County Public Health Department becomes the primary agency in dealing with this
aspect of the emergency.
State guidelines require that the General Plan designate evacuation routes for the City. Definition of
evacuation routes is dependent on the nature and extent of the disaster. Primary evacuation routes are
shown on Exhibit 5-3. Not all routes are likely to be open or passable in the event of a major catastrophe.
Residents and workers should proceed as directed by public officials.

5.3.4 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The Compton Fire Department is responsible for programs to
protect residents and properties from accidents involving
hazardous materials. Such programs include documenting all
storage and usage of hazardous materials.              Educational
programs assist City residents in handling and storing such
materials properly. Those businesses and residents violating
laws involving hazardous materials will be prosecuted. To
reduce the scope of risk related to the transportation of
hazardous materials through the City, vehicles carrying such
materials are restricted to the travel routes designated in the Los
Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
Businesses using or producing hazardous materials shall be
concentrated in the areas designated Industrial on the General
Plan Land Use Policy Map. Through the environmental review process, the City will ensure such uses are
removed from proximity to residential development, schools, and other sensitive land uses.
The Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan establishes site criteria for hazardous waste
treatment, transfer, and disposal sites. The criteria outlined in the County plan will be used to review all
proposals for such treatment and disposal facilities in Compton.
UNDERGROUND PIPELINE HAZARDS
The City will continue to regulate land use in the vicinity of underground pipelines. Such regulation will
take into consideration the types of materials transported through these pipelines.
5.3.5 PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAM
The following programs will either be continued or implemented as part of this General Plan.
     Building Code Review. The City periodically reviews and, if necessary, modifies the City’s Building
         Code (Los Angeles County) to reflect current technology and regulations. Procedures for the
         periodic review of the Building Code will be identified by the Planning and Economic Development
         Director. Review will be undertaken by designated individuals to identify appropriate changes that
         should be considered. Following this review, amendments to the City’s Building Code will be
         made, as required.
     Code Enforcement. Because unsafe structures with poor or obsolete wiring or construction
         materials pose the risk of significant damage, injury, and loss of life from fire, code enforcement is
         an important tool in preventing fires.
     Disaster Response Database. In the event of a major earthquake or other major disaster, persons
         living or working in the City may need to be self-sufficient for up to 5-7 days before the results of
         any major relief efforts are realized. A database will be created to identify medical professionals,
         heavy equipment operators, and volunteers trained in first aid and search-and-rescue. The
         database would identify other volunteers that would staff emergency collection centers,
SECTION 5 – PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                       PAGE 123

 CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
       distribution centers, and otherwise assist in the recovery efforts. This information, and the
       appropriate procedures, would then be incorporated into the City’s emergency preparedness plan.
    Fire Prevention. The City will work with the Fire Department to promote fire prevention and fire
       safety programs. The City shall also encourage periodic inspections of existing structures by the
       fire department for compliance with fire safety standards and practices. All new development
       plans must be submitted to the fire department for review and comment during the plan check
       process. This review must be completed for the development process to proceed. New
       development must conform to any applicable standards and regulations.
    Hazardous Materials Control. The City will continue to cooperate with county, state, and federal
       agencies involved in the regulation of hazardous materials’ storage, use, and disposal. The City
       will work with the fire department in requiring hazardous materials users and generators to
       identify safety procedures for responding to accidental spills and emergencies. The fire
       department will also work with local law enforcement officials in regulating the transport of
       hazardous materials through the City. The City will continue to promote the safe disposal of
       “hazardous and toxic substances” used in private households through the support of “Hazardous
       Materials Collections” conducted at specific locations and times throughout the City.
    Public Safety & Fire Services Review. Compton will regularly review the adequacy of law
       enforcement services and fire protection and emergency services in the City. This review effort
       shall be a component of the annual budget review, and the City shall work with the Sheriff’s
       department and the fire department to correct any identified deficiencies. Annual reports
       concerning each Department will be submitted to the City Council for consideration.
    Environmental Review. The City will evaluate the environmental impacts of new development
       and provide mitigation measures prior to development approval, as required by the California
       Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
       Environmental review will be provided for major projects and those that will have a potential
       adverse impact on the environment. Issue areas related to public safety that may be addressed in
       the environmental analysis include: earth and geology, risk of upset public services, and flood risk.
       In compliance with CEQA and NEPA, the City will also assign responsibilities for the verification of
       the implementation of mitigation measures. The City’s environmental review procedures are in
       place.
    Emergency Preparedness Plan. The City maintains an
       Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) that outlines the
       responsibilities and procedures the City will follow after
       a disaster, including specific emergency functions and
       operations, available resources (fire stations, emergency
       shelters, hospitals and clinics, resource persons, etc.),
       and mutual aid agreements. The City will regularly
       update its EOP according to federal and state legal rules
       and requirements.
SECTION 5 – PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT                                                                    PAGE 124

 CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
    Multi-Hazard Functional Plan. The City maintains a Multi-Hazard Functional Plan (MHFP). The
       MHFP outlines potential hazardous threats to the City (man-made, natural, or otherwise), what
       needs to be done to mitigate those threats, what has already been done, which departments are
       responsible for certain mitigation steps, the timeline for those steps, and the progress or status
       report of each project at the time the plan is updated. The City will regularly update its MHFP
       according to federal and state legal rules and requirements.
    Fire Safety Development Review Program. Certain design standards have been established by the
       City of Compton and the fire department to ensure that site planning and building design consider
       public safety and fire prevention. These standards include requirements governing emergency
       access, roadway widths, and location of fire hydrants, etc.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
                SECTION 6.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
6.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
The primary purpose of the Economic Development Element is to establish a broad planning and policy
framework that will facilitate ongoing revitalization of the City through business attraction, business
retention, marketing, and research of economic trends. Even though this Element is not required by the
State of California planning laws, once adopted, the Element will have the same standing as the other
mandatory elements.
The Economic Development Element addresses a range of issues germane to the economic well-being of
Compton, and it is linked to the Land Use Element that indicates the location and extent of commercial,
industrial, and other types of employment and revenue-generating land uses in the City. The Element
specifically examines programs for attracting new commercial and industrial development as well
retention strategies.
To put the size of Compton’s economy into perspective, its population size (over 93,000 persons),
employment base, and the amount of land devoted to commercial and industrial land uses would place it
among the larger cities in most other states. Compton is centrally located in Los Angeles County and if Los
Angeles County were a country it would have been the world’s 19th largest economy falling between the
economies of Poland and Indonesia using 2008 gross domestic production figures.
6.1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
The Economic Development Element consists of the following sections:
     The Introduction to the Element provides an overview of the Element’s scope and content.
     The Economic Development Element Background Report discusses a wide range of issues
         affecting the local economy and tax base that must be considered in future planning and
         development in the City.
     The Economic Development Plan identifies the City policies related to the local economy and tax
         base along with those programs that will be effective in implementing these policies.
             SECTION 6.2 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
                                  BACKGROUND REPORT
The Economic Development Element provides an overview of the existing economic characteristics and
conditions in the City. The background information included in this section serves as the foundation for
the development of economic development strategies and policies.
6.2.1 ECONOMIC SETTING
The City of Compton is uniquely positioned for business in almost the exact geographical center of Los
Angeles County. The “Hub City” is accessible by five freeways – Interstate highways 105, 110, 710, 405 and
State Highway 91. The Long Beach and Los Angeles ports are less than 20 minutes from downtown
SECTION 6 – ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT                                                            PAGE 129

   CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Compton, providing easy access to international destinations for customers, suppliers, and leisure
travelers. In addition, the Long Beach and Los Angeles airports are less than 20 minutes away. Compton’s
proximity to these transportation infrastructure assets provides it with key attributes attractive to
manufacturing and logistics/distribution businesses.
To help position the City and its assets, economic development is one of the City’s highest priorities.
Assistance programs are available to help generate business growth while addressing important
revitalization goals. Compton provides financial assistance for redevelopment projects and activities, as
well as business incentives through various programs.
6.2.2 BUSINESS CLIMATE
The recession that began in December 2007 bottom out in late
2009 and begin to recover in 2010. Compton is grouped in the
North Gateway region of Los Angeles County by the Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC). The
North Gateway region has the largest concentration of
manufacturing businesses and jobs in Los Angeles County
followed by professional business services and wholesale trade.
The region lost 19,000 factory jobs in 20085, due to the recession.
The forecast for manufacturing in the near term is continued
shrinkage, but international trade is expected to increase
modestly.6 The international trade and logistics industry cluster
in Compton may help provide jobs to residents in the coming
year, particularly if the tax incentives available in the City are
promoted and residents have the desired skills.
Compton’s residents are now able to shop closer to home at the new Gateway Towne Center, which
recently opened Phase 2, counter-balanced some of the retail leakage that was occurring in Compton.
[*this sentence doesn’t make sense] Many of the new establishments are expected to draw
consumers from neighboring cities and the nearby California State University, Dominguez Hills, which will
also contribute to the City’s tax base.
6.2.4 ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
Compton’s land use and development patterns are well established. Commercial land uses extend along
the major arterial roadways and industrial development is generally concentrated along the Artesia
Freeway (SR-91) corridor and along Alameda Street. Because of the City’s size and age, the City’s economic
base is diverse.
Until recently, virtually all of the commercial uses were located along the City’s major arterial corridors
such as Long Beach Boulevard, Compton Boulevard, Alondra Boulevard, Rosecrans Avenue, and Central
5 Kyser Center for Economic Research, Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, 2009-2010 Mid-Year Economic
Forecast and Industry Outlook, July 2009, pp 56-57.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Avenue. Commercial development in these areas is characterized by strip commercial development and
smaller neighborhood commercial centers. Attraction efforts by the City have begun having an impact.
The redevelopment of a long-vacant site on Alameda Street adjacent to the Artesia Blue Line Station has
brought a mega-shopping center that features major big box developments like Target, Home Depot, Best
Buy, Marshalls, Chipotle, Anna’s Linens commercial banks, and restaurants.
General commercial uses, which include a broad set of commercial retail and service-oriented
development, total approximately 120 acres of land within the City. The total land area devoted to
commercial uses within the Planning Area that includes both incorporated and unincorporated areas total
216 acres. The location and extent of commercial development in the City are shown in Exhibit 6-1.
The industrial land uses in the City are widespread, reflecting Compton’s long history engaged in
manufacturing, distribution, and warehousing. Older and generally more specialized manufacturing uses
are located along the Alameda Street corridor and in the northern-most portion of the City along the east
                                            side of Alameda Street and north of Rosecrans Avenue. These
                                            older industrial uses were originally located along the Alameda
                                            corridor to take advantage of the railroad. The railroad has
                                            since been placed below grade and is now exclusively used for
                                            goods movement from the port facilities to the rail yards
                                            located south and southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
                                            A second and much larger area of the City where industrial
                                            land uses are concentrated is located to the south of Greenleaf
                                            Street continuing south to the southern boundary of the City.
                                            This area is well served by the Artesia Freeway and has rail
                                            access. These business parks enjoy the advantage of the area’s
                                            proximity to the ports and the City’s central location in the
                                            Southern California market area. Approximately 954 acres of
                                            land within the City and the Planning Area are devoted to
business park, industrial, and manufacturing uses. The location and extent of existing industrial uses in
the City are noted in Exhibit 6-2.
                   SECTION 6.3 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN
6.3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN
The Economic Development Plan identifies the City’s goals from 2010 through 2030 related to the
business environment, unemployment, and revenue base, and sets policies and programs for achieving
them. The plan also identifies incentives available for attracting new businesses or growing existing ones.
The City’s vision for Economic Development is to utilize Smart Growth principles to establish pedestrian-
friendly commercial districts that thrive and provide services and jobs to residents, while supporting City
services through tax revenues.

6.3.2 ECONOMIC GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Economic Development Element were developed in response to needs
identified in the technical background report and on issues and opportunities identified in the community.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUE – BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
The business environment consists of political, economical, social, and technological factors. The City can
improve some aspects of the local business environment and provide technical assistance to businesses
impacted by others. The City can provide simple, easy-to-navigate permit and licensing processes.
Technical assistance can be offered to help businesses grow to the next level of production through

SECTION 6 – ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT                                                               PAGE 134

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUE – UNEMPLOYMENT
Compton has historically had a higher than average unemployment rate. Residents who want to work are
not finding jobs. Reasons for high unemployment range from education, job skills, access to appropriate
jobs, transportation, or child care challenges. Solutions range from job training targeting growth
industries to expanding job opportunities.
Economic Development Goal 2. Reduce the unemployment rate in Compton to reflect the national
average.
     Economic Development Policy 2.1. The City of Compton will support efforts to increase adult
         literacy, high school graduation, and college education rates among residents.
     Economic Development Policy 2.2. The City of Compton will promote the job training and
         professional education programs at workforce development centers and local institutions of higher
         education such as Careerlink, El Camino College - Compton Center, California State University
         Dominguez Hills, California State University Long Beach, University of California Los Angeles, and
         University of Southern California.
     Economic Development Policy 2.3. The City of Compton will promote the new hiring tax credits
         that are available to City businesses when hiring Compton residents.

         countries abroad to attract more industry to the City and increase employment opportunities for
         residents.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ISSUE – CITY REVENUE BASE
The health of the City is tied to the health of the local economy through the revenues generated from
property, business, and sales taxes. Services are funded through these revenues and through user fees.
Compton is not receiving its fare share of sales tax revenues because many goods and services used by
residents are unavailable in the City. With the opening of the Gateway Town Center (and now Phase 2),
this trend is reversing. The community understands the need to increase City revenues and at the same
time is committed to the quality of the enterprises providing the revenue.
    Economic Development Goal 3. Create a healthy environment to attract and retain investment,
    broaden the tax base, and increase the flow of public revenue.
     Economic Development Policy 3.1. The City of Compton will increase the number and quality of
         commercial and industrial businesses in the community to provide greater employment
         opportunities and tax revenues to support City services.
     Economic Development Policy 3.2. The City of Compton will develop an economic development
         plan for the entire City. Concentration on Retention, Attraction, and Expansion.
SECTION 6 – ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT                                                            PAGE 135

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Economic Development Policy 3.3. The City of Compton will support high-quality retail
        development that is consistent with the General Plan land use plan and demonstrate how it can
        reduce sales leakage outside the City.
     Economic Development Policy 3.4. The City of Compton will link City financial incentives to the
        delivery of tax revenue or jobs.
     Economic Development Policy 3.5. The City of Compton will seek private, state, and federal grants
        that will support the expansion of the local tax base.
6.3.3 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
The Planning and Economic Development Department promotes the orderly growth and development of
Compton’s commercial districts and residential neighbourhoods through the expeditious delivery of
technical expertise and resources. P&EDD was formed by combining the former departments of Planning
and Economic Resources Development. The Economic Development Division of P&EDD supports ongoing
business investment in the community through business development workshops, grants, and the
administration of business assistance programs.
The following State and Federal programs are available to qualified businesses in Compton and are utilized
by the Economic Development Division to attract businesses, increase local employment opportunities,
and reduce the City’s unemployment rate. Exhibit 6-3 shows where each program is available in the City.
     Section 108 Loan Program. This is the loan guarantee provision of the Community Development
        Block Grant (CDBG) program. Section 108 provides a source of financing for economic
        development, housing rehabilitation, public facilities, and large-scale physical development
        projects. Compton can leverage a small portion of its CDBG funds into federally guaranteed loans
        to pursue physical and economic revitalization projects to support: business attraction and
        retention; site preparation and acquisition; commercial façade improvements; infrastructure
        improvements; and industrial park improvements and building retrofit.
     Business Attraction and Retention Technical Assistance Program. The City of Compton provides
        management and technical advisory services and resources to businesses. Free counseling is
        available to individuals or groups desiring to start a business or improve an existing business.
        Assistance is available to clients for SBA, State, and/or Federal loan packaging, business and
        marketing planning. The program makes available: publications; reading and reference materials;
        and City demographic. The program also provides business training workshops and seminars
        through a partnership program with El Camino Compton College Learning Center, the Small
        Business Development Center (SBDC), and Careerlink (Compton).
     Commercial Revolving Loan Program. Low interest rate loans for commercial and industrial based
        businesses located in Compton that have been in operation for at least two (2) years and demonstate
        capacity to meet the monthly debt service resulting from the loan. Qualifying applicants are eligible
        to receive up to $100,000 for commercial loans and $150,000 for industrial loans. The minimum
        loan amount is $25,000. In most cases, loan applicants are required to demonstrate that two
        private dollars of funding have been secured for each dollar of City funds provided. The business

       inventory purchases. The goal of the program is to encourage commercial and industrial
       revitalization, assist in the development and/or expansion of commercial and industrial businesses
       in order to generate employment opportunities, stimulate private investment and, in general,
       improve those areas experiencing economic decline. The program is designed to provide a financing
       incentive that will result in private financing of business loans that are marginal and would
       therefore not occur without City involvement.
    HUBZone. The HUBZone program was developed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to
       promote job growth, capital investment, and economic development to historically underutilized
       business zones, referred to as HUBZones, by providing contracting assistance to small businesses
       located in these economically distressed communities. The SBA annually designates qualified
       census tracts as HUBZones in Compton. To participate, a business must be certified. Business
       certification includes maintaining a principal office in the HUBZone and demonstrating that 35%
       of its employees reside in the HUBZone and that it meets the definition of a Small Business based
       on its industry classification. Certified businesses receive federal contract preferences and set
       asides when bidding on Federal Government procurements.
    Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ). The City has 33 properties in the Artesia Commerce Park designated as
       a FTZ. This provides advantages to businesses involved in international trade by reducing or
       eliminating tariff costs. Businesses located in a FTZ can import parts or supplies for use in their
       U.S. manufactured finished good without paying tariff fees if the finished good is exported. If the
       finished good is for domestic sale they can delay payment of the tariff until the finished good is
       shipped.
    Recycling Market Development Zone (RMDZ). The RMDZ program combines recycling with
       economic development to fuel new businesses, expand existing ones, create jobs, and divert waste
       from landfills. Businesses located in the RMDZ that use materials from the waste stream to
       manufacture their products are eligible for attractive loans, technical assistance, and free product
       marketing.
    Labor Surplus Area (LSA). The Department of Labor annually designates cities with
       unemployment rates 20% higher than the national average as a LSA. The City of Compton is a
       designated LSA. Businesses located in a LSA can receive procurement preference points when
       bidding on federal procurement contract opportunities, which make them more competitive.
       Another benefit of locating in a LSA is access to Small Business Administriation (SBA) loans.
       Businesses that are normally restricted from applying for SBA financing because they are not a
       small business by SBA standards, may be able to apply for SBA loans because they qualify as a LSA
       business.
    Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). The WOTC is a federal income tax credit that can save
       employers up to $2,400 when they hire someone who is a member of one of eight targeted groups
       that have traditionally faced significant barriers to employment. Employers can claim up to 40%
       of the first $6,000 in qualified first-year wages for a maximum credit of $2,400 per new hire.
       Qualified wages are capped at $6,000 for all WOTC target groups, except Summer Youth, whose
       wages are capped at $3,000.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     City of Compton Career Link Work Source Center. The Career Link Work Source Center is a one-
        stop center funded through Federal Workforce Investment Administration (WIA) dollars. The
        Center offers comprehensive employment and hiring services to workers, employers, and job
        seekers at no charge. More specialized services like customized training sessions or intensive
        employment counseling are available for a nominal fee. The business services model employed by
        the Work Source network ensures the sharing of job listings and potential candidates throughout
        an entire countywide network. Job search tools provided include access to California’s database of
        job openings, Internet access, copy and fax machines, telephone bank, resume creating program,
        and handicap-accessible computer services. Job listings are updated daily. Employers can receive
        recruitment assistance and labor market information. Individuals can receive career planning
        assistance.
     New Employment Hiring Tax Credit (NEC). The New Employment Credit (NEC) is available for
        each taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2021, to a qualified
        taxpayer that hires a qualified full-time employee on or after January1, 2014, and pays or incurs
        qualified wages attributable to work performed by the qualified full-time employee in a designated
        census tract or economic development area, and that receives a tentative credit reservation for that
        qualified full-time employee.
     California Competes Tax Credit. The California Competes Tax Credit is an Income tax credit
        available to businesses that want to come to California or stay and grow in California. Unlike the
        Enterprise Zone program, this program is Statewide. Thus, there are no geographic restrictions.
        Tax credit agreements will be negotiated by GO-Biz and approved by the “California Competes Tax
        Credit Committee.”

                 SECTION 7.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
7.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
The primary purpose of this Urban Design Element is to establish a broad planning and policy framework
that will facilitate the ongoing revitalization of the City. While not required by state law, once adopted, the
Urban Design Element will have the same legal standing as the other mandatory elements.
7.1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
The Urban Design Element consists of the following sections:
      The Introduction to the Element provides an overview of the Element’s scope and content.
      The Urban Design Background Report discusses a wide range of issues regarding the form,
         structure, and sense of place that must be considered in future planning and development in the
         City.
      The Urban Design Plan identifies the City policies related to urban design along with those
         programs that will be effective in implementing the policies.
  SECTION 7.2 URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT BACKGROUND REPORT
This section of the Urban Design Element describes the existing characteristics and conditions of the City
of Compton as they pertain to historic development patterns, public art, streetscape, and public
infrastructure. This background information provides the foundation for the Urban Design Element goals
and policies.
7.2.1 HISTORIC DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS
Compton began as a pioneering community in 1867 when 30
families moved from Stockton, CA led by Griffith Dickenson
Compton. The early settlers formed a town and built a
schoolhouse which served as a church and center for civic
gatherings. The early settlers farmed and ranched. The
Richland Farms neighborhood has its roots in that early time.
The original one-room schoolhouse built in 1896 became
Compton High School and in 1898, the first class graduated.
Between 1914 and 1925, twelve new buildings were added and in
1927 a community college was added so that graduating seniors
could pursue a college education locally. With the exception of
the administration building which was rebuilt in 1935 after
being damaged in a 1933 earthquake, Compton High School has
been maintained to look much as it did when it was built in the
first quarter of the 20th Century – a link to Compton’s past.
SECTION 7 – URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                        PAGE 143

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The community college separated from the high school district when the voters approved a bond issue in
1950 to buy the present site on Artesia Boulevard. The new college was constructed in time for the first
classes to be held in the Fall of 1953. Compton College has grown and changed over the years, with a
modernization plan implemented between 1996 and 2004. In August 2006, the college went through a
transition and became El Camino College Compton Center.
The original town center was located along Willowbrook Avenue and Compton Boulevard which remains
the City’s downtown today. When the City incorporated in 1888 with 500 residents, the City boundaries
were 1 mile east and west of Willowbrook Avenue from Greenleaf in the south to a quarter-mile north of
Rosecrans. As the City continued to attract residents, the first City Hall was built on Alameda Street in the
1920s. On May 24, 1924, the Compton/Woodley Airport opened on Alondra Boulevard providing general
aviation services to the community. During the 1930’s, 40’s, and 50’s, over half of Compton’s existing
housing stock was built. Compton was developing into a suburban bedroom community with a grid
pattern of six north-south arterials and six east-west arterials. Schools were built to serve the residents of
these new suburban neighborhoods.
Compton began to be marked by the freeways that now surround it in the 1950s. State Route 91 was the
first, constructed along the southern boundary of Compton. In 1954, State Route 7 began construction and
was completed in 1975. It was renamed Interstate 710 in 1984. The 1960s brought construction of State
Route 11 which was renamed Interstate 110 in 1981. Interstate 105 was part of the 1960’s freeway master
plan for the State but it was not constructed until the 1980s and opened in 1993.
In the 1970s, a new era of development began in Compton. The present City Hall was built at 205 S.
Willowbrook Avenue replacing the one on Alameda Street. The downtown area was rebuilt and hundreds
of single-family homes, townhomes, and condominiums were constructed throughout the City. Walnut
Industrial Park was developed in the late 1970s and 1980s transforming 1,500 acres of unused and
underutilized land through the efforts of the Community Redevelopment Agency.
Compton’s next phase of growth began with the opportunity
presented by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority’s construction of the Blue Line
light rail through the City along Willowbrook Avenue, which
opened in 1990. The City constructed a multi-modal transit
center at the Compton Civic Center stop, the Martin Luther
King Jr. Transit Center. The MLK Jr. Transit Center serves
as a transfer station for multiple bus lines from Long Beach
and Gardena as well as Greyhound buses and all five of the
Compton Renaissance Transit bus routes. Willow Walk
town homes opened in 2007 adjacent to the MLK Jr. Transit
Center to capitalize upon the transit connections. The City
is developing a North Downtown Specific Plan to further
support transit-oriented development around the Compton
Civic Center Station. Another major opportunity occurred in 2002 when the freight rail lines bisecting the
City on Alameda Street were placed below grade with the development of the Alameda Corridor. The
Alameda Corridor is a consolidated freight expressway between the Ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach and downtown Los Angeles that began construction in 1994. Traffic flow across Alameda
Street has been significantly improved and the gateway monuments, plazas, and bridge crossings over the

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Alameda Corridor have improved pedestrian crossing and contributed to the improvement of the public
space in the City.
7.2.2 PUBLIC ART
Public art is any work of art or design that is created by an artist
specifically to be sited in a public space. It can tower several
stories high, or it can call attention to the pavement beneath
your feet. It can be cast, carved, built, assembled, or painted.
Whatever its form, public art attracts attention. By its presence
alone public art can heighten our awareness, question our
assumptions, transform a landscape, or express community
values, and for these reasons it can have the power, over time to
transform a city’s image. Public art helps define an entire
community’s identity and reveal the unique character of a
specific neighborhood. It is a unifying force.
Beyond its enriching personal benefits, public art is a true
symbol of a city’s maturity. It increases a community’s assets
and expresses a community’s positive sense of identity and values. It helps green space thrive, enhances
roadsides, pedestrian corridors, and community gateways; it demonstrates unquestionable civic and
corporate pride in citizenship and affirms an educational environment. A city with public art is a city that
thinks and feels. Examples of public art and landmarks in Compton are identified in Table 7-1.
In Compton, the large civic center monument dedicated to Martin Luther King, Jr. is an illustrative
example of the use of public art. It has become the symbol of the City and is used on the City’s website,
publications, literature, and signage.
Compton has enriched several public spaces with painted murals and mosaics. The painted mural at the
Compton Metro Station entrance representing the musical traditions of each of the three major ethnic
groups in Compton was created by Compton high school students and is titled, “Universal Musicians”.
Landmarks include cultural institutions and historical places such as the Heritage House and Angeles
                                                Abbey. The Heritage House was built in 1869 by A.R.
                                                Loomis. In 1955 it was marked the ‘Oldest House in
                                                Compton.’ It is now located at the corner of Myrrh Street and
                                                Willowbrook Avenue near the Civic Center Plaza and was
                                                restored and refurbished and will eventually house a museum
                                                detailing early life in Compton. Angeles Abbey is a
                                                mausoleum, with Moorish middle-eastern architecture. It is
                                                a popular location for television commercials and movie
                                                shoots. Founded around 1923, Angeles Abbey Memorial Park
                                                has a rich history and is the final resting place of many
                                                notable early Compton citizens.

                                The area is landscaped with tall palm trees like a desert oasis and the well is a
                                symbol of soothing refreshment of body and spirit while also serving as a circular
                                seating area or gathering place for passengers waiting in the park & ride area.
                                Steel and copper replicas of coins reinforce the idea of a wishing well.
Artesia Metro Station
                                Etched along the pathway into the station are strips of blue concrete pavers with
                                poetic references to universal human longings and emotions through metaphors
                                associated with water. The strips of text lead the viewer toward a low wall of blue
                                and green mosaic tile images of breaking wave patterns. The waves are directed
                                toward a serpentine walk leading up to the station platform where a steel kiosk
                                displays ceramic tile “wishes” gathered from children and youth in the
                                community.
Crystal Park Casino and Hotel   Crystal Park was the first casino hotel in Los Angeles County. It remains as one
                                of the few operating casinos in the area and a tourist destination. In addition to
                                gaming, the hotel hosts nightly entertainment and special events. Its location is
                                visible from the 91 Freeway and near the Artesia Metro Station.
Tomorrow's Aeronautical Museum  This museum on Alondra Boulevard, next to Compton Airport, is destination for

                                California. It is located on Long Beach Boulevard near Alondra Boulevard.
                                The mausoleum, with its Moorish middle-eastern architecture, is a popular
                                location for television commercials and movie shoots. Founded around 1923,
Angeles Abbey Mausoleum
                                Angeles Abbey Memorial Park has a rich history and is the final resting place of
                                many notable early Compton citizens.

7.2.3 STREETSCAPE
Streetscape refers to the street’s visual character that is formed
through the combination of the roadway, sidewalks,
landscaping, buildings, street furniture, and open spaces.
Compton has been upgrading its streetscapes to improve the
pedestrian environment as well as the visual appeal to residents
and visitors.
Pedestrian activity is heavy at the intersection of Compton
Boulevard and Willowbrook Avenue adjacent to the Civic
Center. At this street crossing, special design attention has been
given to brick pavers and medians to ensure pedestrian safety
because the Metro Blue Line train crosses this intersection.
The Alameda Corridor bisects Compton and connects the Ports
of Los Angeles and Long Beach with the rail yards east of Downtown Los Angeles. It consists of a series of
bridges, underpasses, overpasses, and street improvements that separate freight trains from street traffic
and passenger trains, facilitating a more efficient transportation network. The development of overpasses
and street improvements provided unique opportunities for pedestrian enhancements to the streetscape.
Sound walls were installed in areas abutting the corridor at Frances Willard Elementary School on El
Segundo Boulevard to reduce noise pollution and increase safety. At Compton Boulevard, green fencing is
used to soften the streetscape. Where major boulevards meet the Alameda Corridor, pedestrian crosswalks
are defined with a red brick pattern outlined in white. To encourage pedestrian travel and minimize
impact on the community, landscaped plazas have been created to enhance the Alameda Corridor crossing
environment.
Major bus stops are located near popular shopping districts, schools, parks, and public buildings and many
have been improved with benches and shelters creating a more welcoming place to catch the bus or train.
Landscaping and trees soften the urban streetscape. They provide shade and an inviting atmosphere to
pedestrians. Compton has incorporated Birch, Crape Myrtle, and Ficus Nivea, a type of fig tree, into the
streetscape medians of its commercial corridors. Residential and commercial property owners are
encouraged to beautify their properties with trees. The City’s parks are landscaped with trees around the
periphery of the park, thereby contributing to the streetscape and allowing the inner space to be used for a
diversity of activities.
7.2.4 PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE
The City has invested in its public and private infrastructure with gateway monuments, medians, and a
multipurpose trail system connecting the City via Compton Creek. Over the years since moving City Hall,
investments have been made to build a civic center at Willowbrook Avenue and Compton Boulevard that
includes the Civic Center Plaza, Los Angeles Superior Court, Sheriff’s Station, Compton Library, Compton
Fire Station #1, and the U.S. Postal Office. On the northeast corner is the Compton Towne Center, and to
the north of it lies the Martin Luther King Jr. Transit and Metro Blue Line Compton Station stop.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Gateways are major entry points into the City. Compton has updated its gateways with monuments
greeting entering and departing visitors to the City. In addition, concrete obelisks inscribed “Compton” are
located on the central medians of key streets.
Infrastructure improvements were made to Compton Boulevard, Alondra Boulevard, Central Avenue, and
Wilmington Avenue in the last five years with the addition of median islands to separate the direction of
moving cars. The median islands are made of red brick, stone, or white cement. Low maintenance trees
and plants beautify the new medians.
Compton Creek runs diagonally through Compton from the northwest to southeast. The City has provided
community connectivity with the installation of the Compton Creek Multi-Purpose Trail System, a 3.5 mile
long equestrian path on the west bank of Compton Creek and a 3.5 mile long cement multi-purpose biking
and walking path on the east bank from West El Segundo Boulevard to Greenleaf Boulevard. This path
connects several local schools and parks, the bike lane on Alondra Boulevard, and residential
neighborhoods including Richland Farms, home to many horse-owners.

7.3.3 URBAN DESIGN PLAN
The Urban Design Plan provides guiding principles for design of all new commercial, retail, and industrial
development in the City of Compton.
                                       Figure 1: Design Envelope Area
GUIDING PRINCIPLES - BUILDING DESIGN
The Design Envelope Area or DEA defines the area within which a proposed building must consider
adjacent building designs. The DEA includes two adjacent neighboring and three opposite buildings
surrounding the proposed site as shown in Figure 1. If the proposed building is on a corner, the five
buildings considered within the DEA are the three other corner buildings and the adjacent building facing
the same street and the building across the street from it as shown in Figure 2.
                             Figure 2: Design Envelope Area of Corner Building
The DEA shall be used to define mass, scale, rhythm, texture, and other components of building design, as
described in the following guiding principles.
     Articulate Large Masses. Buildings of large mass shall be designed to avoid a box-like
        appearance. They can be broken up through horizontal or vertical articulation or by use of varied
        materials, textures, or colors. The massing of the buildings shall remain generally consistent with
SECTION 7 – URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                    PAGE 150

 CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
       appropriate buildings within the design envelope area. Where the massing within the design
       envelope area emphasizes a simple block form, variations to this form are encouraged to break up
       large, solid wall surfaces. On buildings with wide facades, the use of courtyards, arcades, and
       varied roof lines is encouraged to help provide architectural interest and reduce large massing
       elements.
    Avoid Blank Walls. Building design elements such as roof lines, cornices, and storefronts shall be
       extended across all facades open to view from public streets, parking lots and/or adjacent
       properties. Contrasting textures, trims, landscaping, architectural relief, and details from the main
       facade can be used to add interest to visible side or rear walls.
    Retain Scale of Components. The scale of proposed building components shall remain consistent
       with the buildings in the design envelope area. Building components such as windows, doors, and
       storefront modules shall be considered with respect to 1) each other, 2) the entire new facade, and
       3) the scale of elements found in other buildings within the design envelope area.
    Land Use Compatibility. New development must be compatible with other development in the
       area in terms of floor area ratio, building height, and mass. New developments shall conform to
       the height limits set down in the City Zoning Code.
    Maintain Similar Proportions. The proportion of the major elements of a building shall be
       complementary to the proportion found between similar elements in appropriate buildings in the
       DEA. These elements include windows, doors, and storefront design. For example: multi-paned
       glazing is rarely found in the storefronts; therefore, single-pane glazing is recommended where
       this is a common element in the design envelope area.
                           Figure 3: Similar Proportions and Limited Emphasis
    Limit New Emphasis. Emphasis shall be used with restraint in order not to detract from the
       overall character of the design envelope area. A major element of emphasis, such as entry, shall
       not overshadow design elements of adjacent buildings.
    Use Compatible Textures. The texture of the facades shall be compatible with the buildings within
       the design envelope area. Variations in texture are permitted where these emphasize intimate
       scales such as bricks or tile.
    Provide Compatible Setbacks. The front setback to building entrances shall be encouraged to have
       different setbacks to add interest, to allow for doors swinging out, and/or to add to the display area
       in the storefront. This varying setback concept could be integrated into the facade articulation
SECTION 7 – URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                       PAGE 151

 CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
       elements by providing arcade area, roof overhang, outdoor dining enclosure, courtyard,
       landscaping, hardscape, bus shelter, and/or architectural relief.
    Use Related Colors. All color palettes chosen for new development shall be consistent with the
       area or project-specific design standards. In addition, the colors on the buildings within the DEA
       should be reviewed to determine compatibility with the proposed building. Neutral or soft colors
       are preferable for large wall surfaces (light gray, cream, beige, tan, light blue, etc.) while brighter or
       deeper shades provide effective trim colors (brown, dark green, maroon, white, black, charcoal
       gray, etc.). The use of bold, primary, or garish colors is not allowed. Generally, a limit of three
       colors per building is desirable.
    Screen Mechanical Equipment. All rooftop mechanical equipment and utility equipment shall be
       screened to the view from the street according to existing City standards. Utility boxes and
       pedestals shall be placed underground or in unobtrusive areas where feasible.
                                  Figure 4: Screen Mechanical Equipment
    Integrate Additions. An addition to an existing building shall be designed to integrate with the
       existing building. The new addition shall match the original in terms of massing, window styles
       and openings, roof line, materials, and all other aspects of design (rhythm, scale, etc.). When a
       newer look is desired than that found on the original, the entire building shall be renovated to
       achieve a single design.
    Hide Building Security. Building security shall be hidden during operational hours. The use of
       interior security and fire alarm systems are preferred. Vandal-proof glazing that is resilient to
       impact is also recommended for storefronts. If interior grills are used, they shall be permitted only
       at the interior of display windows and must recess into pockets or overhead cylinders that conceal
       the grill when retracted.
SECTION 7 – URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                          PAGE 152

   CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
                                           Figure 5: Addition Integration
       Remove Abandoned Materials. Abandoned pipes, conduits, wires, signs, and other debris shall be
          removed and sign anchors patched to match adjacent surfaces. Operational pipes, conduits, etc.,
          must be hidden.
       Integrate Seismic Strengthening. Any seismic structural upgrading shall be conducted at the
          interior of the building, if possible, unless the structural elements blend into the architecture of the
          exposed rear/side facade. Shear walls shall not be introduced into the storefront where display
          areas currently exist.
       Use Complementary Lighting. Exterior lighting shall blend with the architectural character of
          the building to illuminate entryways and to articulate architectural features. Both lighting
          fixtures and levels of light shall be subtle, and not designed with an intensely lit façade acting as a
          sign.
 GUIDING PRINCIPLES - FAÇADE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS
 Buildings consist of three main elements: 1) the base or bottom; 2) the center or body of the building; and
 3) the top portion including a roof or cornice.
                                          Figure 6: Elements of a Building
Top
Body
Base
 The following guidelines address the side and rear elevations of buildings and must be implemented as
 part of a street façade improvement plan:
 SECTION 7 – URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                           PAGE 153

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Be consistent with the style of the building - rear/side facades shall be designed to be consistent
         with the architectural style of the building and the design of the primary façade.
     Rehabilitation of the rear façade may introduce accessory elements typical of the main facade
         (such as awnings or light fixtures), but shall not attempt to replicate storefronts or ornate
         decorative embellishments typically found only on the main façade.
     Exterior window treatments - The use of window treatments is encouraged to identify entrances
         and to add visual interest at windows. If awnings are chosen, they must meet City ordinances to
         allow passage of service and emergency vehicles.
     Security grills - Grills on windows shall be simple rather than ornate and meet all provisions of the
         Uniform Building Code.
GUIDING PRINCIPLES - STREETSCAPE DESIGN
The use of enriched paving in pedestrian crosswalks delineates the crosswalks to approaching vehicles. In
addition, paving treatment installed at driveway approaches, drop-off areas, and plaza entries is
recommended. Special paving materials and patterns shall be used to enhance pedestrian walkways,
plazas, and gardens.
                                      Figure 7: Paving Material Examples
        Stone        Brick      Pavers      Stamped
Recommended materials include:
     Scored or stamped patterns in smooth or rock salt finished natural or colored concrete;
     Natural stone pavers (flat) set in mortar in regular or irregular sizes;
     Precast pavers, such as brick or concrete; and,
     Other materials consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.
SECTION 7 – URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                    PAGE 154

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Enriched paving can improve pedestrian safety and ease of movement while maintaining and enhancing
the City's image and economic viability. In addition to crosswalks, the placement of gateway monuments,
major intersections, and the placement or repair of walls and fences are examples of streetscape
improvements which will enhance the visual appeal of the area. Street furniture that will enhance the
pedestrian experience along commercial corridors includes benches, trash receptacles, and bus shelters
shall have the following specifications:
     Stone, rock, concrete, wood, or metal are all acceptable building materials for street furniture;
     All benches shall be of pre-cast concrete or wire mesh metals;
     Trash receptacles shall be pre-cast concrete or wire mesh metals (non-combustible materials);
         and,
     Bus shelters shall be placed inside of adjacent property lines. Property dedications or development
         agreements shall be included with project approvals. The pads shall be brick-colored stamped
         concrete or pavers.
GUIDING PRINCIPLES - SIGNAGE
The design quality and readability of signs are a very important aspect to the overall atmosphere and
pedestrian/ vehicular character created for the area. All signs shall be maintained in good repair, including
the display surface, which shall be kept neat and functional.
     The exposed back of all signs visible to the public shall be suitably finished and maintained.
     Signs may be composed of wood, plastic, foam, acrylics, metal, concrete, and/or glass.
     The base of all freestanding and monument signs must be fully landscaped and irrigated.
     All signs shall be designed free of bracing, angle-iron guy wires, cables, or similar devices.
     An effort shall be made to achieve consistency between building style and sign design. In all cases,
         signage shall be complementary to the exterior treatment of the building or location involved.
     Color schemes for signage shall relate to other signs, graphics, and color schemes in the vicinity in
         order to achieve an overall sense of identity.
     Lettering styles used on signage shall be highly legible and shall be laid out horizontally or along
         relatively flat horizontal arcs.
     Methods of illuminating signs include incandescent lighting, fluorescent lighting, LED, and bent
         neon tube lighting. When a sign is internally lit, only the letters, logos, and symbols shall be
         translucent with the background sign area opaque unless it is an LED sign.
SECTION 7 – URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                          PAGE 155

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
                                 Figure 9: Examples of Appropriate Signage
GUIDING PRINCIPLES - LANDSCAPING
Outside of the public right-of-way, the landscaping surrounding commercial strips, shopping centers,
and/or other commercial and industrial properties offer an opportunity for several types of plants and
designs. The following are guidelines and recommended plant lists for off the right-of-way landscaping:
     The use of drought tolerant plant species is recommended, especially in large areas next to
        buildings, parking lot areas, and residential development.
     Trees and shrubs shall be trimmed and maintained.
     Earth mounding (berms) shall be used to imitate small hills and knolls in the setback areas not
        used as usable open space.
     All landscaping shall be fully irrigated with an electronically monitored irrigation system.
     Landscaping lighting shall be used to highlight landscaping features such as trees and pedestrian
        areas.
GUIDING PRINCIPLES – FENCING AND SCREENING
The placing or repairing of walls and fences is suggested as a design component to improve the appearance
of the property. Distinct treatments are recommended for construction sites, commercial/industrial
properties, and commercial/industrial properties which abut residential properties.
     Construction sites shall be screened from public view with either a panel wood fence or a chain link
        fence with slats or green polyurethane screening. A wood panel fence may include an approved
        artist rendering or mural. Where required, a panel wood fence must include a cover over the
        sidewalk.
     Commercial and industrial sites shall use a solid masonry block wall, simulated wood, a wrought
        iron fence, or a combination of wrought iron and masonry block wall. Landscaping of clinging
        vines or shrub planting materials shall be planted along the exterior of the wall or fence. All
        landscaping areas shall be fully equipped with automatic irrigation.
SECTION 7 – URBAN DESIGN ELEMENT                                                                    PAGE 156

        maintain fencing and landscaping between the two properties.
7.3.4 URBAN DESIGN PROGRAMS AND DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
The following programs and City Departments will implement City policy relative to urban design.
     Design Review. The Director of Community Development will oversee an interdepartmental
        design review process for the review and evaluation of new projects to ensure that they meet the
        highest standards for design and construction. Projects requiring review include, but are not
        limited to exterior improvements made to residential units, new residential subdivisions,
        landscaping for new projects, project additions, and commercial, industrial, and institutional
        projects in the City. The purpose of the design review process is to ensure that building design,
        architecture, and site layouts are compatible with surrounding development. This process will be
        defined in the City’s Municipal Code.
     Environmental Review. The City will continue to evaluate the environmental impacts of new
        development and provide mitigation measures prior to development approval, as required by the
        California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Environmental review shall be provided for major
        projects, as well as those that will have the potential to adversely impact the environment. Land
        use and development are among the issue areas that will be addressed in the environmental
        analysis. In compliance with CEQA, the City shall also assign responsibilities for the verification of
        the implementation of mitigation measures that may be recommended as part of the
        environmental review process.
     Zoning Conformity Program. The City shall review and amend the zoning ordinance and map to
        ensure that the development standards are consistent with those identified in the Land use
        Element. The City will initiate appropriate changes to the zoning map to ensure conformity
        between the Land Use Element and zoning map.

                   SECTION 8.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
8.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
The City of Compton Air Quality Element is an optional element in that it is not specifically mandated by the
State of California for inclusion into the Compton General Plan. However, once adopted, the element has the
same status as the other seven mandatory elements.
The inclusion of the Air Quality Element underscores the City’s commitment to improving air quality. The
Element focuses on local initiatives that will be effective in improving air quality locally as well as for the
surrounding region, and identifies air quality standards that new development must attain.
Air quality is impacted by land use, local circulation systems, and transportation services. Policies and programs
included in the required elements mirror sustainable development concepts that are effective both in reducing
dependence on the private automobile and reducing vehicle miles traveled, and hence air pollution. The Land
Use and Housing Elements encourage transit-oriented development while the Circulation Element provides for
the maintenance of a comprehensive transit framework that will be effective in reducing air quality emissions
from local private vehicles.

8.2.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF AIR POLLUTANTS
Compton is located in the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB), a 6,600 square-mile area that includes Orange County
and the non-desert urbanized portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties. Air pollution in
Compton is affected by local and regional impacts. An understanding of airborne pollutants, the sources of the
emissions, and the corresponding health effects is critical in the development of policies and programs to
remedy poor air quality. Airborne pollution is typically categorized according to the source, namely mobile
emissions or stationary emissions.
Mobile emissions refer to those pollutants that are generated from moving sources such as cars, trucks, trains,
aircraft and ships. Among the most prevalent mobile emissions are vehicle emissions. Stationary emissions are
generated from non-moving sources and may include emissions from power plants, factories, or other industrial
processes. The focus of Federal, State, and regional efforts is on air pollutants that present the greatest potential
for health problems. The criteria pollutants of special concern include the following:
      Ozone (O3) is a nearly colorless gas that irritates the lungs and damages materials and vegetation. O 3 is
         formed by photochemical reaction (in which nitrogen dioxide is broken down by sunlight). Although O 3
         concentrations have declined nationwide since 1991 to the lowest levels since monitoring began, the
         Southern California region continues to experience some of the highest recorded levels in the nation. In
         portions of Southern California the O3 levels are more than two times higher than the national standard
         and nearly three times higher than the more stringent state standard. The Los Angeles Region and the
         surrounding SCAB is designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air
         Resources Board (CARB) as an extreme ozone non-attainment area.
      Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless toxic gas that interferes with the transfer of oxygen to the
         brain that is produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels emitted as vehicle
         exhaust. The South Coast Air Basin is designated as a serious non-attainment area for carbon monoxide
         by the EPA.
      Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a yellowish-brown gas that, at high levels, can cause breathing difficulties.
         NO2 is formed when nitric oxide (a pollutant from burning processes) combines with oxygen. Although
         NO2 concentrations have not exceeded national standards since 1991, NO 2 emissions remain a concern
         because of their contribution to the formation of O 3 and particulate matter. The South Coast Air Basin
         remains a non-attainment for NO2 by both the EPA and CARB.
      Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a colorless, pungent gas formed primarily by the combustion of sulfur-containing
         fossil fuels. Health effects include acute respiratory symptoms and difficulty in breathing for children.
         Although SO2 concentrations have been reduced to levels well below State and Federal standards,
         further reductions in SO2 emissions are desirable since SO2 is a precursor to sulfate and PM10.
      PM10 refers to particulate matter less than ten microns in diameter. PM 10 causes a greater health risk
         than larger-sized particles, since fine particles can more easily cause respiratory irritation. The Federal
         standards for PM10 have been met in most areas within the SCAB though standards were exceeded in
         portions of Riverside County. However, there were widespread exceedances of the more stringent State
         standards throughout the SCAB. As a result, PM10 continues to be designated non-attainment.
SECTION 8 – AIR QUALITY ELEMENT                                                                            PAGE 162

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
      PM2.5 refers to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter. PM2.5 also represents a significant
          health risk because they can more easily cause respiratory irritation. The annual average concentrations
          of PM2.5 exceeded federal standards in some areas of the SCAB.
The sources and potential health effects of the criteria pollutants are summarized in Table 8-1. There has been a
documented improvement in overall air quality in the region. Nevertheless, poor air quality in the South Coast
Air Basin continues to be a major health concern. Air pollution remains a contributing factor in a number of
chronic health conditions that include asthma, emphysema, and heart and pulmonary diseases. The CARB
estimates that approximately 8,800 Californians die prematurely each year as a result of non-attainment of
ozone and particulate matter standards. A recent study completed by the University of Southern California
noted that the lungs of children born in the Southern California region are not likely to fully develop and may
never recover from smog’s damage in adulthood.

8.2.2 AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
Pollutants regulated by the Federal and State Clean Air Acts correspond to three categories: criteria air
pollutants which are commonly found pollutants; toxic air contaminants which include any compound that is in
the air and has the potential to produce adverse health effects, and global warming and ozone-depleting gases
such as chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) compounds and other contributory substances. The EPA has established
ambient air quality standards (National Ambient Air Quality Standards [NAAQS]) for the following air
pollutants: ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), lead (Pb),
particulate matter (PM10), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has
also established ambient air quality standards for six of the aforementioned pollutants regulated by the EPA
(CARB has not established standards for PM2.5). Some of the California ambient air quality standards are more
stringent than the national ambient air quality standards. California has also established standards for the
following: sulfates, vinyl chloride, and visibility. Table 8-2 lists the current national and California standards.

In addition to the Federal and State ambient air quality standards, there are daily and quarterly emissions
thresholds related to the construction and subsequent operation of projects that are subject to the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The City of Compton uses these thresholds in its local review of
development projects over which the City has jurisdiction. A development that results in either construction-
related emissions or operational emissions that exceed the thresholds are considered to have a significant and
adverse environmental impact.
SECTION 8 – AIR QUALITY ELEMENT                                                                              PAGE 164

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
8.2.3 AIR QUALITY CONTROL REGULATIONS
There are a number of important plans and implementing regulations that are applicable to land uses and
activities that may affect air quality. The more significant plans and regulations relevant to the City of Compton
are summarized below.
     Air Quality Management Plan. Both Federal and State Clean Air Acts require that every non-attainment
         area prepare an air quality management plan (AQMP) to identify ways local air quality may be returned to
         healthful levels. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD) is the smog control
         agency for the South Coast Air Basin, and it is the principal local agency responsible for comprehensive air
         pollution control in the region that includes air quality monitoring, the development of long range plans to
         improve air quality, and the enforcement of regulations designed to attain and maintain State and Federal
         ambient air quality standards. The South Coast AQMD is responsible for the implementation of the
         protocols of the Federal Clean Air Act. In addition, it is responsible for ensuring that the more stringent
         California Clean Air standards are met. The most recent AQMP was adopted in June 2007 and focuses on
         those criteria pollutants for which the region is in non-attainment (ozone and particulates), as well as
         incorporating new scientific data, modeling, and regulations into the plan.
     Regulation IV Prohibitions. Regulation IV measures are applicable to a wide range of emissions sources. It
         does not regulate the specific types of equipment or sources of emissions. Rather, it establishes standards
         that cannot be exceeded.
     Regulation XI Source Specific Standards. Regulation XI rules are control measures that are applicable
         to a wide range of existing stationary sources designed to regulate a single pollutant. Each Regulation
         XI rule applies to controlling emissions from a specific source or type of equipment.
     Regulation XIII New Source Review. Regulation XIII establishes pre-construction review requirements
         for new, modified, or relocated facilities in the SCAB. Affected facilities must install best available
         control technology (BACT) equipment, which must be as stringent as the Lowest Achievable Emission
         Rate as defined by the Federal Clean Air Act.
     Regulation XIV Toxics and Other Non-criteria Pollutants. The South Coast AQMD Rule 1401 (New
         Source Review of Carcinogenic Air Contaminants) assesses and manages risk from new or modified
         sources of air toxics through a permitting program to control non-criteria pollutants. Rule 1401 also
         describes the risk assessment procedures to use in evaluating risks from sources that emit cancer-
         causing substances. The following examples of projects are considered to have the potential for
         significant air quality impacts:
         o    A project involving the emissions of a carcinogenic or toxic air contaminant identified in Rule 1401
              that exceeds the maximum individual cancer risk of one in one million or 10 in one million if the
              project is constructed with the best available control strategy for toxics (T-BACT) using the
              procedures in Rule 1401;
         o    A project that could accidentally release an acutely hazardous material or routinely release a toxic
              air contaminant posing an acute health hazard; and,
         o    A project that could emit an air contaminant that is not currently regulated by South Coast AQMD
              rule but is on the Federal or State air toxics list.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
      Regulation XX - Regional Clean Air Incentives Market. A comprehensive market-based regulation
        aimed at reducing NOx and SOx emissions at larger emission sources (annual NOx or SOx emissions
        greater than or equal to four tons) by setting annual declining limits at each facility and allowing the
        owner to meet these declining targets by either buying surplus emissions reductions from other sources,
        reducing emissions through installation of air pollution control equipment, or reducing operations
        onsite.
8.2.4 AIR QUALITY TRENDS
Winters within the SCAB are mild, and frost is rare, as temperatures seldom fall below 28° F. The annual
average daytime temperatures in the City of Compton range from 44°-63° F in winter to 70°-85° F in summer.
Temperatures sometimes exceed 100° F during the summer months. Annual rainfall in the region averages
between 12-15 inches and occurs almost exclusively during the winter months. Compton is located
approximately 8 miles from the Pacific Ocean and thus enjoys some of the moderating influences of the ocean.
Wind flow patterns in the SCAB affect air quality by directing pollutants downwind from their sources. Local
meteorological conditions (such as light winds and shallow vertical mixing) and topographical features (such as
the San Gabriel Mountains to the north of the region) create areas of high pollutant concentrations by hindering
dispersal. Temperature inversions created by a semi-permanent subtropical high-pressure cell over the Pacific
Ocean also hinders dispersion by trapping cool air near the ground with warm air from the ocean.
The two primary criteria pollutants that remain non-attainment in the local area and are regularly monitored are
PM10 and Ozone. The South Coast AQMD operates a monitoring station in Lynwood and readings at this station
can be used to characterize local air quality. Although a monitoring station was established in Compton in 2008,
it has not been open long enough to provide trend data. Table 8-3 indicates the readings for these pollutants
from the Lynwood station. Ozone and PM 10 measurement trends from the station in Lynwood are illustrated in
Exhibits 8-1 and 8-2 respectively, and they indicate a gradual decline in the number of days when State and
Federal clean air standards were exceeded.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The Los Angeles basin has experienced poor air quality due in large part to the area’s topography and
metrological influences that often lead to inversion layers that prevent the dispersal of pollutants. During the
mid-20th century, the Los Angeles area had the worst air quality in the nation which gave rise to various
strategies to improve air quality. The region’s air quality has shown a steady and gradual improvement since the
1970’s when air quality was at its worst. This improvement is largely due to the elimination of many stationary
point sources, more stringent vehicle emissions controls, and new regulations governing activities that
contribute to air pollution (such as open-air fires).
8.2.5 GLOBAL WARMING
Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are known as Greenhouse Gases (GHG). GHGs are emitted by both
natural processes and human activities. GHG emissions that are produced both by natural and industrial
processes include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20). The accumulation of GHG in
the atmosphere regulates the earth's temperature. Without natural GHG, the Earth's surface would be about
61°F cooler. However, emissions from fossil fuel combustion by humans have elevated the concentration of
GHG in the atmosphere above previous levels. Scientific evidence indicates a correlation between increasing
global temperatures/climate change over the past century and human induced levels of GHG. These and other
environmental changes have potentially negative environmental, economic, and social consequences around
the globe.
The California Natural Resources Agency is presently developing the State's Climate Adaptation Strategy.
Currently, there are no Federal standards for GHG emissions and Federal regulations have not been
promulgated. Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the harm associated with climate change are serious
and well recognized, that the EPA must regulate GHG as pollutants, and unless the agency determines that
GHG do not contribute to climate change, it must promulgate regulations for GHG emissions from new motor
vehicles. To date, 12 states, including California, have set State GHG emission targets. The passage of
Assembly Bill AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, established the California target to
achieve reductions in GHG to 1990 GHG emission levels by the year 2020.
The Compton General Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR) includes an evaluation of the existing
greenhouse gas emissions within the planning area, those anticipated local greenhouse gas emissions
anticipated at build-out under the implementation of the General Plan’s Land Use Element, and those
estimated greenhouse gas emissions for the 1990.
                               SECTION 8.3 AIR QUALITY PLAN
8.3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN
The Air Quality Plan identifies the City’s goals for 2010 through 2030 related to improving local air quality and
sets the policies and programs for achieving them. The plan also identifies local initiatives such as
environmentally sensitive land use planning, transportation planning, trip reduction strategies, and the control
of stationary emissions that will address localized emissions sources.
The City’s vision for Air Quality is to utilize Smart Growth principles to foster pedestrian-focused neighborhoods
and increase transit use which will translate into air quality benefits through a reduction in automobile use.
SECTION 8 – AIR QUALITY ELEMENT                                                                           PAGE 168

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
8.3.2 AIR QUALITY GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Air Quality Element were developed in response to issues identified in the technical
background report and on issues and opportunities identified in community workshops that were conducted as
part of a comprehensive outreach program.
AIR QUALITY ISSUE - TRIP REDUCTION
Light duty automobiles, as a group, will remain a significant contributor to ozone and carbon monoxide air
pollution, despite significant reductions from this source that will occur even without additional controls.
    Air Quality Element Goal 1. Reduce automobile use.
     Air Quality Element Policy 1.1. The City of Compton will ensure that new large-scale developments
         incorporate features that facilitate alternate forms of transportation.
     Air Quality Element Policy 1.2. The City of Compton will increase rider-ship on the local transit system
         by making it more user-friendly by providing safe, attractive places to wait that include route maps.
AIR QUALITY ISSUE - DIESEL EMISSIONS
Trucks contribute to air pollution by increasing congestion during peak hours, through involvement in freeway
accidents which lead to extensive vehicle slowing and idling, and through direct emissions of pollutants,
especially particulates. Programs which divert truck traffic to less congested time periods increase traffic flow,
which reduces the emission of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, as well as improving truck delivery efficiency
by reducing travel time.
    Air Quality Element Goal 2. Reduce peak-hour roadway congestion.
     Air Quality Element Policy 2.1. The City of Compton will encourage truck operations to divert peak
         hour travel, whenever feasible, to off-peak periods to reduce roadway congestion and associated
         emissions.
     Air Quality Element Policy 2.2. The City of Compton will encourage local facilities to receive truck
         deliveries in off-peak hours.
     Air Quality Element Policy 2.3. The City of Compton will encourage industrial and commercial
         businesses to use CNG, LNG, and Hybrid/Electric trucks where feasible.
AIR QUALITY ISSUE - GROWTH MANAGEMENT
When housing is located far from available employment and necessary shopping and services, residents are
forced to drive longer distances than when jobs, housing [*should this be housing or shopping?], and
services are in close proximity. Longer trips contribute to greater automobile emissions of air pollutants.
SECTION 8 – AIR QUALITY ELEMENT                                                                           PAGE 169

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
    Air Quality Element Goal 3. Reduce emissions associated with vehicle miles traveled by
    providing a balance of jobs and housing.
     Air Quality Element Policy 3.1. The City of Compton will support economic development policies,
         which promote opportunities for business attraction within the City to reduce vehicle trips outside of the
         City for employment.
     Air Quality Element Policy 3.2. The City of Compton will support economic development policies,
         which promote a balance of shopping and services necessary for the City's residential sector to reduce
         vehicle trips outside of the City.
AIR QUALITY ISSUE - ENERGY CONSUMPTION
Energy conservation programs that reduce current and future consumption can more than offset future usage
and maximize the benefits of furnace and water heater controls.
    Air Quality Element Goal 4. Reduce emissions associated with energy consumption.
     Air Quality Element Policy 4.1. The City of Compton will support the use of energy-efficient equipment
         and design in City facilities and infrastructure.
     Air Quality Element Policy 4.2. The City of Compton will encourage incorporation of energy features,
         including passive solar, in the construction and rehabilitation of new and existing structures.
     Air Quality Element Policy 4.3. The City of Compton will support recycling programs which reduce
         emissions associated with manufacturing and waste disposal.
     Air Quality Element Policy 4.4. The City of Compton will encourage the use of lower-emission alternate
         fuels in city-owned vehicles.
AIR QUALITY ISSUE - STATIONARY EMISSIONS
Materials such as paints and coatings used in building construction contribute to air pollution. Locating new
sensitive receptor sources near existing sources of particulate matter or toxics exposes residents to unsafe levels
of pollutants. The review of building and site plans prior to construction can serve to reduce or eliminate both
new sources of pollutants or exposure.
    Air Quality Element Goal 5. Reduce air pollution emissions and impacts through site planning and
    building design.
     Air Quality Element Policy 5.1. The City of Compton will support the use of low polluting construction
         materials and coatings.
     Air Quality Element Policy 5.2. The City of Compton will provide, to the maximum extent feasible, for
         the separation of sensitive receptors, such as schools and hospitals, from sources of toxic emissions.
     Air Quality Element Policy 5.3. The City of Compton will encourage the design of new commercial
         developments to emphasize access to walking, bicycling, and public transportation.
     Air Quality Element Policy 5.4. The City of Compton will standardize air quality review procedures for
         all new developments.
SECTION 8 – AIR QUALITY ELEMENT                                                                            PAGE 170

 CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Air Quality Element Policy 5.5. The City of Compton will reduce the exposure of sensitive receptors to
        dust and odors to the maximum extent feasible.
AIR QUALITY ISSUE - CITY INITIATIVES
Many air quality and transportation programs require regional and sub-regional cooperation to be effective.
Local support for air quality legislation at the state and federal level is also essential for its passage.
    Air Quality Element Goal 6. Maximize the effectiveness of air quality control programs through
    coordination with other governmental units.
     Air Quality Element Policy 6.1. The City of Compton will participate in the Southern California Air
        Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD) development process on regulations that impact the
        City of Compton to insure that city concerns are resolved early in the process.
     Air Quality Element Policy 6.2. The City of Compton will participate in regional air quality plan
        development to ensure that issues affecting Compton are considered when developing local government
        measures and that legislation improving regional air quality that does not adversely impact Compton, is
        supported.
     Air Quality Element Policy 6.3. The City of Compton will participate with neighboring cities in efforts to
        improve regional and sub-regional transit.
     Air Quality Element Policy 6.4. The City of Compton will require new local commercial and industrial
        establishments to demonstrate that South Coast AQMD permits have been obtained.
8.3.3 AIR QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAMS
There are a number of Federal and State agencies involved in the development, implementation, and
enforcement of regulations related to clean air. The primary agencies include the United States Environmental
Protection Agency, the California Air Resources Board, and the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA is the lead Federal Agency responsible for
        implementing and enforcing the Clean Air Act. As part of this effort, the EPA is responsible for the
        establishment of national ambient air quality standards. The EPA also regulates mobile emission
        sources that include automobiles, trucks, aircraft, and recreational vehicles.
     California Air Resources Board (CARB). The CARB is part of the California Environmental Protection
        Agency (CalEPA), and it is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the California Clean Air Act
        and the establishment of State ambient air quality standards. The CARB is also responsible for setting
        emission standards for vehicles sold in California and for other emission-sources including consumer
        goods and off-road equipment.
     South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD). Because Southern California
        experiences some of the worst air quality in the nation, the South Coast AQMD was created in 1977 with
        passage of the Lewis Air Quality Management Act. This Act merged four county air pollution control
        agencies into a single regional special district as a means to better address Southern California’s air
        pollution problems. The South Coast AQMD is now the principal agency responsible for comprehensive
        air pollution control in the region that includes air quality monitoring, the development of long range

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
          plans to improve air quality, and the enforcement of The Federal and State standards have been
          established at specified levels to ensure that human health is protected with an adequate margin of
          safety. For some criteria pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, there are also secondary standards
          designed to protect the environment and human health. Toxic air contaminants are typically measured
          at the source and their evaluation and control is generally site specific. Global warming and ozone-
          depleting gases are not monitored although sources of green house gas emissions are subject to Federal
          and regional policies that call for their eventual elimination.

    1. The significance of localized project impacts under CEQA depends on whether ambient CO levels in the vicinity of the
       project are above or below State and Federal CO standards. If ambient levels are below the standards, a project is
       considered to have a significant impact if project emissions result in exceeding of one or more of these standards. If
       ambient levels already exceed a State or Federal standard, project emissions are considered significant if they increase one
       hour CO concentrations by 1.0 parts per million (ppm) or more or eight hour CO concentrations by 0.45 ppm or more.
    2. Assessing odor impacts depends upon such variables as wind speed, wind direction, and the sensitivity of receptors to
       different odors. The American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM, Standard Method D 1391) has devised a method that
       considers how many times an air sample must be diluted with “clean” air before the odor is no longer detectable to an
       average adult with average odor sensitivity. The number of dilutions needed to reach this threshold level is referred to as
       a “dilution to threshold” (D/T) factor. An odor with a D/T of 2 (2 parts of fresh air to one part of odorous air) becomes
       faintly detectable to almost all receptors. At 5 D/T, people become consciously aware of the presence of an odor, and at 5
       to 10 D/T, the odor is strong enough to evoke registered complaints. The standard to utilize in assessing off-site odor
       exposure is preferably below 5 D/T and acceptable below 10 D/T.

8.3.4 AIR QUALITY EMISSIONS THRESHOLDS
In addition to the Federal and State ambient air quality standards, there are daily and quarterly emissions
thresholds related to the construction and subsequent operation of projects that are subject to the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The South Coast AQMD has recommended thresholds local governments
should use in their evaluation of development projects. The City of Compton uses the South Coast AQMD-
recommended thresholds in its local review of development projects over which the City has jurisdiction. A

development that results in either construction-related emissions or operational emissions that exceed specified
daily emissions thresholds are considered to have a significant and adverse environmental impact. Projects in
the SCAB generating construction-related emissions that exceed any of the following emissions thresholds are
considered to be significant under CEQA.
      75 pounds per day of reactive organic compounds;
      100 pounds per day of nitrogen dioxide;
      55o pounds per day of carbon monoxide;
      150 pounds per day of PM10;
      55 pounds per day of PM2.5; or,
      150 pounds per day of sulfur oxides.
The proposed project would have a significant effect on air quality if any of the following operational emissions
thresholds for criteria pollutants are exceeded:
      55 pounds per day of reactive organic compounds;
      55 pounds per day of nitrogen dioxide;
      550 pounds per day of carbon monoxide;
      150 pounds per day of PM10
      55 pounds per day of PM2.5; or,
      150 pounds per day of sulfur oxides.
Compton is located in a non-attainment area for PM10 and Ozone. Both the Federal and the State of California
Clean Air Acts require that every non-attainment area prepare an air quality management plan every three years
to identify ways local air quality may be returned to healthful levels. The South Coast AQMD is responsible for
the implementation of the protocols of the Federal Clean Air Act and for ensuring that the more stringent
California clean air standards are met.
Assembly Bill 32 established a deadline for the State of California to come into compliance with the provisions of
the Kyoto protocols. This bill requires that California reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% to 1990 levels
by the year 2020. To implement AB 32 the California Air Resources Board is required to draft a plan to reach
these goals, and in 2008, Senate bill 375 was passed to assist the CARB in reducing greenhouse gases by
providing for more sustainable communities through better land use planning. In addition, it gives the Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG) an expanded role in setting regional goals. The CARB will
develop regional greenhouse gas emission reduction targets to be achieved from the automobile and light truck
sectors for 2020 and 2035. SCAG is required to prepare a "sustainable communities strategy" to reduce the
amount of vehicle miles traveled in the region and demonstrate the ability for the region to attain the CARB's
targets.

              SECTION 9.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE NOISE ELEMENT
9.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
Since 1971, the Noise Element has been one of the mandatory elements of a California General Plan. As growth
patterns change, noise elements must adapt to enable cities to limit exposure of City residents to excessive and
potentially harmful noise levels. The development of effective strategies to reduce excessive noise is essential to
creating safe and compatible living and working environments. The State guidelines are also very specific as to the
content of noise elements. Government Code Section 65302(f) indicates that the noise element should be prepared
according to guidelines established by the State Department of Health Services. At a minimum, the Government
Code requires that the Noise Element analyze and project noise levels for the following:
     Highways and freeways;
     Primary arterials and major local streets;
     Passenger and freight railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems;
     Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport operations; aircraft over-flights, jet
        engine test stands, and all other ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport operations;
     Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad classification yards; and,
     Other stationary sources identified by local agencies as contributing to the community noise environment.
The State General Plan guidelines further indicate that noise exposure information should be used to develop the
Land Use Element in order to achieve noise-compatible land use patterns (Section 65302(f)). Because land use
patterns in Compton generally are well-established, the goals and policies focus on resolving existing noise
concerns.
9.1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
The Noise Element consists of the following sections:
     The Introduction to the Element provides an overview of the Element’s scope and content.
     The Noise Element Background Report discusses a wide range of noise control issues that must be
        considered in future planning and development in the City.
     The Noise Mitigation Plan identifies the City policies related to noise control along with those programs
        that will be effective in implementing the policies. This section also establishes how the City intends to
        integrate noise control with land use planning.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
               SECTION 9.2 NOISE ELEMENT BACKGROUND REPORT
This section of the Noise Element focuses on the community’s noise environment and includes a discussion of
noise, an overview of noise sources in the City of Compton, and the manner in which noise in the environment may
be controlled or eliminated. This background analysis considers the following:
      Characteristics of Noise and Noise Measurement provides an overview of noise and sound measurement
         techniques.
      Noise Standards indicates the commonly used standards in determining acceptable noise levels for a
         particular category of land use.
      Noise Control Regulations indicates those regulations and standards that are effective in mitigating noise
         impacts.
      Existing Ambient Noise Environment discusses the existing conditions in Compton relative to noise. The
         analysis includes the findings of the citywide noise measurement survey, traffic noise modeling, and the
         location and extent of noise sources and noise sensitive receptors.
9.2.1 CHARACTERISTICS OF NOISE AND NOISE MEASUREMENT
Noise is generally defined as unwanted sound. Sound is mechanical energy that is transmitted by pressure waves
through the air. Noise may be generated from a point source, such as a piece of construction equipment, or from a
line source such as a roadway (where the vehicle traffic is the noise source). Because the area of the sound wave
increases as the sound gets further and further from the source, less energy strikes any given point over the surface
area of the wave. Thus, with increasing distance from the noise source, the level of sound decreases and this effect
is referred to as spreading loss. Due to this spreading loss, noise decreases or attenuates with distance.
Objects that block the line-of-sight will further attenuate the noise if the receptor is located within the shadow of the
blockage (such as behind a sound wall). If a receptor is located behind the wall, but has a view of the source, the
wall or barrier will do little to attenuate the noise. Additionally, a receptor located on the same side of the wall as
the noise source may actually experience an increase in the perceived noise level because the wall can reflect noise
back to the receptor compounding the noise.
Noise levels are typically described using a number of methods that are designed to evaluate the loudness of a
particular noise. The most commonly used units employed for measuring sound levels include the decibel (dB), the
equivalent noise level (Leq), and the community noise equivalent level (CNEL). The decibel is, by far, the most
common measurement unit. The decibel measurement scale employs a numerical scale where zero represents the
lowest limit of sound that can be heard while injury to the eardrum could occur at levels in exceed of 140 dB.
Typical noise levels associated with various activities, and the effects, are noted in Exhibit 9-1.
The Leq is the average of the sound level energy for a one-hour period and employs an A-weighted decibel
correction that corresponds to those noise frequencies that are more sensitive to human hearing. Since the human
ear is not equally sensitive to all of the frequencies within the noise spectrum, noise measurements are weighted
more heavily towards those frequencies for which we are more sensitive using an A-weighting (referred to as dBA)
adjustment.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The human ear can detect changes in sound levels of approximately 3 dBA under normal ambient conditions,
though changes of less than 3 dBA are noticeable to some people under quiet conditions. Changes of less than 1
dBA are discernable by few people under controlled, extremely quiet conditions.
Certain receptors or land uses (such as residential uses) are more sensitive to unwanted noise during the evening
and at night. As a result, an artificial dB increment is added to quiet time noise levels in a 24-hour noise descriptor
called the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) or the day/night average noise level (Ldn). The CNEL
descriptor requires that an artificial increment of 5 dBA be added to the actual noise level for the hours from 7:00
p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and 10 dBA for the hours from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. to take into account a person’s increased
sensitivity to noise during these periods. The Ldn descriptor uses the same methodology except that there is no
artificial increment added to the hours between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. Both descriptors give roughly the same
24-hour level with the CNEL being only slightly more restrictive.
9.2.2 NOISE STANDARDS
The former State Office of Noise Control has prepared Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of Noise
Elements of General Plans that have subsequently been incorporated into the State’s General Plan Guidelines.
These noise guidelines indicate the compatibility of noise-sensitive land uses in areas subject to ambient noise
levels ranging between 55 CNEL and 80 CNEL.
      Residential uses are normally unacceptable in areas where the ambient noise levels exceed 70 dB CNEL;
          and residential uses are conditionally acceptable in areas where the ambient noise level ranges between 55-
          70 dB CNEL.
      Commercial/professional office buildings and land uses are normally unacceptable in areas where the
          ambient noise levels exceed 75 dB CNEL and are conditionally acceptable within areas where the ambient
          noise levels range from 67 to 78 dB CNEL (for commercial/professional offices only).
      Industrial uses are normally unacceptable in areas where the ambient noise levels exceed 80 dB CNEL and
          are conditionally acceptable in areas where the ambient noise level ranges between 65-75 dB CNEL.
      Institutional land uses are normally unacceptable in areas where the ambient noise levels exceed 75 dB
          CNEL and are conditionally acceptable within areas where the ambient noise levels range from 65 to 75 dB
          CNEL.
      Schools, libraries, hospitals, and nursing homes are treated as noise-sensitive land uses requiring acoustical
          studies within areas exceeding 60 dB CNEL.
9.2.3NOISE CONTROL REGULATIONS
The following Federal, State, and local regulations define acceptable noise limits and abatement of noise levels.
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Noise Control Act of 1972 authorized the EPA to publish
          descriptive data concerning the effects of noise and to establish levels of sound "requisite to protect the
          public welfare with an adequate margin of safety." These levels are separated into health (hearing loss
          levels) and welfare (annoyance levels), with an adequate margin of safety. In March 1974, the EPA
          published Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare
          With an Adequate Margin of Safety (EPA 550/9-74-004) that established that 55 CNEL as the requisite

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
         level with an adequate margin of safety for areas with outdoor uses including residential yard areas and
         other outdoor spaces used for recreation.
      Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The FHWA has adopted and published noise abatement
         criteria for highway construction projects. The FHWA noise abatement criterion established an exterior
         noise goal for residential land uses of 67 Leq and an interior goal for residences of 52 Leq. The noise
         abatement criterion applies to private yard areas and assumes that typical wood frame homes provide a
         10dB reduction with windows open and 20 dB a noise reduction with closed windows.
      Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD has adopted environmental criteria and
         standards for determining project acceptability and necessary mitigation measures to ensure that projects
         assisted by HUD provide a suitable living environment. Standards include maximum levels of 65 dB for
         residential areas.
      Workplace Exposure. The California Occupational Noise Control Standards contained in the California
         Code of Regulations, Title 8, Industrial Relations, Chapter 4, outline permissible noise exposure at a
         workplace. Employees should not be exposed to noise levels of 90 dBA for more than eight hours in any
         workday.
      California Vehicle Code. The California Motor Vehicle Code establishes noise standards for those areas not
         regulated by the federal government. State standards regulate the noise levels of motor vehicles and
         motorboats, establish noise impact boundaries around airports, regulate freeway noise affecting
         classrooms, regulate occupational noise control, and identify noise insulation standards. The California
         Motor Vehicle Code also sets operational noise limits according to the type of vehicle and date of
         manufacture.
      California Administrative Code. Sound transmission control standards contained in the California
         Administrative Code, Title 24, Building Standards, Chapter 2.35, outline noise insulation performance
         standards as a means to protect persons within new hotels, motels, apartment houses, and dwellings other
         than detached single-family dwellings. These standards require an interior noise level of 45 dB CNEL or
         less for residential projects. For residential buildings or structures within the 60 dB CNEL of an airport or
         vehicular or industrial noise source, an acoustical analysis should be conducted to show compliance with
         the standards.
      City of Compton Noise Control Ordinance. The City of Compton Municipal Code regulates noise levels in
         the City by referencing the Los Angeles County Noise Control Ordinance. The Code makes it unlawful for
         any person to make or cause any loud, unnecessary, and unusual noise which disturbs the peace or quiet of
         any neighborhood or which causes discomfort or annoyance to any reasonable person of normal
         sensitiveness residing in the area.
9.2.4 EXISTING AMBIENT NOISE ENVIRONMENT
Noise sources in Compton may be placed into five basic categories that include freeway noise (from the I-710, SR-
91, and the I-105 freeways), aircraft noise from both Compton Woodley Airport as well as aircraft over flights within
landing approaches to LAX, traffic on local streets, noise from railroad operations, and noise from stationary
sources. Each of these sources and their impacts on the noise environment of Compton are summarized below.
SECTION 9 – NOISE ELEMENT                                                                                  PAGE 181

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Freeway Noise. The I-710 freeway (the Long Beach Freeway) extends along the easterly City boundary in a
         north-to-south orientation. The SR-91 freeway (the Artesia Freeway) traverses the southernmost portion of
         the City in an east-to-west orientation. Finally, the I-105 freeway (the Century Freeway) is located to the
         north of the City. These freeways are the dominant source of noise in the area.
     Local Traffic Noise. Traffic noise on surface streets is also a significant source of noise within the City.
         Major roadways in the City that contribute to relatively high noise levels include Wilmington Avenue,
         Willowbrook Avenue, Tamarind Avenue, Alameda Street, Santa Fe Avenue, Long Beach Boulevard,
         Compton Boulevard, Alondra Boulevard, Greenleaf Boulevard, and Artesia Boulevard. Noise levels along
         these roadways are influenced by a number of variables including traffic volumes, the percentage of truck
         traffic, vehicle speeds, the time distribution of traffic, and gradient of the roadway. The highest level of
         traffic noise is found along the major arterial roadways that are handling relatively high traffic volumes
         with correspondingly high vehicle travel speeds.
     Railroads. The Alameda Corridor extends through the eastern half of the City and is located below grade,
         except for a small section south of Greenleaf Boulevard. The trench which became operational in 2002, has
         mitigated much of the noise in the central and northern part of the City. A second major source of mobile
         noise is the MTA Blue Line. The MTA trains operate in fifteen minute headways between 4:00 PM until
         12:00 AM (midnight), and every twenty minutes between midnight and 4:00 AM. The calculated exterior
         noise level associated with train operations is 47 dBA (CNEL), with a maximum of 80 dBA.
     Airports and Heliports. The Compton/Woodley Airport is located in the southwestern portion of the City.
         The Airport has several runways, the longest being a paved runway extending 3,670 feet. More than 200
         aircraft are based at the airport. Aircraft operations average 181 take-off and landings per day. The airport
         handles approximately 60,000 operations per year. The 65 CNEL contours extend approximately 2,000
         feet from the take-off and landing approaches as shown in Exhibit 7-2.
     Stationary Sources. The City of Compton has a large number of stationary noise sources located within its
         boundaries. These noise sources are typical of those found in an urban setting. Noises associated with
         industrial and commercial operations include truck traffic and machinery noise. The majority of these uses
         are located along the Artesia Freeway and the Alameda Corridor.
The existing noise environment in Compton was further characterized through noise measurement surveys and the
use of a computerized traffic noise prediction model, the California Department of Transportation (CALTRANs)
Traffic Noise Prediction Model, to estimate traffic noise along key roadways. The measurement locations were
selected on the basis of proximity to major noise sources and the noise sensitivity of the land use. Each site was
monitored for a minimum of fifteen minutes and the ambient noise levels were measured using dBA and CNEL
values and expressed in term of Percent Noise Levels or L%. In this way, noise levels recorded over the course of
the measurement period are expressed using percentages where the L90 is the noise level exceeded 90 percent of
the time, L50 is the level exceeded 50 percent, and L10 is the level exceeded ten percent of the time. The L90 level
generally was used to represent the background or ambient noise level, L50 represents the average noise levels, and
L10 represents the peak or intrusive noise levels. The noise levels shown in the Table 9-1 underscore the City's
relatively high ambient noise levels. This is largely due to traffic noise.

A second analysis provided data on the distance from the centerline of the street that specific noise levels are found.
The California Department of Transportation (CALTRANs) Traffic Noise Prediction Model was used to calculate
the noise level for a particular reference set of conditions (such as existing traffic volumes, roadway grade, vehicle
speeds, number of travel lanes, etc). Noise levels (in CNEL) were expressed using noise contours representing a
line along which the ambient traffic noise levels were equal (the use of noise contours in this fashion are similar to
how weather maps depict common temperatures or topographic maps show areas of equal elevation). For purposes
of this analysis, noise level contours for the 70 CNEL, 65 CNEL, and 60 CNEL were calculated.

The noise model computed the distance of the specific noise contour from the roadway centerline. For example, in
Table 9-2 the 65 CNEL contour for the Alondra Boulevard corridor was found to be 110 feet on both sides of the
roadway. This figure indicated that all of the properties and land between the contour line and the roadway

centerline would be exposed to noise levels of at least 65 CNEL. However, the actual distances to these contours
could be considerably less than predicted where intervening structures break the line-of-sight to the roadway.

principles to provide more multi-modal access to the workplace as well as local retail, educational, and
recreational uses in order to reduce automobile traffic and its noise as well as increase the quality of life.
9.3.2 NOISE MITIGATION GOALS AND POLICIES
The goals and policies of the Noise Element were developed in response to issues identified in the technical
background report and on issues and opportunities identified in the community workshops that were
conducted as part of a comprehensive outreach program.
NOISE ISSUE - NOISE FROM MOBILE SOURCES
Noise may be generated from a point source, such as a vehicle engine or from a line source such as a
roadway (where the vehicle traffic is the noise source). These sources include the I-710 freeway, the SR-91
freeway, the I-105 freeway, the Compton/Woodley Airport, the Alameda Corridor, the MTA Blue Line, and
city roadways. In those areas where transportation noise represents a threat to the public health and
welfare, the City will reduce noise hazards to safe levels. In those areas where transportation noise
degrades the environment, but not to an extent that represents an immediate hazard to public health and
welfare, the City will reduce environmental degradation as much as feasibly possible within the limits
imposed by conflicting objectives.
Noise Goal 1. Enforce transportation-related noise regulations.
      Noise Policy 1.1. The City of Compton will ensure that new transportation equipment purchased
        by the City will comply with noise performance standards.
      Noise Policy 1.2. The City of Compton will require the measurement and mitigation of noise
        impacts of all new or remodeled transportation and circulation infrastructure projects.
        Mitigation may entail redesigning the architecture or circulation patterns.
      Noise Policy 1.3 The City of Compton will impose traffic restrictions to reduce transportation
        noise, when no other option is available.
NOISE ISSUE - NOISE AND LAND USE COMPATIBILITY
Noise and land use incompatibilities can be avoided for new developments when noise is properly
considered in the planning, design, and permitting of a project. The City will work to prevent future
land use and noise conflicts through the planning and approval process.
Noise Goal 2. Incorporate noise considerations into land use planning decisions.
      Noise Policy 2.1. The City of Compton will require noise studies for new development projects
        and expansion of existing developments that will result in construction of projects that are
        10,000 square feet or more. of building or structure area or fifteen units or more to measure and
SECTION 9 – NOISE ELEMENT                                                                                 PAGE 186

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
        propose mitigation measures for noise impacts on the nearby community, especially on existing
        noise-sensitive land uses.
     Noise Policy 2.2. The City of Compton will review the site plan, building orientation, design, and
        interior layout of proposals for new development in noisy environments for solutions that lessen
        noise intrusion to the exterior and interior of the project.
     Noise Policy 2.3. The City of Compton will require that mixed-use structures provide sufficient
        noise and vibration mitigation for the residential uses through noise-reducing design and
        materials.
NOISE ISSUE - NOISE FROM STATIONARY SOURCES
When non-transportation noise sources generate excessive levels of noise representing a threat to the
public health and welfare, the City will mitigate those noise hazards to safe levels when non-
transportation noise sources degrade the environment.
Noise Goal 3. Control non-transportation noise impacts.
     Noise Policy 3.1. The City of Compton will enforce the State standard of 65 dbA for exterior
        noise levels for all commercial and residential land uses.
     Noise Policy 3.2. The City of Compton will establish regulations limiting noise levels from
        lawn blowers, trimmers, machinery, or other disturbances in residential zones.
     Noise Policy 3.3. The City of Compton will require sound attenuation devices on all
        exterior mechanical and construction equipment.
9.3.3 NOISE CONTROL PROGRAMS
There are a number of programs that will be effective in implementing City policy relative to noise control
and abatement. These programs are summarized below.
     City of Compton Municipal Code. The Municipal Code regulates noise levels in the City by
        referencing the Los Angeles County Noise Control Ordinance. The Code makes it unlawful for any
        person to make or cause any loud, unnecessary, and unusual noise which disturbs the peace or
        quiet of any neighborhood or which causes discomfort or annoyance to any reasonable person of
        normal sensitiveness residing in the area. The standard that may be referred to in determining
        whether a violation exists may include, but not be limited to the following: the level of noise;
        whether the nature of the noise is usual or unusual; the level and intensity of any background
        noise; the proximity of the noise to residential sleeping facilities; the nature and zoning of the area
        within which the noise emanates; the time of the day or night the noise occurs; the duration of the
        noise; and whether the noise is recurrent, intermittent, or constant.
     Code Enforcement. The Municipal Law Enforcement Services Code Enforcement officers are
        responsible for enforcement of the City’s noise control ordinance. For this reason, ongoing code
        enforcement efforts are an important implementation program within this element.
     Environmental Review. The City shall continue to evaluate the environmental impacts of new
        development and provide mitigation measures prior to development approval, as required by the
SECTION 9 – NOISE ELEMENT                                                                                PAGE 187

 CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
       California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA)
       where applicable. Environmental review shall be provided for major projects including those
       projects that will have a potential adverse impact on the environment. The State of California
       Recommended Land Use Compatibility Standards will be used as a guide for impact due to noise.
       (See Exhibit 7-3) Issue areas related to noise that may be addressed in the environmental
       analysis include: impact to ambient noise level, impact of construction noise, and mitigation
       measures. In compliance with CEQA and NEPA, the City shall also assign responsibilities for the
       verification of the implementation of mitigation measures.
    Building Code Review. The City of Compton will review, and if necessary, modify the City’s
       Building Code (Los Angeles County) to reflect current technology and regulations regarding noise
       attenuation. Procedures for the periodic review of the Building Code will be identified by the
       Building and Safety Director. Review will be undertaken by designated individuals to identify
       appropriate changes that should be considered. Following this review, amendments to the City’s
       Building Code will be made, as required.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
               SECTION 10.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
10.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
The Health Element of the Compton General Plan is a new section that has been added to the 2010 update
of the General Plan, and it is intended to address public health challenges and opportunities in the City of
Compton. This element embodies the vision and establishes policies that Compton will be a Healthy City
that provides a safe and healthy lifestyle for all Compton stakeholders (including resident, business, and
visitors to the City).
The Health Element will identify systemic problems that prevent Compton stakeholders from enjoying a
health and prosperous life with a direct impact on their personal well-being. Potential remedies are listed
as General Plan policies in this chapter and these policies correlate with many General Plan elements,
including the Land Use; Circulation; Open Space, Conservation and Recreation; and Public Safety. To
create a relationship between elements, the policies identified in this chapter that pertain to another
element will also be listed under that element.
10.1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
The Health Element consists of the following sections:
      Section 10.1 Introduction to the Element provides an overview of the Element’s scope and content.
      Section 10.2 Health Element Background Report discusses a range of public health conditions that
         must be considered with regards to future planning and development in the City.
      Section 10.3 Health Plan identifies the City’s goals & policies to improve health and quality and
         strategies that will be needed to implement these policies. This section also discusses Health
         Standards that will be used to monitor the effectiveness of the policies.
       SECTION 10.2 HEALTH ELEMENT BACKGROUND REPORT
The Health Element Background Report provides a detailed overview of the existing conditions in
Compton with respect to public health conditions. This background information is the basis for the Health
Element of the City of Compton’s General Plan. The data used in the background report is based on health
surveys and research prepared by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (DPH). DPH
tracks health-related data based on two geographic structures: Health Districts and Service Planning
Areas. Health-related data tracked by DPH is typically sampled based on larger population sizes. Due to
limits on the geographic level of data available from DPH, health data covering just the City of Compton is
not available. Data only includes residents that are surveyed or tracked by DPH, not all stakeholders. This
report instead relies on data provided for DPH Service Planning Area Six which includes the City of
Compton and the Compton Health District. These areas are defined below in Exhibit 10-1.
SECTION 10 – HEALTH ELEMENT                                                                          PAGE 191

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Health District: A Health District is defined as a division of the County by Census Tracts used for
         planning local health needs. Compton is located in the Compton Health District, which includes
         the City of Compton, along with unincorporated East Compton, West Compton, and Willowbrook
         (all areas in the City’s Sphere of Influence) and portions of the Cities of Lynwood and Paramount.
         Many of the statistics in this element are provided at the Health District level and much of the
         research and data extracted by DPH at this level would not be statistically significant at the City
         level due to sample size. DPH is not able to remove the portions of Lynwood and Paramount from
         this data set, thus this element reports data for the entire Health District. However, the City of
         Compton is the dominant population center within the District and represents the general
         characteristics of the population of the entire district.
     Service Planning Area: Aggregations of Health Districts are made to form Service Planning Areas
         (or SPAs). The Compton Health District is located in SPA 6, which includes City of Compton,
         portions of Lynwood and Paramount and most of the City of Los Angeles south of Interstate 10
         (including the Crenshaw, Hyde Park, Jefferson and Athens neighborhoods) as well as areas of
         unincorporated Los Angeles County (including the Florence and Willowbrook communities).
10.2.1 PUBLIC HEALTH AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT
Within this section, information on the context of the public health and physical (built) environment
conditions in Compton is provided. Compton is known as the Hub City because it is centrally located in
the Los Angeles basin. However, the City’s location also places Compton squarely in the center of an area
where residents experience significant inequality in health conditions and the physical condition of the
built environment. To set the context for this discussion, this section will review of the ability of Compton
residents to access health services and provide an insight to the socio-economic realities of Compton
stakeholders. The following sections will cover these topics with greater detail.
Regarding economic inequities, or the disparity in income available to different individuals, the
community of Compton is faced with a number of hardships not present in other parts of the County. One
example is seen in poverty level data based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for
the period 2006 to 2008, which identified 24% of Compton residents living in Poverty in contrast to 15% of
Los Angeles County residents. The situation is even starker for children – based on American Community
Survey data for the period between 2006 and 2008, 34% of children in the City of Compton were living in
poverty compared with only 22% in Los Angeles County. The American Community Survey uses the U.S.
Census Bureau Thresholds of Poverty which in 2008 ranged from $10,991 for a single person to $44,346
for a family of nine or more individuals that includes eight or more children (based on weighted average
thresholds). This federal definition is generally accepted by researchers as being a floor and a much higher
income level is typically used by government agencies to denote low-income individuals. Thus, the number
of stakeholders residing in Compton who have significant economic needs is even greater than the 24%
identified by Census data.
Income inequity in Compton has a major impact on access to health care. Insurance data for the Compton
Health District shows that fewer residents have no insurance than the countywide access (17% of Compton
Health District residents vs. 22% of Los Angeles County residents) which is a function of having more
residents on public insurance program than the County as a whole (34% of Compton Health District vs.
17% of Los Angeles County). However, Compton Health District residents are more likely to not be able to
afford the prescriptions, with 22% of Compton residents report they are unable to afford needed
SECTION 10 – HEALTH ELEMENT                                                                             PAGE 193

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
prescriptions as compared to 12% of Los Angeles County residents. This has a major impact on residents
who are suffering from chronic diseases who need to medications to maintain their health.
The built environment of a city has a strong impact on the physical health and well-being of its residents.
One example of the interplay between the physical environment and health can be seen in air quality. The
jobs, schools, and housing are located in a sprawling format across the Los Angeles area. This results in the
need for many to drive to their destination instead of walking, biking, or taking public transit. High levels
of emissions generated by the vehicle trips (along with the factories in the region) and these emissions are
trapped by the mountains surrounding the Los Angeles basin. The result is that the air quality in the Los
Angeles Metropolitan Area consistently rating as among the worst in the Nation.
The 2010 State of the Air report produced by the American Lung Association using U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) data indicates that the South Coast Air Basin, which includes Compton and Los
Angeles County, has the highest level of Ozone (O3) pollution and the third-highest level of year round
particulate matter pollution in the United States. The California standard for exposure to PM-10
(particulate matter of 10 microns in diameter or less) was not met during 47% of the days of the year. i As
noted earlier in the General Plan, Compton is bisected by the Alameda Corridor freight railroad and is
surrounded by four major freeways (Interstates 105, 110, 710, and State Route 91) with a fifth freeway
(Interstate 405) located close to the city border. Two of these freeways pass through the City’s boundaries
(I-710 and SR-91). The city’s location in relation to rail and highway networks that serve the Ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach also results in more localized air pollution from trains, trucks and automobiles
traveling the major transportation networks to industrial areas in the City of Compton and adjacent
communities. The close proximity of Compton residents and businesses to these facilities and the resulting
health affects, including asthma from air pollution, is an illustration of the need to examine and address
health inequities from the physical environment of the City.
10.2.2 PUBLIC HEALTH STATISTICS FOR COMPTON
This section provides an overview of health statistics for the greater Compton area, and it provides a
comparison with data from Los Angeles County in order to illustrate the extent of the health issues faced
by City residents. First, definitions are given for chronic diseases and causes of death. Each definition
includes an analysis of the impact of chronic diseases on Compton residents (data is only available for
residents, not all stakeholders). Next, overall life expectancy for residents of the Compton area is provided
a comparison to Los Angeles County. Finally, this section will examine mortality data for the Compton and
Los Angeles County using two timeframes: single year data based on Year 2007 (the most recent single
year for which data is available) and comparative data from the ten year period of 1998 to 2007.
Residents of Compton and Los Angeles County are afflicted with a range of Chronic Diseases that include
Asthma; Alcoholism; Cancer; Coronary Heart Disease; Diabetes; HIV; Hypertension; Liver Disease;
Obesity; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; and Stroke. Specific Chronic Diseases and their impacts on City of
Compton Residents are summarized below:
     Alcohol-related diseases. These are diseases linked to the over consumption of alcohol. Based on
         CDC data, African Americans and Latinos are twice as likely as whites to be affected by alcohol-
         related disease. Based on the Los Angeles County Health Survey, the number of residents who
         reported chronic drinking in the Compton Health District (4%) was about the same as the
         countywide average of 4.3%.
SECTION 10 – HEALTH ELEMENT                                                                            PAGE 194

 CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
    Asthma. As defined by the CDC, Asthma is a disease that affects the lungs. It is one of the most
       common long-term diseases of children, but adults have asthma, too. Asthma causes repeated
       episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and nighttime or early morning coughing.
       Exposure to high levels of air pollution is a risk factor for triggering Asthma attacks. In SPA 6,
       7.2% of adults (18+ years old) who were diagnosed with Asthma reported they still had Asthma in
       2005 (the most recent year data was available) or had an attack in the past 12 months. This
       compares unfavorably with health survey data indicating 6.5% of Los Angeles County adults with
       the same conditions. Data for the Compton Health District was not available as it was not
       statistically significant for use in policy discussions.
    Cancer. Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells in an organ divide without control, and can
       invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems.
       Breast Cancer is one of the leading causes of premature death for women in Los Angeles County
       and it is the leading cause of death for Black and Hispanic/Latino women aged 25 to 44 years. In
       SPA 6, the mortality rate in 2007 was 24 per 100,000 population, compared to the Los Angeles
       Countywide mortality rate of 22 per 100,000 population. The mortality rate is decreasing which is
       a positive trend – in 1998 the death rate in SPA 6 was 32 per 100,000 population. Colorectal
       Cancer is the eighth leading cause of death in Los Angeles County, and is the twelfth leading cause
       of premature death. Although this is a leading cause of premature death for Asian/Pacific
       Islanders, the mortality rate countywide for Black Males at 22 per 100,000 is the highest of any
       ethnic group in the County. The mortality rate in SPA 6 in 2007 was 16 per 100,000, which is
       slightly higher than the Los Angeles County of 14 per 100,000. Lung Cancer was the third-leading
       cause of deaths in the Compton Health District and Los Angeles County as a whole in 2007.
       However, Lung Cancer was the fifth-leading cause of premature death in the Compton Health
       District compared to the seventh leading cause of premature death in Los Angeles County.
    Coronary Heart Disease. Coronary Heart Disease is a condition in which the flow of blood to the
       heart muscle is reduced. When coronary arteries become blocked or clogged by cholesterol and fat
       deposits, they cannot supply enough oxygen-carrying blood to the heart, resulting in Coronary
       Heart Disease. This condition is the number one cause of death in the Compton Health District
       and Los Angeles County as a whole. However, Coronary Heart Disease ranks second as a cause for
       premature deaths in the Compton Health District as compared to the Los Angeles County where it
       is the leading cause of premature death.
    Emphysema/ Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Emphysema/COPD are conditions
       that interfere with the normal flow of air in and out of the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.
       Emphysema is the most common form of COPD. Emphysema is a lung disease that involves
       damage to the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The air sacs are unable to completely deflate, making
       them unable to fill with fresh air and ensure adequate oxygen supply to the body. Emphysema is
       closely associated with lung cancer and exposure to high levels of air pollution increases one’s risk
       of death from Emphysema/COPD.
    Diabetes. Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce, properly use, or is partially
       resistant to the effects of insulin. Insulin is a hormone necessary to convert sugar, starches, and
       other food into energy needed for daily life. Insulin takes sugar from the blood into the cells. The
       percentage of adults 18 and over in the Compton Health District who have been diagnosed with
       Diabetes has doubled over the ten year period from 6% in 1997 to 12.4% in 2007. The rapid
SECTION 10 – HEALTH ELEMENT                                                                          PAGE 195

 CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
       growth in this chronic ailment in the Compton Health District indicates a need for preventative
       measures
    Hypertension. Hypertension is the condition of having High Blood Pressure, which is defined as
       having a mean systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg and mean diastolic blood pressure
       is greater than 90 mm Hg. In the Compton Health District, 32% of individuals 18 and older have
       been diagnosed with Hypertension as compared to 25% of Los Angeles County as a whole.
    HIV. Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV is not a leading cause of death but is a major cause
       of premature death in the County – it is the second leading cause of death for black males aged 25
       to 44 years. HIV is the cause of a high amount of deaths in SPA 6. Rates have declined but range
       from a high in 1999 of 12 deaths per 100,000 persons – double the Los Angeles County average of
       6 deaths per 100,000 persons to 9 deaths per 100,000 persons in 2007- more than double the Los
       Angeles County average rate of 3.9 deaths per 100,000 persons. HIV diagnosis data specific to the
       City of Compton or the Compton Health District was not available.
    Liver Disease. Another chronic ailment that disproportionately affects residents of SPA 6 is Liver
       Disease. Like HIV, this is not a leading cause of death throughout the SPA 6 but an important
       cause of premature death throughout the County where more people died from Liver Disease
       (1,133) in 2007 than from Homicide (869). Liver Disease is the second leading countywide cause
       of death for Hispanic men, who have the highest mortality rate of any ethnic group in the County
       at 30 per 100,000 persons. The SPA 6 mortality rate in 2007 was 16 per 100,000 persons, which
       was significantly higher than the Los Angeles countywide mortality rate of 11.6 per 100,000
       persons.
    Obesity in Adults and Children. The increase in adults and children who are overweight or obese
       as identified by Body Mass Index is an affliction that cuts across geographic regions across Los
       Angeles County and the nation. While 58% of adults countywide are overweight or obese, the rate
       in SPA 6 is 73%. This increase is also affecting the youth of Compton – in SPA 6 about 29% of
       children are obese, exceeding the countywide average of 23% and the highest average in the
       County. Reducing the number of individuals in these categories is of prime concern to the City.
    Stroke. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted and
       part of the brain cannot get the blood and oxygen it needs. Without oxygen, nerve cells in the
       affected part of the brain usually die within minutes, resulting in the loss of cognitive abilities
       controlled by that part of the brain. Strokes continue to be a major cause of death in the Compton
       Health District and Los Angeles County, with Strokes ranking as the number 2 cause of death in
       the Compton Health District and the County as a whole. Blacks (at 62 per 100,000) have the
       highest mortality rate of any ethnic group in the County for this ailment. In SPA 6, the 2007
       mortality rate of 55 per 100,000 were almost double the countywide rate of 36 per 100,000.
    Sexually Transmitted Diseases. Diseases that are transmitted through sexual activity are known
       as Sexually Transmitted Diseases. This incorporates a broad range of ailments including
       Chlamydia; Gonorrhea; Syphilis; and Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.
SECTION 10 – HEALTH ELEMENT                                                                         PAGE 196

DPH provided trend data from the 1998 to 2007 period and in this period the #1 cause of premature death
and #1 cause of death is Coronary Heart Disease – across Los Angeles County and in SPA 6. While
Coronary Heart Disease is the #1 cause of death in the Compton Health District, Homicide is the #1 cause
of premature death in the District. Many of the risk factors for this ailment are preventable or can be
reduced by individual activities, including tobacco smoking; high cholesterol; high blood pressure; obesity;
and, excessive alcoholic consumption.
Overall, the trend in LA County and SPA 6 was positive and death rates dropped consistently between 1999
and 2007. While the County death rate dropped below the County’s 2010 goal of 162 per 100,000 persons
to 150 per 100,000 persons in 2007, in SPA 6 the rate stayed above this level at 192 per 100,000 persons
and resulted in the highest rate of deaths compared to other SPAs in Los Angeles County
Prevention activities identified by DPH to reduce the likelihood of Coronary Heart Disease include the
promotion of physical activities (this will be discussed further in the Built Environment section); smoking
restrictions; and increasing the availability of nutritious foods which have vitamins, minerals, fibers &
lower in calories. DPH data has shown a decline in the death rates in the Compton Health District from
Coronary Heart Disease and other chronic illnesses over the last ten years. This tracks favorably with
declines seen in other health districts in the County. However, these declines have not closed the long-
standing gap between health conditions in Compton and other areas of Los Angeles County.
10.2.3 BUILT ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF COMPTON
It is becoming clearer to public health and planning professionals that the design of a physical
environment of a community can play a significant role in determining if residents and businesses will
experience a healthy lifestyle in a community. Researchers from organizations such as the Centers for
Disease Control and the America are conducting research to identify how to change the way physical
environment are constructed to create a healthier lifestyle. Most residents and business owners would
agree that having a diverse mix of land uses, including recreation spaces makes a city more attractive,
inviting, and livable. These are all characteristics that Compton can possess with a vision, a well-developed
plan, and a process for bringing the community together to implement this vision. The following section
will review current conditions for a number of different community characteristics.
PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
The built environment of the City of Compton can be characterized as a lower density residential and
industrial city, with Single Family Residential neighborhoods comprising the plurality of the City’s land use
covering 46% of the city’s developed land area (excluding transportation facilities). The built environment
in Compton is typical of South Los Angeles County cities which are characterized by large-lot residential
areas with commercial retail facilities located along corridors and in large regional shopping centers.
Compton also has a sizable industrial sector, with large portions of the eastern and northern portions of
the City dedicated to these uses. This leaves little room for parks and recreation facilities, with K-12
schools comprising the largest single open space land use in the City. The low density, almost entirely
built-out environment of Compton combined with predominance of the automobile as a primary means of
travel over the last fifty years has led to an urban environment that is challenging to navigate for those who
by necessity or convenience would want to walk to a local store, school, or place of business. The design of
the physical environment is a major determinant in transportation choice and trips made by automobile or
truck are a major generator of air pollution in Compton and the greater Southern California region.
SECTION 10 – HEALTH ELEMENT                                                                             PAGE 197

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
As noted in the section above, the Compton area has higher than average rates of residents who are
overweight and obese. Reducing these rates will help to reduce chronic diseases that are influenced by
unhealthy weight including Coronary Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Stroke. Increasing physical activity is a
way to prevent and reverse the conditions of obesity and reduce weight for overweight individuals. One of
the major impediments to increasing physical activity is the lack of safe outdoor spaces to conduct physical
exercise. While most Compton neighborhoods have sidewalks, and Compton does have an extensive trail
along Compton Creek, some areas of the city lack adequate facilities for outdoor activity. In some areas,
personal safety is an issue that restricts outdoor activity. Many streets in the Industrial areas and Richland
Farms neighborhood do not have sidewalks or pedestrian paths to provide for safe pedestrian access away
from motor vehicle traffic. It should be noted that in Richland Farms, the lack of sidewalks maintains a
community aesthetic that dates back to the agrarian roots of Compton. Establishing safe pedestrian
pathways in this community will require landscape design elements that preserve the look and feel of the
community while creating a safe space for all users of roadways, including bicyclists, pedestrians,
equestrians (for off-street trails), cars, trucks, and buses. For example, paths with permeable pavers may
be preferable to concrete sidewalks in the Richland Farms area.
PERSONAL SAFETY
Personal safety has been considered by Public Health practitioners as a physical environment and in terms
of violence prevention, a public health issue. One example of this recognition is the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Health Injury & Violence Prevention program that works to reduce the incidence of
violent crimes and the resulting costs in terms of health care and human lives. Recent data from
community surveys prepared by DPH show that in SPA 6 only 57% of adults believe their neighborhood is
safe from crime. This is much lower than the countywide average of 87% and reflects both a perception
and a reality of higher crime rates than other parts of the region. Changing the perception and the reality
of personal safety will have a positive impact in encouraging healthier lifestyle changes such as walking and
bicycling to destinations within the City and increasing economic development in Compton.
PARK FACILITIES
As noted in the Parks and Recreation chapter, the amount of parks available to City residents – currently
60 acres for the nearly 100,000 residents, is much less than the 500 acres for 100,000 residents
recommended by the National Parks & Recreation Association. This results in a very large deficit (over
440 acres) in park facilities in the City. While it may be unrealistic to expect to fully meet this deficit in the
timeframe of this General Plan, the City should continue to strive to identify creative ways to close the park
gap and provide innovative opportunities for residents and workers to enjoy safe, well-maintained outdoor
recreation space for themselves and their families.
The City is taking steps to improve recreational facilities, including establishing pocket parks;
implementing the Compton Creek Regional Garden Park Master Plan, and developing the Greenleaf
Corridor Improvement Project to establish a regional parkway within the Southern California Edison right-
of-way adjacent to Greenleaf Boulevard.
HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS
More city, state, and national governments are recognizing the issues of Food Security and the need to
provide Health Food Options. The World Health Organization defines Food Security as “when all people at
all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life”. Applying this
SECTION 10 – HEALTH ELEMENT                                                                                PAGE 198

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
definition to food resources in the City of Compton brings forth some of the challenges that residents have
to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
The City has a limited number of full-service grocery stores, primarily located in the urban core near the
historic downtown area (Ralphs, Superior Groceries), or in locations across the City (Food 4 Less; Fresh &
Easy Neighborhood Market), or about four full-service grocery stores for approximately 100,000 residents.
A typical rule of thumb is one full-service grocery store per 10,000 to 15,000 residents, in which the City is
currently under-stored by this measure. There are also a number of independently-owned markets that
provide grocery merchandise throughout the City. However, only 28% of residents of SPA 6, which
includes Compton, feel that the quality of fresh fruits and vegetables where they shop is high. One
alternative to provide higher quality fruits and vegetables is to patronize a farmer’s market. There is
currently no farmer’s market in Compton – the nearest markets are three to four miles away in Los Angeles
(the closest location is at MudTown Farms in Watts) and the Cities of Gardena, South Gate, and Torrance.
Compton is underserved in this sector and the nearly 100,000 residents of the City represent an untapped
market for farmers providing direct to consumer sales of fresh fruits and vegetables.
HEALTH FACILITIES
Compton has a small number of medical facilities located within the incorporated area. The Dollarhide
Medical Clinic, operated by the Los Angeles County Health Services Department is the primary public
medical care facility in the city. There are a number of non-profit health clinics that serve Compton,
including the St. Francis Medical Center Compton Community Clinic, St. John's Well Child and Family
Center, and Compton Central Health Clinic. In addition, there are a number of physicians, nurses,
optometrists, and other medical professionals in private practice in the City.
There are currently no inpatient hospital facilities or Emergency Medical Care Facility in the Compton
Planning Area, as illustrated in Exhibit 8-8. Nearby hospitals with emergency care facilities include
the St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood; Memorial Hospital in Gardena; and the Kaiser Permanente
Hospital in Downey, with the closest hospital being St. Francis in Lynwood. The Los Angeles County
Health Services Department operates the Martin Luther King Jr. Multi-Service Ambulatory Health Center
in unincorporated Willowbrook, just north of the Compton city limit. This facility was a general teaching
hospital jointly operated by the County and Charles H. Drew University that closed in 2007. The County
and the University of California approved plans in 2010 to reopen and jointly operate the facility as a 120-
bed general teaching hospital starting in 2013. The reopening of Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital will bring
a desperately needed full service medical center with an emergency medical care facility to the Compton
planning area.
PHYSICAL EXERCISE
One of the key determinants of physical health involves the amount of physical exercise that a person
undertakes as part of their daily routine. The physical environment that one lives in can have a significant
determination on whether or not there is an adequate opportunity to engage in levels of physical activity
sufficient for a health lifestyle. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that
adults undertake at least 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (i.e.,
brisk walking) every week (or a mix of aerobic activity and muscle-strengthening exercises). Physical
conditions in Compton and many other communities in South Los Angeles County are an impediment to
individuals to meet this guideline. These physical conditions include a lack of park and recreational space
commensurate with the population of the City, limited cycling and walking routes that are protected from
SECTION 10 – HEALTH ELEMENT                                                                           PAGE 199

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
vehicle traffic, and the perception or reality of feeling unsafe while conducting physical activity outside in
the community. Despite these impediments, gains are being made in provisioning additional facilities in
Compton to provide safe and accessible areas for physical activity. This includes the expansion of the
Compton Creek pathway and other outdoor physical activity areas in the planning stages.
COMMUNITY WELL-BEING
In addition to life expectancy mentioned earlier in this section, another key indicator of community health
is the well-being of a community. Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines well-being as “the state of being
happy, healthy, or prosperous”. Using this definition as a lens by which to view the City of Compton
provides a way to illuminate the current conditions identified in this section and create a frame for
measuring changes to the City. Creating a City of Compton that enhances the well-being of residents will
be a key outcome of implementing the goals and policies outlined in the next section of the Health
Element.
                             SECTION 10.3 HEALTH PLAN
10.3.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE PLAN
The Health Plan identifies the City’s goals for 2010 through 2030 related to the development and
maintenance of a Healthy City of Compton and sets the policies and programs for achieving these goals.
The plan also establishes Standards for each issue area critical to maintaining a Healthy City.
The City of Compton’s motto is “Birthing a New Compton”. The City’s vision for a Healthy Compton is to
utilize Smart Growth principles to foster a healthy and safer city by developing with pedestrian-friendly
residential and commercial districts that provide opportunities for residents and workers to have improved
health outcomes.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
HEALTH ISSUE – INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FACILITIES
Restoring direct access to Health Care and Emergency Care Facilities is critical to the health and well-being
of the residents and workers of the City of Compton. The re-opening of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Hospital in Willowbrook will provide improved access to health care and emergency care facilities for
Compton residents. The goal and policies below will support this re-opening and other improvements to
health care facilities in Compton.
    Health Goal 6. Provide access to high quality medical and emergency care facilities for residents,
    businesses and visitors to the City of Compton.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
                  SECTION 11.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE ELEMENT
11.1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE ELEMENT
The Housing Element establishes City policy as it applies to housing and is applicable to the 2006-2014
planning period as established by the State legislature. As indicated in the Introduction to the General Plan,
the Housing Element is one of the seven State-mandated elements. The Housing Element outlines strategies
and programs that focus on the following:
     Rehabilitation of substandard housing units;
     Conservation of the existing housing stock;
     Identification of new housing opportunities; and,
     Maintenance of affordable housing units.
The State Legislature recognizes the role of local general plans, and particularly the Housing Element, in
implementing statewide housing goals to provide decent and sound housing for all persons. Furthermore, the
Legislature stresses continuing efforts toward providing affordable housing for all income groups. The major
concerns of the Legislature regarding housing elements are:
     Recognition by local governments of their responsibility in contributing to the attainment of State
        housing goals.
     Preparation and implementation of the City’s Housing Element which coordinates with State and Federal
        efforts in achieving State housing goals.
     Participation by local jurisdictions in efforts required to attain State housing goals.
     Cooperation between local governments to address regional housing needs.
These concerns can be summed up with the idea of “regional fair share.” Every city and county in the State of
California has a legal obligation to respond to its fair share of the projected future housing needs in the region in
which it is located. For the City of Compton, the regional housing need is determined by the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG), and is based upon an overall regional housing need goal established by the
State.
The Housing Element must identify strategies, programs, and potential development sites that will enable
Compton to meet its assigned Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) requirements. For the 2006-2014
planning period, the City’s RHNA requirement includes the following:
     Extremely Low Income -         8 units
     Very Low Income -              8 units
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                              PAGE 207

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
      Low Income -                          10 units
      Moderate Income7 -                    13 units
      Above Moderate Income - 30 units
The City of Compton has a RHNA goal of 69 units during the current planning period. A substantial amount of
new housing has been contructed, entitled, or is in the planning process. Approximately 446 units have been
constructed or approved. This includes the newly developed Season’s At Compton, an 84-unit low-income Senior
Housing Development for physically disabled seniors. The City provided gap financing assistance to META
Housing Development Corporation to ensure feasibility of the development. Construction was completed on the
development in 2011. Willow Walk Townhouse Phase I was completed in 2008 and phase II was completed in
2011. It consists of 128 units, 33 units were marketed to first time homebuyers, 12 qualifying as low income
households and 21 as moderate income households and the remaining 95 were sold at market-rate.
  Housing Definitions: Income Limits
  Median Household Income: The middle point at which half of the City's households earn more
  and half earn less.
  Income limits as defined by California Housing Element law are:
     Very Low Income Households: Households earning less than 50% of the median
         household income
     Low Income Households: Households earning 50-80% of the median house hold income
     Lower Income Households: Households earning less than 80% of the median income for
         a family of four.
     Moderate Income Households: Households earning 80-120% of the median income
     Above Moderate Income Households: Households earning over 120% of the median
         house hold income
  The most recent HCD income limits can be accessed online at http://www.hcd.ca.gov.
11.1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE ELEMENT
The Housing Element consists of the following sections:
      Introduction to the Element, provides an overview of the Element’s scope and content.
      Housing Element Background Report, discusses a wide range of existing characteristics and conditions
          in the City of Compton that affect the demand, availability, affordability, and development of housing.
          This section also identifies the progress Compton made in achieving its quantified housing goals and
          identifies whether previous goals and policies will carry forward into the next Housing Element.
      Housing Plan, identifies the City policies related to housing issues along with those programs that will be
          effective in implementing the policies.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
11.1.3 RELATIONSHIP OF THE ELEMENT TO THE GENERAL PLAN
The Compton General Plan serves as the blueprint for planning and development in the City and indicates the
community’s vision for the future. This long-range planning document describes goals, policies, and programs to
guide decision-making. Once the general plan is adopted, all development-related decisions in the City must be
consistent with the Plan. State law also requires a community’s General Plan to be internally consistent. This
means that the Housing Element, although updated more frequently, must function as an integral part of the
overall General Plan, with consistency between it and the other General Plan elements.
The Housing Element is most directly related to the Land Use Element since it is the latter element that
designates the location and extent of residential neighborhoods throughout the City. This is reflected in Land
Use Goal 5: The City of Compton will work to rehabilitate and conserve the existing neighborhoods in the City
while evaluating opportunities for new residential development.
The Compton General Plan Guiding Principles related to housing are excerpted below.
      Provide high quality, accessible housing which gives people choices.
      Maintain Compton’s affordability and continue to provide assistance for first-time home buyers.
      Preserve and enhance Compton’s unique urban agricultural district.
11.1.4 BACKGROUND REPORT
The Housing Element Background Report discusses a wide range of existing characteristics and conditions in the
City of Compton that affect the demand, availability, affordability, and development of housing. The background
information included in this section serves as the foundation for the development of housing goals and policies.
The development patterns in the City have been established through the long-term implementation of the City’s
General Plan and Zoning regulations. Commercial land uses generally extend along the major arterial roadways
in the City with residential neighborhoods located in the interior areas behind the commercial frontages.
Residential development is the predominant land use and is scattered throughout the City. The land area located
within the City’s corporate boundaries is 6,511 acres (10.2 square miles).8 Of this total area, residential
development accounts for 2,689 acres or more than 44% of Compton’s total land area. Compton has just the
right amount of residential mix to ensure that the City’s tax base is diverse. Residential land uses in Compton
generally consist of the following types of development. The location and extent of existing residential
development in Compton is illustrated in Exhibit 3-1.
      Single Family Residential. Land uses and development included in this category are characterized by
          single-family homes. The majority of the parcels found within the City remain developed as single-family
          residential development. Typically 4 to 8 dwelling units per acre.
      Low Density Multifamily Residential includes duplexes and smaller multifamily residences. Lower
          density multifamily residential land uses are generally found within the central portion of Compton with

         parcels that were originally developed with small bungalows or that were previously developed as single-
         family and have been redeveloped with small multifamily buildings. Typically 8.1 to 17 dwelling units per
         acre.
     Medium Density Multifamily Residential is characterized by higher density residential development that
         includes town-homes, condominiums, and apartments. These uses are generally found along key
         arterials as well as the central portion of the City. Typically 17.1 to 34 dwelling units per acre.
11.1.5 BIRTHING A NEW COMPTON
The City of Compton’s motto is “Birthing a New Compton”. The City’s vision for Housing is to utilize Smart
Growth principles to provide affordable housing for all income groups within pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods
with services within walking or transit distance.
11.1.6 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
Population characteristics affect the type and amount of housing need in a community. Issues such as population
growth, age characteristics, race and ethnicity, and employment characteristics combine to influence the type of
housing needed and the ability to afford housing. This section details the various population characteristics
affecting housing needs.
POPULATION GROWTH
According to the State of California Department of Finance (DOF) estimates, Compton’s population as of January
2009 was 99,431, a change of 5,938 persons or 6.3% over the population in the 2000 Census. Table 1 documents
the City’s population and housing unit growth over the past three decades.
Population growth has increased in the last nine years but housing growth has not kept pace. Most of the
population growth was absorbed by existing households. Compton’s average household size increased from 3.78
persons per housing unit in 1980 to 4.39 persons per housing unit in 2009 (compared to 3.1 for Los Angeles
County). Table 2 illustrates that although the largest cluster of residents is between the ages of 18 – 65 years old
has increased to 58 percent in 2007, the median age for the City is a younger average at 26 years old.
Family (unsure how to Format these : family, housing unit, etc)
A family consists of all persons related by blood or marriage who live as a household unit and occupy a single
housing unit.
Housing Unit
A housing Unit is a house, an apartment, a trailer home, or a group of rooms.
Separate Living Quarters
Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat separately from other persons in a building
and which has direct access from the outside of a building or through a common hall.

POPULATION BY AGE
The age structure of a population is an important factor in evaluating housing needs and projecting the
direction of future housing development. Compton’s population profile is younger than the average in Los
Angeles County. The median age in Compton is 25.9 year which is older than it was in 2000, but is still
younger than the median age of Los Angeles County at 32 years. The age profile of the City is summarized in
Table 3-2. The 2000 Census profile is compared with more recent estimates drawn from the Census
Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS).
The under 5 population has decreased slightly as a percent of the total since 2000. However, the decrease in
the 5 to < 18 population is more dramatic. This suggests that the increase in household size is not due to an
increase in family size, but due to the number of unrelated people living in the same household.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
RACE AND ETHNICITY
The racial and ethnic composition of a population affects housing needs based on the unique household
characteristics of different groups, and household size in particular. The U.S. Census collects information on
the race and ethnicity of the U.S population. There are five racial categories identified by the U.S. Census,
White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian and
Other Pacific Islander. There is one ethnic category, Hispanic or Latino which is defined by the U.S. Census
as a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin,
regardless of race.
Table 3 compares the racial and ethnic characteristics for the City for the year 2000 and the 3-year estimate
for 2006-2008. The number and percent of Latinos has increased in the past 7 years while the number and
percent of African-Americans has decreased. To the extent that these two groups have different housing
preferences, this population shift has implications for the type of housing needed.
The ongoing demographic shift from majority African American to majority Latino residents is important to
defining housing needs in Compton because typically, for a variety of reasons, Latinos often have larger
household size and more recent Latino immigrants tend to have lower incomes than those residents who
have resided in the United States for a longer period of time

Public Participation
In accordance with Article 10.6 of the Government Code, the preparation of a local housing element must
include a citizen participation process and the process must be documented.             The City has conducted
extensive public outreach to involve residents and citizen groups in the preparation of the Housing Element.
In total more than twenty-five (25) meetings were conducted to ascertain Compton’s housing needs. The
public outreach spans some six (6) years from 2007 – 2011. In total more than 2,000 Compton stakeholders
have provided feedback and comments and throughout the years, the information has been collected,
reviewed and incorporated to help shape the policies and objectives of the Housing Element and remaining
elements of the General Plan.
Initially, community outreach was conducted in partnership with the Southern California Association of
Governments through their Compass Blueprint 2% Strategy. The first of a series of meetings took place in 2007
and continue through 2009. At the heart of the 2% Strategy are the Opportunity Areas. These are key parts of
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                            PAGE 214

the region for targeting growth, where projects, plans and policies consistent with the Compass Blueprint
principles will best serve the mobility, livability, prosperity and sustainability goals of the region’s Growth
Vision. Compton represents an Opportunity Area because it contains two stations of the Metro Blue Line
light rail. This outreach activity culminated with the preparation of a vision document that included broad
goals and preferred land development patterns expressed by the community to guide the General Plan update.
The resulting guiding principles represent a “checklist” of community values to be used to guide public
decision-making. They represent the collective values and ideals of a diverse mix of people representing
residents from renters to homeowners, business owners, and nonprofits.
The City gathered community feedback on housing needs from community meetings held during the
Consolidated Plan (CP) process and during community meetings from the Analysis of Impediments to Fair
Housing (AI). During the CP process, the City conducted four (4) community meetings, one in each district,
to determine the adequately and supply of housing in March 2010. The time period for the CP is five years
(2010 – 2014). Participants generally included community leaders, block clubs, elected officials, students
and business owners.      All participants were issued a questionnaire regarding housing needs and other
related services. Surveys were collected and the data was compiled and reported in the final CP which was
approved by City Council in May 2010. Within the CP, the City outlined several goals and recommendations
to achieve housing goals. In addition to surveys, participants reviewed a PowerPoint presentation that
outlined specific housing goals and participated in a facilitated discussion led by the City of Compton
Planning and Economic Development Department. The housing priorities identified at these meetings were:
      Preservation of existing housing
      Provision of new single-family housing
      Elimination of blight in residential neighborhoods
      Increased opportunity for home ownership
      Preservation and enforcement of equal housing opportunity
      Preservation of low-income housing
      Energy conservation
Similarly, for the preparation of the AI, housing professionals and City staff led a discussion with participants
to identify impediments and barriers to Fair Housing, to share instances of discrimination and to make
recommendations to change public policies that limit housing choices for people of various incomes.
Supplemental interviews were conducted with various community and industry representatives to obtain
information from those unable to attend the sessions. A summary of the AI factors and remedial solutions
were included in the final document and have been appropriated added to the Housing Element in the pages
to follow.
Above and beyond community meetings for the CP and the AI, the City held five (5) community meetings in
February 2011 to collect input from residents; one in each City Council District. A fifth meeting was held at
City Hall during City Council meeting to obtain input and share results with the public of specific housing

goals. Outreach included distributing flyers to each residence, posting the dates of the meetings on the City’s
website, making announcements on the local cable channel and at City Council meetings, and making flyers
available at all public buildings. Spanish speaking interpreters were present at the community meetings to
translate to non-English speaking residents and business owners.           In addition, surveys were sent to
nonprofits funded with City funds and their beneficiaries. The purpose of these efforts was to identify the
priority needs of the City. Additionally, the City of Compton conducted a significant public outreach to
various segments of the community to obtain comments, and suggestions on the proposed General Plan and
Housing Element. These outreach efforts consisted of the following actions:
     The City posting the EIR Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the required 45 day public review period at
         City Hall and on the City web site Home Page in April 2011.
     The City placed several 24 by 36 inch color posters at various locations throughout the City and at
         City Hall beginning in March of 2011 for several months prior to the adoption of public hearings to
         solicit input on the Housing Element.
     The City made available hard copy draft General Plan document, including the Housing Element, to
         the public. Copies were provided in English and Spanish and were available for review at the
         Planning and Economic Development counter on April 2011.
     The City posted the proposed General Plan on the City’s website in English and Spanish April 2011.
        The City provided an email address specifically set up to received additional feedback and comments
         regarding the draft General Plan in April 2011.
     The City distributed over 100 draft General Plan CDs to various stakeholder in March 2011.
Based upon feedback and data from the previous community meetings, City staff synthesized and
incorporated community feedback into the draft Housing Element with corresponding implementation
recommendations.         To ensure a cross section of stakeholders, the City identified stakeholders
underrepresented at previous community meetings. These included the senior population, Spanish speaking
residents, children and young adults and the business community. The City endeavored to create specific
community meetings all aimed at soliciting feedback from these specific stakeholders. The City conducted
two community meetings exclusively for the seniors of Compton at the City’s senior center on March 8 and
April 14, 2011 respectively. One of the two meetings was requested by the Commission on Aging.
Approximately 40 seniors attended the meetings.
Similarly, on March 24, 2011, the City conducted a presentation for the student body government officers of
the local high schools, Compton, Dominguez, Centennial and César Chavez high schools. Students met at
City Hall to discuss Compton’s future on the proposed General Plan 2030 and Housing Element. Students
worked in teams by reviewing proposed housing recommendations or offered additional recommendations
for housing objectives. One student from each high school reported out by summarizing modified or new
recommendations.        City staff incorporated recommendations into the Housing Element and other
recommendations into specific elements of the General Plan. This meeting was attended by approximately
25 student leaders and represented the first time that all high school leaders met in more than 20 years.

 The City also engaged the elementary and middle schools to participate in Compton’s 2030 vision by creating
 posters and by submitting essay Vision 2030 essays. For elementary students, participants were encouraged
 to illustrate what Compton should look like by 2030. Students prepared their artwork using paint, pencils
 and print cutouts. Middle school students provide a two-page essay identifying how the City should evolve
 over the next 20 years. Both elementary and middle school students’ contributions will be incorporated into
 the final General Plan document.
 Additional community meetings were also held for Compton’s Spanish speaking community. According to
 the 2000 census, approximately 60 percent of Compton residents were Latino and a large number of them
 do not speak English as a second language. The first meeting was held during Planning Commission on
 March 9, 2011. A Spanish speaking interpreter was present at the Planning Commission meeting and
 translated the entire General Plan discussion in Spanish. The Planning Commission meetings are routinely
 shown on the City Cable station Channel 36 and it allowed Spanish speaking residents an opportunity to
 learn about the draft Housing Element and General Plan if they were not in attendance at the first
 community meeting. For the second meeting, City officials sent flyers to Spanish all Spanish speaking
 church congregations and placed an ad in the local Spanish newspaper. The second community meeting took
 place in August 2011 at Victory Outreach, one of Compton’s most active church congregations. City staff and
 Spanish speaking interpreters were on-hand to facilitate the meeting. Draft documents in English and
 Spanish were available for review by the public. Both English and Spanish verison will remain on the
 website. Additional draft documents written in Spanish were distributed to Victory Outreach and Our Lady
 of Victory for parishioner not in attendance at the second community meeting.
 A final community meeting was held for the business community. There are hundreds of businesses located
 on arterial roadways throughout Compton. The City conducted outreach to the entire Compton business
 community. A community meeting was held in September 2011 at Compton Careerlink Center. More than
 100 business and property owners attended the meeting, making it the largest community meeting to date.
 While many business owners had concerns about proposed land use changes, many provided comments
 regarding housing related issues.      Among the most prevalent comments were to provide funding to
 encourage mixed use development along the major transit corridors in Compton and to provide financial
 assistance to qualified residents to maintain residential and commercial properties. City staff presented a
 presentation to the business community and focused a great deal of time on the Housing Elements. After the
 presentation, staff was on hand to meet with individual business owners to discuss specific business needs
 and housing objectives. A collective summary of recommendations from all targeted stakeholders are listed
 below:

EMPLOYMENT
An assessment of the prospective need for market rate housing must take into consideration the type of
employment held by residents of the City. Blue collar occupations are held by 39% of the residents, white
collar occupations by another 39% and the remaining 22% hold service and farm occupations. The three top
occupations are held by 45% of Compton residents. The top three occupations are Office/Administrative
Support, Transportation/Moving, and Production. Occupations held by Compton residents are shown in
Table 4.
The 2009 annual average unemployment rate for the City was 19.6% compared to 11.6% for the County and
9.3% for the nation910. The City’s 2009 labor force is estimated to be 37,100 persons with 29,800 persons
employed and 7,300 persons actively seeking work.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
HOUSING ISSUE – HOUSING CONSERVATION
The goal of housing preservation is to protect the existing investment in housing and to avoid physical
decline that will require larger rehabilitation efforts in the future to restore quality and value. Also, sound
housing reduces potential hazards such as electrical fires, poor sanitary conditions, and exposure to
asbestos. In Compton, the existing single-family housing stock represents a significant resource which
would be impossible to replace due to existing construction costs. Rehabilitation of these units, as well as
completion of infrastructure improvements, will help arrest the physical decline of entire neighborhoods
and encourage current residents to remain in the communities in which they have invested. The following
goal and supporting policies underscore the City's resolve to upgrade and preserve existing units to create
safe, affordable housing opportunities, especially for prospective new owner-occupants.
     Housing Goal 1. Achieve and maintain a high degree of quality and safety in the City's older housing
     stock.
      Housing Policy 1.1. The City of Compton will use the City's code enforcement program to bring

      Housing Policy 1.4. The City of Compton will replace severely deteriorated units with sound,
         quality, affordable housing.
      Housing Policy 1.5. The City of Compton will work with federal housing authorities to facilitate
         resale and occupancy of FHA foreclosed units, and investigate ways in which vacant units may be
         occupied until resale occurs.
HOUSING ISSUE – NEW HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
The City encourages construction of new single-family and housing units (including townhouses and
condominiums) to ensure that an adequate supply is available to meet existing and future needs. Because
Compton is largely built out, new construction will occur as infill or as redevelopment on underutilized
lots.
     Housing Goal 2. Provide a variety of types and an adequate supply of housing to meet the existing
     and future needs of City residents.
      Housing Policy 2.1. The City of Compton will increase its efforts with private housing developers
         of housing to increase the availability of market rate housing for both homeowners and renters.

        address the needs of the City's homeless population, giving attention to homeless men
HOUSING ISSUE – ELIMINATION OF BLIGHT
Blighting influences created by deteriorating units and juxtaposition of residential and industrial uses can
lead to a decline in property values and exacerbate the deterioration of neighborhood conditions. In
Compton there are many areas where manufacturing activities are located adjacent to or within residential
neighborhoods. Through implementation of land use policy and the following directives, the City plans to
create more livable residential areas by developing buffer zones to lessen impacts of competing land uses.
    Housing Goal 3. Eliminate conflicts between residential and nonresidential uses.
     Housing Policy 3.1. The City of Compton will relocate non-conforming residential uses from
        abutting or adjacent incompatible industrial land uses.

        neighborhoods to convert existing buildings into more “green-friendly” buildings.
HOUSING ISSUE – INCREASED HOME OWNERSHIP
In Compton, the median housing value is lower than Los Angeles County as a whole, yet some low and

home ownership for all income groups.
    Housing Goal 4. Increase opportunities for home ownership.
     Housing Policy 4.1. The City of Compton will explore strategies to allow the private sector to

        income-eligible owner-occupants.
     Housing Policy4.2. The City of Compton will provide favorable house purchasing options to
        moderate income-eligible households, such as interest rate write-downs, down payment assistance,

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
HOUSING ISSUE – PRESERVATION OF GOVERNMENT - ASSISTED LOW INCOMING
HOUSING
Government assisted low income housing units that are at risk of converting to non-low income uses should
be preserved.
     Housing Goal 6.         Preserve government-assisted low income housing for use as affordable
     housing for lower income City residents.
          Housing Policy 6.1. The City of Compton will preserve restricted low-income housing in the City so
          that there may be a pool of units for low income and special needs residents.
          Housing Policy 6.2. The City of Compton will assist current tenants of rent restricted buildings
          that are being converting to non-restricted units to explore ownership and management options
          and provide relocation assistance if necessary.

Energy costs can contribute to higher housing costs. Through energy conservation programs and efforts,
these costs can be reduced and thereby provide additional income to residents.
     Housing Goal 7. Reduce overall housing costs through programs to reduce energy costs.
      Housing Policy 7.1. Te City of Compton will require new residential construction to comply
          with State and local building code insulation and energy conservation standards.

          including active and passive solar features, and fuel cells, in new residential construction.
                   SECTION 11.3 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Household characteristics provide useful information for understanding the growth dynamics and changing
housing needs in the community. The Census Bureau defines a household as all persons living in a housing
unit, which may range from a family related by marriage and birth to a single person living alone to unrelated
individuals living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories or other group
living situations are not considered households. Presently the City of Compton Zoning Code does not provide
a definition of family. The new proposed Zoning Code will include many new definitions including Family.
Until the Zoning Code adopts a definition of “Family”, The City will use Census Bureau definition of
Household.
11.3.1 HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                            PAGE 223

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Compton is a family-oriented community with a much higher percentage of family households in 2000 than
Los Angeles County as shown in Table 5. Families are defined as people residing in the same house related
through blood or marriage. The higher concentration of families is consistent with the higher household size
seen in Compton and suggests a need for larger homes.

11.3.2 HOUSEHOLD SIZE
Household size is an important indicator of housing need since it may suggest an increase in the number
of large families, but it may also point to a general rise in overcrowding. For example, a city’s average
household size over time if there is a trend toward larger families. In communities where the population is
aging, the average household size may decline.
Compton’s average household size increased from 3.78 persons per housing unit in 1980 to 4.39 persons per
housing unit in 2009 (compared to 3.1 for Los Angeles County). There is a substantial difference in the
average household size for the City and the County. According to the 2006-2008 American Community
Survey 3-Year Estimates, the average household size for owner-occupied units was 4.29 persons per
household compared to 4.16 persons per household for the renter occupied units, a minor difference.
11.3.3 OVERCROWDING
Overcrowding is an indicator of housing affordability. Unit overcrowding is caused by the combined effect of
low earning and high housing costs in a community, and reflects the inability of households to buy or rent
housing that provides a reasonable level of privacy. However, cultural factors may also play a role in
overcrowding. The Census defines overcrowded households as households with greater than 1.01 persons
per room, excluding bathrooms, kitchens, hallways, and porches.
The incidence of overcrowding in Compton is significant and has worsened since 1990 as shown in Table 6.
When a household has greater than 1.51 persons per room, it is considered severely overcrowded. Table 7
identifies the frequency of overcrowded housing units by tenure and degree based on data from the 2006-
2008 American Community Survey 3-year estimates. Overcrowding is more prevalent in rental than in
ownership housing, particularly for the severely overcrowded units.

11.3.4 HOUSEHOLD INCOME
An important factor in housing affordability is household income. While upper income households have
more disposable income to spend on housing, low and moderate income households are more limited in the
range of housing they can afford. According to the 2000 Census, the overall median household income for
the City of Compton was $48,474 while the median family income was $55,111. The median income for
owner-occupied households was $48,537 while the median income for renter households was $28,640, Table
8. On average, renters in all income categories spend a greater proportion of their incomes for housing than
do homeowners, and thus face greater financial obstacles in securing decent, affordable housing.

As Table 10 indicates, Compton has a higher percentage of very low and low income households than Los
Angeles County as a whole. This disparity has important implications for multiple housing issues, such as
affordability, type, and tenure.

11.3.5 HOUSEHOLD AFFORDABILITY
State and Federal standards for housing overpayment are based on an income-to-housing cost ratio of 30
percent and above. Households paying greater than this amount have less income left over for other
necessities such as food, clothing, utilities, and health care. Upper income households are generally capable
of paying a larger proportion of their income for housing; therefore, estimates of housing overpayment
generally focus on lower income groups.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Distinguishing between renter and owner housing overpayment is important because, while homeowners
may over-extend themselves financially to afford the option of a home purchase, the owner has the option of
downsizing into the rental market. Renters on the other hand, are limited to the rental market and are
generally required to pay the rent established in that market.

Housing affordability is a major problem for lower income households in Compton as demonstrated in Table
11. More than half of all lower income owner households and almost two-thirds of all lower income renter
households pay more than 30 percent of their incomes for housing.
Housing affordability is particularly bad for very low income households, whose incomes are less than half of
the county median. More than 60 percent of very low income owner households and almost 75 percent of
very low income renter households pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing. The distribution
of families living under the defined poverty thresholds are illustrated in Exhibit 3-2.
11.3.6 COST BURDEN FOR HOUSING
According to the 2006-2008 American Community Survey 3-Year Estimates, 7,443 owner-occupied
households paid 30% or more of their monthly income for housing. This figure represents 56% of the total
owner-occupied housing units in the City. Renter households paying 30% or more of their monthly income
for housing totaled 5,581 households or 58% of the total renter households in the City.

 Table 12 provides a breakdown of the following income categories:
       Very-Low incomes refer to those household incomes that are 50% of the County median adjusted for
           household size
       Low incomes refer to those household incomes that are between 51% and 80% of the County median
           adjusted for household size
       Moderate incomes refer to those households that are between 81% and 120% of the County median
           household income adjusted for household size
 The HCD now requires local governments to identify those households that have incomes that are classified
 as extremely low income. Extremely low income households are those households that have annual incomes
 less than 30% of the County median (the Households included in this category typically represent the lowest
 wage earners in a community with wages corresponding to the current annual minimum wage of $8.00 per
 hour (as of January 1, 2008). The annual wage figure cited previously assumes full-time employment.
 The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) data are used by HOME and CDBG jurisdiction

 The CHAS data concerning overpayment for housing in the City of Compton is summarized below in Table
 13A . The data indicates the overpayment for extremely low income households (≤30% of the County
 median), very low income households (>30% to ≤50% of the County median), low income households (>50%
 to ≤80% of the County median), and all of the households in the City. The households that are overpaying
 for housing are further identified by tenure (owner-occupied and renter households). Finally, the table
 indicates senior households and large-family households that are overpaying for housing.

11.3.7 SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
Government Code section 65583(a)(7) requires “An analysis of any special housing needs, such as those of
the elderly, persons with disabilities, large families, farmworkers, families with female heads of households
and families and persons in need of emergency shelter.”
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulties in finding decent, affordable housing due to
their special needs. In Compton, these “special needs” groups include the elderly, disabled persons, large
households, female-headed households, farm workers, and the homeless. Below is a table that illustrates the
number of special interest population/groups targeted for assistance.

LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
Large households are consist of 5 or more persons and are considered a special needs population due to the
limited availability of affordable and adequately sized housing. The lack of large homes is especially* evident
among rental units where the number of units over three bedrooms is extremely small. Large households
often live in overcrowded conditions due to both the lack of large enough units and insufficient income to
afford available units of adequate size.
The City of Compton as a general rule has a larger than average household and family size than is typical of
Los Angeles County as a whole. The average household size in Compton is 4.16 and the average family size is
4.45 persons. Although these numbers do not reach the established threshold of 5 persons per household,
the data shows that Compton residents have a need for larger than average homes. According to the most
recent 2000 Census figures, there were 8452 households that contained five or more persons per household.
SENIOR HOUSEHOLDS
Elderly households include those family householders containing persons 65 years of age or older as well as
non-family householders (persons living alone) where the individual is 65 years of age or older.
The total senior population in Compton is 6,562 which accounts for 7 percent of the total population. Seniors
head about 15% of all households (22,368) in Compton. The elderly have a number of special needs
including housing, transportation, health care and other services. Rising rents are a particular concern to
seniors who live on fixed incomes. Nine hundred seniors or 14% fall below the poverty line. Additionally,
1,027 seniors serve as the primary caregiver to grandchildren under 18 years of age.
The CHAS databook documents that of the 3,259 senior households 1,630 or 50% of the senior households
have incomes less than or equal to the median family income for Los Angeles County. This indicates a need
for assistance for seniors in securing safe decent housing in Compton.
Even senior citizen homeowners, who are at an advantage because their housing payments are fixed, are still
subject to increasing utility rates and other living expenses.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
For those seniors that live on their own many have physical limitations both of which may inhibit their ability
to maintain their homes or perform minor repairs.
Moreover they may require the installation of grab bars, ramps, kitchen modifications or other physical
modifications to the interior of the unit to render the unit more suitable for an elderly resident.
Special interior improvements are often needed to accommodate a disabled tenant or homeowner. For
example, door frames must be wider to accommodate wheel chairs, ramps instead of stairs are needed, hand
rails in bathrooms need to be installed, cabinet doors must be accessible, and light switches and other
devices also need to be within easy reach. The cost for retrofitting an existing structure may cost thousands
of dollars and be well beyond the reach of those households with lower incomes.
SINGLE PARENT-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Single parent households frequently have special needs for such services as childcare. Single parent
households also typically have lower incomes which limits housing options and childcare opportunities. The
Census reports that there are 4,708 single parent households in Compton. The majority of these households
are female headed with 3,672 and 1036 households headed by males. The number of both female and male
headed households bears importance in relation to social service needs, such as child care, recreation
programs, and health care, which are of special concern to these households.
The City offers assistance to single parents in need of financial assistance with housing costs through the
Housing Choice Voucher Program discussed on Page 47 which provided monthly rental assistance to private
landlords.
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
A disability is defined as a long lasting condition that impairs an individual’s mobility, ability to work, or
ability to care for themselves. Persons with disabilities include those with physical, mental or emotional
disabilities. Disabled persons have special needs because of their fixed income, shortage of affordable and
accessible housing and higher costs associated with their disability.
According to the 2000 census an estimated 13,539 persons or 26 percent of the population have one
disability. Approximately, 77 individuals have self care limitations and require daily assistance in living. The
living arrangements for persons with disabilities depend on the severity of the disability. Many persons live
at home in an independent environment with help of other family members. To maintain an independent
living environment, disabled persons can require one or several forms of assistance. This assistance can be
special housing design features.
Unless such provisions are made for disabled persons during original construction, such facilities will not
likely be provided in sufficient numbers in typical rental projects. The lack of such housing is even more
pronounced when it comes to market-rate rental units. Special interior improvements are often needed to
accommodate a disabled tenant or homeowner. For example, door frames must be wider to accommodate
wheel chairs, ramps instead of stairs are needed, hand rails in bathrooms need to be installed, cabinet doors
must be accessible, and light switches and other devices also need to be within easy reach. The cost for

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
retrofitting an existing structure may cost thousands of dollars and be well beyond the reach of those
households with lower incomes.
The City does not require special building codes or onerous project review to construct, improve or convert
housing for persons with disabilities. Additional discussion on persons with disabilities is provided on Page
37 of this document.
HOMELESS PERSONS IN NEED OF EMERGENCY SHELTER (FORMAT CHANGES START:
Homelessness is defined as not having a permanent address, sleeping in places not meant for habitation, or
not having a place to change clothes or bathe. Homelessness typically occurs because there is insufficient
income to weather a personal financial crisis such as a loss of employment or family illness and continue to
pay for housing. Mental disabilities or drug and alcohol additions also contribute to creating homeless
individuals.
Based on the 2009 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, for Los Angeles County there are an estimated
48,053 homeless people that includes 42,694 in the Los Angeles Continuum of Care service area managed by
the Los Angeles Homeless Services Agency (LAHSA) and 5,359 managed by the cities of Long Beach,
Pasadena and Glendale. Within LAHSA, 10,245 are chronically homeless individuals who have been on the
streets for a year or more or have had 4 episodes of homelessness in the last 3 years, and who have one or
more disabling condition such as mental illness, substance abuse, and health conditions.
     The proportion of chronically homeless people according to LAHSA is 25%, one of the highest
         proportions of all major metropolitan areas in the country.
     LAHSA, reports that 47% are Black/African American, 21% White, 29% Hispanic or Latino, and 3%
         Asian/Pacific Islander/ American Indian/ Alaskan Native. Black/ African Americans are
         overrepresented as they make up roughly 9% of the County population.
     LAHSA reports there are 4,885 members of homeless families
     LAHSA reports of the 42,694, only 14,050 homeless are in shelters
Table 15 lists the programs offering housing support to the Homeless person. Compton provides numerous
resources and shelter locations for the homeless.
A transitional housing facility operated by the Shields for Families, Inc. is located at 1415 E. Alondra
Boulevard in Compton. This facility provides transitional apartment-style housing and support for homeless
families suffering from substance abuse. A total of 106 units are provided by this facility.
EMERGENCY SHELTERS
Transitional housing is a type of supportive housing used to facilitate the movement of homeless individuals
and families to permanent housing. A person may live in a transitional housing unit for up to two-years
while receiving supportive services that enable independent living.
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                             PAGE 235

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Supportive housing refers to permanent rental housing that also provides a wide array of support services
that are designed to enable residents to maintain stable housing and lead more productive lives. Supportive
housing is most often targeted to persons that have greater risk factors such as mental illness or drug
dependence that could ultimately lead to prolonged homelessness. The types of support services that may be
provided include medical and mental health care, vocational and employment training, substance abuse
counseling, childcare, and independent living skills training. Supportive housing can be in any type of
residential structure including a single family detached unit or an apartment building.
Emergency, Transitional, and Supportive housing are currently being treated as permitted land uses even
though they are not called out in the Zoning Ordinance in compliance with SB2. The City had made policy
decision to treat these temporary housing types are permitted by right land uses in compliance with state law
and will include them in the upcoming Zoning Consistency Program. In the proposed revised zoning
ordinance these temporary housing land uses will be specifically listed as permitted in all single family and
multifamily zones.
Currently, the City’s Zoning Ordinance permits emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing in
any non residential zone district subject to a Conditional Use Permit. The City however has designated
through the Land Use Element a Housing Overlay Land Use Designation which will be created over
Wilmington Avenue and Long Beach Avenue where these alternative residential land uses will be treated as
permitted land uses across multiple zones. The designated corridors are on the east and west portions of the
City. The Long Beach Blvd. corridor is located on the eastern portion of the City and runs almost the entire
length of the City. The Wilmington Avenue corridor is located on the western portion of the City and runs
from El Segundo Blvd. to Greenleaf Blvd. The overlay zones total approximately 325 lots containing 101
acres of land. The overlay designation encompasses the Multi-Family, General Commercial, Mixed Use and
Low Density zones. The emergency overlay land use designations areas are shown on Exhibit 3-5.
SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY HOTEL
There are several definitions of a single room occupancy hotel. Below are the more common definitions:
    1.   SRO hotel room means a guest room or efficiency unit, as defined by California Health and Safety
         Code section 17958.1, intended or designed to be used, or which is used, rented, or hired out, to be
         occupied, or which is occupied, as a primary residence.
    2. A single room occupancy (more commonly SRO, sometimes called single resident occupancy) is a
         multiple tenant building that houses one or two people in individual rooms (sometimes two rooms,
         or two rooms with a bathroom or half bathroom), or to the single room dwelling itself. SRO tenants
         typically share bathrooms and / or kitchens, while some SRO rooms may include kitchenettes,
         bathrooms, or half-baths. Although many are former hotels, SROs are primarily rented as a
         permanent residence.
    3. The expression "single room occupancy" or, more commonly "SRO", refers to a building that houses
         people in single rooms. This means that tenants must share bathrooms and kitchens. The term
         originated in New York City, probably in the 1930s (the Oxford English Dictionary provides an
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                              PAGE 236

         earliest citation of 1941), but the institutions date back at least fifty years before the nickname was
         applied to them.
SROs are a viable housing option for poor people, students, single tenants, seasonal or other traveling
workers, empty nester widows / widowers, or others who do not desire or require large dwellings or private
domestic appliances. The smaller size and limited amenities in SROs generally makes them a more
affordable housing option, especially in gentrifying neighborhoods or urban areas with high land values.
The rents of many disadvantaged tenants may be paid in full or in part by charitable, state and federal
programs, giving incentive to landlords to accept such tenants.
Some SRO buildings are renovated with the benefit of a tax abatement, with the condition that the rooms are
rented to tenants with low incomes, and sometimes specific low income groups, such as homeless people,
people with mental illness, people with AIDS, and so on. An SRO hotel does not include any individual in
which the person is housed or detained under legal restraint or hospitalized or otherwise under medical,
nursing or psychiatric care, or fraternity or sorority houses.
The present City of Compton Zoning Code is silent on the development of Single Room Occupancy projects.
However, upon adoption of the General Plan 2030, the City funded Zoning Consistency program will be
initiated and Single Room Occupancy developments will be specifically listed as a permitted land use in
commercial zones with development standards specified.                Presently, SRO’s are allowed within any
commercial zone with a Conditional Use Permit since they are treated similar to Hotels. However, they will
be permitted as a use by right in any Commercial or Mixed use zone covered by the Emergency Shelter
Overlay Land Use designation area on both Long Beach Blvd. and Wilmington Avenues. This a potential 2.6
mile long, 101 acre, 350 lot overlay area being created within the City where SRO’s will be permitted by right.
Moreover, under the proposed General Plan Zoning Consistency Ordinance the development regulations
controlling the development of SRO’s will be created incorporating reduced standards from the typical
commercial hotel development standards. SRO’s are recognized to be different from hotels and typical
multi-family residential developments. Minimum room size as well as a parking standards will be analyzed
and reduced. Table 25 shows the variety of housing types that are permitted by right in the various
residential zones.
EMERGENCY SHELTER GRANT PROGRAM AND HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION AND RAPING
RE-HOUSING PROGRAM
The Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority (LAHSA) has developed its Continuum of Care system to assure
a coordinated effort to provide services to the homeless and at-risk population in Los Angeles County.
Working with LAHSA, the Compton Planning and Economic Development Department will develop a
resource list of the Los Angeles County and local agencies that receive federal funds from the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, and others.
The Compton Planning and Economic Development Department will distribute this list to each household
that receives Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program (HPRP) financial assistance. It will
use the list to link participating households with other needed services in order to help keep them housed.
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                 PAGE 237

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Each year, the City receives approximately $90,000 of Federal Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) funding to
assist the City in meeting the housing needs of both the homeless and at-risk residents. The City will
leverage the HPRP funds with the ESG funds by collaborating with two non-profit agencies that received the
City's ESG funds for emergency shelter services during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 fiscal years,
The City will also work in partnership with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA). LAHSA is
comprised of community-based organizations, City representatives, businesses, health care entities, veteran
service organizations, churches, community colleges, State universities, and formerly homeless individuals.
Because of the vast size of the Los Angeles County, Local Service Planning Areas (SPAs) were established.
The City of Compton is a part of SPA 6.
LAHSA will help the Local Housing Authority to identify other area service providers that may be of
assistance to the program participants so that they can develop support networks that will enable them to
remain in their existing housing and not become homeless.
The Compton Grants Division will directly input the necessary data into LAHSA's HMIS so that reports
concerning the City's HPRP outcome will be generated as required by HUD. It is the City's intention that at
least two staff persons will be trained by LAHSA in the proper use of the HMIS. The HMIS will provide
data on the unduplicated count of at-risk of homeless persons receiving services; track service usage; and
report on the accomplishments of the households receiving financial assistance through the program.
The City's FY 2005-2010 Consolidated Plan identified homeless programs as a high priority need and
estimated that, at any given time, there are approximately 1,666 homeless individuals and families living
within the City of Compton. Due to the economic crisis and high housing costs, the homeless population is
increasing. The use of the City's HPRP funds to pay for "shallow' subsidy rent payments for households that
are at-risk of becoming homeless and have no other housing options available to them is consistent with
the priorities presented in the City's Consolidated Plan. The City's goal is to prevent additional residents
from becoming homeless.
The Grants Division intends to accept referrals for HPRP financial assistance from the following local non-
profit agencies that receive the City's ESG funds for emergency shelter services:
CAPACITY OF EMERGENCY SHELTER OVERLAY ZONE
As part of the proposed Emergency Shelter Overlay Zone determining what the maximum capacity of
proposed rooms is problematic at best. There are too many unknowns and assumptions that have to be
made.
The proposed Overlay Zone will cover two commercial corridors from approximately El Segundo Blvd to
Greenleaf Blvd in the south. A distance of 2.6 miles for each corridor through the City. The zoning within
these two corridors where Emergency shelter will be permitted by right is limited commercial and Mixed
Use. The proposed land use map shows the overlay zone on Long Beach Blvd and Wilmington Avenue.
These two major streets were selected for locating emergency shelters because they offer within walking
distance several community services such as access to public transportation, retail services and medical care.
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                            PAGE 238

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Additionally, there are multiple employment opportunities along these two main streets as cross streets such
as Compton Blvd., Rosecrans Avenue, and Alondra. One mile west of Long Beach Blvd. is the MTA Greenline
light rail that runs from the City Los Angeles to the City of Long Beach. Both Wilimington and long beach
have several older commercial retail buildings that would be excellent candidates for redevelopment of
conversion to an emergency shelter.
A field survey of the corridors revealed that there a few vacant sites and other commercial buildings suitable
for conversion to emergency shelters. A rough estimate of the potential number of rooms that could be
provided is 200. Based on 2011 homeless count by the Los Angeles County HAS Compton has approximately
851 homeless persons with about 215 unsheltered persons.
Typically, for new construction the maximum number of units/rooms of any emergency shelter or single
room occupancy proposal would be governed by zoning ordinance development standards such as maximum
site coverage, FAR, building height, parking, and setbacks.         Similarly, determining the maximum unit
capacity of an existing commercial building converted to an emergency shelter or single room occupancy
would also be governed not only by the zoning ordinance, but the building code as well. There is no way to
accurately predict the theoretical maximum capacity of rooms. Each site must be analyzed on a case by case
basis. The closest standard that could apply is the Residential High Density regulation of one unit per 1,500
square feet of site area. However, it is inappropriate to apply a multi-family standard to essentially a hotel
type of use. To do so would unfairly restrict the number of potential rooms and represent an unreasonable
governmental constraint.
Additionally, until the proposed Overlay Zone is written which would address unit/room density the City
cannot make any reasonable calculation that could be logically proven. Once the proposed Overlay Zone is
written, however each proposed site could be analyzed and a theoretical maximum number of units
determined.
The City can only state that it is committed to creating an Emergency Shelter Overlay Zone which treats
emergency shelters and single room occupancy uses in certain non-residential zones as a permitted uses
without placing punitive regulations such as high parking standards on them.
EMERGENCY SHELTER GRANT
The City provides financial support using funds from the federal Emergency Shelter Grant program to
Compton-based non-profits that provide housing and social services to homeless individuals and families.
Table 16 provides a summary of the accomplishments of these agencies in Compton that directly assist
homeless individuals for the period 2000 to 2004.
FARM WORKERS
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through seasonal
agricultural work. Farm workers have special housing needs because they earn lower incomes than many
other workers and move throughout the season from one harvest to the next.
The census identifies only 100 residents as employed in the industries of farming, fishing or forestry
representing less than one-half of one percent of the City’s labor force. Therefore, given the extremely small

percentage of farm workers with the City of Compton, the city has no special housing programs beyond

The table above shows that there is a capacity in Compton and the surrounding communities for 16,930 beds.
Based on 2011 homeless count by the Los Angeles County HAS Compton has approximately 851 homeless
persons with about 215 unsheltered persons. There is more than enough capacity to accommodate the
existing homeless population.
A field survey of the Long Beach overlay zone corridor revealed that there a five vacant lots, three vacant
retail buildings, one 50 room hotel and one apartment building that could be converted or redeveloped into
emergency, supportive and transitional housing. The field survey also revealed that there were several

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The number of housing units in Compton has grown steadily over the past two decades in spite of the City
being essentially built-out for many decades.                 This newer residential development is largely infill
development on parcels that were developed in lower residential densities or in some other nonresidential
land use. Table 18 compares the growth in Compton with the growth in nearby cities and the County. The
data included in Table 18 was derived from Census statistics for the years 1980, 1990, and 2000.

The growth in housing since 1990 has been in attached single-family and multifamily housing. Table 19
compares the types of housing in the City for 1990 and 2000. As indicated in the Table, there has been a
modest increase in the number of single family detached housing and significant increase in multi-family
housing.
HOUSING TENURE
Housing can be categorized by tenure or occupancy, owner-occupied versus renter-occupied. The tenure
distribution of a community’s housing stock (owner versus renter) influences several aspects of the local
housing market. Residential mobility is influenced by tenure, with ownership housing evidencing a much
lower turnover rate than rental housing. Housing overpayment, while faced by many households regardless
of tenure, is far more prevalent among renters. Tenure preferences are primarily related to household
income, composition, and age of householder.
Table 20 reveals that the proportion of households that are renters has remained stable in the last decade
after the small increase during the 1980s. The vacancy rate in Compton rose from about 3 percent in 1990 to
about 6 percent in 2000. According to the most recent DOF data (2009), the vacancy rate stands at 6.1
percent. Although the total number of housing units in the city increased over this period, the percentage of
occupied units decreased slightly. Housing tenure data from the 2000 Census is mapped in Exhibit 3-3.

AGE AND CONDITION OF HOUSING STOCK
Compton has an older housing stock; over 90% of the housing units removed for new development were built
before 1939 leaving roughly 60% of the housing units over 45 years old. Table 21 provides a breakdown of
housing units by year built in Compton and the Los Angeles-Long Beach Metropolitan Statistical Area.

                                    American Housing Survey and City of Compton
Compton has a higher proportion of older housing than the Los Angeles-Long Beach Metropolitan Statistical
Area where nearly 18% more of housing in Compton was built before 1970 (see Table 20). In addition, the
percentage of residents considered low or very low income by HUD is higher in the City of Compton (58%)
than Los Angeles County (41%). Given the combination of older housing stock and lower income residents,
the percentage of substandard housing and housing in need of rehabilitation is expected to be higher than
that found in the larger metropolitan area. Aging and deteriorating housing stock can have severe negative
effects on housing quality and quality of life.
A citywide visual survey was conducted in May 2011 to ascertain the condition of the housing stock within the
city. Housing condition was evaluated according to the following four categories and criteria:
      Standard Condition: Units that did not appear to require repairs. Units in this category were also
         generally well maintained and were typically new.
      Minor Repair Condition: Units in this category require some minor repairs that would not require a
         contractor and are cosmetic in nature..
      Major Repairs Condition: Units in this category were visibly in need of major repairs or renovation.
         These repairs were deemed necessary either due to extensive deterioration of cosmetic elements such
         as finishes or through materials.
        Dilapidated: Indicates that structures present are in such a state as to pose a danger to the
         inhabitants or have apparent structural problems.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Compton as the 8th oldest City in Los Angeles County experienced most of its housing construction boom in
the post World War II years.
The age of the housing stock combined with below Los Angeles County median income levels for a majority
of the City residents creates a significant impediment to regular property maintenance not typical of other
more affluent communities. However, with this fact in mind the survey results indentified that a majority of
units irrespective of age fell into the Standard and Minor repair condition categories. The homes in these
two categories were comprised of post war boom homes typically single level wood frame homes with a
stucco exterior. There were also a large number of more contemporary two story homes constructed within
the last twenty years. The majority (55%) of these homes despite being 60 years old do not appear to warrant
any concern for their longevity or ability to provide quality low/moderate income housing. It was clear that
several neighborhoods reflected significant reinvestment by their property owners.
The Major Repairs Condition category is the next category where most of the remaining homes (25%) could
be classified. These homes were older homes and tended to be located in the central and northern portions
of the City. Most of the problem areas observed consisted of poor or dead landscaping, broken fences,
cracked stucco walls, broken windows, walls in need of general restuccoing and repainting and roofing
repairs.
Lastly, there are a minority of homes (20%) that could be classified as Dilapidated. These homes are need of
significant repairs or in some cases demolition.
While a significant number of housing units in Compton were constructed prior to 1969, age alone is not a
valid indicator of the presumed condition or repairs needed. The premise that the older the unit is the more
likely it is to require some form of repair or maintenance is not always the case. Older units have typically
already had major renovations or remodeling. As can be shown by the survey of the typical Compton
residences, most are maintained and not in need of significant repairs. As a result housing age data alone
should not be used to presume a negative condition of the City’s housing stock.
Proactively, the City is proposing through increased code enforcement to implement Housing Goals 1.1, 1.2,
and 1.3 which mandate increased enforcement of health and safety code violations,               strengthened
rehabilitation and financial assistance programs, and replacing severely deteriorated units with new
affordable housing.      Additionally, with the financial assistance of the Emergency Assistance and Fix It
Programs to assist in the repair of the units any concern about the useful life of the housing stock will be
satisfied. The City of Compton will assist by seeking out additional funds to assist low and moderate income
households.
11.3.9 GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATIONS
The residential land use designations contained in the General Plan, and the associated density standards
and potential dwelling unit yields are summarized as follows:
      Single Family Residential (1 to 12 units/net acre/3224 acres) 38,688 max units
      Multifamily Residential (12.1 to 34 units/net acre/587 acres) 19,958 max units
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                           PAGE 247

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
     Multi-Family Residential (with Smart Growth Overlay) (12.1 to 34 units/net acre/ 13 acres) 442 max
        units
The General Plan build-out figures above do not include the development possible in the area governed by
the Brickyard Specific Plan where a possible 1,250 new residential units are proposed.
Below are the General Plan residential land use designation descriptions:
     Single Family Residential (1 to 12 units/net acre)            (Format Questions)
        The Single Family Residential category permits low scale residential development at densities of up
        to twelve units per acre. Based on an average Compton household size of 4.4 persons per dwelling,
        the maximum population density is 53 persons per acre. Development included within this land use
        category consists of single-family houses that may include both detached and attached units. Other
        permitted uses include schools, churches, day care homes, public utilities and facilities, and similar
        uses generally considered compatible with and serving the needs of residential neighborhoods.
        Existing single-family housing development in Compton consists of conventional subdivisions as
        well as large lot developments (10,000 square feet and larger lot sizes), in the Richland Farms
        community.
        The City of Compton Zoning Ordinance consists of three residential zones that would implement the
        Low Density Residential designation. The Residential Agriculture zone will accommodate densities
        of one to four single family units per acre. The Low Density Residential zone will accommodate
        densities of five to seven units per acre. The Medium Density Residential Zone will accommodate
        densities 7 to 12 units per acre.
        Additionally, the Zoning Ordinance allows for the development of Secondary Dwelling Units as a
        permitted land use within the Residential Agriculture and the Low Density Residential zones in
        accordance with California Government Code Section 65851.1 and .2 Development standards are
        shown on page 3-33.
     Multifamily Residential (12.1 to 34 units/net acre)
        Multifamily Residential development includes apartment complexes, townhomes, condominium
        projects, as well as any of the non residential uses permitted in the lower density residential
        categories. This land use designation permits development at densities of up to 34 units per acre.
        Based on an average household size of 4.4 persons per dwelling, the maximum population density is
        150 persons per acre.         Only those development projects that incorporate superior design
        characteristics or provide amenities for residents, such as onsite recreation, open space above the
        minimum requirements, or covered parking will be allowed to build at densities over 20 dwelling
        units per acre. Developments involving housing for senior citizens or other City-identified special
        needs groups may achieve higher densities. Density bonuses above 34 units per acre maximum are
        permitted if a housing development meets the requirements set forth in Section 65915 of the State
        Planning Code
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                            PAGE 248

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
        The City of Compton maintains a high engineering standard for curbs, gutters, sidewalks, and
        streets, and these standards govern construction in terms of width and grade. In the past, the City
        has approved residential subdivisions with private streets where the standards have been modified to
        reduce housing costs. In the future zoning consistency program the City will continue to review the
        general development standards to explore strategies for modification to determine if the standards
        can be reduced without reducing their level of safety or effectiveness in the City.
                        SECTION 11.4 HOUSING CONSTRAINTS
This section of the Housing Element is concerned with the identification of constraints that may affect the
development of housing, especially affordable housing. The analysis below considers the following:
         Governmental Constraints, refers to reasonable regulations, ordinances and fees that govern
        the development of new housing.
         Non-Governmental Constraints, refers to financial assistance offered by the City or other
        organizations. The primary non-governmental constraint is the lack of adequate financial resources
        by individuals or families to purchase or rent market rate housing. These constraints are discussed
        under the category Market Constraints. (Haven’t read it yet, but in the body this Title is
        missing)
     Market Constraints, refers to economic market factors that affect the cost of existing and new
        housing and any financial assistance available.
        Environmental Constraints, refers to characteristics of the local environment that may affect the
        cost of new housing.
11.4.1 GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Local governments may unintentionally affect the cost of housing through the enforcement of land use
controls, and building codes, code enforcement, fees, processing requirements, required on- and off-site
.improvements, and taxes and insurance. For this reason, it is important for the City to review and provide
measures to review these parameters in terms of their potential to affect the supply, distribution, and cost of
housing. The State of California planning law requires local governments to indicate the location and extent
of permitted low/moderate residential development in their general plans.            In addition, standards of
development intensity and population intensity must be indicated. The location and types of housing in the
City of Compton however, are limited to some extent by density limitations contained in the General Plan.
DEVELOPMENT AND PROCESSING FEES
In 1978 Californians enacted Proposition 13, which limited the ability of local public' agencies to increase
property taxes based on a property's assessed value. In 1982, the Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of
1982 was created to provide an alternate method of financing needed improvements and services. New
residential growth within the City imposes an increase in service demands upon public infrastructure,
including police, fire protection and suppression, paramedic services and park maintenance which must be
paid for.
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                             PAGE 249

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The City has plans to increase its fees, since they have not been increased in 6 years and is among the lowest
in LA County in order to recapture the costs related to the processing and servicing of new developments.
Any new fee structure proposed will be consistent with those being levied in the City of Los Angeles and a
number of other surrounding jurisdictions in the Southern California region. A Compton fee survey was
conducted in 2008. The study will be revised to reflect current fees from neighboring communities,
including recommendations to increase or decrease fees for entitlement activities. Once the update is
complete, City officials will review and decide to increase, decrease or keep the fees at the current level.
This fee survey is scheduled to go to City Council by mid. May 2012. Any proposed new fees will be
designed to recover the actual service costs and impacts and not to augment the City's general fund. At no
time will the City charge a higher development impact fee than what is necessary to offset the anticipated
costs to the City for constructing necessary public improvements. The following are typical fees related to
housing development:
The planning fee for design review of a single family home in the Residential Agricultural and Low Density
Residential zones on a pre-existing subdivided lot is $50.00. If the lot is part of a past Planning Commission
approval, the fee is $100.00.
For multi-family units the design review fee is $250.00 per project if the development is for four units or less
in the Medium and High Density Residential zones. If the project is for more than 4 four units a Conditional
Use Permit and environmental determination are required and the total fee is $2,250.

BUILDING CODES
The City has adopted the 2007 State Uniform Building, Housing, Plumbing, Mechanical and Electrical
Codes. For a typical 1,000 sq. ft single family detached residence or 1,000 square foot multi-family unit the
building plan check/permit fees are as follows:
       Plan Check / Building permit fee: $797.50
       Electrical Fee: $40.00 (20 fixtures + 20 outlets)
       School Fee: $2970.00
       Mechanical fee: $61.50
       Plumbing fee: $187.00
       School District Fee - $2.97/square foot
Park fees is calculated assuming three gross acres and density of nine units per acre the total Quimby fee is
$133,813.89 for the site. If the site consisted of 28 single family lots the same fee would be $4,779.06 per lot.
The fee is based off of an approved fee schedule contain within the Municipal Code. The proposed project’s
density yields a specific percentage number which represent the minimum required park land dedication.
However, for projects under 50 lots, in lieu of land dedication, the payment of fees is required. The in lieu
fee is calculated based on the average per square foot land cost multiplied the land dedication percentage.
For a typical single family residence on a 5,000 square foot lot the total City development and building fees
required are $8,835. The total materials cost to construct this 1000 square foot home plus the land cost
totals $198,000. City processing fees represent approximately 4.5% of the development cost per single
family unit.
For a typical multiple family unit the total City development and building fees required are $8,241.06. The
materials cost for a typical 800 square foot multi-family unit is $90,000 for materials with land costs
adding another $18,000 totaling $108,000. City processing fees represent approximately 7.6% of the
development cost per multiple family unit.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
Street construction costs typically represent a significant cost in project development with costs varying
depending on the required street width and whether sidewalks, bus turn outs and traffic calming
improvements are required.
The City is 98% built out with all streets installed and in use, with most in operation for several decades.
The last remaining piece of undeveloped land proposed for residential is the 104 acre Brickyard site. This
will be a mixed use development with high density residential, commercial and light industrial uses to
share all public improvement costs. Street costs are not expected to be a constraint of the future
residential development within the Brickyard site.
Redevelopment adjacent to existing streets, however may require additional improvements to the existing
streets. The Public Works Department currently estimates construction costs for streets to be local:$200,
collector: $270, and arterial:$ 470 per lineal foot. Utility costs typically add another 20 to 50 % depending
on the number and size of utilities to be installed. The right-of-ways for Arterial, Collector and local streets is
100, 62 and 50 feet respectively.
For redevelopment adjacent to existing streets the city recognizes the constraints of the existing
surrounding circulation system and adjusts the improvements required according to the physical
constraints present and the health and safety of the public.
There is no established codified fee waiver of deferment process for development fees. However, the City
Council can by resolution waive any City fee. This requires a staff report and resolution. The City has not
does not typically have any requests for fee waivers.
PROCESSING PROCEDURES
 If an application for Zoning and Site Plan Review is complete and in conformance with City requirements,
 the processing time is relatively brief.
The City of Compton Zoning Ordinance contains four residential zoning categories where residential uses
are classified as permitted by right, or conditionally permitted.
Permitted residential uses refer to those uses allowed without discretionary review except for design review
and building permits as long as the project complies with all development standards. Conditionally
Permitted Uses (CUP) are approved by the Planning Commission unless appealed to the City Council.
 Projects appealed to the City Council get priority scheduling. Typical findings for a CUP include that the
 project is consistent with the General Plan; the use is compatible with surrounding uses, the use will not
 have an adverse impact public health and safety, and general welfare concerns.
The time required to process a residential project varies greatly and depends on the issues of the project.
Project complexity and its CEQA determination are two factors that are directly related to the number of
entitlement actions needed for a project to complete the review and approval process. The entitlement
actions for a residential project could require a General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, Conditional Use
Permit Variance and Subdivision plus the environmental determination. This is a worst case scenario and
not typical. See Tables 23 and 24 for specific processing times.
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                PAGE 252

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
However, it should be noted that each residential project does not necessarily need to have a complex CEQA
review and can be deemed exempt. Small scale projects consistent with General Plan and Zoning Ordinance
do not generally require Environmental Impact Reports [EIR], General Plan Amendments, Rezones,
subdivisions or Variances. The typical multi-family residential development usually requires only a
Conditional Use Permit and environmental determination.
Review and approval procedures for multiple entitlement applications are also encouraged to be processed
concurrently to save time and make the process more efficient and less costly to the developer. As an
example, a rezone petition may be reviewed in conjunction with the required site plan, Conditional Use
Permit, tentative tract map, and any necessary variances.
The City works closely with developers to expedite approval procedures so as not to put any unnecessary
timing constraints on development. All entitlement applications are filed with the Planning and Economic
Development Department which will circulate copies of the application to other departments and agencies
for review and comments.
For a typical single-family residence on one pre-existing subdivided lot the processing
procedure is as follows:
         Step 1
         The Architectural Review application is submitted to the Planning and Economic Development
         Department for Architectural Review Board review and approval. The fee for the Architectural
         Review Board application is $50.00.
      Step 2
         Planning staff, serving as the Architectural Review Board reviews the project over the counter for
         architectural and zoning conformance to the zoning ordinance. If no variances, exceptions, or zone
         changes are needed, three copies of the plans are stamped and approved. The applicant is then
         referred to the Building Department to obtain the plan check submittal requirements. If however, a
         variance is required, the process stops and the applicant must file a Variance application and
         proceed to the Planning Commission. .
                 [what happened to Step 3?]
        Step 4
         After the Planning staff has approved the Architectural Review Application, the applicant submits
         the plan check set for the home to the Building Department for review and permit issuance. The
         Building Department performs the plan check through a contract company. Depending upon the
         complexity of a project, building plan check for new single family construction averages
         approximately six weeks as long as the initial plan check application is complete.

       Step 5
        After revisions are made and the plan check resubmitted, and the Building Department determines
        that the plans are in compliance and can be approved, the Building Division will contact the
        applicant to come in and obtain his building permit.
For a Multi-Family Development of Four Units Or Less on one pre-existing subdivided lot the
processing procedure is as follows:
The process for Multi-Family Development of four units or less is the same as described above for single
family units except that the review is not performed over the counter but may take two weeks. Multi-family
development of four units or less do not require a Conditional Use Permit or any other discretionary public
hearing approval. The application fee Architectural Review Board for four or less units is $100.00..
For a Multi-Family projects of five or more units on a pre-existing subdivided lot the
processing procedure is as follows:
     Step 1
        The applicant discuses the project with planning staff and is informed that the project will require a
        Conditional Use Permit (CUP) because any multi-family project over four units (5+) requires a CUP.
        A CUP is a discretionary development review application requiring a public hearing. Additionally a
        Mitigated Negative Declaration will most likely be required as well. The typical planning processing
        fee for a multi-family project of five or more units is $2,500.
     Step 2
        The applicant then submits his CUP and CEQA applications to the Planning and Economic
        Development Department for development review.
     Step 3
        Planning Staff then conducts the development review process checking for compliance with all
        applicable zoning regulations and for general plan consistency. If no variances or zone changes are
        needed, the plans are reviewed and revised as needed until the plans are ready for presentation
        before the Planning Commission. The environmental review is similarly prepared and revised as
        needed. The applicant is an integral partner in this plan revision process.
     Step 4
        When the project plans are ready for the Planning Commission the CUP staff report is prepared and
        a Mitigated Negative Declaration finalized for Planning Commission review. Then both items are
        scheduled for a public hearing and notices sent to the surrounding property owners.
     Step 5
     Step 6

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
        After the project is approved by the Planning Commission, The applicant is referred to the Building
        Department to obtain the plan check submittal requirements. The applicant then submits the plan
        check for the multi-family project to the Building Division for plan check review. Depending upon
        the complexity of a project, building plan check for new construction averages approximately six
        weeks as long as the plan check application is complete.
     Step 7
        After revision and resubmittal of the plan check set, and the Building Department determines that
        the plans can be approved, the Building Division will contact the applicant to come in and obtain his
        building permit.
The requirement to obtain a Conditional Use Permit for all multi-family projects of 5 or more units on an
existing subdivided lot with correct zoning is viewed as a possible development constraint to low income
housing. When the City conducts both its Architectural Review Board review and Conditional Use Permit
review the primary goal is the same and that is to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Zoning code
and ensure compatibility with the abutting properties and surrounding area. A possible solution to this
constraint would be to remove any number and simply require compliance with the zoning ordinance
through an administrative site plan application. Possibly an administrative Directors Hearing can serve as
the approval authority to such an administrative application. A Directors hearing will remove compliant
residential developments from review by Planning Commission. This constraint will be further investigated
through the future zoning consistency program after adoption of the General Plan 2030.

Table 29 below shows the variety of housing types that are permitted by right in the various residential zones.
Specifically, a “YES” response means residential land uses such as Emergency, Transitional and Supportive
housing are treated as permitted land uses even though they are not called out in the current Zoning
Ordinance. The City had made policy decision to treat these temporary housing types are permitted by right
land uses and will include them in the upcoming Zoning Consistency Program. A “No” response means that
the land use is not a permitted by right or conditionally permitted land use.

 *= Conditional Use Permit
 An analysis of the current processing procedures and development regulations demonstrates that the City’s
 development review process is not an impediment to the provision of affordable housing. The land use
 controls (zoning development standards) are typical of most Cities in southern California. They regulate the
 placement of the residences through minimum lot size, setbacks, lot coverage, parking and building height.
 For example in Compton a proposed single family detached home in the Residential Agriculture and Low
 Density Residential Zones would require:

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
One requirement for a detached single family home in the City requires a minimum of two bedrooms and
1,200 feet of floor area in the RA and LD zones. This minimum bedroom and floor space requirement could
be viewed as a hardship. However, this along with all of the development standards will be reviewed in the
proposed citywide Zoning Consistency Program update undertaken after the adoption of the General Plan
2030. The City can investigate the possibility of reducing the size standards to permit smaller two bedroom
single family detached homes. However, the Variance process is always available to modify any zoning
development standard necessary to develop an affordable housing project.

For single family detached zones, the maximum density permitted in the RA and RL zones is 0 to 8 units per
acre. The maximum density permitted for multi-family units in the medium and high density residential
zones is 8.1 to 17 and 17.1 to 34 units per acre respectively. These densities are achievable and the present
development standards have not prevented low income or assisted housing developments from being
constructed in the City. The most recent example is the Season at Compton project.
While the most of the development standards for the single family detached and multi-family units are
reasonable, the 1.5 space enclosed garage parking requirement for multi-family seems an appropriate area
for modification in the proposed Zoning Consistency program. Eliminating the garage parking requirement
or reducing the requirement to just one enclosed space or requiring just one carport parking space would
significantly reduce the development costs. The City can also explore the potential of allowing studio units to
provide only one uncovered space reducing development costs even more.                      The City is committed to
exploring all reasonable opportunities of reducing costs while still maintaining development standards that
ensures quality development and does not result in adverse impacts to the health welfare and safety of the
community.
Code Enforcement is a critical function of local government land use. Code enforcement serves to ensure
compliance with adopted zoning codes, to prevent illegal construction and works with the Building and
Safety Department to prevent or correct unsafe living conditions in residences. The City employs 14 code

enforcement officers to patrol the city on a daily basis Monday through Sunday initiating correction notices
and responding to citizen complaints. When a violation is identified, they issue a notice of violation to the
property owner. If the property owner does not address the correction after either the first or second notice
the matter is turned over to the City Attorney for resolution.
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Disabled persons often have unique and special needs when it comes to housing. Often, households in this
category are also occupied by elderly persons.          Special interior improvements are often needed to
accommodate a disabled tenant or homeowner. For example, door frames must be wider to accommodate
wheel chairs, ramps constructed instead of stairs, hand rails in bathrooms need to be installed, cabinet doors
must be accessible, and light switches and other devices may also need to be lowered to be within easy reach.
The cost for retrofitting an existing structure may cost thousands of dollars and be well beyond the reach of
those households with lower incomes. The lack of such housing is more pronounced when it comes to below
market-rate rental units.
The 2000 U. S. Census indicated that 3,434 households in the City (approximately 6.8 percent of the total
number of households in the City) had a senior household member 65 years of age or older. The Census
indicated that 520 senior households lived in their owner-occupied units and 244 seniors lived in their own
rental units. The remaining seniors lived with family members. The development review process and zoning
standards for developments that target persons with disabilities are the same standards applicable to any
typical residential development within the single and multi-family zones. Any residential development with
five or more units requires a Conditional Use Permit and compliance with the standards zoning regulations.
Presently, there are no spacing requirements for any residential project housing persons with special needs.
Additionally, the Limited Commercial zone is also available for development of single and multi-family
housing for persons with disabilities with the approval of a Conditional Use Permit. No extraordinary
development standards apply to the housing of persons with disabilities. However as previously stated, the
City will explore opportunities for reductions in certain development standards where appropriate. For
example, development housing persons with sever learning disabilities or senior citizens that require 24 hour
assisted care may not need to provide the same number of required parking spaces freeing up lot area for
additional common area or additional units.
SPECIAL NEEDS - DISABLED
Senior housing (both owner and rental) often has many of the features outlined above. The real constraints
are associated with the housing for families and working-aged adults. Table 22 indicates the number of
disabled persons in the City arranged according to key age groupings. While the disability figures shown in
the Table 22 may seem excessive, the disability categories include sensory disabilities (such as hearing
impaired persons), mental disabilities, and physical disabilities. Of the working aged adults identified as
having disabilities, approximately 59% were employed.

11.4.3 MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Non-Governmental constraints (Market Constraints) refer to those economic and market factors that may
affect the cost of new housing development. The cost of raw, developable land creates a direct impact on the
cost of a new home and is considered a possible constraint. A higher cost of land raises the price of a new
home. As a general rule, the City's ability to affect market constraints is limited in that these constraints are
typically related to market forces that are common throughout the larger region of Southern California.
These market forces may include, but not be limited to, the cost of land, construction (materials and labor),
and financing.
Even with the current decline in housing values nationwide, recent statistics indicate that Southern
California remains as one of the most expensive housing markets in the country.
In January of 2006 the average sales price for a home was $361,800 with a peak housing price occurring in
April of 2007 at $403,200. Prices thereafter steadily declined until bottoming out in October of 2009 at
$187,500. The average home price then increase slowly to $196,500 in November of 2011. August 2007 is
considered to be the beginning of the current credit crisis that marked the beginning of a continuous trend in
falling median home prices over mid 2007 prices. Rents experienced an increase from a 2000 level of $529
per month to $783 in 2008
Compton has a higher percentage of very low and low income households than Los Angeles County as a
whole. This disparity has important implications for multiple housing issues, such as affordability, type, and
tenure. According to the 2000 Census the overall median household income for the City of Compton was
$48,474 while the median family income was $55,111.
CONSTRUCTION COSTS
 A significant cost factor associated with residential building involves the cost for building materials.
 These costs can account for more than half of the total construction cost. Typical construction costs in the
 area include the following:
      One-level single-family home, stucco on stud frame: $128 per square foot;
      Two-level single-family home, stucco on stud frame: $123 per square foot; and,
      Two to three level apartment, stucco on stud frame: $150 per square foot.
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                PAGE 261

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
 Average construction costs for a 1000 sq. ft. single family home are approximately $128 per square foot.
 Single family lots average $75, 000 when a subdivided vacant 5,000 square foot lot is found. However,
 Compton is approximately 99% built out so costs for vacant unimproved land are do not reflect the true
 costs to buy improved property and redevelop the site. A redeveloped site will typically cost more per
 square foot.
 In the Medium Density Residential zone the average construction cost per 800 sq. ft. multi-family unit is
 $90,000 for materials with land costs adding another $32,400 totaling $122,400.
 In the High Density Residential zone the average construction cost per 800 sq. ft. multi-family unit is
 $90,000 for materials with land costs adding another $18,000 totaling $108,000.
COST OF LAND
 Depending on location and desirability of the site, the cost for land in the area averages $524,607 per acre.
 Individual single family residential lots sell for approximately $75,000. On and off site improvements
 required are limited to infrastructure improvements necessary to ensure the health safety and welfare of
 the community. The City does not require any other impact fees other than school fees.
 The City offers financial assistance through its HOME program to assist developers in the creation of
 low/moderate and special needs housing. The programs are discussed in more detail on page 3-49.
 AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING
The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to purchase a house affects the
amount of affordably priced housing in the City. Fluctuating interest rates can eliminate many potential
homebuyers from the housing market or render a housing project that could have been developed at lower
interest rates infeasible. When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse has been true when interest
rates increase. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic growth in alternative mortgage products,
including graduated mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These types of loans allow homeowners to take
advantage of lower initial interest rates and to qualify for larger home loans. However, variable rate
mortgages are not ideal for low- and moderate- income households that live on tight budgets.
Variable rate mortgages may allow lower income households to enter into homeownership, but there is a
definite risk of monthly housing costs rising above the financial means of that household. Therefore, the
fixed interest rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially during periods of low, stable
interest rates. Table 31 illustrates interest rates as of May 2012. The table presents both the interest rate and
annual percentage rate (APR) for different types of home loans. The interest rate is the percentage of an
amount of money which is paid for its use for a specified time and the APR is the yearly percentage rate that
expresses the total finance charge on a loan over its entire term. The APR includes the interest rate, fees,
points, and mortgage insurance, and is therefore a more complete measure of a loan's cost than the interest
rate alone. However, the loan's interest rate, not its APR, is used to calculate the monthly principal and
interest payment.

       Notes: A conforming loan is for no more than $729,750. A jumbo loan is greater than $729,750.
A major short-term constraint to housing development is the lack of available financing. Presently interest
rates are at historic lows not seen since the early 1950’s. Similarly, the cost of land and construction costs
have declined significantly. However, the ability to obtain residential financing is very difficult, because of
the higher credit standards imposed by the lenders due to the explosion of mortgage defaults and
foreclosures that have occurred due to the lax lending practices of the previous ten years.
Lending institutions are now understandably reluctant to grant residential mortgages to individuals or
developers without 10 or 20% down payment. This more fiscally conservative lending approach however,
could be viewed as a constraint to new housing production. As a result of local, state, and national housing
and economic trends, local developers predict that far fewer housing units will be produced over the next
several years and more capital will be required per unit built.
11.4.4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
This section indicates those constraints that are related to natural or man-made factors that may inhibit new
residential development.
 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
All of the sites identified for future residential development will take place on properties that were previously
developed. As part of the lending process, financial institutions typically require environmental assessments
be completed to ensure that properties subject to redevelopment are free of contamination or that any
potential contamination can be remediated.
The majority of the candidate development sites were developed prior to the 1970s and may include trace
amounts of lead in the structures.               Lead based paint was commonly used prior to 1970 and is the
predominant source of lead contamination in the soils. Asbestos was commonly used in insulation and floor
tiles during this same period. As a result, any rehabilitation or demolition associated with future
redevelopment will likely need some form of investigation and remediation.
 Important points to keep in mind about lead based paint are:
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                  PAGE 263

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
      Exposure to lead-based paint can be harmful to children and adults.
      Three-quarters of the homes built before 1978 contain some lead-based paint.
      Temporary measures to reduce lead exposure range from following specified cleaning techniques to
         good nutrition.
      Permanent measures include structural component removal and replacement, paint removal, and
         covering the painted surfaces.
When properly maintained and managed, lead base paint poses little danger, although a painted surface that
experiences constant frictions such as windows and window sills, doors and door frames, and stairs and
railings are a real concern because of the potential to break the painted surface or cause dust.. Lead-based
paint that peels chips or alligators is especially risky. As a general rule, the older a home is the stronger the
risk of lead-based paint. Exposure to lead dust happens not only through lead-based paint chips and flakes
that you can see, but also through the fine dust that forms. This dust can get on carpets, floors, furniture,
toys and other objects, as well as on the hands of children and adults in the home.
However, there is an important distinction between the presence of lead-based paint and a lead-paint hazard.
The latter poses an immediate threat, while lead-based paint in good condition might pose a hazard
sometime in the future. HUD has a detailed procedure that involves analyzing many painted surfaces in the
home, evaluating the condition of paint, and measuring lead dust concentrations.             A risk assessment
conducted by a qualified professional and will tell the homeowner if there any significant sources of lead
exposure and what to do
Measures to permanently eliminate lead dust hazards include component removal and replacement, paint
removal, and covering painted surfaces. There is no completely safe method for do-it-yourself removal of
lead-based paint. Each paint removal method sandpaper, scrapers, chemicals, and heat guns can produce
lead fumes or dust in the air that can be inhaled. Dust can settle on floors, walls and tables. It can be
ingested through hand-to-mouth contact and re-enter the air through cleaning (such as sweeping or
vacuuming) or when people move throughout the house.
Except for the most elementary measures, dealing with lead removal is a complex task. It often is much
safer, and sometimes more economical to replace painted items and cover painted surfaces. You can replace
a door, molding, or other item yourself if it can be easily removed without creating lead dust. Covering walls
and ceilings with gypsum wallboard, plaster, or paneling (encapsulation) is another potential method. If it is
necessary to strip lead-based paint to maintain historic integrity, remove the item (for example molding)
from the home for stripping. If the painted surface is not peeling or cracking, you can spray the surface with a
sealant. Painting over lead-based paint is not a permanent solution. In 2010 the City conducted testing and
abatement of 14 homes.
TEMPORARY LAND REMOVAL MEASURES:
      Clean up paint chips immediately (duct tape efficiently picks up chips).

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
      Clean floors, window frames, window sills and other surfaces weekly. Use a mop or sponge with
         warm water and a powdered high-phosphate automatic dishwasher detergent or a solution of
         trisodium phosphate (TSP). Wear protective gloves and use two buckets -- one for wash water and
         one for clear rinse water. Always wring dirty water into the wash bucket.
      Thoroughly rinse sponges and mop heads after cleaning.
      Wash children's hands often, especially before they eat or go to sleep.
      Keep play areas and toys clean.
      Keep children from chewing painted surfaces such as window sills or cribs.
      Make sure children eat nutritious, low-fat meals high in iron and calcium (such as dairy products,
         eggs, beans, spinach, and lean red meat). Children with good diets absorb less lead.

 Cortese - Superfund Sites (Format Question)
 There are no Cortese sites or Superfund sites in the City of Compton.
SEISMIC RISK
 Major faults in the region include the Whittier/Elsinore, Norwalk, Newport/Inglewood, Santa Monica,
 Sierra Madre, Palos Verdes, and San Andreas faults. The Newport – Inglewood Fault Zone is the only active
 fault zone that lies within the City of Compton. The fault zone is 75 kilometers in length and runs through
 the southwest corner of Compton. The fault runs northwest to southeast between Central Avenue and
 Avalon Boulevard crossing Rosecrans Avenue, Compton Boulevard, Alondra Boulevard, Walnut Street, and
 Artesia Boulevard. It extends through other surrounding cities, such as Inglewood, Gardena, Long Beach,
 and Culver City.
Because the Newport / Inglewood Fault extends through Compton, in the event of an earthquake, the City
will be subject to surface rupture or ground breakage along the surface of the fault. The most recent major
rupture in this fault zone was the Long Beach earthquake in 1933, which had a magnitude of 6.4. However,
no surface ruptures occurred in that earthquake.
The City of Compton is at moderate risk for serious damage from an earthquake. The Newport-Inglewood
Fault is estimated to have probable magnitudes between 6.0 and 7.4. In addition, a major earthquake on any
of the faults in the Los Angeles Basin could cause significant damage to the City of Compton. These faults
include the San Andreas, San Fernando, San Jacinto, Sierra Madre, and Whittier-Elsinore Faults. Recent
significant earthquakes in the Los Angeles Basin include the San Fernando (1971), Whittier (1987), and
Northridge (1994) Earthquakes. Between 1769 and 1999, there were 33 earthquakes in Southern California
with a magnitude of 5.0 and above.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The faults in the Los Angeles Basin are very active and have the potential to do massive destruction if the City
is unprepared. After 1993, building codes were changed to ensure that new construction would be safer in
the event of an earthquake. The older buildings in the City have a higher risk of being damaged in an
earthquake since they were built prior to the new codes. A number of buildings on Rosecrans Avenue, Long
Beach Boulevard, Compton Boulevard, and Alameda Street need to undergo the requisite seismic retrofit.
There are no designated Alquist-Priolo Special Studies Zones found within the City.
The City of Compton has an Emergency Management Team led by the Fire Department. It is comprised of
various department heads tasked with the obligation to quickly react to an emergency or crisis in the City.
The City conducts annual test runs to ensure that procedures are in place and that staff is prepared to carry
out responsibilities.
WILDFIRE RISK
The City of Compton is an urban environment with little danger of wildfires. There are only three properties
in the City that have the potential for grass fires that can burn, leaving the City a low risk for any wildfires
beyond a minor brush fire. There are nine high-occupancy facilities in addition to the schools in the City that
have the potential to be urban fire hazards. These facilities are the Courthouse, City Hall, the Crystal Park
Hotel, the Compton Fashion Center, the Gateway Towne Center, and four senior-citizen housing complexes.
The Compton Fire Department has four stations serving the City. The City’s fire services include ten front-
line vehicles: four front-line engines, one ladder truck, one air/light unit, two paramedic ambulances and two
basic life support transport units. Thus there no risk to homes of Wildfire in the City of Compton
FLOODING
The Whittier Narrows Dam is 11 miles upstream from Compton. A dam failure would result in flood waters
reaching Compton in approximately 15 hours with a depth of four feet. Dominguez High School and the
adjacent golf course east of the 710 Freeway have the potential to be flooded if the Whittier Narrows Dam has
a dam failure.
The Hansen Dam is 30 miles upstream from Compton. If this dam fails, the water would reach Compton
within twenty hours with a depth of one foot. The northern portion of Compton would flood first and then it
would continue to spread throughout the entire City. School, industrial, commercial, and residential areas
would all be affected by a flood caused by a failure of the Hansen Dam. The Sepulveda Dam is 29 miles
upstream from the City. If this dam has a failure, the flooding would reach Compton within eleven hours
with a one foot depth.       Schools, industrial, commercial, and residential areas would be affected by a
Sepulveda Dam failure. The Los Angeles River drops 800 feet to the ocean over its fifty mile course, nearly
sixteen feet per mile. This steep decent increases the speed of the water and its danger to citizens. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identifies where property owners are required to carry
flood insurance to mitigate the impact of known flood hazards.
Flood insurance was required for the 100-year flood plain of the southern end of the Los Angeles River until
2002 when the US Army Corp of Engineers completed the Los Angeles River Drainage Area (LACDA) flood
control project. The purpose was to strengthen and raise the banks of the Los Angeles River and its

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
tributaries against the possibility of a "100-year flood" which once threatened to devastate an 82 square mile
area from Pico Rivera to Long Beach, including Compton. As a result, Compton homeowners within the Los
Angeles River’s 100-year flood plain are no longer mandated by FEMA to purchase flood insurance.
Compton lies in the floodplain of the Los Angeles River and Compton Creek. Between 1811 and 1994, there
were 30 floods along the Los Angeles River. A 100-year flood is a flood that has a 1% chance of occurring
every year. Most of the area in the City east of Wilmington Avenue was subject to potential inundation by a
100-year flood from the Los Angeles River, which flows from north to south just inside the eastern border.
However, due to the efforts of the US Army Corps of Engineers, this threat no longer exists. Much of
Compton Creek, a tributary of the Los Angeles River, runs through the City and is a potential source of
flooding; although the amount of water running through the creek limits the threat to a much smaller area
and a much smaller incidence of occurrence. The threat of flooding is increased by the “high concentration
of impermeable surfaces that either collect water or concentrate the flow of water in unnatural channels”. As
a result, localized flooding may occur when storm drains become congested and water collects in the street.
Flood Control and Flood Management in the City of Compton is a combined effort between the US Army
Corp of Engineers, the California Department of Water Resources Division of Flood Management, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and local infrastructure. The infrastructure for flood control of the
Los Angeles River system includes five major flood control reservoirs operated and maintained by the US
Army Corp of Engineers and fifteen dams, 143 sediment entrapment basins and 29 spreading grounds
operated and maintained by the Los Angeles Department of Public Works (LADPW). The LADPW also
maintains 470 miles of open flood control channels, 2,400 miles of underground storm drains and 70,000
street drains. The open flood channels range in size from 2 to 600 feet in width and from 2 to 40 feet in
depth.
INFRASTRUCTURE
The City of Compton has a gross acreage of approximately 6,378 acres (10.5 square miles), of which the
Compton Municipal Water Department (CMWD) serves 7.81 square miles. There are approximately 14,000
service connections. Historically, the primary source of supply for CMWD is ground water from wells located
within its boundaries. CMWD is also a member agency of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California (Metropolitan), and has three connections. CMWD’s system is in one pressure zone. Water is
pumped from deep wells, and flows into a grid system, which then distributes it using a gravity fed system.
These wells augmented with water purchased from Metropolitan Water District flows into four 3.3 million
gallon reservoir storage tanks. CMWD overlies the Central Basin, a ground water basin which historically
has provided the city with its principal source of water.
The Central Basin has been adjudicated and the annual pumping allocation for CMWD is 5,723 acre-feet per
year. Water supplies are currently adequate to meet normal domestic needs. CMWD retails water to
approximately 65 percent of the City of Compton. Private water companies provide service to the remaining
residents.
The service area for CMWD currently includes a broad range of housing types and styles; a range of
shopping, professional and commercial services; and light industrial areas. Compton is rapidly emerging as

a large industrial center in Los Angeles County for transit and distribution, business services, high
technology, home and lifestyle products, metals, financial services, and textile manufacturing
CMWD participates with the Water Replenishment District in groundwater management of 163 miles of 4- to
24-inch diameter pipelines, four 3.3 million-gallon steel reservoirs and approximately 10 wells; 4 active wells
and 1 well on standby and 4 that are inactive.          In addition, CMWD has rights to six emergency
interconnections with the following agencies:
      Park Water Company
      Dominguez Water
      Southern California Water
      Midland Park Water
      City of Lynwood Water
      City of Long Beach Water Department
Over the long-term, urban water demand is a function of climate, land use, population, and institutional
factors, all of which affect the amount of water consumed.          In the short-term, water demand varies
considerably on a seasonal, daily, and hourly basis. Both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in
water demand are significant criteria incorporated in the design of water storage, treatment and distribution
systems. Variances in demand are related to a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:
      Temperature and rainfall fluctuations.
      Variations in lawn irrigation use associated with differences in residential density and lot size.
      Variations in the number of persons per household.
      Variations in the concentration of water intensive residential or commercial land uses.
      Differences in greenbelt landscaping requirements.
      Maturity of residential outdoor landscaping.
      Differences in the degree of implementation of water conservation measures.
      Economic growth or recession.
Consumption records indicated that 80% of the yearly consumption is to single family residences.
Historically, per capita consumption rates in fully developed areas tend to increase at a low annual growth
rate. Records show that annual per capita demand has generally decreased. This decrease may be attributed
to the implementation of long-term water use efficiency measures, as well as climactic and economic factors.
The implementation of long term water use efficiency measures is credited with reducing per capita use,
presently averaging 93.8 GPCD

Summarized in Table 32 are projected values for water consumption in measures of both gallons per day
(GPD) and acre-feet per year (AFY). Projections were prepared based on a population projection study
prepared by Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and the average gallons per capita day
water use.

11.4.5 WATER REDUCTION PROGRAMS
RESIDENTIAL PLUMBING RETROFIT
Low-flow showerheads are distributed by CMWD on a continual basis, predominantly during Water
Awareness Month. The water savings were calculated based on an estimated 5.56 GPD per device water
savings.
CMWD partners with the local fire department, nurseries, landscape designers, contractors, and horticulture
growers to educate landowners and promote water efficient landscaping. To improve water use efficiency at
public landscapes and greenbelts, CMWD maintains strategic relationships with the school district and parks
department. CIMIS-based controllers with soil moisture sensors are also used at all City of Compton parks.
HIGH-EFFICIENCY WASHING MACHINE REBATE PROGRAMS
Metropolitan Water District (MWD) coordinates a High Efficiency Clothes Washer (HECW) rebate program
on behalf of its member agencies to include the City of Compton. Beginning in 1995, MWD has partnered
with agencies including Southern California Edison, and CALFED to offer monetary incentives to customers
for the purchase of water saving washing machines. This program has resulted in more than 93,000 HECW
distributions to date.
PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAMS
CMWD utilizes several methods to promote water conservation and resource efficiency. CMWD distributes
information to the public through bill inserts, brochures, paid advertising, and special events held
throughout the year. In 1999, CMWD modified water bills to demonstrate daily water consumption (in
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                         PAGE 269

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
GPD). The bills provide a comparison of each customer’s water consumption in the previous year to that in
the current year for the same billing cycle.
SCHOOL EDUCATION PROGRAMS
CMWD works with the local school district to educate students about water conservation and resource
efficiency.    Programs are targeted to educate students and encourage active involvement in water
conservation. An ULFT distribution program is coordinated with local high schools that enable students to
attend a workshop on water conservation and leadership. In turn, the students act as team leaders that
educate and encourage neighbors and parents to replace their current utilities with low flush toilets. The
program also raised $15.00 for the school per toilet replacement.
RISK MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL,                              AND   INSTITUTIONAL
PROGRAMS
CMWD has identified all large commercial customers within its service area and is encouraging them to take
advantage of recycled water where available. Most commercial sites within CMWD are small retail outlets
with a single restroom, as with all customers within CMWD, they are encouraged to repair any fixtures that
may be wasting water (e.g. running toilets or sinks). CMWD's planning department reviews the building
plans to determine the proper meter size determined by Uniform Plumbing Code (UPC) fixture units, and
line size for any new residential or commercial construction. CMWD also requires the use of water efficient
fixtures before a permit is issued to a new customer. There is an annual review of customers’ water use and
CMWD also offers on-site follow-up evaluations to customers, to assist in the compliance with these
programs. CMWD is also looking into offering rebates for commercial retrofit devices via Metropolitan.
CONSERVATION PRICING
CMWD has a fixed bimonthly service charge, based upon meter size and usage for all customer sectors.
During rationing situations such as in the drought years, CMWD utilizes a block rate structure to encourage
water conservation. Usage above the water budget is billed at a higher rate equivalent to the penalties
imposed on CMWD by Metropolitan for usage above the directed reduction.
WATER CONSERVATION COORDINATOR
CMWD's water conservation coordinator is a function performed for the most part by a combination of
existing water department staff working in conjunction with Metropolitan and the school districts. CMWD
stresses water conservation via distribution of conservation handouts and information booths at various
community events. CMWD has continued to survey the institutions and educators on the number of
programs, materials, and attendance at water conservation activities.
RISK MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS WATER WASTE PROHIBITION
CMWD adopted a "Water Waste Prohibition," by Ordinance Number 1851 on March 12, 1991, which is
actively enforced in drought situations.     To enforce Ordinance 1851, CMWD will issue warnings and
subsequent citations to customers exceeding the conservation constraints. Flow restricting devices may also
be installed for non-complying customers.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
RESIDENTIAL ULFT REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS
In association with Metropolitan, CMWD participates in an ultra-low flush toilet (ULFT) replacement
program. The program began in 1995, and offers rebates to existing customers to help improve water use
efficiency. Old toilets that are returned to the CMWD are recycled and used as crushed aggregate road base
throughout California.
Sewer and street capacity have been also analyzed and found to be adequate to serve the existing and any
potential residential redevelopment during the next planning period.
Based on the information above there are no immediate or projected water, sewer or road capacity
impediments to providing additional affordable housing
HOUSING COSTS
The median home price in Compton as of September 2005 was one third less than the median in Los Angeles

11.4.6 FAIR HOUSING
It is important to examine how the City of Compton laws, regulations, policies and procedures will ultimately
affect fair housing choice. Fair housing choice is defined, generally, as the ability of people with similar
incomes to have similar access to location, availability, and quality of housing. Therefore, impediments to
fair housing choice may be acts that violate a law or acts or conditions that do not violate a law, but preclude
people with varying incomes from having equal access to decent, safe, and affordable housing.
FAIR HOUSING LAW, POLICIES, AND COMPLAINT ANALYSIS
The State of California has a fair housing law that is more expansive than the federal Fair Housing Act. The
City of Compton does not currently have a local ordinance, but it is subject to the California Fair
Employment and Housing Act. The City of Compton provides its citizens with the services of the Fair
Housing Foundation of Long Beach (FHF) for the purpose of fair housing education and public outreach.
Currently, in the City of Compton, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing is charged
with enforcing the state’s Fair Employment and Housing Act.
Between 2005 and 2010, a total of 10 complaints were received and investigated through the HUD Regional
Office and State Fair Housing Assistance Program agency.                Of the advertisements reviewed, no major
violation was found. Generally, most apartment advertisements did include the equal housing opportunity
logo in addition to the wheelchair accessibility logo. Including these logos can be a means of educating the
home seeking public that the property is available to all persons.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The City of Compton receives Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment
Partnership (HOME) and Emergency Shelter Grant (ESG) entitlement allocations. During FY 2010-11, the
City received $3,203,998 in federal entitlement funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) to address the needs, goals, and objectives established in the Annual Action Plan as well
as the five-year Consolidated Plan. In terms of affordable housing unit production, the city was diligent in
achieving goals stated in the Annual Action Plan.
The City’s zoning ordinance and public policies were examined to reveal any current ordinances or policies
that impede fair housing. No concerns were noted as a result. Compton adopted an Affordable Housing
Density Bonus ordinance in 2007 to use incentives to encourage the production of affordable housing within
the city and mitigate some of the barriers to affordable housing listed in the Consolidated Plan.
FOCUS GROUP AND COMMUNITY INPUT ON IMPEDIMENTS TO FAIR HOUSING
Focus groups and community meetings were held to collect input on impediments to fair housing. Attendees
indicated a need to continue the City’s emphasis on mitigating the impacts of discrimination or impediments
to housing choice for protected class members, including ethnic and racial minorities, persons with
disabilities, renters with past criminal records or prior convictions for sexual abuse related crimes, and those
in need of special needs housing or facing evictions, foreclosures and homelessness. Participants wanted
greater emphasis on preventing discrimination and preferences based on race and ethnicity. They cited
increased perceptions that some industry representatives routinely violate fair housing law and the “first
come first served” policy to advantage person of the same race or ethnicity of the majority living in a rental
complex or neighborhood in acquiring housing participants voiced support for continued emphasis on credit
education and housing consumer counseling. Increased financial literacy courses taught in high schools were
seen as solutions as well. They also cited the need for additional funding for fair housing outreach, education
and enforcement to landlords, and homeowner associations and other likely violators of fair housing law.
Participants emphasized the need for increased project based rental assistance and the overall allocation of
Section 8 Vouchers due to increased demand for rental assistance.
HOME MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE ACT (HMDA) DATA ANALYSIS
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) gathers data on home mortgage activity
from the federal agencies that regulate the home mortgage industry.            The data contain variables that
facilitate analysis of mortgage lending activity, such as race, income, census tract, loan type, and loan
purpose.
An analysis of home mortgage disclosure act data did not provide conclusive evidence of fair housing
impediments; the data tend to suggest that redlining may be occurring in some of the low-income census
tracts in the county and the city. While it is expected that low-income applicants would not have a very high
success rate in their loan applications, within the low-income census tracts even high-income applicants
showed a poor success rate. It would appear that lenders might be reluctant to lend in those communities.
In the county and the city, the least success in lending was found in the refinance loan sector and the highest
success was found in home purchase loan sector. Refinance loans were the most frequent loan type in the
city and the county.

Overall, the origination rates among Whites were higher than minorities in home purchase, home
improvement and refinance loans. Although Hispanics and African-Americans accounted for higher number
of applications than Whites, the percentage of loan originations were significantly lower compared to their
percentage in population in the county and the city.
Overall, the mortgage markets seem to have peaked in 2000 and 2001.               Opportunities still exist for
borrowers to buy housing or refinance existing higher interest loans. Rising interest rates appear to be
having an impact on lending activity in the city, with the number of applications slowing in recent years. In

FAIR HOUSING INDEX
The Fair Housing Index is a measure developed specifically for Analyses of Impediments to Fair Housing.
The index combines the effects of several demographic variables with Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
(HMDA) data and maps the results by census tract.
As indicated on Exhibit 3-4, the census tracts designated as having High Risk of having fair housing
problems are concentrated in the central and northeastern census tracts in Compton. Most of the census
tracts in the city have Moderate Risk of having fair housing problems. The areas of high to moderate risk
may contain the older housing stock, more likely in poor condition, with lower housing values and rents, and
are primarily occupied by minority households that have higher percentages of households headed by
females with children than that of other census tracts or areas. There is a higher than average
unemployment rate and lower than average level of educational attainment.

     SECTION 11.5 PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING PREVIOUS HOUSING
                                               OBJECTIVES
As part of the periodic review of the housing element, the City of Compton is required to evaluate its progress
toward achieving the goals contained in the previous element. The City’s previous element anticipated that a
total of 722 new units would be constructed during the 2000 – 2005 planning period. Of these newly
constructed units, 330 units would be for lower income households and 140 units would be for moderate
income households. The City’s goal for rehabilitated units was 400 and for Section 8 rental assistance was
997 households, and up to 290 qualifying households would receive first time homebuyer assistance. In
addition, 313 units of at-risk housing would be preserved for very-low income households.
Table 31 shows the quantifiable housing objectives in the previous Housing Element along with the achieved
results. With the exception of rental assistance the City did not come close to achieving its targets. While
developing the goals, policies, and implementation plan for this Housing Element, staff carefully reviewed
the roadblocks to success during the 2000-2005 period and has developed annual targets to avoid a repeat.
In addition, the housing element has been developed in concert with the objectives for the Comprehensive
Plan for Community Development Block Grant funding as well as the Impediments to Fair Housing to
leverage all of the City’s resources dedicated to providing affordable access to housing.
Table 29 only quantifies the new housing that completed construction during the 2000 – 2005 planning
period. A significant number of projects were initiated during this period and were completed after 2005.
They are reflected in Table 30 below having been completed in the current planning period.
The Government Code, in Section 65588 (a) (2) indicates that the information documenting the results of the
previous Compton Housing Element’s policies should be quantified wherever possible. The majority of the
goals and policies included in the previous Housing Element have been included in this element. Table 32
indicates those policies that were reworded and indicated the corresponding policies that have been included
in this element.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
The results shown in Table 31 reflect that the ongoing Housing Goals and Objectives/Policies for the 2000 –
2005 planning period were for the most part achieved, except for the housing goal of building 722 general
units was not achieved due to the lack of available vacant land of sufficient size in the City or land potentially
available to redevelopment to attain this goal. Looking back it is clear that the goal were too optimistic. The
City’s goal and ability to effectively assist in the rehabilitation of 400 units was also overestimated. Rental
assistance was the one area where the City was able to come close to the attainment of a set goal helping 803
out of 997 units.
The last remaining developable land in the City is the Brickyard site were potentially 1,300 units could be
built. This site is a mixed use site and will provide the City with an opportunity to include low income units
into the development. The recent dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies has brought into confusion the set
aside funds they use for low income residential units. Presently, the plan is for the City Housing Authority
will take over all of the Redevelopment Agency housing programs. The City will continue their Housing
Authority to work with new and existing multi-family property owners to participate in various programs to
provide affordable housing. The development of the new Housing Goals and Policies were reviewed for both
utility and their realistic potential to achieve success in the new Housing Element.

Table 30A shows the accomplishments of the Housing Programs administered by the City between the years
2008 through 2011. This table shows the several Housing Programs for various fiscal years and the actual
accomplishments of each program for each year. This table is different from Table 39 which shows the Goals
of the last Housing Element and the City’s success in implementing those goals as well as whether the goal
was deleted from the new Housing Element or retained. Both tables may have overlapping information, but
Table 40 is not intended to address Housing Element Goals but more specifically certain programs.

   CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
A major focus of the Housing Element is to identify strategies, programs, and sites that will enable Compton
to meet it assigned Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) requirements. For the City of Compton,
the regional housing need is determined by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
pursuant to Section 65584 of the Government Code and is based upon an overall regional housing need
number established by the State. The assigned RHNA for the City calls for a total of 69 units to be provided
during the current planning period. The housing needs are categorized according to the following income
groups and is summarized in Table 33 and graphically illustrated in Exhibit 3-6.
    The Extremely Low Income households are those whose income is 30% or less than that of the median
    household income for the greater Los Angeles area. For the 2006-2014 planning period, the City’s RHNA
    for extremely low income households is 8 units.
       The Very Low Income households are those whose income does not exceed 50% of the median
            household income for the greater Los Angeles area. For the 2006-2014 planning period, the City’s
            RHNA for very low income households is 8 units.
       The Low Income households earn from 51% to 80% of the median. For the 2006-2014 planning
            period, the City’s RHNA for low income households is 10 units.
       The Moderate Income groups earn from 81% to 120% of the median. For the 2006-2014 planning
            period, the City’s RHNA for moderate income households is 1311 units.
       The Above Moderate households earn over 120% of the median income. For the 2006-2014 planning
            period, the City’s RHNA for extremely above moderate households is 30 units.
The RHNA applicable to the City is summarized in Table 3-33. The RHNA is also graphically illustrated in
Exhibit 11-6.
A substantial amount of new housing has been contructed, entitled, or is in the planning review process.
During the current planning period (since 2006), a total of 645 units have been constructed, approved, or are
currently undergoing review. Furthermore, 158 units are designated for lower-come households for seniors
as well as persons that are developmentally disabled.
As indicated previously, those households that have incomes of 30 % of the County median would fall into
the extremely low income category. Based on the 2009 income limits, an extremely low income household
would have the following household incomes: a one person household with an annual income of $16,650 or
less; a two person household with an annual income of $19,050 or less; a three person household with an
annual income of $21,400 or less; and a four person household with an annual income of $23,800 or less.
The HCD indicates that the projected need for extremely low income households may be calculated by
assuming that such households represent 50% of the very low income households. In other words, the future
house need for extremely low income households in Compton is projected to be 168 households.
11 This target was increased to 13 to balance the total RHNA requirement of 69.

SECTION 11.7 ADEQUATE HOUSING SITES INVENTORY
The assigned RHNA for the City calls for a total of 69 units to be provided during the current planning
period. A substantial amount of new housing has been contructed, entitled, or is in the planning review
process. As a result, the City is in a unique position of having already acheived is required housing
allocation.
11.7.1 RESIDENTIAL UNITS PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT PLANNING PERIOD
The RHNA for the City calls for a total of 69 units to be provided during the current planning period. The
RHNA goal has been met and exceeded. During the current planning period (since 2006), a total of 645
units have been constructed, approved, or are currently undergoing review. Table 30 shows the strategies
employed to deliver 260 housing units since 2006 and to have an additional 186 projected to complete
construction in 2011. During this planning cycle, the City of Compton has been involved in a number of
projects identified in Table 35. The status of the major developments is summarized below:
        Alameda Court, LLC Project. The Disposition and Development Agreement between the Agency and
         the Developer provides that the Agency sell to the Developer an approximately 55,661 square feet site
         for the development of 28 two, three, and four bedroom for sale town homes units, including live-
         work units allowing for a home office, with attached garages; a common outdoor area; and a
         community center of approximately 1,550 square feet. Five units were set aside for low-income
         families. The five units were based on $800,000. 00 in HOME funds that were given to the
         developer to set aside the five units. The basis for affordability for these units is the Los Angeles
         County Median income. The City classifies very low, low and moderate income individuals and
         families as those with yearly incomes of $55,111.
     The Seasons at Compton project is senior housing project providing 30 units with restrictions on age
         and income. Of the 30 units within the project located within the City, nine units are for very low

Densities for each of the above properties were calculated using the minimum lot area requirements for the
zones each of the proposed developments would be within. Residential High Density requires 1,500 square
feet of lot area per unit and single family units require a minimum lot size of 5,000 square feet. The densities
shown are maximum gross densities and the ultimate net densities will vary depending on the site design for
each site and compliance with typical development standards. All of the above development sites are not
built and each would need to be rezoned prior to development. Rezoning each site will be part of the General
Plan Zoning Consistency program to follow the adoption of the General Plan.

11.7.2 UNITS CURRENTLY AT RISK FOR CONVERSION
Section 65583 of the California Government Code was amended in 1991, requiring an analysis of subsidized
units and a description of programs to preserve assisted housing developments. The preservation of assisted
units is an issue because the subsidy periods of federally subsidized projects constructed 20-30 years ago are
beginning to come up for renewal or termination.
Ten developments in the City have received mortgage assistance through the Federal Government and/or
State of California. These Ten developments are listed below in Table 38. Table 38 indicates the name,
location, government assistance, affordability controls, and other pertinent information for the government-
assisted projects within the City.
The use restrictions for Section 8 new construction opt-out contract, attach to the properties’ when the
market rate mortgage was issued at the time the contract was entered into by the property owner. The
Section 8 contract guarantees, for the term of the contract that units covered by the contract are rented to
lower income senior citizens. The low income senior citizen pays 30% of his/her adjusted gross monthly
income to the owner or manager while HUD pays the difference between the rent paid by the tenant and the
market rate rent. Market rate rents are determined and reviewed on a yearly basis by HUD.
In the event the owner successfully opts-out of the Section 8 contract the previous low-income senior rental-
housing units would no longer be included in a federal program to guarantee reduced rents.
Since six of the ten projects listed in Table 38 are at risk of going market rate during the next five years. To
terminate the contract the property owner must filed a Notice of Intent with HUD, to opt-out of the Section 8
contract. So far the City has not received a notice that any of the nine assisted units will terminate their
contracts and go market rate.
11.7.3 ASSESSED CONVERSION RISK
The total number of units at risk of going market rate during the next five years is 317 divided up among nine
properties. According to the California Housing and Community Development publication, approximately 15
to 20 percent of at risk properties will opt out of the assisted housing programs for a variety of reasons. This
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                              PAGE 289

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
means that approximately 47 to 63 units is the real number of at risk units that the City needs to work toward
providing in the event the anticipated 15% to 20% of existing property owners opt out.
Therefore, the City is working on three projects that are in the development stage totaling 244 new units.
These projects include Willow Walk, Alameda Court, and Seasons at Compton projects.

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
11.7.4 PRESERVATION OF AT RISK HOUSING PROGRAM
In order to meet the housing needs of persons of all economic groups, the City must guard against the loss of
housing units available to lower-income households. A total of 317 units in nine HUD-assisted projects are
at-risk of conversion to market-rate prior to 2015. The City’s objective is to either retain or replace as low-
income housing all at risk units in the City. The Planning and Economic Development Department will
implement the following programs on an ongoing basis to conserve its affordable housing stock.
     a.  Monitor Units At-Risk - SANTA FE APARTMENTS, WHITFIELD MANOR, and ST TIMOTHY'S
         TOWER, APT are all eligible to prepay their remaining HUD-insured Section 236 loans and opt out
         of low-income use restrictions any time. Section 8 subsidies for units in the four other projects are
         renewed on short-term basis and may not be renewed in the future due either to lack of funding at
         the HUD level or owner decision to opt out of the Section 8 program. In addition, the SANTA FE
         APARTMENTS has a Section 8 contract that expired before the end of 2010. The City will continue
         to monitor these apartments annually.
     b. Work with Potential Purchasers - Establish contact with public and non-profit agencies
         interested in purchasing and/or managing units at-risk to inform them of the status of such projects.
         Where feasible, provide technical assistance and support to these organizations with respect to
         financing. The City should actively pursue affordable housing opportunities and maintain a list of
         interested and qualified affordable housing developers. The City will update this list annually.
     There are a number of housing providers that have been identified by the State HCD as candidate entities
     that could assume responsibility for the at-risk housing should they be converted to market rate units:
      Community Development & Preservation, LLC;
      MBK Management Corporation;
      Community Rehabilitation Services, Inc;
      East Los Angeles Community Corporation
      FAME Housing Corporation;
      Los Angeles Center for Affordable Tenant Housing;
      Los Angeles Housing Partnership, Inc.;
      Los Angeles Low Income Housing Corp. (LALIH); and,
      The East Los Angeles Community Union (TELACU).
c.   Tenant Education - The California Legislature extended the required notification period, requiring
     property owners give a 12-month notice of their intent to opt out of low-income use restrictions. The
     City will work with tenants of at-risk units and provide them with education regarding tenant rights and
     conversion procedures. The City will also provide tenants in at-risk projects information regarding
SECTION 10 – HOUSING ELEMENT                                                                                 PAGE 291

  CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
    Section 8 rent subsidies through the Housing Authority, and other affordable housing opportunities in
    the City.
d. Assist Tenants of Existing Rent Restricted Units to Obtain Priority Status on Section 8
    Waiting List - HUD has set aside special Section 8 vouchers for existing tenants in Section 8 projects
    that are opting out of low-income use. Upon conversion, the units will stay affordable to the existing
    tenants as long as they stay. Once a unit is vacated and new tenants move in, the unit will convert to
    market-rate housing.
FIVE-YEAR OBJECTIVES:
     Preserve all 317 units in the nine at-risk properties.
     The City will monitor, every three months, the status of any HUD receipt/approval of Notices of
        Intent and Plans of Action filed by property owners to convert to market-rate units.
     The City will annually identify and meet and purse funding with non-profit organizations as
        potential purchasers/managers of at-risk housing units.
     As part of coordination with non-profit partners, the City will annually explore funding sources
        available to purchase affordability covenants on at-risk projects, transfer ownership of at-risk
        projects to public or non-profit agencies, purchase existing buildings to replace at-risk units, or
        construct replacement units.
     The City will provide tenant education within 30 days of a notice and assist tenants to obtain special
        Section 8 vouchers reserved for tenants of converted properties.

The replacement cost for the subsidized at risk developments would be prohibitive. In general, the cost for
new land in the city is $18 a square foot. The actual construction cost for residential development ranges
from $118 a square foot up to $129 a square foot. The total projected replacement cost for the at-risk units
identified in Table 3-38B above. This figure assumes that a minimum 5,000 square foot multi-family lot
would be required and each unit would have a total floor area of 850 square feet (two-bedrooms). The land
cost would total approximately $90,000 (assuming $18 per square foot) while the construction cost would
total approximately $109,650 (assuming $129/square feet by 850 square feet per unit $109,650. The
financing cost for each unit would be $100,365 at 45 for 30 years. The total cost per 850 square foot multi-
family unit would be $240,015. The total rehabilitation coast per unit would be $197,649, Table 3-38A
11.7.5 SUCCESSOR (REDEVELOPMENT) AGENCY OWNED SITES
Table 35 indicates those sites that are presently owned by the City of Compton.            These sites are presently
zoned non-residential and have different existing General Plan land use designations. However, the new
Land Use Element of the new General Plan 2030 will re-designate all of the sites listed in Table 35 to
residential land uses.      Moreover, upon adoption of the General Plan 2030, the City of Compton will
undertake a zoning consistency program to rezone a variety of properties whose zoning is not consistent with
the adopted Land Use Element including all of the properties listed in Table 35. These properties could
accommodate up to 228 units based on a density of 30 units per acre. This density formula corresponds to
that identified by the State legislature for urban areas. The locations are shown in Exhibit 11-6.
The CRA is solely responsible for development of these areas and is core objective of the agency. As funds
become available they will continue to facilitate additional developments.
The sites shown in Table 35 can certainly be consolidated through the subdivision process if warranted. Each
site will be viewed within the context of the sites’ location, the configuration of the associated lots and project
site design. The subdivision process typically occurs at the time of project entitlement because this allows for
the most efficient design of lot lines that would accommodate the proposed location of improvements,
accesses and easements.
The sites listed in Table 35 will also become uses by-right under the proposed Zoning Consistency Program
planned for the spring of 2012. When the new zoning ordinance is written these land uses will become uses
by right as will all single family and multi-family uses that meet the minimum code requirements. Densities

   CITY OF COMPTON GENERAL PLAN 2030
will meet the multifamily minimum of 20 dwelling units per acres however due to each sites’ size the smaller
sites may have less total units onsite.
The City’s methodology is to use the Los Angeles County median income as the basis for determining which
units will available to the various income groups whether as a rental or a for sale unit. The projected unit
count for each site shown in table 35 is based on a minimum lot area of 1,500 square feet per unit as specified
in the zoning ordinance for Residential High Density (RH).

11.8.1 QUANTIFIED HOUSING OBJECTIVES
Compton’s quantified objectives for new housing during 2006 – 2014 are listed in Table 32 by housing
strategy. Definitions and examples of each housing strategy are provided below.
#1: DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE TO FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS
       Willow Walk Project: The Disposition and Development Agreement between the former Compton
          Community Redevelopment Agency and the Developer provided that the Agency sell to the
          Developer an approximately 6.5 acre site for the development of 128 for sale residential town homes
          with tandem garages and interior park space. The City provided down payments assistance to 21
          Moderate and 12 Low Income First Time Homebuyers in the form of gap financing to subsidize the
          purchase of newly constructed townhomes. These units were completed in June 2011. All of the
          remaining 95 units are market-rate townhomes. Home funds from the City were used to contribute
          down payment assistance to both moderate and low income 1 st time home buyers in 2008. Because
          Home funds were used the City provided funds based on the calculated Los Angeles County median

11.8.2 PROGRAMS
All potential sources of funding will be actively pursued by the City and particularly the Compton Local
Housing Authority with oversight by the Planning and Economic Development Department in their efforts
to implement the City's Housing Element. In recent years, Compton’s real estate market improved due to
the increased demand for relatively affordable housing that is available in the City compared to other
13
   This target was increased to 13 to balance the total RHNA requirement of 69.

portions of Los Angeles County. Compton's housing programs emphasize the need to strengthen public-
private partnerships. Efforts to cooperate with other public entities and especially with the private sector,
continues to be a priority. The goal is to produce, improve, and protect the City's housing stock utilizing the
CRA tax increment set-aside funds and other housing funds as leverage. Under California Redevelopment
Law, 20% of the tax increment generated by the Agency’s project areas is to be placed into a set-aside fund
and is to be utilized for qualifying housing related activities.
The City will operate the following twelve programs which are described in detail on the following pages
along with the implementation responsibility, funding, schedule, and quantified objectives.
    1.   Housing Choice Voucher Program

Upon adoption of the General Plan 2030 update the City will undertake a comprehensive review of the
residential development standards to determine if any existing standards are acting as constraints upon low
income housing development. Specifically the City will review the parking requirements to possible reduce
the parking requirement from 1.5 enclosed parking spaces to 1 uncovered parking space for low/moderate
income housing units. Additionally, the provision to require a Conditional Use Permit for multi-family unit
projects of 5 or more units on an existing lot within a multi-family zone will be further investigated with the
goal of significantly raising the number or removing the number.

11.8.3 SUCCESSOR AGENCY (REDEVELOPMENT) SET-ASIDE FUNDS
The Compton Redevelopment Agency (CRA) was established in 1971 as a means to eliminate bighted
conditions in the City. The first project area was adopted in 1971 and then combined with the second project
area established in 1973 into one project area totaling 2,635 acres. The project area will expire in 2032. The
CRA sets aside 20% of the tax increment revenue generated from the Agency’s project area. This set-aside is
placed in a separate Low- and Moderate-Income (L&M) Housing Fund and is used for activities that
increase, improve, or preserve the supply of affordable housing. As indicated in Table 39, the expected
accrual of L&M Housing Funds over the planning period ending in the year 2014 is anticipated to be
$43,282,150. The lower half of Table 40 indicates those programs and/or categories that will be funded by
the L&M funds. Since the dissolution of the Redevelopment Agency, the City has taken over all programs as
the Successor Agency.
