                                         LAND USE
     GOAL: Promote land use patterns which maintain safe
     residential neighborhoods, bolster economic prosperity,
     preserve open space, and enhance the overall quality of
     life in Irvine.
                        Description of the Land Use Element
The City of Irvine is a thriving master-planned community with active citizen involvement. Irvine
strives to enhance the quality of life for its residents through the provision of ample recreational,
cultural and social activities, housing, and employment opportunities. Figure A-3, Land Use
Diagram, graphically portrays the land uses in the City.
The Land Use Element seeks to protect and enhance the quality of life in the community. Land use
policies determine how land is developed in the community, ranging from an office building or a
single-family home, to the number of parks and open space areas in the City. Land Use policies
also guide and resolve many land use issues and constraints in order to define the quality of life in
the City.

                                                  and had a population of 20,156. In 1997, the

land use intensity and population density, in
relation to the projected need for land. This         RELATED OBJECTIVE NUMBERS
statistical table represents a historical
baseline for growth monitoring and                 The following objectives are related to the
identification of trends. The nonregulatory        Land Use Element:
statistical table provides the foundation for
monitoring reports on the implementation of        Circulation Element - B-1 through B-7
the General Plan and is not considered part        Housing Element - C-1, C-2, C-4, C-5, C-7
of the General Plan.                               Seismic Element - D-1, D-2

Gross Acreage: Acreage totals for the non-         Noise Element - F-1, F-2
regulatory tables are estimates originally         Public Facilities Element - G-1
derived from the Land Use Element diagram          Integrated Waste Management Element - H-
using a computerized planimeter. Currently,        1, H-2, H-3
the acreage figures are refined through the        Energy Element - I-1
use of the Geographic Information System.          Safety Element - J-1, J-2
As such, the acreage estimates reflect gross       Parks and Recreation Element - K-1, K-2,
acre figures. The gross acre figures include       K-3
rights of way, easements, and flood control        Conservation and Open Space Element - L-1
rights of way, etc. Therefore, the acreage         through L-5, L-7 through L-12
figures are not intended to be a regulatory        Growth Management Element - M-2, M-6,
minimum or maximum with respect to land            M-7
use designations. The gross acre figure may
be revised as more accurate information is
obtained from subsequent development
applications. The acre figure will be
adjusted to conform to precise City
boundaries, road alignments, slope
conditions and other general plan policies
and guidelines through the development
monitoring program.

               MAXIMUM INTENSITY STANDARDS BY PLANNING AREA
                           GENERAL PLAN FOOTNOTES
1. For planning areas not yet annexed, the County of Orange maintains land use authority and
     controls related regulatory activities. Dwelling units and square footage totals may not reflect
     the Orange County General Plan.
2. This designation allows a variety of land uses, including the high-density residential category.
3. Refer to Objective A-4, Policy (a) for additional institutional category requirements. Within
     each planning area, actual intensity is regulated by the appropriate agencies involved. The
     development intensity for institutional uses is in addition to the development intensity
     allowed in the adopted land use category.
4. This designation provides for a variety of land uses and is based upon 63,476 AM (peak
     hour), 76,173 PM (peak hour) and 812,673 ADT as the maximum intensity regulating factor
     (refer to the IBC database), with the exception of Planning Area 4.
5. This designation provides for a variety of land uses, which are regulated by the Irvine Center
     Development Agreement for PA 33. The development intensity is derived from the Irvine
     Center Development Agreement adopted August, 1993. The development intensity for PA
     33 was determined by converting the allowable points (6,300) to gross leaseable square feet
     and then multiplying by 1.15 to achieve a gross floor area. As such, the Irvine Center
     Development Agreement is estimated to allow approximately 8,388,980 square feet of gross
     floor area. An additional 1,514,000 square feet of gross floor area is permitted subject to the
     Zoning Ordinance, for a planning area total of 9,902,980 square feet. With the approval of
     General Plan Amendment 41359-GA (CC Reso. 03-115) in August 2003, residential units
     were introduced into Planning Area 33 and accompanied by a footnote indicating that non-
     residential intensity must be reduced by a set amount for every residential unit built so as to
     avoid any increase in total traffic in Planning Area 33. Based on the approval 3,150 units, the
     maximum gross floor area is approximately 7,955,092 square feet. In addition, adjustments to
     the residential and non-residential intensity figures are allowed, pursuant to this footnote,
     without a requirement to file a subsequent General Plan amendment for those adjustments.
     The actual development intensity within PA 33 may exceed these estimates subject to the
     traffic provisions contained in the Development Agreement. Within Planning Area 4, this
     designation provides for a variety of land uses as provided by the Lower Peters Canyon
     Development Agreement.
6. The permitted range of dwelling units (low-high) may be less than that allowed by the
     available acreage. The residential intensity ranges are based on estimated gross figures and
     may be adjusted through technical refinements to reflect more accurate information at
     subsequent planning levels.

General Plan
Supplement No. 8 June 2012
7. Within Planning Area 12, the multi-use designation allows medium high or high density
     residential use.
8. On September 26, 1988, the "Memorandum of Understanding Implementing Initiative
     Resolution 88-1" was approved, establishing a 10,600 dwelling unit cap for Planning Areas
     17, 18, 22, 26 and 27. In addition, the Memorandum permits up to 800 dwelling units in lieu
     of commercial in Planning Area 26, for an overall cap of up to 11,400 dwelling units.
9. Reserved.
10. The University of California controls land use authority and related regulatory activities.
     Dwelling unit totals are based on the University's Long-Range Development Plan.
11. Total residential Dwelling Units within Planning Area 4 shall not exceed 7,969.
12. Residential uses within Sector 11 of Planning Area 4 shall not exceed 2,830 ADT unless
     additional environmental documentation ensures traffic mitigation.
13. Reserved.
14. Derived from Planning Area 22 Zone Change [16868-ZC].
15. In Planning Area 15, a total of 50,526 square feet of Institutional Uses have been allocated
     equally to two sites designated as High Density Residential. Additionally, 5,939 square feet
     of Institutional Uses have been allocated to a site designated as Multi-Use and located at
     5010 Barranca Parkway. This square footage is considered additive and is not included in the
     Planning Area 15 total intensity caps.
16. The Multi-Use category intensity will be used for Transit Oriented Development in Planning
     Areas 30 and 51, even though the intensity is only shown within PA 51 in this table. The
     units and square footage will be divided between Planning Areas 30 and 51 through the
     implementation of a Master Plan for Transit Oriented Development.
17. The 1,254,500 square feet in Institutional/Public Facilities in Planning Area 51 includes
     122,500 square feet for Orange County Transit Authority facilities; 300,000 square feet for
     County of Orange facilities; 263,000 square feet for warehousing for homeless providers
     (Buildings 319, 322, and 360); 468,000 square feet of institutional uses; 26,000 square feet of
     sports park; and 75,000 square feet of any public facilities that are permitted by the General
     Plan and as defined in the Zoning Ordinance. 7,800 students are allowed in conjunction with
     institutional/educational use within the Lifelong Learning District.
City of Irvine                                A-23                           Land Use Element
General Plan
Supplement No. 8 June 2012
18. In order to develop at the maximum intensities as established under the Overlay Plan for
     Planning Areas 30 and 51, the property owner has entered into a development agreement,
     (recorded on July 12, 2005), which will require the dedication of land and the development or
     funding of infrastructure improvements in excess of the City’s standard requirements, and the
     commitment to long-term maintenance of public facilities.
19. To the extent that residential units are built in PA 33, within the 4.7C Urban Commercial
     District, a corresponding reduction in the allowable non-residential intensity shall occur in
     terms of equivalent traffic generated. The actual amount of reduction in non-residential
     intensity will be based upon a conversion rate of 648 square feet of non-residential intensity
     per dwelling unit (as established in the traffic analysis “City of Irvine Spectrum 1 Traffic
     Analysis” July 2003). Revisions to the non-residential and residential intensity figures for
     PA 33 (consistent with this note) are authorized without the need for a subsequent general
     plan amendment.
20. Reserved.
21. The maximum residential density in the 5.0 IBC Mixed Use district in Planning Area 36 is 0-
     52 dwelling units per gross acre except that the maximum allowable density may be increased
     to 0-56 dwelling units per gross acre if the development provides 20 percent of the units in
     the development as on-site affordable housing in accordance with the following criteria:
              Five percent of the units for Income II (30-50 percent of median area income); and
              Five percent of the units for Income III (50-80 percent of median area income); and
              Ten percent of the units for Income IV (80-120) percent of median area income).

23. Development Agreement 00310468-PDA vested certain entitlements for the Park Place
     development (collectively, the “Vested Park Place Entitlements”). The Vested Park Place
     Entitlements include the right to allocate the maximum permitted intensity of development
     within Park Place among the various permitted and conditionally permitted uses utilizing the
     development points system set forth in Section V.E.-736.5 of the 1989 Zoning Code (the
     “1989 Point System”). The maximum intensity limits for Planning Area 36 allow for up to
     3,450 dwelling units within Park Place subject to an overall intensity limit 8,567,880 total
     points under the 1989 Point System which have been allocated to Park Place under the
     Vested Park Place Entitlements. To the extent that the 3,450 maximum unit entitlement is not
     developed at Park Place, non-residential uses may be developed at Park Place by utilizing
     unused points under the 1989 Point System. Total construction within Park Place shall not
     exceed any of the following intensity limits: 3,450 residential dwelling units and 8,567,880
     points under the 1989 Point System.
24. Reserved.
25. Unallocated dwelling units represent those units remaining in a Planning Area that may be
     built anywhere in the same Planning Area. These units are within the maximum development
     intensity for the Planning Area; and, therefore placement of unallocated units into any
     residential category within the planning area for purposes of development is determined to be
     consistent with the General Plan and Zoning Code with regard to intensity allocation only,
     provided that placement is otherwise consistent with site specific zoning regulations and that
     any potential environmental impacts are adequately addressed, including traffic impacts,
     pursuant to CEQA. Additionally, unallocated units in Planning Area 4 cannot be transferred
     between sectors per an existing development agreement.
26. The Master Affordable Housing Program, including a Density Bonus Agreement by and
     between the City of Irvine and property owner entered into on November 6, 2008 vests
     property owners’ right to develop 1,269 density bonus units for a total of 4,894 units in
     Planning Areas 30 and 51. Up to 1,269 of the density bonus units included in PA 51 can be
     transferred to PA 30.

27. Density Bonus units granted pursuant to state law.
28. The development intensity allocated to 8.1A equates to 175,000 square feet of office use and
     325,000 square feet of Research and Development use with a post-2030 trip limit of 5,115
     average daily trips, 506 am peak hour trips and 509 pm peak hour trips based on NITM land
     use rates. To the degree residential units, up to a maximum of 790 dwelling units, or other
     uses are built in 8.1A, a corresponding reduction in the allowable Office and/or Research and
     Development intensity shall occur in terms of equivalent traffic generation based on a.m.
     peak, p.m. peak, and average daily trips. The actual amount of reduction will be based on
     land use based traffic generation rates, and using an average trip generation rate (10.73 ADT,
     0.98 am peak hour trips and 0.94 pm peak hour trips per 1,000 square feet of office use and
     9.96 ADT, 1.03 am peak hour trips and 1.06 pm peak hour trips per 1,000 square feet of
     research and development use) for Office and/or Research and Development intensity and
     the applicable rates for any proposed non-office use, as determined by the Director of
     Community Development.
29. The IBC Vision Plan, adopted by City Council in July 2010, assumed a theoretical total of
     2,038 density bonus units. This total is based on 655 total density bonus units existing, under
     construction, approved, or in process at the time of Vision Plan adoption, plus an additional
     1,383 potential density bonus units based on the maximum allowed pursuant to state law for
     the 3,950 potential base units identified to reach the 15,000 base unit cap at the time of
     Vision Plan approval.

                            GENERAL PLAN FOOTNOTES
1. Community Parks and some open space spines located within Recreation land use category in
     Planning Areas 4, 5, 10, and 38 are conceptual. Unless specified in the Conservation and
     Open Space Element or the park code, the size of the open space spines or Community Parks
     will be determined concurrent with subsequent development applications.
2. Planning Area 3 includes a 730 acre Landfill overlay on the Recreational land use
     designation.
3. Planning Area 22 includes a 620 acre Golf Course overlay on the Residential land use
     designation.
4. Planning Area 27 includes a 58 acre Landfill overlay on the Recreational land use
     designation.
5. Planning Area 29 includes a 33 acre Landfill overlay on the Recreational land use
     designation.
6. Institutional acreage within Planning Area 4 represents a goal, not a requirement. Per the
     Lower Peters Canyon Development Agreement, institutional uses for Planning Area 4
     include: public & private schools; churches; libraries; post offices; police stations; fire
     facilities; day care centers; utilities; public facilities; hospitals; government offices;
     eductional facilities; non-profit housing, and institutional residential.
7. The Planning Area 30 and 51 total acreage figures include all General Plan Land Use
     categories as well as railroad and roadway rights-of-way. The railroad and roadway rights-of-
     way acreage has not been divided into individual General Plan Land Use categories.
     Therefore, the total acreage in Planning Areas 30 and 51, although correct, is greater than the
     sum of the individual General Plan Land Use categories in each planning area.
8. In order to develop at the maximum intensities under the Overlay Plan for Planning Areas 30
     and 51, the property owner has entered into a development agreement (recorded on July 12,
     2005), which requires the dedication of land and the development or funding of infrastructure
     improvements in excess of the City’s standard requirments, and the long-term maintenance of
     public facilities.

   GOAL: Provide a balanced transportation system.
                      Description of Circulation Element
The overall Citywide circulation system can influence the pace of urban development and
facilitate interaction among the planning areas. Irvine’s circulation system has been
designed to:
     Create a hierarchy of roadways.
     Reinforce boundaries of planning areas.
     Respond to conservation, noise, air pollution, and wildlife preservation policies.
     Satisfy City General Plan and Strategic Business Plan objectives.
Four different types of systems compose Irvine’s circulation system: air, road, public
transit, and trails. This element describes the nature and extent of the existing circulation
network, and identifies trends, issues, and public policies relating to the development of a
balanced, multi-modal circulation system for Irvine.

                                          SEISMIC
   GOAL: Minimize the loss of life, disruption of goods and
   services, and destruction of property associated with an
   earthquake.
                             Description of Seismic Activity
A seismic event, or earthquake, is the movement of the earth's crust along a fault. The impact of
a seismic event on any given location depends on two factors: geologic setting and geologic
conditions.
Geologic setting refers to an area's proximity to active earthquake faults. A fault is a fracture in
the earth's crust forming a boundary between rock masses that have shifted. For planning
purposes, an active fault is usually defined as a fault that shows movement within the last 11,000
years and can be expected to move within the next 100 years.
Geologic conditions refer to the stability of the soil during an earthquake. For example, loose,
unconsolidated soil is more prone to liquefaction during an earthquake than compacted soil or
rock. The City of Irvine and sphere of influence are located in Seismic Zone 4, as identified in
the Uniform Building Code. This zone indicates the highest classification of the four zones in
the United States, with the most stringent requirements for building design. In addition, the
Seismic Element evaluates five general types of geologic conditions called Seismic Response
Areas (SRA), which are described in the Existing Conditions Section of this Element and shown
in Figure D-3.
This element identifies seismic hazards and discusses strategies for reducing disasters. Due to
the strong relationship between this element and the Safety Element, both elements should be
considered together in identifying the location and type of development permitted in the City, in
developing building standards and in providing services to City residents.

                        CULTURAL RESOURCES
   GOAL: Ensure the proper disposition of historical,
   archaeological, and paleontological resources to minimize
   adverse impacts, and to develop an increased understanding
   and appreciation for the community's historic and prehistoric
   heritage, and that of the region.
                         Description of Cultural Resources
This element recognizes the importance of historical, archaeological, and paleontological
resources in the City of Irvine and establishes a process for their early identification,
consideration, and where appropriate, preservation.
Cultural resources are the physical remains of the City's historic and prehistoric heritage.
Historical resources include sites established after 1542 A.D., the date when European contact
with California began, which may be significant to history, architecture, or culture.
Archaeological resources include any location containing evidence of human activities which
took place prior to 1750 A.D. Historical sites established prior to 1750 A.D. are also
archaeological sites. Paleontological resources include any location containing a trace of plants
or animals from past ages.
Paleontological investigations have shown that the area was previously a marine environment.
Archaeological investigations have shown that native Americans arrived within this area about
9,000 years ago. The area's diverse natural resources supported a large population of these native
hunters and gatherers. In 1769, the base of the Santiago Hills was first traversed by the Spanish
explorer Don Gaspar de Portola. In the 1830s Don Jose Andres Sepulveda began ranching
operations. In 1876 James Irvine purchased and consolidated open range land stretching from
the Santiago Hills to the Pacific Ocean into the Irvine Ranch. In 1971, the City incorporated,
which coincided with the start of urban development of a large portion of the Irvine Ranch.
Because of its past, Irvine has many cultural resources which are protected through the policies
established in this Element.

                                           NOISE
   GOAL: Contribute to a healthy and safe environment by
   minimizing noise impacts.
                             Description of Noise Element
Noise, as defined in this element, is generally unwanted sound which is considered unpleasant
and bothersome. Unwanted noise can affect people both physically and psychologically. People
are usually more sensitive to noise during the evening and nighttime than during the day because
of reduced activities, fewer noise emitting sources, and the need for rest. Land uses in which
people are especially sensitive to noise include residential, convalescent and rest homes,
hospitals, libraries, churches, and schools. This element provides guidelines for minimizing
noise impacts from various sources.
The Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL), commonly used by California local
governments, is used by Irvine to quantify community noise levels and standards. The CNEL is
an average of noise levels over a twenty-four hour period. Refer to technical definitions on Page
F-3.
The City's interior and exterior noise standards are shown on Table F-1. Table F-2 shows each
land use category and the CNEL which is compatible with the uses in the category.

Unwanted noise is divided into two major
categories of noise sources - mobile and
stationary.

                                                   levels.
Achieve maximum efficiency in
noise abatement efforts through
intergovernmental coordination and
public information programs.
The following policies support
Objective F-3:
Policy (a): Coordinate efforts to reduce
  noise impacts with appropriate public and
  government agencies.
Policy (b): Monitor federal and state
  legislation and programs which will
  reduce noise in Irvine.
Policy (c): Use police power to enforce the
  appropriate noise standards in the state's
  motor vehicle code and other state and
  federal legislation for mobile noise
  sources.
Policy (d): Encourage appropriate agencies
  to maximize the use of noise reducing
  equipment in the City.
Policy (e): Seek the cooperation of aircraft
  regulatory agencies in the modification
  and selection of flight paths which will
  reduce noise impacts on residential and
  other noise sensitive areas.
Policy (f): Monitor and update, as needed,
  the City Noise Ordinance so that it will
  continue to be effective in restricting noise
  from stationary sources.

Interpretation
Zone A                 Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional
Clearly Compatible     construction without any special noise insulation requirements.
Zone B                 New construction or development should be undertaken only after detailed analysis of the noise reduction
Normally Compatible    requirements are made and needed noise insulation features in the design are determined. Conventional construction,
                       with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice.
Zone C                 New construction or development should normally be discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed,
Normally Incompatible  a detailed analysis or noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features must be
                       included in the design
Zone D                 New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

 Noise Mitigation Measure Definitions               RELATED OBJECTIVE NUMBERS
 Alignment: In the context of highway            The following objectives are related to the
 noise        assessment,    the     three-      Noise Element:
 dimensional position of the road.
                                                 Land Use Element - A-6
 Barriers: Any solid material that               Circulation Element - B-2, B-7
 shields a receiver from a given source          Housing Element - C-2
 of noise. Types of barriers include             Public Facilities and Services Element - G-1
 walls, berms, hills and intervening             Integrated Waste Management Element – H-2
 structures. Most often, the term “noise         Conservation and Open Space Element - L-6
 barrier” refers specifically to sound           Growth Management Element – M-3
 walls or berms intentionally placed in
 such a way as to re-direct noise away
 from receiver locations (e.g., sound
 walls along a highway).
 Lateral separation: The horizontal
 distance between the road          and a
 receiver.         With new roadway
 construction, there is sometimes the
 flexibility to position the alignment
 within the right of way in such a way
 as to maximize the lateral separation
 (or buffer) between the road (noise
 source) and the nearest receivers (e.g.,
 residences).
 Vertical Profile:        The path of a
 roadway in the vertical direction.
 Roadways can be designed to be
 below-grade (depressed), above-grade
 (elevated), or at-grade relative to areas
 adjacent to the road. Generally, traffic
 noise levels along depressed roadways
 are substantially lower than those
 along roadways that are at grade.
 Elevated roadways also reduce traffic
 noise (relative to at-grade conditions)
 but only within the first few hundred
 feet of the road.

                    Description of Public Facilities and Services
Public facilities are defined as institutional responses to basic human needs, such as health,
education, safety, recreation, and worship. Examples of typical public facilities include
churches, hospitals, and police stations. Public facilities contribute to the quality of life for both
individuals and groups in the community. They provide convenient and efficient services, a
sense of identity, and define the visual character of the City. This element provides policies and
criteria for the development of various types of community facilities, their relationship to one
another, and their location to serve the needs and desires of the community.
Public facilities and services are provided by every level of government, and other public and quasi-
public organizations. Public services and facilities are often provided jointly by more than one of
these agencies to reduce costs. The City of Irvine is just one local public agency of many that serve
the residents of Irvine. Certain types of public facilities and services have been determined to be of an
essential nature to a community and are provided by the private sector as a requirement of residential
development in the city. Public facilities and services required for new residential development are
based on population generated by the new development, and include park land and facilities, police
services, fire services, school facilities and libraries. Other public services and facilities are desired to
address the needs of specific populations or strong public demand, such as senior centers, child care
centers, and golf courses. Tables G-1 and G-2 at the end of this chapter outline the City’s standards
and guidelines for certain public facilities and services.
The need for public facilities or services is based on an analysis of user need and demand, the
characteristics of the user population, the location of services, and the cost to develop, operate and
maintain the services. Consideration is also given to reducing the duplication of services between

agencies, and providing services within the financial means of the potential user groups. For public
services and facilities which are provided solely or jointly by the City of Irvine, this analysis is
considered as part of the Strategic Business Plan, the annual Operations Budget and the Capital
Improvement Program. For public facilities and services of a recreational nature, please refer to the
Parks and Recreation Element, and for those related to public safety, please see the Safety Element.
Existing Conditions
City facilities and services include
neighborhood parks, community parks and
programs, the Civic Center, the Aquatics
Center, and police services. The City jointly
provides other facilities with other public
agencies including a community theater, child
care centers, athletic complexes, an adult day
care center, transportation services and fire
stations. These facilities are provided through
joint development, joint use or through joint
powers authorities.

                        Public Facilities and Services Standards
POLICE SERVICES:
     Police services are provided by the City of Irvine Public Safety Department. The staffing goal
     for police department in the Year 2000 is 1.14 officers per 1,000 population. Staffing goals
     are adjusted annually as addressed in the City's Strategic Business Plan to ensure that, at a
     minimum, the following emergency response standards are met (Residential Night-time
     Population Standard):
          Responding to Priority E (Emergency) events within 6 minutes 85% of the time.
          Responding to Priority I (Crimes in Progress) events within 10 minutes 85% of the time.
          Responding to Priority II (Less Serious Crimes Now Occurring) events within 20 minutes
          90% of the time.
FIRE SERVICES:
The Orange County Fire Authority was formed in 1995 as a joint powers authority and is
governed by a 21 member Board comprised of representatives of the 19 cities and the
unincorporated area it protects. As a partner agency, Irvine receives regional fire protection and
emergency services from one of the largest regional fire
service organizations in California, currently with over 61
fire stations. Within the City, OCFA operates 6 fire
stations with additional stations planned for the Irvine
Spectrum and the general area east of Northwood Point.
OCFA is a full service emergency response agency which
is able to take advantage of the versatility, skills, and
availability of resources and management that can be
shared and deployed without regard for jurisdictional
boundaries OCFA provides fire suppression, emergency medical, rescue, and fire prevention
services.      The Authority also handles hazardous materials coordination and wildland
management.
The policy of the OCFA for fire protection and emergency services in Irvine is as follows:

General Plan
Table G-1 (Con’t)
          For fire and basic life safety incidents in urban areas, a first due unit on scene within a five (5)
          minute response time for 80% of the time.
          For advanced life support incidents, units shall be located and staff available within eight (8)
          minutes response time, 80% of the time.
Irvine's fire services are provided from two types of facilities, Battalion stations and Fire stations.
Equipment included at each station is determined by the OCFA. The OCFA Fire Station Design
Guide provides useful information and guidelines necessary to design and construct an essential
fire station facility. Stations consist of either a large battalion station headquarters station or a
standard small station which can house at least two apparatus. A station site would require a
minimum one acre, flat buildable site, typically with good circulation and access to arterial
highways.
SCHOOL FACILITIES:
The Irvine Unified School District (IUSD) serves the majority of the City's residential neighborhoods.
Other school districts which serve Irvine residents includes the Santa Ana Unified School District and
the Tustin Unified School District.
Each school district’s student generation rate changes over time. The rates are based upon factors
such as the density and type of new development, and new or existing residential units. In the IUSD,
the typical school sizes are as follows:
     Elementary School (K-6): Permanent core building to house 600 students, with provisions for
     relocatable buildings to house a maximum of 720 students on an average site of 10 acres.
     Middle School (7-8): Permanent facilities for 700 students with provision for relocatable
     buildings and short term overload of facilities to house a maximum of 900 students on an average
     site of 20 acres.
     High School (9-12): Permanent facilities for 1,800 students with provisions for relocatable
     buildings and short term overload of facilities to house a maximum of 2,400 students on an
     average site of 40 acres.

Integrated Waste
Management
                                                 ELEMENT H
              INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT
    GOAL: Encourage solid waste reduction and provide for the
    efficient recycling and disposal of refuse and solid waste
    material without deteriorating the environment.
             Description of Integrated Waste Management Element
Integrated waste management is described as a system for reducing, collecting, recycling and
disposing of waste products generated by residential, institutional, commercial, and industrial
land uses. Waste can be liquid and solid, hazardous and non-hazardous. The collection and
disposal components of waste management are further described as follows:
1.        Solid, Non-hazardous Waste.
Solid waste collection is usually accomplished by picking up refuse at the sources via collection
vehicles, separating out recyclable materials at transfer stations, and then transporting the
residual material
Solid wastes can be disposed of in several ways such as sanitary landfill, recycling, waste-to-
energy, and composting.
                                              Solid Waste Disposal Methods
Sanitary Landfill - An area where waste is dumped, then buried beneath a layer of earth. Landfills are usually
equipped with a liner to reduce soil and water pollution from contaminated seepage.
Recycling - The process of recovering useful materials from solid waste, including items for reuse.
Waste-to-Energy - The only renewable energy technology that provides communities with dual environmental
benefits: a clean source of electricity and clean trash disposal. In the waste-to-energy process, trash is used as a fuel
to generate power such as electricity or steam for central heating or cooling.
Composting - The process of converting yard waste into a usable organic compost. This process allows the
conservation of valuable landfill space and also provides an excellent soil amendment.

General Plan
2.        Liquid, Non-hazardous.
Liquid, non-hazardous wastes are usually collected through a sewer system and treated at a waste
water treatment facility with the liquid waste (effluent) being disposed of in the ocean or treated
for reuse as reclaimed water. The resulting sludge can be disposed of in a sanitary landfill,
sludge farm, or eliminated through incineration.
3.        Hazardous Waste.
Hazardous wastes are required by state law to be recycled, treated on site or treated at a
designated waste treatment facility whereby hazardous materials are neutralized prior to final
disposal.
Liquid hazardous wastes are either treated at the waste source to neutralize hazardous
components and then placed in the sewer system, or nontreated hazardous wastes are collected in
specifically designed collection vehicles for ultimate disposal.

                                         ENERGY
   GOAL: Promote energy conservation and the use of
   renewable energy sources throughout the City in a cost
   effective way.
                   Description of Energy and Energy Sources
Energy is defined as anything that makes it possible to do work and cause movement against
resistance. The use of energy depends upon the availability of sources and development of the
technological skill to use them.
Energy sources can be categorized as nonrenewable or renewable. Nonrenewable energy sources
cannot be restored, whereas, renewable sources can be harnessed indefinitely. Examples of
nonrenewable sources are petroleum fuels and natural gas. Renewable energy sources include
solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal steam.
Nonrenewable energy sources are subject to price fluctuation and interruptions in supply. In
addition, air pollution, water pollution and acid rain are some examples of the by-products
produced from converting petroleum fuel to energy. These by-products are not associated with
most renewable sources. Substituting renewable for nonrenewable sources and conserving
energy will reduce the chance of a future energy crisis and will result in a cleaner environment.
This conservation can be accomplished through reduced consumption, increased efficiency and
changes in individual behavior.
This element provides a basis for long-range energy planning. In addition, it summarizes
information on energy supply and demand. The associated state and local objectives, when
implemented, will result in efficient energy consumption by the City and its residents, businesses,
and industries.

   GOAL: Minimize the danger to life and property from man

   hazards, non-seismic geologic hazards and air hazards.
                              Description of Safety Element
Community safety programs can reduce the potential for loss of life, injuries, and property damage
associated with natural and man-induced hazards. These hazards include fire, floods, geologic
hazards, and aircraft operations. This element provides guidelines for the protection of the
community from these hazards. Both the Seismic and Safety Elements should be considered
together in the planning process for the provision of a safe environment. Refer to the Seismic
Element for identification of seismic hazards and policies to minimize them.

                        PARKS AND RECREATION
   GOAL: Provide park and recreation opportunities at a level
   that maximizes available funds and enables residents of all
   ages to utilize their leisure time in a rewarding, relaxing, and
   creative manner.
                         Description of Parks and Recreation
A park is defined as any public or private land set aside for aesthetic, educational, recreational, or
cultural use. It is related to open space, which is all land and water in an urban area not covered
by buildings. The amount of park land required for dedication is established at the time of
subdivision approval through the implementation of the Irvine Subdivision Ordinance (referred
to as the Park Code). The Subdivision Ordinance establishes park credit standards and provides
for any exceptions for dedication (i.e., housing incentives). Developers of residential subdivisions
are required to dedicate park land, or pay fees in lieu of dedication, at the rate of five (5) acres per
thousand (1,000) population consistent with the standards contained in these codes. The allocation of
land is apportioned as follows:
                         Community Parks:       2 acres
                         Neighborhood Parks: 3 acres
The City of Irvine's public park system is divided into two park categories: community parks and
neighborhood parks. Neighborhood parks are further divided in public or private parks.
Recreational facilities and services are also provided by the private sector and by jurisdictions other
than the City. For example, Irvine also has a county regional park and several commercial
recreational facilities. This element establishes guidelines for the orderly development of Irvine's
park and recreation facilities.

                         Parks and Recreation Facility Descriptions
PARK FACILITIES: There are five types of park facilities provided in Irvine. Each type is
described below:
          Regional Open Space: Regional open space areas are lands primarily acquired thorough the
          dedications agreed to under the Implementation Actions Program of the Conservation and
          Open Space Element. Once dedicated to the city the land becomes permanent public open
          space area. These areas vary in size and location throughout the City and may have full or
          limited public access depending on the environmental sensitivity.
          Regional Parks: Regional parks are owned by the County of Orange and managed by the
          Harbors, Beaches and Parks Department. There is no mandated dedication standard or park
          size required. Regional parks can be active or passive parks.
          Community Parks: These parks are generally a minimum of 20 acres in size (excluding
          greenbelts, trails and school grounds) and able to serve a population of 10,000 persons. An
          exception to this standard exists in Lower Peters Canyon (Planning Area 4) where community
          parks may be a minimum of 10 acres in size (excluding greenbelts and school grounds).
          Community parks are owned and maintained by the City. Colonel Bill Barber Marine Corps
          Memorial Park, Heritage Community Park, Harvard Community Park and Turtle Rock
          Community Park are examples of community parks in Irvine. Community parks are
          developed with facilities that are Citywide in scope and are intended to serve more than one
          residential village.
          Public Neighborhood Parks: These parks are generally a minimum of 4 acres in size
          (excluding greenbelts, trails and school grounds) and able to serve a minimum population of
          2,500 persons. Public parks are owned and maintained by the city. Orchard Park, San Carlo
          Park and Chaparral Park are examples of public neighborhood parks.
          Private Neighborhood Parks: These parks are a minimum of one third of an acre in size and
          able to serve the immediate development or specific planned community in which they are
          located. Private parks are owned and maintained by homeowner associations or maintenance
          district. They are generally a minimum of one third of an acre in size for developments with
          densities under 30 dwelling units per acre and a minimum of 6,000 square feet in size for
          developments with densities over 31 dwelling units per acre, except for developments in
          Planning Area 36 where the parks will comply with provisions contained in the “IBC
          Residential Mixed Use Vision and Overlay Zoning Code.”

               CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE
   GOAL: Maintain and preserve the environmental systems as a
   major feature in the City.
                  Description of Conservation and Open Space
Conservation is the wise use, management, and preservation of natural resources to assure their
continued availability and viability. Open space is defined as lands which provide for the
preservation of natural resources such as plant and animal habitat, managed production of
resources, outdoor recreation, or public health and safety (i.e., air crash hazard zones).
Since conservation of resources and open space are so closely related, these two required
components of the General Plan are combined into one element. This element provides long-term
guidance for the preservation of significant natural resources and open space areas. The value of
this element is threefold. First, it provides mechanisms for ensuring a balance between the urban
and natural environments within the City. Secondly, it recognizes natural and man-made hazards
which might potentially affect the community if development were to occur. Finally, it provides
specific policies and a program for preserving, managing, and using natural and man-made
resources.

 Identification of Issues
 1. How can conservation and open
      space objectives be balanced with
      development objectives?
 2. How can conservation and open
      space areas be integrated into urban
      development?
 3. How can public access and
      enjoyment of conservation and open
      space areas be provided?
 4. How can the environmental systems
      be maintained and preserved?
 5. How can significant hazards and
      resource areas be identified and
      managed so as to protect the
      public's safety, health and welfare?
 6. How can an effective and realistic
      policy program provide for the
      permanent preservation and
      management of conservation and
      open space areas be established?

                        GROWTH MANAGEMENT
   GOAL: To ensure that growth and development are integrally
   planned with, and phased concurrently with, the City of
   Irvine’s ability to provide an adequate circulation system and
   public facilities.
                         Description of Growth Management
In November 1990, Orange County voters approved a Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth
Management Ordinance. This ordinance imposed an increase to the retail sales tax by 1/2 cent
for a twenty-year period for the funding of transportation-related improvements. The sales tax
will generate a return of retail sales tax and discretionary revenues to each jurisdiction for use on
local and regional transportation improvements as well as maintenance of existing roadways. To
receive a portion of these revenues, the City must satisfy the requirements established by the
countywide Growth Management Program. This element comprises a series of objectives and
policies to carry out the goals of the program and ensure that growth and development are based
upon the City's ability to provide an adequate circulation system and public facilities.
Although the City of Irvine General Plan currently provides policy discussion regarding growth
management, congestion management, air quality, and a balanced land use mix, it is the City's
goal to participate in on-going countywide efforts to implement traffic improvements while
recognizing local land use authority. The intent of the Growth Management Element is to
establish the basic policy framework for future policies and programs within a single general plan
element.
Existing Conditions
As the City of Irvine and surrounding                   relevant transportation programs as
communities continue to grow, the                       identified within the City's Circulation
transportation network must be completed to             Element provided that associated impacts
commensurate with new development.                      can be adequately mitigated:
Therefore, Irvine supports the following

               IRVINE BUSINESS COMPLEX (IBC)
     GOAL: To create a cohesive planning framework for
residential and mixed use development in the IBC that is
compatible with existing non-residential development.
                            Description of the IBC Element
The IBC Element formally establishes the goals and objectives for future planning for residential
and mixed use development in the IBC based on the IBC Vision Plan and Mixed Use Overlay
Zoning Code Planning Process conducted by the City of Irvine between 2005-2010. The text of
the Vision Plan document is presented in this element, reformatted into City of Irvine General
Plan objective and policy statements.
Introduction
The Irvine Business Complex (IBC) is a unique part of the City of Irvine. Dating from the 1970s,
the IBC was developed solely as a commercial and industrial center serving Southern California
as a regional economic and employment base, including hotel, restaurant, commercial, retail,
industrial, and office uses. (Figure N-1 Regional Location)
Transition in land use was contemplated in the original entitlement program for the IBC with the
amount and variety of land use within an individual parcel being dictated by a trip generation
strategy. A provision was created that permits Transfer of Development Rights between parcels
based upon trip generation and environmental analysis Market forces, however, have increased
development pressures in the IBC and are encouraging a rapid transition from a suburban mixed-
use commercial and industrial center into a more urban regional mixed-use center. This
evolution, to a more urban environment, will include an array of commercial, industrial, retail
and residential land uses constituting changes to the look, feel, and function of the business
complex.
In early 2004, the number of applications for residential units within the IBC increased
dramatically and City of Irvine anticipates that the total number of units in the IBC could
increase to more than 10,000 within the next five to ten years. This increase in residential units
represents a significant increase over the original residential cap of 3,896 dwelling units in the
IBC established in 1992. The City of Irvine identified the opportunity for a mixed-use

community with a coordinated urban design framework within the IBC while ensuring the
continued economic viability of existing and future businesses.
These development pressures have created the desire for a vision to bring the IBC into the 21st
Century. The purpose of this Vision Plan is to develop a comprehensive strategy and guiding
urban design framework for future IBC development. This Vision Plan and the Irvine Business
Complex Residential Mixed-Use (IBCRMU) Overlay Zone, call for creating sustainable urban
neighborhoods within a framework of new streets and open spaces; a new approach than has
traditionally been considered within other residential areas of Irvine.
This Vision Plan reflects a long-term view of the IBC as a mixed-use community, and reflects
the best planning techniques available to assist in the evolution of the IBC from a traditional
office and industrial area. This Vision Plan also builds on the principles established through the
public meeting process and at the IBC Design Charrette held in July 2005.
Together, the Vision Plan and the IBCRMU Overlay Zone will become the basis for determining
the coordination of public and private sector initiatives for the development and implementation
of a sustainable, quality mixed-use community within the IBC.

The Vision – Overarching Concepts
The purpose of the Vision Plan, as
incorporated into this IBC Element is to
address the opportunities and constraints
previously discussed and develop an
urban design framework to guide future
development in the IBC. This element
suggests a dynamic mix of uses, with
urban housing integrated into a
conceptual framework of streets,
landscape improvements, pedestrian
walkways, and urban open spaces.
In order to achieve a balanced urban
environment, the IBC needs walkable
neighborhoods where people can work,
live, and play; feeling part of an
evolving and vibrant cosmopolitan city.
This requires a mix of uses and places
that are activated both day and night,
drawing together diverse community
segments both business and residential.

Local Streets
The proposed new streets, as well as
existing local streets, in the IBC are
smaller scale; providing the opportunity
for a more pedestrian oriented „green‟
network of streets, connecting business
and residential districts to the San Diego
Creek and the citywide open space
system. Canopy trees for shade are
proposed in eight-foot parkways and a
minimum of five-feet for sidewalks
should be provided.
The existing east-west streets proposed
to be enhanced for pedestrian use
include: Alton Parkway, Barranca
Parkway, Campus Drive, McGaw
Avenue, Main Street and Michelson
Drive.

                                               streets should not be gated.
The Vision Plan as outlined in this
element seeks to address the imbalance
between pedestrian and automobile
users, by deconstructing large super
blocks into smaller parcels through the
creation of new local vehicular and
walking streets. The ultimate aim is to
provide improved connectivity between
blocks and the existing street network
for the benefit of all the community.
This system will encourage access to the
interior of existing large parcels. This
proposed street network will provide

access, trash pick-up, access to parking
areas, and a more pedestrian friendly
access system to local services,

While maintaining the existing arterials
and enhancing the pedestrian experience,
the plan calls for the introduction of a
“finer grain” street pattern allowing for a
greater diversity in housing types by
reducing the scale and size of
developments and making it easier to mix
housing types within a single large project
site. The smaller blocks can create a more
walkable pedestrian network by providing
various routes to a variety of destinations.

Transit
The City Council adopted a Citywide
Transit Vision in April 2009. The
Citywide Transit Vision is in compliance
with a development condition for
Planning Area 40. The Transit Vision
evaluates a citywide rubber-tired clean
technology shuttle system intended to
provide convenient, safe,
environmentally friendly, direct
connections from Irvine and Tustin
Stations to other development areas in
the Irvine Spectrum, the Orange County
Great Park and Heritage Fields,
Woodbury/North Irvine, and the IBC.
The Citywide Transit Vision builds on
the success of the City‟s i-Shuttle, the
University of California Irvine Student
Shuttle Program, and the planned
expansion of Metrolink service by the
Orange County Transportation Authority
(OCTA). Implementation of the City
service is expected to occur in phases.
Complete the Sidewalk System
Many of the streets within the IBC do
not have sidewalks. The existing
sidewalk improvement program will
continue to be implemented and
embellished with enhanced standards for
improved walkability and connectivity to
create an interconnected system of
pedestrian-friendly boulevards, avenues
and streets.

Several new pedestrian bridges are
envisioned within the IBC:
▪ Across the San Diego Creek,
     connecting to Bill Barber Marine
     Corps Memorial Park.
▪ Across the San Diego Creek,
     connecting McGaw to the new
     „Creekwalk,‟ San Marco Park, and
     the existing „Mountains to the Sea‟
     trail along the San Diego Creek.
▪ A bridge crossing on Jamboree Road
     from Central Park to Park Place.
▪ Improve the bridge/underpass along
     San Diego Creek at the 405 freeway.
Overlay Zone Implementation
The IBC Design Criteria adopted in
conjunction with this element and the
Residential Mixed Use Overlay Zone
describes the type of open spaces that
can qualify for the public and private
Neighborhood Park requirement. Urban
open spaces such as plazas and squares
may qualify as a Public Neighborhood
Park if they meet the design criteria.

Street Frontages - Setbacks
The IBC has developed in a manner that
has resulted in a patchwork of building
frontages and setbacks. Building
setbacks currently range between 20 to
40 feet measured from the curb. These
setbacks were designed with the vehicle
in mind which has created an
environment that is unfriendly to
pedestrians within the IBC. In addition,
some buildings along Jamboree Road
turn their backs on the major streets and
do not contribute to an attractive street
frontage.
Buildings should be designed in a
manner that creates an attractive, safe
pedestrian scale along public streets.
A hierarchy of street setbacks has been
established in the IBCRMU Overlay
Zone which proposes different setbacks
for different types of streets and in some
cases location within the IBC. A typical
street cross section is shown below
demonstrating the relationship between
buildings and street. Detailed cross
sections can be found in the Typical
Street Cross Sections section of this

ELEMENT C
HOUSING
GOAL: Provide for safe and decent housing for all economic
segments of the community.
Introduction
The Irvine Housing Element is structured to reflect the “Housing Element Building Blocks”
model developed by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
HCD is responsible for reviewing the Housing Element for compliance with state law. In
addition to responding to the requirements of state law, the Irvine Housing Element demonstrates
how the strategies to meet the City’s locally determined housing needs are methodically
addressed through plans, programs and projects.
This Housing Element, while mandated by state law, also represents a roadmap for Irvine to
continue its visionary leadership, which has resulted in a legacy of sustainable housing
opportunities for all Irvine residents now and into the future. It is with thoughtful, well-designed
and strategically implemented goals, objectives and programs as referenced in this update to the
Housing Element, that this is accomplished and preserved for future generations.
City of Irvine                                  C-1                                    Housing Element
General Plan

Background
The City of Irvine (City or Irvine), from its beginnings, has been master planned to create a
vibrant, attractive, sustainable and superb community for its residents. Irvine has been, and is
viewed as, the premier master planned community on the west coast. The City has accomplished
this by involving its residents and businesses in the planning and development of a community
that incorporates a full spectrum of housing, significant employment opportunities, recreation,
open space preservation, great schools, shopping and services. Irvine is a community committed
to developing and ensuring a high quality of life for its current and future residents. Irvine has
established villages that are unique in character, as well as award winning for their master plans.
These villages have been designed to provide housing choices, proximity to schools, shopping
and services, transportation and employment. This Housing Element update, while meeting the
requirements of state law, also acknowledges and affirms the City’s commitment to its master
planning efforts and to ensuring housing choices are available for all its residents.
Community Context – A Commitment to:
Quality of Life
The story of Irvine is one of thoughtful planning with decisions made reflecting the input of the
community leading to a high quality of life that is nationally recognized. As the City has grown,
the importance of these decisions has also increased. Thoughtful planning for more than 40 years
has earned the Irvine acclaim as one of the nation's best master-planned communities.
Located in the heart of Orange County, the City combines the friendliness, warmth and safety of
a small town with the educational, employment, recreational, and cultural opportunities of a large
city. Incorporated in 1971, the City has grown into a strong and diverse residential and business
community. Irvine has achieved regional importance in part due to its central location within
Orange County and attention to balanced planning. In 2012 Irvine turned 41, still a relatively
young city, and continuing to be a successful master planned community. The carefully created
and executed master plan continues to guide Irvine’s growth four decades after the original
concept for the community was born. The original concept provided affordable market housing
opportunities for families to live, grow, and age in a master planned community. That concept
has not changed. Today, more options are available to residents in type, location and setting, all
of which benefit from the basic idea that residents can enjoy proximity to work, schools,
recreation, shopping and the natural environment. The City has also affirmed its housing vision
through the adoption of a Housing Strategy & Implementation Plan, which plans to
accommodate “… a full spectrum of housing types to meet the shelter needs of all income groups
and special needs populations in all stages of life.” This commitment is evidenced by the market
and affordable housing opportunities and the initiatives established by the City to provide
multiple housing choices for Irvine residents.
All this will continue to be done in a thoughtful and coordinated manner with other activities and
efforts undertaken by the City through its master plan. From working with businesses, to
ensuring excellence in education with its institutional partners, to leading the nation as one of the
safest cities in America, Irvine’s housing programs also continue the effort to create a vibrant,
successful community.
City of Irvine                                   C-2                                  Housing Element
General Plan

Affordable and Suitable Housing for All
Since its inception Irvine has been a leader in a variety of types of housing in Orange County and
southern California. In partnership with the Irvine Company, which owned the original land
grant on which the City is located, Irvine has developed a full spectrum of housing opportunities,
including numerous affordable housing projects. To develop affordable housing, Irvine has
worked closely with local for-profit and nonprofit housing developers. Development of housing
in Irvine is guided by the goals, objectives and policies of the City's Housing Element and
Chapter 2-3 of the Zoning Ordinance. The overall goal of the Housing Element is to provide safe
and decent housing for all economic segments of the community.
One of the original goals of the master plan of Irvine was to create a balance of housing
reflecting a wide range of options and prices, so anyone choosing to live in Irvine could establish
roots and move up or down in the housing market as their circumstances and preferences
changed. To that end, Irvine now has a wide range of housing choices for all of its residents.
Irvine’s commitment to providing a full spectrum of housing for all income groups at all stages
of life was formalized through the adoption of its Affordable Housing Strategy &
Implementation Plan (Implementation Plan) in 2006. Prior to the formal adoption of the
Implementation Plan, Irvine proactively negotiated affordable housing programs with its largest
land owner, the Irvine Company. In addition to its negotiation efforts, in 2003 Irvine adopted an
Inclusionary Housing Ordinance that implemented its strategic objective of having a balanced
housing stock. This was accomplished during a time when Irvine was seeing a loss of affordable
housing opportunities and was adopted after full discussion and participation of various
stakeholders. The ordinance ensured future residents would have affordable housing
opportunities, while balancing the needs of residential developers to adjust to new development
requirements. The City fully actuated its Implementation Plan with the creation of the Irvine
Community Land Trust, a nonprofit organization that will develop and hold land for affordable
housing.
The Implementation Plan incorporates many objectives and strategies aimed at developing
permanent affordable housing in the community, the creation of the Irvine Community Land
Trust being one example. However, this is only part of the ongoing effort to address the housing
needs of its residents that Irvine has demonstrated since its incorporation.
The City's employment areas generate a significant number of jobs that, in turn, create demand
for housing. Irvine has acknowledged this demand and committed itself to provide a wide variety
of housing choices as well as creating vibrant mixed-use residential villages such as the Irvine
Business Complex. The City understands that the more housing choices offered to the residents
in Irvine, the better the City can respond to the increasing need for a balance between jobs and
housing.
Because the City has a master plan that accommodates growth and supports a balanced supply of
numerous housing options and programs, Irvine is better prepared than most cities to meet the
housing needs of current and future residents. Irvine’s ongoing commitment to its master plan
has made it a highly desirable place to live.
City of Irvine                                   C-3                                 Housing Element
General Plan

Balancing Housing and Business in Irvine
Irvine provides an array of development and expansion opportunities to both existing businesses
and those seeking to locate in Irvine. The City has three major employment centers - the Irvine
Spectrum, Irvine Business Complex (IBC) and University Research Park – which provide nearly
200,000 jobs and assure Irvine a solid and permanent economic base. Other business centers
throughout the City, such as Jamboree Center and Irvine Technology Center, also play an
important role in Irvine's robust employment scene. The goal when planning these centers has
been to create a healthy jobs/housing balance that offers residents the ultimate Southern
California luxury: a job close to home, which would translate into less time spent on the road and
more time spent at home. To further this goal, the City has adopted the Irvine Business Complex
Residential Mixed Use Vision Plan (Vision Plan). The Vision Plan encourages balanced,
sustainable mixed-use growth within the IBC with the thought to reduce commuter traffic on
streets and freeways, and make housing available closer to job centers.
The carefully planned employment centers have become magnets for many of the nation's
leading research and technology companies. This in turn ensures a strong economic base that
enables the City to provide an exceptional level of service that helps make Irvine's outstanding
quality of life possible.
Supporting Housing Through Excellence in Education
Premier education at all levels is a key component of the master plan for Irvine. Not surprisingly,
Irvine has become synonymous with stellar educational opportunities. From innovative pre-
school programs to world class doctoral studies, education is a cornerstone of Irvine life. To
support academic performance, the City contributes more than $4.5 million annually for
enhanced public safety, health and social services on school campuses. The Irvine Unified
School District is recognized as one of the outstanding school districts in California. The
University of California, Irvine is consistently ranked among the nation’s best universities. As a
result, Irvine is recognized as one of the nation’s “smartest” cities and nearly 64 percent of Irvine
residents age 25 or older have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to the national average of
28 percent.
Irvine is home to the University of California, Irvine, Concordia University, Irvine Valley
College and a number of satellite graduate programs for the University of Southern California,
Pepperdine University, Chapman University and California State University, Fullerton. All of
these choices mean Irvine residents have immediate, local access to the best education available.
Keeping Safety First
Irvine has the unprecedented distinction of being “America’s Safest City” for nine consecutive
years – 2004 through 2012. In 2012 Irvine was named the Safest City with a population over
200,000. Being ranked as a Safest City touches on virtually every facet of municipal operations
in Irvine. Visionary planning, strong law enforcement programs and personnel, enlightened City
leadership, public and private partnerships, and an engaged community are cornerstones of the
community’s success.
Irvine’s unwavering commitment to public safety goes beyond experienced, well-equipped
police officers and innovative policing strategies. The City’s holistic approach to create a safe
community includes a myriad of health and wellness programs for families, community and
City of Irvine                                   C-4                                  Housing Element
General Plan

business outreach, proactive land-use policies, regular maintenance of public facilities, roads,
parks, and support for student achievement. There is a reason Irvine is recognized year after year
as one of the safest cities in America, and the answer can be found in every aspect of community
life.
Enhancing Quality Living Environments Through Parks/Open Space
As the most successful planned community in the nation, Irvine offers its residents more open
"green" space than any other city in Orange County. The City features 19 developed community
park sites totaling 350 acres, and five special facilities totaling 45.5 acres. There are 37 public
neighborhood parks totaling 163 acres and many private neighborhood parks. Moreover, the City
has 11 landscaped public recreational trails totaling 43 miles. In addition to parks, the City of
Irvine is in a league of its own when it comes to trails and preserved open spaces. The Jeffrey
Open Space Trail, Bommer Canyon and Quail Hill are a few of the treasured areas that have
been preserved as a result of Irvine’s historic Open Space Initiative, and are examples of the
extraordinary recreational opportunities available to residents. Overwhelmingly approved by
residents in 1988, the Open Space Initiative ensures that development will be clustered in the
core of the City to allow for the preservation of large peripheral areas of open space as
communities are built. More than 16,000 acres of parks, trails and wilderness areas – an area
greater than one-third of the entire city – ultimately will be forever preserved. And in addition to
all of these community park facilities, the City has embarked on creating the first major
metropolitan park of the 21st Century – the Orange County Great Park. When complete, the
Orange County Great Park will consist of over 1,200 acres of park land and will serve the
residents of Irvine and the region with significant amenities, open space, passive and active
recreational facilities, and enhance the living environment surrounding homes in the area.

Additional Information
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
To ensure that all California cities and counties contribute to the statewide housing mandate to
provide decent and adequate housing for all Californians, the Housing Element law institutes the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process. The RHNA is meant to allocate a “fair
share” of the region’s housing needs to each individual jurisdiction, based on, among other
factors, population and job growth, housing construction trends, commute patterns, infrastructure
constraints, and household formation trends.
For the planning period of October 15, 2013 through June 30, 2021, Orange County was
allocated an overall RHNA of 37,966 units, with the City of Irvine being allocated a RHNA of
12,149 units. Irvine has addressed the RHNA allocation in this Housing Element Update by
continuing its strategic planning for the community and identifying appropriate locations for
housing at density levels required by state law for the total RHNA. This Housing Element meets
the requirements of state law, continues Irvine’s tradition of thoughtful planning and is a
component part of Irvine’s vision for a full spectrum of housing for all income groups at all
stages of life.
Sources of Data
Pursuant to state law, the Housing Element must contain background information on the City’s
population and employment characteristics, household trends, housing market conditions, and
the City’s affordable housing stock. Needless to say, no one single agency or organization
provides a comprehensive and consistent set of data that can be used to prepare the Housing
Element. In order to address all aspects of state mandates, multiple sources of data must be used,
which often creates inconsistencies due to methodologies of data collection, timeframe of data,
and specific purpose of the data. However, much of the data presented in the Housing Element is
intended only to provide a general picture of the City. Such technical inconsistencies, while
important from a research and scientific perspective, are not critical enough to alter policy
direction. Data has been compiled from existing sources such as the 2010 Census, the American
Community Survey and other recognized public agencies including the State of California
Department of Finance. Other sources used in this Housing Element include the following:
         Employment and wage data from the State Employment Development
          Department, labor market statistics
         Housing market information, such as home sales and rents, from the California
          Association of Realtors and DataQuick
         Special needs populations and their service providers
         Lending patterns for home purchase and home improvement loans, from the Home
          Mortgage Disclosure Act
City of Irvine                                    C-6                               Housing Element
General Plan

Where 2010 decennial Census data is not available, 2006-2010 Five-Year American Community
Survey (ACS) data is used to provide information on the community’s demographic and housing
characteristics.1 Because the ACS is based on a sample rather than a complete count, it contains a
margin of error and the results are less accurate than the decennial Census. Therefore, ACS
results are presented in this Housing Element only for variables for which decennial Census data
are not available.
General Plan Consistency
The City adopted its most recent General Plan in 1999. This Housing Element has been reviewed
and is consistent with this updated General Plan. The City initiated a comprehensive update
process for the General Plan that is expected to take approximately two years to complete. As the
Housing Element cycle dictates this element be updated by October 15, 2013, the Housing
Element update will occur prior to completion of the comprehensive update. Accordingly, where
appropriate, the comprehensive update will be developed in a manner consistent with the 2013-
2021 Housing Element.
Public Participation
The City of Irvine values community input in assisting the development of City policies and
programs. As part of this update, the City conducted two community meetings to solicit input on
this Housing Element. Community meetings were publicized on the City’s website and Intranet,
and in the Irvine World News. In addition, the meetings were advertised through social media
posting on the City’s cable channel ICTV 30 and on Facebook and Twitter.
For the community meetings, the City invited housing professionals, community groups, and
organizations, for-profit and nonprofit developers, schools and universities, real estate
professionals, the Chamber of Commerce, housing advocates, and other nonprofit service
providers that serve lower income populations. In all, those invited to the stakeholder meetings
included 177 groups and organizations, in addition to the general public. Community meetings
were held on March 13 and March 19, 2013 in the Irvine City Hall Conference and Training
Center. Appendix A contains the distribution list for these meetings.
City staff also conducted a public study session with the Irvine City Council on March 12, 2013
and the Planning Commission on April 18, 2013 to provide an overview of the Housing Element
process and key community needs, then solicited input on issues of concern from each
Councilmember and Planning Commissioner.
The stakeholder meetings and the community meetings were well attended due to the City’s
diligent efforts in reaching out to various groups in the community. Comments received during
these meetings and responses prepared by the City are summarized in Appendix A. Comments
received during the outreach process generally centered on the housing need for persons with
developmental disabilities.

    This Housing Element is structured to adhere to the Housing Element Building Blocks created by the State
    Department of Housing Community Development (HCD) to assist jurisdictions in preparing the Housing
    Element. Consistent with the Housing Element Building Blocks sample analyses, certain analyses in this
    Housing Element also present the American Community Survey (ACS) data.

General Plan

The draft Housing Element was available on the City’s website throughout the public review
process and was available to be viewed in person at City Hall. Public notices were sent out and
published notifying residents when the document was available for public review.
Public Hearings
On May 16, 2013 and on June 6, 2013 the Planning Commission held public hearings to review
the draft Housing Element and to direct it be submitted to HCD for review. Upon approval by the
Planning Commission, the draft Housing Element was forwarded to HCD for a mandatory 60-
day review consistent with state law. On July 30, 2013 HCD provisionally certified the Housing
Element, which was then submitted to the City Council for final review, approval and adoption.
On XXX the City Council adopted the Housing Element without changes. In compliance with
state and City laws, public notices were issued for these hearings in local newspapers, on the
City website, and at the City’s four posting sites.

Population, Employment and Housing Characteristics Trends
Table C-1 shows the City’s population from 1980 to 2012. Over the past 32 years, the City of
Irvine has experienced growth due to its central location and available vacant and residentially
zoned land. Between 1980 and 1990, the City’s population increased by over 77 percent, and
between 1990 and 2000, it increased further by nearly 30 percent to 143,072. As of 2012, the
population of Irvine is estimated at 223,729, a 56 percent increase since 2000.

Table C-2 shows the population changes between 2000 and 2012 for Irvine and its neighboring
cities. The City of Irvine experienced growth at a much faster pace than all of its neighbors and
Orange County as a whole. Lake Forest is the only community with similar (but, still lower)
growth in the area. The majority of growth in Lake Forest resulted from annexation of the
existing community of Foothill Ranch. Most of Irvine’s population growth stems from the
development of planning areas, which are primarily residential. Some of the population growth
can also be attributed to the rezoning of land from Industrial to Multi-Use in the IBC area.
However, many of the approved projects in the IBC are not yet built or occupied. In the past, a
high demand for housing motivated developers to redevelop offices and businesses in industrial
areas, such as those adjacent to John Wayne Airport, into apartments and condominiums.

under age 18, such as in Irvine, typically reflects a family-oriented community where single-
family homes and other ownership housing represent a significant portion of the housing stock.
Table C-3 summarizes the age distribution of Irvine residents between 2000 and 2010. The City,
as a whole, aged slightly with the median age among Irvine residents increasing from 33.1 in
2000 to 33.9 in 2010. During this time period, the City experienced significant increases in all
age cohorts, but especially in the number of young children, “baby boomers,” and seniors.

Race and Ethnicity
Different racial and ethnic groups often have different household characteristics and cultural
backgrounds, which may affect their housing needs and preferences. Table C-4 shows the racial
and ethnic composition of Irvine residents in 2000 and 2010. As shown, White residents continue
to be the most prevalent group in Irvine. However, the racial and ethnic composition of Irvine
has become more diverse in recent years. Specifically, the White population comprised about 61
percent of the total population in 2000, but declined to just slightly over 50 percent in 2010.
During the same period, the Asian population nearly doubled and the proportion of Asian
residents in Irvine increased from about 30 percent in 2000 to over 39 percent in 2010. The
number of Hispanics and Blacks in the City also increased significantly during the 2000s,
although together these groups represented just 11 percent of the City’s total population in 2010.

Employment Trends
Employment by industry in Irvine is shown in Table C-5. The largest employment sector in the
City is Education, Health Care and Social Assistance, comprising nearly 24 percent of all jobs.
Professional Services make up the second largest share of employment in the City, followed by
Manufacturing and Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate employment. Many people who work in
Irvine do not live in the City, so Irvine’s population actually doubles to 400,000 during the work
day as the City draws workers from other cities in Orange County, as well as nearby San Diego,
Los Angeles and Riverside counties.

General Plan
To facilitate a more balanced jobs-to-housing ratio, the City initiated the preparation of the IBC
Vision Plan and Overlay Zoning Ordinance in 2006, which was approved by the City Council on
July 13, 2010. The purpose of the Vision Plan is to provide for the orderly transition of the IBC
from primarily industrial and/or office areas into a pedestrian-oriented area that can
accommodate a mixture of retail, office, and higher density residential uses, while protecting
existing businesses. The Vision Plan reflects a long term view of the IBC as a mixed-use
community, and reflects the best planning techniques available to assist in the evolution of the
IBC from a traditional office and industrial area. These principles established after an exhaustive
public participation process are as follows:
         Protect the existing job base;
         Develop mixed use areas;
         Provide transportation, pedestrian, and visual connectivity;
         Create usable open space; and
         Develop safe, well designed neighborhoods.
Household Growth
The Census defines a household as all persons who occupy a housing unit. A household may
include single persons living alone, a family related through marriage or blood, and/or unrelated
individuals living together. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or
other group living situations are not considered households. Information regarding household
characteristics is important to understanding the growth and changing needs of a community. As
illustrated in Table C-8, the number of households in Irvine has continued to increase steadily
over the last two decades, from 40,257 in 1990, to 51,199 in 2000, and to 78,978 in 2010.

Tenure
Housing tenure refers to whether a unit is owner or renter-occupied. The changes in the
distribution of owner versus renter-occupied units between 1990 and 2010 are presented in Table
C-9. Over the years, the City experienced a slow, but steady decline in the proportion of owner-
occupied units, reflecting the diversity of the housing stock and increased development of rental
units by the Irvine Company, a major land owner in the community.

Renter-households in the City are far more likely to live in multiple-family housing than single-
family housing. About 91 percent of multi-family units were occupied by renter-households
while only 17 percent of single-family units were renter occupied in 2011 (Table C-10).

Irvine is a family-oriented community. Table C-11 illustrates the changes in household
composition (e.g., family household, non-family household, or single household) in Irvine
between 2000 and 2010. Among the nearly 79,000 households that resided in Irvine in 2010,
about two-thirds percent were families. Specifically, of all households in the City, 26.4 percent
consisted of married couples with children, and 25.5 percent were married couples without
children. The proportion of married couples with children has decreased slightly since 2000.

    Note: A household consists of all the persons who occupy a single housing unit. A household can be a family,but may
    also be unrelated persons living together, or a single person living alone. Average household size represents the average
    number of persons in a household based on all occupied units. This average excludes residents in convalescent/nursing
    homes, student dormitories, or other group living situations. Families are subsets of households in that a family is a
    household comprised of related individuals. Average family size is therefore, the average number of family members
    among the family-households. In general, the average family size is larger than average household size when a
    community has a large number of single-households or families without children, such as in Irvine.
    Source: Bureau of the Census, 2000 and 2010 Census.
Non-family households, which include single persons and other unrelated households, comprised
more than one-third of all households residing in Irvine in 2010. Single households comprised
23.4 percent of all households in the City, a slight increase since 2000.

General Plan
Overpayment and Overcrowding
Household Income and Overpayment
State and federal standards specify that households spending more than 30 percent of gross
annual income on housing (which includes the cost of utilities, insurance, and property taxes) are
overpaying for their housing. When a household spends more than 30 percent of its income on
housing costs, it has less disposable income for other necessities such as health care and food. In
the event of unexpected circumstances such as loss of employment and health problems,
households who overpay are more likely to become homeless. Homeowners who overpay have
traditionally had the option of selling their homes and becoming renters. Renters are also
vulnerable and subject to the constant changes in the housing market.
Table C-12 shows the number and proportion of households with housing overpayment by
income range and tenure. The Census Bureau reported that approximately 42 percent of owner-
households and 49 percent of renter-households in Irvine were spending more than 30 percent of
their incomes to cover housing costs during 2005-2007, the most recent time period for which
this data is available. As expected, housing overpayment was reported to be most prevalent
among lower-income households.

For planning and funding purposes, HCD developed the following income categories adjusted
for household size and based on the Area Median Income (AMI) of a metropolitan area:
         Extremely Low Income Households earn up to 30 percent of the AMI
         Very Low Income Households earn between 31 and 50 percent of the AMI
         Low Income Households earn between 51 and 80 percent of the AMI
         Moderate Income Households earn between 81 and 120 percent of the AMI
         Above Moderate Income Households earn over 120 percent of the AMI

Extremely low income, very low income, and low income groups combined, are often referred as
the “lower income” group. As shown in Table C-12, the extent of overpayment in renter-
households increases as income decreases. Overpayment impacted extremely low and very low
income households relatively equally.

According to the HCD, overcrowding is defined as a housing unit occupied by more than one
occupant per room (excluding kitchens, bathrooms, hallways and porches). A housing unit with
more than 1.5 occupants per room is considered to be severely overcrowded.2
Overcrowding frequently occurs when high housing costs result in families and individuals
doubling up or living in smaller units to meet other basic needs. Overcrowding can also occur
when units of adequate size for large households are not available. Overcrowding can potentially
lead to rapid deterioration of the City’s housing stock, additional traffic and a shortage of on-site
parking.
Table C-13 shows the extent of overcrowding conditions by tenure (owner versus renter) for
Irvine compared to Orange County as a whole, as reported by the Census Bureau. The overall
rate of overcrowding was considerably higher among renter-occupied units (5.3 percent) than
owner-occupied units (1.1 percent) in Irvine. Only one tenth of one percent of owner-occupied
units were severely overcrowded, but 1.4 percent of renter-occupied units were severely
overcrowded.

Resources and Programs
The City helps address overpayment and overcrowding by administering affordable housing
programs. Several nonprofit organizations in the Irvine area (Table C-14) are also available to
assist low income households with their housing cost burden and overcrowded living conditions.
2
    For example, a two-bedroom unit with a living room and a dining room (four rooms total) would be considered
    severely overcrowded if it is occupied by more than six persons.

  Irvine Housing             Develops affordable housing that benefits extremely low to moderate income
  Opportunities              households by developing housing through new construction and rehabilitation of
                             existing structures and acquisition, and by providing the necessary services to
                             enable people to remain in their homes.
Extremely Low Income Households
As shown in Table C-12 (page 15), it is estimated that there were 3,800 households or about six
percent of total households in the City of Irvine that qualified as extremely low income.
Households in this income category had incomes of less than 30 percent of the AMI. Extremely
low-income households primarily consist of households with minimum wage earners, persons
with developmental, physical or mental disabilities, and elderly households receiving Social
Security.
Housing Needs for Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low income households are the most difficult to serve given the substantial subsidies
required to make housing affordable to this income group. Given the housing market in Irvine,
extremely low income households have some housing options in Irvine, primarily as emergency
shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and single-room occupancy (SRO) units.
Bridge Housing and Jamboree Housing Corporation also have rental units available for
extremely low-income households.
Rental Assistance
Affordable rental housing programs are available in many apartment communities in Irvine.
These units are HUD-subsidized apartments or are made affordable through tax credits, bonds
and/or other funding sources. These projects generally offer rents at substantially below typical
market rates. Availability of affordable rental apartments is limited and prospective residents are
often placed on a waiting list before being offered a unit. Generally, low income one-bedroom
units are more available and have shorter wait times than very low income units with two or
more bedrooms.
Another affordable rental program available in Irvine is the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher
Program, which is a federally-funded program administered by the Orange County Housing
Authority (OCHA). The vouchers assist qualified households through rent subsidies, which are
based on 30 percent of the participant’s monthly income and numbers of persons residing in the
unit. Assisted tenants pay the balance of the contract rent, which is based on their income. The
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program is available to senior citizens, disabled persons and

General Plan

lower income households, although a certain portion of the assistance must be reserved for
extremely low income households. As of January 2013 there are a total of 825 households in
Irvine receiving a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher. Of the 825 households, 287 are families,
224 are disabled persons and 314 are elderly persons. In February 2012, OCHA opened its
waiting list for the first time since 2005. Applications were accepted over a two week period and
48,392 were received. The application waiting list will most likely not be re-opened until 2019.
Emergency Shelters
The California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801(e)) defines “emergency shelter" as
housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of
six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be denied emergency
shelter because of an inability to pay.
Pursuant to state law, the City recently amended its Zoning Ordinance to address Senate Bill 2,
which took effect January 1, 2008 and requires every jurisdiction to provide at least one zoning
category in which emergency shelters can be located without discretionary approval from the
local government. Emergency shelters are permitted by right in the IBC Multi-Use, General
Industrial, Medical and Science, Business Park, and Institutional districts. Parking standards of
one space per four beds and one space per employee have been established. These zoning
districts offer easy access to public transportation and services. There is also adequate capacity
for emergency shelters through either new construction or adaptive reuse of existing buildings.
Transitional Housing
The California Health and Safety Code (§50675.2) defines “transitional housing" and
"transitional housing development" as buildings configured as rental housing developments, but
operated under program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation
of the assisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in
time, which shall be no less than six months. This definition of transitional housing does not
encompass all transitional housing facilities, particularly those that operate as group quarters or
community care facilities that charge fees rather than rents.
Under the City’s current development regulations, the City facilitates and encourages the
development of transitional housing by treating facilities that serve six or fewer persons as
regular residential uses. Such facilities are permitted by right in all residential uses (see also
discussions under “Housing for Persons with Disabilities”). They are also permitted by
conditional use permit in the two other non-residential mixed-use zoning districts. The City
regulates these facilities by land use type (single-family homes, multiple-family apartments, or
condominiums) rather than by their users.
Large transitional housing facilities that operate as regular housing developments are considered
regular residential use and permitted by right in the City’s residential zones. Large transitional
housing facilities (serving more than six persons) that operate as community residential care
facilities (i.e. group quarters) are not specifically identified in the Zoning Code, but are
conditionally permitted in all districts except for the Estate Density district. The Conditional Use
Permit (CUP) criteria used to review transitional housing pertains to performance standards. The
findings are the same as those used for other uses requiring a CUP and would not prevent the
approval of transitional housing facilities. Pursuant to the Zoning Code (Chapter 2-9), the
findings are as follows:

General Plan

         The use is appropriate in the location and circumstances in which it is proposed;
         The use is compatible with the existing and proposed on-site and proximate land uses;
         The use implements the general plan objectives;
         Project impacts are identified and mitigated; and
         Major issues associated with the development of the site have been addressed and
          resolved when development of the site is not subject to the master plan approval.
In 1993 the Marine Corps Air Station, El Toro (MCAS) was decommissioned by the federal
government and was subsequently sold to a private developer. Since that time a Base Reuse Plan
was formulated and adopted to create The Great Park, a mixed-use development area that will
include a large scale public park, along with residential, institutional, commercial, agricultural,
recreational, and industrial uses. Reuse of the MCAS is subject to federal regulations (McKinney
Act), which requires that a portion of the decommissioned base area be set aside to address
housing needs of the homeless. In response to this requirement, a coalition of nonprofit housing
providers called El Toro Housing Initiative Collaboration (ETHIC) was formed. The developer
of the private portion of the Great Park, known as Heritage Fields El Toro, has entered into a
contract with ETHIC to transfer 22.3 acres to ETHIC to build 166 mostly three-bedroom
affordable units on a portion of the former base. The remaining acres leave opportunity for more
affordable housing to be built at Heritage Fields.
In addition to the transitional housing that will be provided in the Great Park, the City facilitated
the agreement of 14 transitional units to be deeded by the developer of the former MCAS Tustin
to Families Forward, a nonprofit organization that assists families in financial crisis to achieve
and maintain self-sufficiency. These housing units provide homeless or near homeless families in
the region with housing, allowing parents to focus on their work with case managers to improve
life skills and achieve career advancement, so that they can break free from the cycle of poverty.
Families Forward also owns and operates an additional 12 transitional units located throughout
the City. Jamboree Housing Corporation is another nonprofit agency that provides similar
services and currently owns and operates 10 transitional units in the City.
Supportive Housing
The California Health and Safety Code (§50675.14 (b)) defines "supportive housing" as housing
with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by target populations (including persons with
disabilities, homeless, persons aging out of the foster system, etc.) and that is linked to onsite or
offsite services that assist the supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his
or her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the
community.
Most supportive housing is built and managed by nonprofit housing developers in partnership
with nonprofit service providers. Supportive housing comes in all shapes and sizes, and is
designed to meet the needs of both the people to be served and the communities where it is
located. It could be a renovated motel offering furnished Single Room Occupancy apartments; a
multiple-family development where tenants with disabilities live alongside other families with
low incomes; a small, more service-intensive building; or scattered-site apartments. The City of
Irvine encourages development of supportive housing by allowing this type of use to operate as
multiple-family rental housing in all residential zones where multiple-family housing is
permitted.

General Plan

In 2003 the City provided financial assistance to AbilityFirst Irvine, a local nonprofit for the
development of an affordable apartment complex with supportive services targeting persons with
disabilities. This complex opened in the spring of 2007 and is located at the corner of Harvard
Avenue and Walnut Avenue. The City also provided financial assistance to Jamboree Housing
Corporation (JHC) for the development of two affordable apartment complexes totaling 233
units affordable to households earning 60 percent or less of the AMI. Both projects have on-site
supportive services through JHC’s program entitled Housing with HEART (Helping Educate,
Activate and Respond Together), which assists residents in maintaining their self-sufficiency.
Housing with HEART program activities vary by location since needs are assessed and programs
provided based on input from the residents themselves. Services offered include health and
safety classes, social activities, computer learning centers with Internet access, after-school
tutoring, budgeting and parenting skills classes, home buying seminars, and referrals to local
agencies.
Single-Room Occupancy
Typically, a Single-Room Occupancy (SRO) unit is a multiple tenant building that houses one or
two people in individual rooms (sometimes two rooms, or two rooms with a bathroom or half
bathroom). SRO tenants typically share bathrooms and/or kitchens, while some SRO rooms may
include kitchenettes, bathrooms, or half-baths. Most SRO units are small, with a gross floor area
of less than 400 square feet. Each dwelling unit is restricted to occupancy by no more than two
persons and is offered on a monthly or longer rental basis.
SRO units are one of the most traditional forms of affordable private housing for lower income
individuals, including seniors and persons with disabilities. These units provide a valuable source
of affordable housing and can serve as an entry point into the housing market for formerly
homeless people.
The City facilitates and encourages the development of new SRO units as well as the
rehabilitation of existing SRO units, which along with any other types of residential units are
eligible to receive the density bonus as part of the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. The City
includes SRO housing in its definition of hotel/motel and conditionally permits SRO units in the
Multi-Use, Community Commercial, IBC Mixed Use, Industrial, Medical and Science, and
Trails and Transit Oriented Development zones. SRO units are also permitted in the Lower
Peters Canyon Regional Commercial zone. The Irvine Inn is an existing SRO complex in the
City that provides housing with supportive services for homeless or near homeless individuals.
The sites inventory contained in Appendix B lists numerous sites in the City that can
accommodate SRO units in areas, such as the Great Park and the IBC. Both areas have capacities
at 30 units per acre or greater to accommodate the construction of new SRO units. The Great
Park currently has 18.7 acres of vacant land and the IBC has 34.4 acres of vacant land.
Housing Stock Characteristics
Housing Units by Type
The Census Bureau defines a housing unit as any of the following: a house, an apartment, a
mobile home or trailer, a group of homes, or a single room intended for use as separate living
quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other

individuals in the building, and that have direct access from outside the building or through a
common hall.
Housing Unit Growth and Type
Table C-15 shows the changes in the City’s housing stock by type of housing between 2000 and
2012. The Department of Finance reported 83,792 units in the City in 2012, representing an
increase of 59 percent between 2000 and 2012.

The majority of units in Irvine are single-family homes, comprising approximately 58 percent of
all units. Of these, the majority (58 percent) were detached units. Multiple-family units
represented a large portion of the housing stock, comprising about 40 percent of all homes.
Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates vary by tenure and often influence the cost of housing. In general, vacancy rates of
five percent for rental housing and two percent for ownership housing are considered healthy,
and suggest a balance between housing supply and demand. Vacancy rates for the City of Irvine
are summarized in Table C-16. The City’s 2010 vacancy rates of 3.3 percent for rental housing
and 1.3 percent for ownership housing indicated a relatively healthy supply of rental and
ownership housing opportunities.

Vacant housing can remain unoccupied for a variety of reasons. Some dwellings, for example,
remain vacant because they are intended solely for seasonal, recreational or occasional use.

Housing Age
The age and condition of Irvine’s housing stock is an important indicator of potential
rehabilitation needs. Commonly, housing over 30 years of age needs some form of major
rehabilitation, such as a new roof, foundation work, and plumbing. Due to high household
income and high housing values in Irvine, housing tends to be better maintained than in many
other communities with similar levels of older housing stock. However, despite having sizable
equity in their homes, some households (elderly households in particular) have limited incomes
and may have difficulty maintaining their homes.
Irvine’s housing stock is relatively new. Approximately one-third of all housing units in Irvine
are 30 years or older (built prior to 1980), with another 21 percent of the units in Irvine

As shown in Table C-19 below, certain areas of the City have a significantly higher percentage
of older housing units. For example, nearly 1,000 homes in Census tract number 626.12 were
built prior to 1970. Census tracts 626.29, 626.14, and 525.06 also have a substantial number of
housing units that are 30 years or older. In general, this could indicate that housing rehabilitation
and ongoing maintenance may be more of a need in these older portions of the City.

Housing Conditions
The City conducted a windshield housing conditions survey in 2012 based on the exterior
evaluation of residential dwellings in specified areas of the City. The survey targeted seven
neighborhoods with concentrations of older housing built prior to 1990. Figure C-2 illustrates the
location of the target areas. Properties were rated on features such as landscaping, roofing and
paint and were rated according to the following grade scale:
          A – Good          No visible factors of deterioration evident
          B – Fair          1-2 factors of visible deterioration evident
          C – Poor          3-5 factors of visible deterioration evident

The scores of all features were then combined and an overall rating was given to the property. As
indicated in Table C-20, 74 percent were rated as good, 23 percent were rated as fair, and three
percent were rated as poor. Of the 13,198 properties surveyed, 3,027 are in need of some
rehabilitation.

General Plan
Target Area 1 – University Park, University Terrace, Parkside, Parkwood Apartments
A total of 2,753 units were surveyed in Area 1. Overall, the housing units in Area 1 are in good
condition. The results of the housing condition survey indicate that the Parkwood Apartments
and housing units in the University Terrace and Parkside neighborhoods show very limited signs
of deterioration. It is evident that the housing and apartment units are well maintained.
University Park is an older neighborhood in the western region of Area 1. The housing survey
indicated a number of minor roof and paint repairs are needed, primarily in University Park.
The University Park neighborhood consists of single-family detached and attached homes and
condominiums. The community appears to be an older neighborhood compared to the
communities east of University Park. Although the structure of the housing units are in good
condition, there are a significant number of units that require minor roof repairs, paint touch-up,
and/or repair or replacement of exterior beams and trim. The majority of repairs include
replacing cracked ceramic or wood roof shingles, or replacing fallen asphalt shingles.
Approximately 25 homes still have asphalt driveways that are cracked or uneven. Considering
these repairs are minor, the housing condition survey gave the University Park neighborhood a B
grade.
The University Terrace and Parkside neighborhoods contain single-family attached
condominium and town homes. The existence of a homeowners association provides quality
consistency throughout the neighborhoods. All housing units were in very good condition with
no apparent signs of deterioration. Both neighborhoods received an A grade at the conclusion of
the housing survey.
The Parkwood Apartments are well maintained and in very good condition. At the completion of
the housing survey, the Parkwood Apartments received an A grade.
Area 2 – Culverdale
A total of 461 single-family housing units were surveyed in Area 2. The housing stock in the
area consists of single-family detached homes that were found to be in relatively good condition.
Some of the properties are in need of minor paint touch-up, or require repairs for splintering and
rooting exterior beams and trim. Nineteen homes have asphalt driveways that are cracked or
uneven and need to be replaced. Almost all properties need to have the house address numbers
re-painted on the curbside. Beyond minor cosmetic improvements, the neighborhood is well
maintained by a homeowners association and received an overall grade of A- on the housing
conditions survey.
Area 3 – Orange Tree
A total of 412 single-family homes were surveyed in Area 3 with the results indicating that this
area has been well maintained. Although a few homes show signs of weathered paint and
splintered wood trim (mostly along the backside of the property facing the alleys), the overall
condition of the housing unit exteriors remains among the highest quality in the City, considering
the housing stock consists of older homes. The existence of a homeowners association likely
contributes to the quality maintenance of the homes. The housing conditions in the Orange Tree
neighborhood received an A grade.

Area 4 – Deerfield Apartments, Deerfield Park, The Ranch, El Camino Glen, The Willows
A total of 2,573 single-family and multi-family units were surveyed in Area 4. A majority of the
housing units surveyed were in good condition. There is one small, isolated, neighborhood in the
northeast corner of The Willows neighborhood that showed signs of deterioration and neglect.
The greater Deerfield Park neighborhood consists of single-family detached housing units. The
survey of the Deerfield Apartments indicated that the complex is in good condition. Considering
the development is an older multiple-family development, only minor paint and roof repairs are
needed. The housing conditions in the Deerfield Park neighborhood are in relatively good
condition. There were very few signs of deterioration or neglect. The Deerfield Apartments and
Deerfield Park neighborhood received an A grade on the housing conditions survey.
The Ranch and El Camino Glen neighborhoods consist of older, single-family detached housing.
The housing units were observed to be in good condition. Landscape conditions and garage door
maintenance have improved significantly since the previous housing survey. Both neighborhoods
received an A grade on the housing conditions survey.
The Willows neighborhood is need of improvement. Several homes are in need of roof repairs,
fresh paint, garage door replacement, window repair, exterior beam and trim replacement, and
landscape up-keep. The neighborhood shows significant signs of neglect by homeowners and/or
renters. The absence of a homeowners association may be impacting The Willows neighborhood.
Based on numerous signs of deterioration and neglect, The Willows neighborhood was assessed
a B- grade on the housing conditions survey.
Area 5 – Irvine Groves, College Park, Green Tree Park, The Colony, The Racquet Club
A total of 2,461 units were surveyed in Area 5. The overall area was observed to be in
moderately good condition considering it is one of the older neighborhoods in the City. Overall,
the quality of housing conditions in Area 5 receives an A- grade.
The Irvine Groves Community consists of condominium style units and showed no visible signs
of deterioration or neglect. The presence of a homeowners association has provided consistent
quality maintenance and responsibility on behalf of the homeowners. The Irvine Groves
Community was observed to be in the best condition compared to the rest of Area 5 and received
an A grade on the survey.
The College Park neighborhood consists of single-family detached housing units. The housing
units were observed to be in moderately good condition. The only repairs necessary include
minor paint touch-up and landscape improvements. The housing conditions in the College Park
neighborhood received a grade of A- on the housing conditions survey.
The Green Tree Park neighborhood consists of single-family detached housing units. The
housing conditions were observed to be in fair condition. There are a number of housing units
that showed signs of faded or chipped paint, warped garage doors and poorly kept landscape.
Although the neighborhood is managed by a homeowners association, it does not appear the
association is maintaining the quality of housing units. The Green Tree Park neighborhood
received a B- grade for housing conditions survey.

General Plan

The Colony neighborhood consists of single-family detached housing units that are in good
condition. Some housing units are in need of minor paint touch-ups. The only consistent repair
needed throughout the neighborhood is to re-paint the house address on the curbside. The quality
of housing conditions in The Colony neighborhood received a grade of A- on the housing
conditions survey.
The Racquet Club neighborhood consists of single-family detached housing units. Overall, the
neighborhood is in moderately good condition. The housing units in southeast corner of the
neighborhood (east of Monroe) are in fair condition compared to the rest of the neighborhood.
There are a number of properties in the southeast corner that require new paint, landscaping
maintenance, repair or replacement of weathered exterior beams and trim and garage repairs. The
housing conditions in The Racquet Club neighborhood receive a B+ grade on the housing
conditions survey.
Area 6 – Woodbridge
The Woodbridge community has a total of 9,579 housing units comprised of single-family
detached and attached housing, apartments, condominiums, and townhomes. A total of 2,653
housing units were surveyed. Considering the neighborhood is one of the oldest in the City, the
housing conditions in the community were observed to be in very good condition. The
community is managed by a number of different homeowner associations that help maintain the
quality and condition of housing units and surrounding landscape. The housing conditions
throughout Area 6 received an A grade.
Area 7 – Turtle Rock
The Turtle Rock community is comprised of 1,871 single-family detached homes. A large
portion of the community consists of large, high-end homes that are very well maintained. The
existences of homeowner associations has helped maintain high quality housing conditions and
manicured landscape. Overall, the housing conditions in Area 7 received an A grade.
Conclusion
Substandard conditions and the need for rehabilitation is not an issue with the City’s affordable
housing inventory. Units are well maintained by property owners. Moreover, like the rest of its
housing stock, a majority of the City’s assisted units are fairly new and in good condition.
To address deteriorating housing conditions, the City has operated a Residential Rehabilitation
Program (RRP) since 2003. The purpose of RRP is to provide deferred loans and/or grants to
very low, low and moderate income owner occupants of single-family detached dwellings,
townhomes, condominiums, and mobile homes for the preservation of decent safe and sanitary
housing. The RRP corrects hazardous structural conditions, makes improvements considered
necessary to eliminate blight, promotes the construction of healthy, sustainable and resource-
efficient housing, improves disabled access, and corrects building, health and safety code
violations. Financial assistance through the RRP previously only consisted of emergency grants
up to $5,000 for emergency repairs such as leaking roofs, faulty plumbing or electrical wiring, or
other necessary repairs. In 2010, the City established a loan program that provides three percent
deferred loans of up to $25,000 to assist low-income Irvine homeowners with critical home
improvement needs.

Housing Costs and Affordability
Rental Costs
The Census Bureau collects information on median home values and median rents for the City of
Irvine and this information is presented in Table C-21. Median home values in Irvine increased
eight percent from $292,600 in 1990 to $316,800 in 2000. Home values increased even more
dramatically during the 2000-2007 period. Since 2007 home values have moderated due to the
national downturn in the economy and housing markets. Median rents in Irvine increased 38
percent (from $925 to $1,272) between 1990 and 2000 and the 2006-2010 ACS reported a
median rent of $1,788.

Home Sales Prices
Based on sales information from DataQuick, the median home price in Irvine (including both
condominium and single-family sales) as of October 2012 was $625,000, a slight decrease from
November 2008. Home prices have fallen statewide since their peak in 2006, partly due to the
rise in foreclosures. Lenders often sell foreclosed properties at a discount, pushing median home
prices down. A decrease in median home prices, therefore, does not necessarily reflect a decrease
in the actual value of homes. Recent trends in the housing market indicate that housing prices in
Orange County have begun to increase.
Table C-23 provides a comparison of median prices for single-family homes and condominiums
in Irvine and nearby communities.

Housing Affordability
According to HCD, housing is considered affordable when it requires 30 percent (35 percent for
owner-households) or less of the household’s gross income. The 30 (or 35) percent includes rent
or mortgage payment, utilities, taxes and insurance. The California Health and Safety Code
(Sections 50052.5 and 50053) provide guidelines for estimating affordable housing costs for
different income groups and tenure types. These guidelines are presented in Table C-24.
Affordable housing rents and home purchase prices based on these guidelines are estimated for
different income groups and presented in Table C-25.

                    Note: Affordability levels should be adjusted for household size
Comparing the housing prices and rents shown in Table C-21 with the affordable housing costs
in Table C-24, extremely low, very low, and low income households in Irvine have fewer
housing options than their higher income counterparts. The City maintains 4,165 affordable
rental units and 13 ownership units for lower income households, with an additional 250
affordable units approved or under construction. However, market rate rentals are rarely an
option for lower income Irvine residents, though moderate income households are able to afford
rents in the City. The ability to purchase a home is beyond the reach of most lower and moderate
income Irvine residents, when using the state’s affordable income and pricing standards. In order
to address the need for affordable ownership, as well as rental housing, the City established the
Irvine Community Land Trust (Land Trust), a nonprofit public benefit corporation dedicated to
providing affordable housing opportunities for the community. Under the community land trust
(CLT) model, the Land Trust owns the underlying land and sells or rents the houses to individual
lower income homeowners and renters at affordable costs. The homeowner and the Land Trust
enter into a 99-year, renewable ground lease, which gives the homeowner exclusive use of the
land and nearly all of the benefits of traditional homeownership. The City also coordinates with
the Land Trust to pursue land acquisition opportunities for a range of affordable housing options,

including rental apartments, ownership housing, emergency shelters, transitional housing,
supportive housing and SRO housing.
In addition, the City has developed a Housing Strategy & Implementation Plan (Implementation
Plan). The Implementation Plan establishes a housing strategy for the City that works to maintain
the high quality of both new and existing housing, emphasizing permanent affordability
whenever possible, and continue to disperse the affordable units throughout the community.
Design standards incorporate green design/sustainable development and accessible development
features to improve affordability and contribute to resource conservation and accessibility in the
community. The City has adopted an ambitious goal of 9,700 units of affordable housing by the
year 2025, representing 10 percent of the City’s total projected housing units. To meet this goal,
the Implementation Plan presents three recommendations, the first of which has been completed:
         Creation of the Irvine Community Land Trust
         Modification of the City’s Existing Homeownership and Rental Housing Programs
         Adoption of New Design Guidelines

Conversion Risk
Over the 10-year planning period of this at-risk analysis (between October 15, 2013 and October
15, 2023)3, seven federally-assisted housing projects in Irvine – Sutton Irvine Residences,
Harvard Manor, Orchard Park, Woodbridge Villas, The Parklands, Windwood Knoll, and
Woodbridge Oaks – are at risk of converting to market-rate housing. These projects, totaling 528
affordable rental units, are assisted with project-based Section 8 assistance and bonds. Project-
based Section 8 is a federal rental assistance program created in the mid-1970’s, under which the
owner reserves some or all of the units in a building for low-income tenants, in return for a
federal government guarantee to make up the difference between the tenant's contribution and
the rent in the owner's contract with the government.
Harvard Manor expired in 2006, but was extended by the owner for a seven-year term to 2013.
According to the owner, the Section 8 contract for Harvard Manor will be extended on a yearly
basis from this point forward. City staff is currently working with the owner of Harvard Manor
to ensure that the affordability of the units is extended. The Irvine Apartment Communities owns
five of the at-risk projects and has recently acquired five-year extensions for all of the projects as

    The statutory timeframe of the fifth revision cycle of Housing Element in the SCAG region is from October 15,
    2013 through October 15, 2021. For purposes of the “at-risk” housing analysis, a 10-year planning horizon is
    required, extending the analysis to cover through October 15, 2023.

a condition of the Planning Area 39 Development Agreement. Five-year extensions are the
maximum times achievable in the HUD mark-up to market program. The new expiration dates
for the at-risk units are reflected in Table C-26 above. These projects are considered at low risk
of converting to market-rate housing.
In November 2012, the Irvine Apartment Communities mailed letters to over 500 low income
households, alerting them to the impending expiration of the state Bond Program regulating the
affordability of their units. These low income units expire on November 15, 2013. However, the

units are as follows:

         Harvard Court
         Northwood Place
         San Leon

Preservation and Replacement Options
To maintain the existing affordable housing stock, the City may either attempt to preserve the
existing assisted units or facilitate the development of new units if it has resources and/or
cooperation from the private property owners of these projects. Depending on the circumstances
of the at-risk projects, different options may be used to preserve or replace the units. Preservation
options typically include: 1) transfer of units to nonprofit ownership; 2) provision of rental
assistance to tenants using other funding sources; and 3) purchase of affordability covenants. In
terms of replacement, the most direct option is the development of new assisted multi-family
housing units. These options are described below.
Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a nonprofit housing provider is generally one of
the least costly ways to ensure that the at-risk units remain affordable for the long term. By
transferring property ownership to a nonprofit organization, low income restrictions can be
secured and the project would become potentially eligible for a greater range of governmental
assistance. The 2008 Housing Element estimated the market value for the City’s 528 at-risk units
to be approximately $133 million, as shown in Table C-27.

                      Market value for each project is estimated with the following assumptions:
                      1. Average market rent obtained from www.rentslicer.com. $1,585 for a
                         one-bedroom, $2,014 for a two-bedroom, $2,289 for a three-bedroom,
                         and $2,116 for a four-bedroom.
                      2. Average bedroom size for one-bedroom assumed at 600 square feet, 850
                         square feet for a two-bedroom unit, 1,050 square feet for a three-
                         bedroom unit, and 1,250 square feet for a four-bedroom unit.
                      3. Vacancy rate = 5%
                      4. Annual operating expenses per square foot = $4.50
                      5. Market value = Annual net project income*multiplication factor
                      6. Multiplication factor for a building in good condition is 12.5.
Current market value for the 1,312 units currently at risk is estimated to be approximately $330
million on the basis of the previous analysis of potential annual income, and operating and
maintenance expenses. These estimates are provided for purposes of comparison and
understanding the magnitude of costs involved and do not represent the precise market values of
these projects. The actual market values at time of sale will depend on market and property
conditions, configuration of the project (100 percent affordable or mixed-income), among other
factors. Furthermore, the estimates include only the costs for the affordable units. Some projects
also include market-rate units. In the event of a transfer of ownership, inclusion of the market-
rate units in the transaction would substantially increase the total costs involved.
Rental Assistance
Tenant-based rent subsidies could be used to preserve the affordability of housing. Similar to
HUD Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, the City, through a variety of potential funding
sources, could provide rent subsidies to tenants of at-risk units. The level of the subsidy required
to preserve the at-risk units is estimated to equal the Fair Market Rent (FMR) for a unit minus
the housing cost affordable by a very low income household. The previous Housing Element
estimated that annual rent subsidies of about $4.6 million would be required to preserve the
affordability of the 528 units that were at-risk units in the previous planning period. Based on the
current 1,312 units at risk, it is estimated that approximately $11.4 million in rent subsidies
would be required annually.
Purchase of Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of the at-risk project is to provide an incentive
package to the owner to maintain the project as affordable housing. Incentives could include

General Plan
writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance, providing a lump-sum payment,
and/or supplementing the rents to market levels. The feasibility and cost of this option depends
on the property owner’s interest in utilizing the incentives and whether the complex is too highly
leveraged. It should be noted that with the loss of redevelopment funding and the ongoing
reductions in federal domestic entitlement programs for affordable housing, it is not certain that
the City will have financial resources to purchase covenants.
Construction of Replacement Units
The construction of new low income housing units is a means of replacing the at-risk units if
they should be converted to market-rate units. The cost of developing housing depends upon a
variety of factors, including density, size of the units (e.g., square footage and number of
bedrooms), location, land costs and type of construction.
Land Costs: In 2012, the estimated land value for a site in Irvine with access, available utilities,
and zoned for medium density residential (12 du/acre), was $3,600,000 per acre, or $82.64 per
square foot.
Labor Costs: The California Labor Code applies prevailing wage rates to public works projects
of a value exceeding $1,000, defining public works to mean construction, alteration, installation,
demolition, or repair work performed under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of
public funds. For example, public transfer of an asset for less than fair market value, such as a
land write-down, would be construed to be paid for in part out of public funds and would trigger
prevailing wage requirements.
While the cost differential in prevailing and standard wages varies based on the skill level of the
occupation, prevailing wages tend to add to the overall cost of development. In the case of
affordable housing projects, prevailing wage requirements typically reduce the number of
affordable units that can be achieved with public subsidies.
Construction Costs: According to RS Means Residential Square Foot Costs (2013),
construction costs for an average two-story single-family home (2,000 square feet of living area),
built of stucco on wood frame total $101.75 per square foot in the Irvine area. For multi-family
attached units, construction costs are slightly lower as developers can usually benefit from
economies of scale with discounts for materials and diffusion of equipment mobilization costs.
Density bonuses for senior and affordable housing can reduce this per-unit cost for multi-family
developments. A reduction in amenities and quality of building materials could result in lower
costs and sale prices. However, high quality design and sufficient tenant amenities are necessary
to maintain minimum health and safety standards and a good quality of life/environment for
residents.
Given the high costs of land and development in Irvine, construction of new affordable housing
would require significant subsidies. The City of Irvine Affordable Housing Strategy estimates
that an average subsidy of $154,500 per unit is needed to provide an affordable rental unit. Based
on this estimate, at least $81,576,000 in subsidies would be needed to construct 528 affordable
apartments, excluding land costs.

General Plan

Cost Comparisons
The above analysis attempts to estimate the cost of preserving the at-risk units under various
options, even though the conversion risk is low. The estimated cost of acquiring the seven at-risk
projects and transferring ownership to nonprofit housing organizations is the highest
($133,318,275). By comparison, the annual estimated costs of providing rental subsidies to
preserve the 528 assisted units are relatively low ($4.6 million). However, long term provision of
rental subsidies for at least 55 years would cost more than $253 million. Overall, the new
construction of 528 replacement units may be the most cost-effective option ($81,576,000
million, excluding land costs). This option is constrained by a variety of factors, including the
lack of financial resources to provide subsidies and rising land costs.
Resources for Preserving At-Risk Units
Due to the high cost of housing development in Orange County, many communities have found
that partnerships with nonprofit housing developers are an effective tool for creating and/or
preserving affordable housing units. In Irvine, several affordable housing developments have
been made possible through close coordination and partnership with nonprofit housing
developers, as well as for-profit developers such as the Irvine Company. Aside from the
development of new affordable housing, the following nonprofit developers have in the past, and
may in the future, be able to assist the City by acquiring and managing at-risk units.
Jamboree Housing Corporation
Jamboree Housing Corporation (JHC) is one of the first nonprofit housing organizations to
provide both affordable housing and on-site social services in Irvine. JHC currently owns six
affordable family and senior communities in the City, including Montecito Vista Apartments,
Granite Court Apartments, The Arbor at Woodbury Apartments, The Inn at Woodbridge, The
Meadows Mobile Home Community and Doria Apartments Phase I and Phase II. These projects
have a total of 931 affordable units. All JHC properties offer residents a range of on-site social,
educational, and recreational services through their Housing with HEART (Helping Educate,
Activate and Respond Together) program. Services offered include health and safety classes;
social activities; computer learning centers with Internet access; after-school tutoring; budgeting
and parenting skills classes; home buying seminars; referrals to local agencies; and more.
Residents of JHC senior communities enjoy a variety of services, including transportation to
appointments and off-site events, as well as assistance with daily living activities.
Irvine Housing Opportunities, Inc.
Irvine Housing Opportunities (IHO) is a private nonprofit organization whose mission is to
develop affordable housing that benefits extremely low to moderate income households by
developing housing through new construction, rehabilitation of existing structures and
acquisition, as an independent developer or through joint ventures and by providing the
necessary services to enable people to remain in their homes. IHO’s most recent project in Irvine
is the addition of 15 new units designated for low income seniors to the existing 150-unit
Woodbridge Manor.
Bridge Housing Corporation
Bridge Housing Corporation is another nonprofit housing developer producing affordable units
in Irvine. The Bridge Housing Corporation currently owns four multi-family housing complexes
in Irvine, including Santa Alicia Apartments, Windrow Apartments, Laguna Canyon Apartments,
City of Irvine                                   C-40                                 Housing Element

and Woodbury Walk Apartments. These four complexes have a total of 444 units affordable to
households earning 80 percent or below the AMI.
The Irvine Company
The City’s partnership with the Irvine Company has produced and preserved a range of
affordable, subsidized housing for the City’s lower-income residents. The Irvine Company
currently offers an affordable housing rental program at 22 of its apartment communities in
Irvine. They are:
          Berkeley & Columbia Court                     San Paulo

Financial and Administrative Resources
Irvine Community Land Trust
In 2006, the City formed the Irvine Community Land Trust (Land Trust), a nonprofit public
benefit corporation dedicated to providing affordable housing opportunities for the community.
Under the community land trust (CLT) model, a CLT owns the underlying land and sells the
houses to individual homeowners at affordable prices. A CLT also leases land to affordable
rental housing developers and restricts the rents they charge through a ground lease. For
ownership housing, the CLT enters into a 99-year, renewable ground lease with each
homeowner, which gives the homeowner exclusive use of the land and nearly all of the benefits
of traditional homeownership.
The Land Trust will partner with private and nonprofit developers to produce high quality
affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households. The Land Trust also expects to
participate in the development of housing for special needs households. The Land Trust will be
involved in the development and preservation of both rental and ownership units, with a focus of
the organization being the management of permanently affordable homeownership units.
Figure C-3: Organization of the Irvine Community Land Trust
The ultimate goal of the Land Trust is to create approximately 5,000 units of permanently
affordable housing in the City of Irvine by 2025. This goal will contribute more than 50 percent
of the City’s goal of 9,700 affordable units by 2025.4 As of February 2013, a total of eight
single-family condominiums have been purchased by the Land Trust and are being rented to very

low income households and one single-family condominium has been sold to a very-low income
household. In addition, the Land Trust recently obtained entitlement to construct a 104-unit
affordable housing project serving very low income households. Groundbreaking on the project
is expected in late Fall 2013. The Land Trust will also conduct a monitoring program on behalf
of the City and provide stewardship for all of its units, insuring high-quality construction, design,
sustainability, maintenance and permanent affordability. The Land Trust will achieve self-
sufficiency by ensuring that fees and other earned income are sufficient to support the
organization’s ongoing operating costs. As a 501(c)(3) public charity, the Land Trust is eligible
to receive property and funds from a variety of sources, such as:
         Direct land donations from developers - To satisfy inclusionary housing requirements,
          developers may choose to make land donations to the Land Trust.
         Inclusionary in-lieu fees - May be used to satisfy inclusionary housing requirements as an
          alternative to providing affordable units at the project site.
         Community Development Block Grant Funds
         HOME Investment Partnership Funds
         Tax-advantaged private donations
         Acquisition loans from the banks, community development financial institutions and
          others.
Inclusionary Zoning In-Lieu Fee
The City’s Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance, adopted in 2003, requires 15 percent of all new units
in Irvine to be affordable to very low-, low- and moderate-income households, with five percent
reserved for very low-income households, five percent for low-income households, and five
percent for moderate-income households. If a developer can demonstrate that it is infeasible to
build units on site, the inclusionary ordinance allows for several options to satisfy the 15 percent
requirement. Some of the options include payment of an in-lieu fee, donation of land, converting
existing market rate housing to affordable housing for a period of at least 30 years, extending the
term of affordability for existing affordable units for at least 40 years, or provision of alternative
housing. As of 2013, the City of Irvine had developed a total of 4,178 units of affordable rental
housing in direct response to the City’s voluntary and required inclusionary housing program. An
additional 250 very low and low income units have been entitled.
Community Development Block Grant Funds
The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (“Act”) initiated the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, which provides funds to local jurisdictions for
community development activities. Although the Act has been amended in recent years, the
primary objective continues to be the development of viable urban communities by providing
decent housing, a suitable living environment, and expanding economic opportunities,
principally for persons of low- and moderate-income.
The CDBG program is flexible in that funds can be used for a wide range of activities. The
eligible activities include, but are not limited to: acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or
property, public facilities and improvements, provision of public services, relocation,
rehabilitation and construction of housing, homeownership assistance, and clearance activities.
There are currently two nonprofit organizations in Irvine that have received the Community-
Based Development Organizations (CBDO) designation - AbilityFirst, Inc., and Jamboree
Housing Corporation. The City may consider opportunities to expand the CBDO designation to
City of Irvine                                    C-43                                 Housing Element
General Plan

nonprofit partners that meet HUD qualifications, and provide CDBG-eligible activities that serve
low- and moderate-income persons.
HOME Investment Partnership Act
The HOME Investment Partnership (HOME) program provides federal funds for the
development and rehabilitation of affordable rental and ownership housing for households with
incomes not exceeding 80 percent of AMI. The program gives local governments the flexibility
to fund a wide range of affordable housing activities through housing partnerships with private
industry and nonprofit organizations.
HOME funds can be used to support four general affordable housing activities:
         Homeowner Rehabilitation
         Homebuyer Activities
         Rental Housing
         Tenant-based Rental Assistance
It is important to note that the HOME program requires the Participating Jurisdiction to provide a
permanent contribution to affordable housing. This is referred to as match, which is 25 percent of
the total HOME funds drawn down for project costs and must be from non-federal resources.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
The Orange County Housing Authority administers the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher
program on behalf of the City of Irvine and all other Orange County cities that do not have
housing authorities. The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program is a federal program that
provides rental assistance to very-low-income persons in need of affordable housing. The
program offers a voucher that pays the difference between the payment standard (an exception to
fair market rent) and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g., 30 percent of their income). A voucher
also allows a tenant to choose housing that may cost above the payment standard, with the tenant
paying the extra cost. The waiting list is currently closed, but is expected to re-open within the
2013-2021 planning period. As of January 2013 there are a total of 825 households in Irvine
receiving a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher. Out of the 825 households, 287 are families, 224
are disabled persons and 314 are elderly persons.

Opportunities for Sustainable Housing
State Assembly Bill 32 (AB32) was enacted January 1, 2007 to address air pollution, greenhouse
gases and is known as the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. AB 32 authorizes
the State Air Resources Board to establish greenhouse emissions limits; monitor compliance with
and enforce any rule, regulation, order, emission limitation, emissions reduction measure
pursuant to state law. State Senate Bill 375 (SB375), was enacted January 1, 2009 to implement
AB 32 through regional coordination of land use and transportation. A key component of SB 375
is the development of a Sustainable Community Strategy (SCS), a document outlining the
region’s plan for combining transportation resources, such as roads and mass transit, with a
realistic land use pattern, in order to meet a state target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The strategy must take into account the region’s housing needs, transportation demands, and
protection of resource and farm lands. An SCS is required for each Metropolitan Planning
Organization (MPO) in the state. The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
adopted its first SCS in 2012 as part its quadrennial Regional Transportation Plan (RTP). The
RTP is a federally required document from each MPO to determine allocation of federal funding
for regional and transportation improvements, The 2012 RTP was the first to include an SCS to
coordinate land use and housing planning with transportation. The Orange County Subregion of
SCAG, under the provisions of SB375, opted to develop its own SCS, separate from that of
SCAG, but included as part of the final SCAG SCS. The Orange County SCS is also required to
be consistent with the SB 375 for consistency between land use, housing and transportation
planning.
SB 375 modified Housing Element law to achieve consistency between the land use pattern
outlined in the SCS and the state-mandated RHNA. The legislation also substantially increased
cities’ and counties’ accountability for carrying out their housing element plans. SB375 requires
all communities to include in the housing element update an analysis of the opportunities for
sustainable housing and energy conservation with respect to residential development. State law
requires the energy conservation section of the housing element to inventory and analyze the
opportunities to encourage the incorporation of energy saving features, energy saving materials,
and energy efficient systems and design for residential development. Communities across the
country are struggling with the repercussions of the 2006-2008 housing market collapse. Local
jurisdictions having dwindling resources are facing new environmental requirements from state
and federal governments. One option for jurisdictions to meet their regulatory obligations and
improve the lifestyle of their constituents is to adopt an energy efficiency program that can
leverage funds from a variety of sources to address multiple related energy objectives, using
newly created local green jobs. A well designed program can create a self-sustaining model to
implement energy efficiency and conservation while improving the economic and environmental
health of all its constituents for years to come.
Energy-related housing costs can directly impact the affordability of housing. While state
building code standards contain mandatory energy efficiency requirements for new development,
the City and utility providers are also important resources for encouraging and facilitating energy
conservation and helping residents minimize energy-related expenses.

Planning and Land Use
Over 14,000 U.S. and foreign companies have offices in Irvine, and the City draws many
employees from surrounding cities and counties. In fact, Irvine has the largest daytime
population of any city in Orange County. Reducing vehicle miles traveled is a prime opportunity
for the City of Irvine to conserve energy. However, reducing vehicle use can be difficult to
accomplish and is best directed through regional plans and programs. The City of Irvine, through
its land use patterns that facilitate within areas of the City such as the Irvine Business Complex,
higher density housing, mixed-use development, and non-automobile travel, can contribute
toward meeting this goal.
The City has adopted several higher density zoning districts along established transportation
corridors and in proximity to transportation centers. These zoning districts promote infill
development to facilitate housing in proximity to jobs, transportation and amenities, which can
maximize energy efficiency and conservation. For example, in the IBC, located in the southwest
portion of the City in Planning Area 36, the City created the 5.0 IBC Mixed Use zoning district
to accommodate a mixture of retail, office, and residential uses. The City then prepared the
Irvine Business Complex Residential Mixed-Use Vision Plan (Vision Plan), which was
conceptually endorsed by the City Council in 2006 and completed in 2009. The Vision Plan was
considered by the Planning Commission on April 1, 2010 and approved by the City Council on
July 13, 2010. The IBC was initially developed solely as a commercial and industrial center
serving Southern California as a regional economic and employment base, including hotel,
restaurant, commercial, retail, industrial and office uses. A major component of the Vision Plan
is providing housing opportunities for the local and regional employment base that support and
complement commercial and industrial uses in the IBC. It also includes a multiple use district
and an urban neighborhood district with land uses that specify ground floor retail, offices, and
restaurants, with upper floors accommodating offices or residential.
Conservation Incentives for the Building Industry and Residents
The City of Irvine has extensive programs that address five key aspects of environmental
sustainability: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy conservation, recycling, pollution
prevention and green building. The City is committed to conserving energy as a means of
creating a sustainable environment. Irvine adopted an Energy Plan in July 2008 to implement the
policies of the Energy Element of the General Plan. The Energy Plan also sets forth four energy
conservation goals for the City: 1.) involve 100 percent of Irvine residents and businesses in
reducing energy consumption; 2.) reduce building energy use 30 percent by the year 2015; 3.)
transition new buildings Citywide to renewable energy; 4.) reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Citywide to 1990 levels by 2020, in accordance with State Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), which was
passed in 2006 by the State Legislature. The City’s recycling program offers ways to encourage
and facilitate residential and commercial recycling through curbside recycling and
demolition/construction recycling. Irvine’s pollution prevention program focuses on efforts to
protect local air and water quality. The City also formally endorses third-party verified green
building certification programs, such as Build It Green’s GreenPoint Rated for residential
properties and the US Green Building Council’s LEED certification for new construction,
rehabilitation and neighborhood planning.

Promoting Green Building and Energy Efficient Building Standards and
Practices
As of 2013, the City of Irvine has done and is doing much in the way of environmental
management and protection, all while promoting the principles of sustainability. Touted as one
of America’s 50 greenest cities with cutting edge initiatives on energy, green building, and
sustainability, Irvine proudly stands as an environmentally progressive city. Since its
incorporation in 1971, the City has been a pioneer in planning and steadfast in executing its bold
vision for an urban, planned community. As a signatory to the U.S. Conference of Mayors
Climate Protection Agreement in 2006 and 2009, Irvine has repeatedly demonstrated its
commitment to preserving the environment that makes it so attractive to residents, businesses
and visitors.
The City of Irvine’s Residential Rehabilitation Program provides $5,000 grants and loans up to
$25,000 to qualifying low and very low income homeowners in need of health and safety,
building code, and accessibility–related repairs. Only owner-occupied single-family dwellings
and manufactured homes located in the City of Irvine are eligible for funding. Energy
conservation measures are considered an eligible repair under this program.
Consistency with AB32, SB375 and the California Attorney General Global Warming
Measures Opinions and Directives
The City of Irvine has implemented the provisions of SB 375 and the SCS through large-scale
projects such as the Irvine Business Complex Residential Mixed-Use Vision Plan, and is
currently implementing these provisions within the proposed Heritage Fields mixed-use
development concurrent with construction of the Orange County Great Park, all on the former
MCAS El Toro. These implementation actions of the City are consistent with examples of
greenhouse gas reduction measures in the context of a housing element found in the California
Attorney General Global Warming opinions and directives regarding implementation of AB 32,
SB375 and new CEQA guidelines. The Attorney General lists examples of potential greenhouse
gas reduction measures in the context of a housing element such as:
         Improve the jobs-housing balance and promote a range of affordable housing choices
          near jobs, services and transit, consistent with the City’s master plan.
         Concentrate mixed use, and medium to higher density residential development in
          designated areas near jobs, transit routes, schools, shopping areas and recreation, such as
          the IBC.
         Encourage transit-oriented developments that are compatible within existing residential
          villages.
         Designate mixed use areas.
Because the City is required to impose enforceable mitigation measures to address greenhouse
gas emissions, each development project will be required to address this in its environmental
review and mitigation measures will be required to comply with the law.

General Plan

Special Housing Needs
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty in finding decent, affordable
housing due to their special needs. Special circumstances may be related to one’s employment
and income, family characteristics, and disability, among other factors. Pursuant to state Housing
Element law, special needs groups include the following: persons with disabilities, senior
households, large households, and single-parent households, the homeless and farm workers.
Persons with Disabilities
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a disabled person as having a physical or
mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Disabled persons
have special needs and many earn little income, have high health care costs, are dependent on
supportive services, and/or require special building accommodations, such as access ramps or
elevators.
Developmentally Disabled
Section 4512 of the State of California Welfare and Institutions Code provides the following
definitions for persons with developmental disabilities:
(a) “Developmental disability” means a disability that originates before an individual attains age
18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
disability for that individual. As defined by the Director of Developmental Services, in
consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, this term shall include mental
retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also include disabling conditions
found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required
for individuals with mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping conditions that
are solely physical in nature.
(b) “Services and supports for persons with developmental disabilities” means specialized
services and supports or special adaptations of generic services and supports directed toward the
alleviation of a developmental disability or toward the social, personal, physical, or economic
habilitation or rehabilitation of an individual with a developmental disability, or toward the
achievement and maintenance of independent, productive, normal lives. The determination of
which services and supports are necessary for each consumer shall be made through the
individual program plan process. The determination shall be made on the basis of the needs and
preferences of the consumer or, when appropriate, the consumer’s family, and shall include
consideration of a range of service options proposed by individual program plan participants, the
effectiveness of each option in meeting the goals stated in the individual program plan, and the
cost-effectiveness of each option. Services and support listed in the individual program plan may
include, but are not limited to, diagnosis, evaluation, treatment, personal care, day care,
domiciliary care, special living arrangements, physical, occupational, and speech therapy,
training, education, supported and sheltered employment, mental health services, recreation,
counseling of the individual with a developmental disability and of his or her family, protective
and other social and sociolegal services, information and referral services, follow-along services,
adaptive equipment and supplies, advocacy assistance, including self-advocacy training,
facilitation and peer advocates, assessment, assistance in locating a home, child care, behavior
training and behavior modification programs, camping, community integration services,
community support, daily living skills training, emergency and crisis intervention, facilitating

circles of support, habilitation, homemaker services, infant stimulation programs, paid
roommates, paid neighbors, respite, short-term out-of-home care, social skills training,
specialized medical and dental care, supported living arrangements, technical and financial
assistance, travel training, training for parents of children with developmental disabilities,
training for parents with developmental disabilities, vouchers, and transportation services
necessary to ensure delivery of services to persons with developmental disabilities. Nothing in
this subdivision is intended to expand or authorize a new or different service or support for any
consumer unless that service or support is contained in his or her individual program plan.
(c) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), for any organization or agency receiving federal
financial participation under the federal Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights
Act of 2000, as amended, “developmental disability” and “services for persons with
developmental disabilities” mean the terms as defined in the federal act to the extent required by
federal law.
The Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (Act) was passed by 106th
Congress and became federal law January 2001. As defined by the Act, “developmental
disability” means a severe, chronic disability of an individual that:
         Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental and physical
          impairments;
         Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
         Is likely to continue indefinitely;
         Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of
          major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language; c) learning; d)
          mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or g) economic self-
          sufficiency;
         Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
          interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of assistance
          that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually planned and coordinated.
According to the Regional Center of Orange County (RCOC), an estimated 1,074 persons in
Irvine have developmental disabilities. Generally, persons with developmental disabilities may
require life-long assistance in their daily living and/or work. Many developmentally disabled
persons can live and work independently within a conventional housing environment. More
severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervision is provided.
The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment where medical
attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before
adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition
from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
Table C-28 presents the number and proportion of Irvine residents with one or more
developmental disabilities, as reported by the RCOC. According to the RCOC, approximately
1,074 persons in Irvine have one or more developmental disabilities. However, the community
has indicated there are developmentally disabled Irvine residents who are not clients of the RCOC.
These persons are difficult to quantify since most support organizations do not track the number of
individuals served by the type of disability. Additionally, many may live at home with their parents

Non-Housing Resources for Persons with Developmental Disabilities
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families
through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-
based facilities. The RCOC is one of 21 regional centers in California that provides point of entry to
services for people with developmental disabilities. The RCOC is a private, nonprofit community
agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families.
Any resident of Orange County who has a developmental disability that originated before age 18
is eligible for services. Services are offered to persons with developmental disabilities based on
Individual Program Plans and may include: adult day programs, advocacy,
assessment/consultation, behavior management programs, diagnosis and evaluation, independent
living services, infant development programs, information and referrals, mobility training,
prenatal diagnosis, residential care, respite care (temporary institutional care of a dependent
elderly, ill or handicapped person, providing relief for their usual caregivers), physical and
occupational therapy, transportation, consumer, family vendor training and vocational training.
RCOC also coordinates the state-mandated Early Start program, which provides services for
children under age three who have or are at substantial risk of having a developmental disability.
RCOC services do not include the provision of housing. According to the RCOC February 2010
Facts and Statistics data, the RCOC serves approximately 16,728 individuals. As of 2012, 380
Irvine residents were receiving services through RCOC.
Another community resource for persons with disabilities is the Dayle McIntosh Center. The
mission of the Dayle McIntosh Center is to advance the empowerment, equality, integration and
full participation of people with disabilities in the community. The Center is not a residential
program, but instead promotes the full integration of disabled persons into the community. Dayle
McIntosh Center is a consumer-driven organization serving all disabilities. Its staff and Board of
Directors are composed of over 50 percent of people with disabilities. Its two branch offices
service over 500,000 people with disabilities in Orange County and surrounding areas. The
Center’s South County branch is located in Laguna Hills, immediately adjacent to Irvine.

General Plan

Statewide data from the Employment Development Department shows persons with
developmental disabilities to be at the extremely low income category with most earning well
below 30 percent of the AMI. Due to their extremely low income they can afford the lowest rents
only with rental assistance from parents, families or the federal Section 8 Voucher program. Job
support is available to the developmentally disabled through the Dayle McIntosh Center and
vendors of the RCOC. However, rental assistance is not. According to the DDS 2009-2010
Annual Report of Employment and Day Programs, the percentage of individuals with
developmental disabilities working in California is 13 percent. This data reflects wages reported
to the DDS for the purpose of unemployment insurance reporting. The DDS data shows that the
average 4th quarter wages of a California RCOC client in 2010 was $1,624. Those who are not
working must rely on support from parents, families and/or monthly Supplemental Security
Income (SSI) payments to cover food, clothing and housing costs.
The majority of persons with developmental disabilities cannot drive and, therefore, are in need
of assistance with transportation. Thus, it is desirable for developmentally disabled persons to
live near transportation and community resources such as grocery stores, libraries, banks, and
recreational facilities. It is also advantageous for these individuals to live in close proximity to
one another to allow for social interactions and efficient delivery of support services.
The City of Irvine provides transportation support to residents through the TRIPS program,
which is available to residents 18+ who are unable to drive due to a permanent physical and/or
cognitive disability. Services include rides to medical appointments, work, school, grocery
shopping, etc. In addition, the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) offers the
ACCESS bus program, which is a shared-ride service for people who are unable to use the
regular fixed route bus service due to functional limitations caused by a disability. Passengers
must be certified by OCTA to use the ACCESS system by meeting the ADA eligibility criteria.
The ACCESS program provides curb-to-curb pick up and drop off and also provides a door-to-
door service at an additional cost. A subscription service allows riders to receive service without
the need to call and request each trip, which is beneficial to riders who are traveling to work,
school, medical appointments or other destinations on a regular basis.
City Council Action Addressing Housing Needs for Developmentally Disabled
In response to citizen concerns regarding housing needs for the developmentally disabled
population in Irvine, the City Council at its May 14, 2013 meeting directed staff to prepare a
report within 30, but no more than 45 days which:
         Identifies the scope of the current as well as the future housing needs of the disabled and
          developmentally disabled population.
         Summarizes the current adopted City Council housing policies for the disabled and
          specifically the developmentally disabled.
         Describes housing and services that are currently being provided by others to serve the
          needs of these citizens.
         Provides the City Council with a list of possible solutions, if inadequacies are found; and
         Returns with a structure for a task force that would convene and then bring back
          recommendations to the City Council for consideration.

Housing Needs of Persons with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities have special housing needs, such as accessible and affordable housing,
and housing near public transportation, services and community facilities. According to the State
Department of Social Services, a number of residential facilities are located in Irvine to serve the
disabled population. Six adult residential care facilities offer a total capacity of 32 beds for
persons with developmental disabilities. Several affordable housing projects serve the disabled
population. These include AbilityFirst (24 units), Mariposa Villas (40 units), Sutton Irvine
Residence (nine units), Woodbridge Manor I (100 units), Woodbridge Manor II (50 units),
Woodbridge Manor III (15 units), Doria Apartments Phase I and II (20 units) and Alegre
Apartments (11 units).
Residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are considered a regular residential use
and are permitted in all residential districts pursuant to state Health and Safety Code and state
Welfare and Institutions Code. Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are
conditionally permitted in all residential districts.
The City currently has two all-affordable apartment complexes for the disabled: Mariposa Villas
and AbilityFirst Apartments. The City partnered with multiple agencies to facilitate the
development of Mariposa Villas, an accessible 40-unit apartment complex affordable to very low
income households. Mariposa Villas is currently home to over 60 persons with disabilities. The
AbilityFirst complex features 14 one-bedroom and nine two-bedroom rental units built
specifically for low income individuals with disabilities. Additionally, seven out of 165
affordable units in the Woodbridge Manor apartment complex are designated specifically for
disabled seniors. The units are on the ground floor and feature accessible bathrooms and lower
countertops in the kitchen.
To make housing in Irvine more accessible, the City provides loans and grants for accessibility
improvements to homes. The City’s voluntary Universal Design Principle program also
encourages developers to offer universal design features where permitted by architecture and
elevations. Universal Design concepts simplify life by making homes and associated living
environments more useable by more people including: children, aging populations and persons
with disabilities. These design features accommodate the aging of family members by
incorporating universal design principles and elements in the materials, technology and products
in the construction of a new home. Additional resources for persons with disabilities are outlined
in Table C-29 below.

Elderly
Senior households are those headed by individuals aged 65 or older. Senior households often
have lower and fixed incomes, physical or mental disabilities, and/or dependence needs.
According to the 2006-2010 ACS, 8,933 households in Irvine (12 percent of City total) were
headed by seniors (Table C-30). Of that total, 6,428 (72 percent of senior headed households)
were owner-households and 2,505 (28 percent of senior headed households) were renter-
households. A significant number of these elderly households reside in the two mobile home
parks. The proportion of senior households in Irvine has increased since 1990, when 8.9 percent
of households (3,583) were headed by seniors.

Based on data from the American Community Survey, the senior population in Irvine is expected
to almost triple (to 18,963) by 2035. Low income elderly renters are a particularly vulnerable
group, and are often the most in need of affordable housing options. Currently in Irvine, 27

Single-parent families with children often require special attention due to their needs for
affordable childcare, health care, and housing assistance. The Census Bureau reported 6,669
female-headed households in Irvine, representing 9.3 percent of all households in the community
(Table C-35). Female-headed households represented approximately eight percent of owner

Following a directive issued by the Office of Management and Budget, the Census Bureau uses a
set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to detect who is
considered poor by federal standards. If the total income for a family or unrelated individual falls
below the relevant poverty threshold, then the family or unrelated individual is classified as
being "below the poverty level."
Female-headed households are disproportionately affected by poverty (Table C-36). ACS data
for the 2009-2011 period reported 8,458 households (11 percent of all households) in Irvine
living in poverty. Approximately 18 percent of female-headed families and 22 percent of female-
headed non-family households reported incomes below poverty level.

Farmworkers
Only 164 Irvine residents held “Farming, Forestry, and Fishing” occupations, according to the
2005-2009 American Community Survey. These persons are most likely employed in plant
nurseries, landscaping or gardening companies. As such, the City has no need for farm worker
housing and affordable housing needs of those who held the “Farming, Forestry, and Fishing”
occupations would be accommodated under the City’s various affordable housing programs.

Homeless
The County of Orange Housing and Community Services Department undertakes a biannual
“Point-in-Time” survey of the homeless population as part of its application for homeless
assistance grant funds to HUD. The most recent Point-in-Time Survey for which results are
available was conducted in January 2011. It is estimated that there were approximately 6,939
homeless persons in the county at the time of the survey, of which 2,667 were sheltered and
4,272 were unsheltered5. The 2011 survey estimates the total homeless population in Irvine as
118 persons, with 50 persons sheltered and 68 persons unsheltered. The survey asked
respondents where they lived just prior to becoming homeless. Of the 610 survey respondents, 10
(1.6%) reported Irvine as their last city of residence6.
The 2010 Census reported four homeless persons in Irvine7. The homeless live in cars, parks,
under bridges, motels, and in homeless shelters trying to maintain their dignity while they
struggle to survive. As a result, most homeless remain hidden.
To address the problem of homelessness, the City of Irvine is an active participant in the County
of Orange Homeless Coalition, a countywide Continuum of Care (CoC) umbrella organization
that brings together government agencies and community-based nonprofit agencies to focus on
eliminating homelessness in Orange County. The CoC is a planning model designed to provide
assistance to homeless persons at every level of need and to move a client from homelessness to
permanent housing. The CoC addresses both the lack of housing affordable to the lowest income
levels and addresses the underlying causes of homelessness such as substance abuse, domestic
violence and mental illness.
For many Irvine residents, the first entry into the CoC is through an emergency shelter, where
individuals and families obtain emergency housing and supportive services directed to getting
people off the streets and into a safe environment. The next component of the CoC is transitional
housing, designed as short-term housing for up to two years, where persons move into a more
stabilized housing arrangement than an emergency shelter. The final component of the CoC is
permanent housing, both with and without supportive services. The ultimate goal of the CoC
system is to move people toward housing alternatives where they are able to reside permanently
in safe and sanitary housing.
The City's major homeless services provider Families Forward offers a range of supportive
services and programs. In 2012, their transitional housing facility served 52 families that
included 103 children. The average length of stay in these transitional units is a year, depending
on the needs of the individual families. Their Rapid Re-Housing Program provides short term
transitional housing of six months or less and served 42 families including 99 children in 2012.
In addition, a 192-unit SRO facility that serves the near homeless is located in Irvine. Table C-38
lists the different facilities and service agencies in and around Irvine that serve the homeless and
those at risk of becoming homeless.

College Students
The City of Irvine is home to the University of California, Irvine (UCI), Concordia University
and Irvine Valley College. As of Fall 2012, UCI had 28,184 students enrolled and more than
15,000 students are enrolled at Irvine Valley College for the 2012-2013 academic year.
Concordia University’s enrollment as of April 2013 is 3,251 students. The presence of college
students and faculty contributes to the local economy and can affect short-term housing
demands. Most undergraduate students at UCI are housed on campus in dormitories. There are
seven apartment complexes/dormitories that tailor to the needs of undergraduate and four
apartment complexes that target graduate students and their families at the UCI campus.
However, the majority of graduate students must seek housing off campus.
In 2007, UCI updated its Long-Range Development Plan (LRDP), which includes plans for
student and faculty housing. As a general land use plan, the LRDP is neither an enrollment plan
nor an implementation plan. Rather, the LRDP contains a framework of policies and guidelines
City of Irvine                                       C-60                                          Housing Element
General Plan

to accommodate an identified level of enrollment and physical development. According to the
LRDP, housing for upper division undergraduate and graduate students is provided in the East
Campus sector. Approximately 12,582 students reside in East Campus, in housing built at an
average density of 48 beds per acre. The 2007 LRDP identifies two mixed-use areas as potential
sites that will combine housing for upper division undergraduate and graduate students with
support facilities such as food service, commercial or campus retail, meeting space, cultural
facilities and other related venues. One of these mixed-use areas includes plans for the
development of 435 multi-family dwelling units within the Mixed Use-Commercial area of the
North Campus sector. As an inclusion area use, this housing may be used to house University
faculty, staff, and students, and/or sold or rented to the private market in order to generate
revenue to support UCI academic programs.
The University of California, Board of Regents in 1983 approved the establishment of the Irvine
Campus Housing Authority (ICHA), a nonprofit corporation created to administer the housing
program. As part of its duties, ICHA assesses faculty and staff housing needs, makes policy
recommendations regarding future phases of housing, and oversees the implementation and
management of affordable employee housing on the UCI campus. Over the past two decades,
ICHA has assisted in the development of 10 phases of faculty and staff housing in University
Hills, the on-campus community-in-residence established under a ground lease from the
University of California, Board of Regents. University Hills consists of approximately 1,229
dwelling units on approximately 240 acres in the southern sector of the campus, at an average
density of 5.1 dwelling units per acre. The 2007 LRDP accommodates an additional 450
dwelling units within the same general land areas identified in the 1989 LRDP by increasing the
density of new housing built to approximately 12 units per acre. The development of faculty and
staff housing at additional sites on the East Campus and the North Campus is also permitted.

Projected Housing Needs
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
State law requires that a community provide an adequate number of sites to allow for and
facilitate production of the City’s regional share of housing. To determine whether the City has
sufficient land to accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income groups, the
City must identify “adequate sites.” Under state law adequate sites are those with appropriate
zoning and development standards, with services and facilities, needed to facilitate and
encourage the development of a variety of housing for all income levels. Irvine’s RHNA for the
2013-2021 planning period has been determined by SCAG to be 12,149 housing units, including
very low income households, low income households, moderate income households and above
moderate income households (Table C-39).

                 extremely low income housing. As an alternative to calculating the subset, local
                 jurisdictions may assume that 50 percent of the very low income category is represented by
                 households of extremely low income (less than 30 percent of the MFI).

Sites Inventory and Analysis
Inventory of Vacant Land Suitable for Residential Development
The majority of vacant residential properties in Irvine are scattered throughout the City in 10
different planning areas. A planning area is defined as a contiguous unit of land that is bounded
by natural or manmade features such as roads, ridgelines, canyons or streams. Planning areas
provide for coordinated planning and development through the use of zoning. They also provide
a recognizable geographic unit which will retain a specific identity in the City's zoning
documents. Irvine’s Zoning Ordinance establishes 37 planning areas which are completely or
partly within the City boundaries. In addition, space has been reserved for one planning area
outside of City boundaries but within the Irvine sphere of influence. Most of the planning areas
(21 of the 38) are designated for residential development with limited commercial/industrial
uses. However, there are some planning areas that have no residential development at all.
State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the Housing Element that the land inventory
is adequate to accommodate that jurisdiction’s share of the regional growth. Irvine is committed
to identifying sites at appropriate densities as required by law. The state has established “default”
density standards for local jurisdictions. State law assumes that a density standard of 30 units per
acre for metropolitan jurisdictions, such as Irvine, is adequate to facilitate the production of
housing affordable to lower income households. Therefore, in estimating potential units by
income range, it is assumed that:
         A density of 0 to 10 units per acre (primarily for single-family homes) is assumed to
          facilitate housing in the above moderate income category;
         A density of 11 to 29 units per acre (primarily for medium density multi-family
          developments) is assumed to facilitate housing in the moderate income category; and
         A density of 30 or more units per acre (primarily for higher density multi-family
          developments) is assumed to facilitate housing in the very low and low income category.
Table C-41 summarizes the number of potential housing units that can be accommodated on
vacant residential sites in the City’s planning areas. A full parcel-by-parcel inventory can be
found in Appendix B, including specific zoning, land use designation, lot size, and other detailed
information.

*Zoning Ordinance Special Development Requirements allow a higher dwelling unit per acre
than traditionally allowed in a low density zone.
Realistic Development Capacity
The City’s residential development standards, including maximum lot coverage, height, open
space, parking, and setback requirements, can limit the potential capacity of a site. Realistic
estimates of residential capacity on the City’s vacant land are based on recent development
trends in Irvine and maximum unit caps allowed in each planning area.
Based on City records, recent residential developments have been able to utilize density bonuses
to achieve an average of 105 percent of the maximum density allowed. Due to the City’s
inclusionary housing requirements, most developments qualify for a density bonus. Particularly
for multi-family rental housing, most developments either exceed maximum allowable densities
or reach very close to the maximum densities permitted. For condominium/townhomes, most
developments achieved the mid-range of the allowable densities. Conservatively, the sites
inventory uses average densities that range between 70 and 80 percent of the maximum
permitted, based on site characteristics and master plan objectives of the planning areas. Table C-
42 demonstrates that projects are typically built at densities of 30 dwelling units or greater, even
when there is no minimum density requirement.

Since the Irvine Company is the major landowner in the City, large sites such as ones shown in
the sites inventory have historically been subdivided into smaller tracts and parcels due to their
own master planning processes. However, the City’s strategy is to work cooperatively with
developers to facilitate the subdivision of large sites, through specific and master planning
efforts, to increase the feasibility of development of affordable housing development on these
sites or to off-set costs. For example, the Northern Sphere is a large area of the City that was
initially an undeveloped area encompassing Planning Areas 1, 5B, 6, 8A, 9, and 9A (see
Planning Area map in Appendix B). When the Irvine Company began master planning this area
most of the parcels were 50 acres or more. Through the planning and entitlement process the
City encouraged the subdivision of large parcels into smaller tracts through development
agreements and incentives such as a reduction in park dedication requirements (as permitted by
the Subdivision Ordinance) in order to encourage the construction of affordable housing.
Specifically, the reduction in park dedication requirements required for residential development
helps lower the cost of construction of the units planned for lower income households. Other
incentives such as expedited processing for multiple subdivision maps further facilitated the
feasibility of building affordable housing on these sites. As a result, there are three all-affordable
housing projects located in the Northern Sphere: Woodbury Walk Apartments, The Arbor at
Woodbury Apartments and Doria Apartments. All of these projects were built on parcels six
acres or less in size, which were considered by nonprofit developers such as Jamboree Housing
Corporation and Bridge Housing Corporation to be appropriate for the development of very low

income housing. To this effect, these affordable housing projects were successfully planned,
financed, and are constructed or under construction. Another example of the City’s commitment
to facilitating small lot development is Planning Area 40, which has a three and a half acre site
dedicated to the City by the Irvine Company through a development agreement. The site has
been entitled and will be developed as a 104 unit affordable housing project by the City through
its nonprofit organization, the Irvine Community Land Trust.
The City provides to all developers a Subdivision Manual (“Manual”), which is a supplementary
document that identifies the procedures for administering and implementing the State
Subdivision Map Act and the City of Irvine Subdivision Ordinance. The Manual is adopted by
the City Council and revised from time to time by the City of Irvine Director of Community
Development. The Manual serves to assist users by providing a comprehensive description of the
City’s requirements and procedures for processing subdivision-related applications.
Analysis of Non-Vacant and Underutilized Sites
The City of Irvine is a relatively new community. Future residential development will occur on
vacant properties as shown in the Sites Inventory (Appendix B). While the Spectrum and IBC do
contain underutilized properties that can accommodate high density residential and mixed use
developments, this Housing Element does not rely on underutilized sites to meet the City’s
RHNA.
Accommodating the Development of Housing Affordable to Lower Income Households
To accommodate the development of affordable housing, the City is committed to identifying
sites at appropriate densities as required by law. The state has established “default” density
standards for local jurisdictions. State law assumes that a density standard of 30 units per acre for
urban jurisdictions such as Irvine, as being able to facilitate the production of housing affordable
to lower income households.
Sites depicted in Appendix B within zoning districts allowing higher densities (up to 50 units per
acre) are used to fulfill the City’s RHNA for lower income households as well as moderate and
above moderate income households. Sites that permit up to 30 units per acre are used for the
City’s RHNA for moderate income households. In reality, many of the City’s affordable housing
projects are developed at densities lower than 30 units per acre. Therefore, these density
assumptions are conservative compared to state law and the City’s past development trends. The
City, as demonstrated in this Housing Element, has adequate vacant sites to accommodate its
RHNA for all income groups.
Environmental Constraints and Adequate Infrastructure
Environmental Constraints
Environmental factors can constrain residential development in a community by increasing costs
and reducing the amount of land suitable for housing.
Hillsides
The City of Irvine is comprised of relatively flat land where most development takes place, as
well as hillsides at the City’s north and south borders. The hillsides are an integral part of the
community’s image and identity, providing a stunning visual backdrop, an environmental
City of Irvine                                   C-66                                 Housing Element
General Plan

sanctuary, and a recreational resource. Preserving the hillsides is an important community goal.
Policies relating to hillside development must balance environmental protection, property rights,
and community values. In these areas, the City has developed a Hillside Overlay District to
provide for guidelines that allow for development with minimal impact to natural topographical
features. The development capacity reflects the impact of hillside development constraints in
specific planning areas.
Natural Community Conservation Plan (NCCP)/Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP)
The Natural Community Conservation Plan/Habitat Conservation Plan (NCCP/HCP) is a
regional land use and conservation plan aimed at preserving entire biotic communities and was
developed as a result of the NCCP Act passed by the California Legislature in 1991. It created a
regional network of land reserves to protect entire communities of native plants and animals,
while at the same time allowing development to move forward in other areas.
In the mid-1990s the City of Irvine, County of Orange and various other cities and landowners
entered into an agreement to place certain lands with the NCCP Reserve. The goal of the
program is to bring much-needed certainty, both for protection of California’s unique natural
legacy, and for economic growth and use of private property. The City believes that protecting,
restoring, and managing large blocks of native habitat under the plan is a more effective way to
manage development than the project-by-project regulation of years past. It also results in a
better outcome for the rare open spaces in Irvine.
Natural Hazards
Irvine is susceptible to many natural hazards, including wildfires, mudslides, and flooding. Other
geological conditions of concern that present additional vulnerability to the community include
earthquake fault zones, liquefaction areas, landslide areas, and steeply sloped hillsides.
Development in areas with known hazards must ensure that adequate precaution and mitigation
are afforded to protect public health and safety.
Adequate Infrastructure Capacity
Lack of infrastructure and public services can constrain the development of housing. Costs to
extend infrastructure or to provide public services can significantly affect the cost of housing and
the timing of development.
Water Service
The Irvine Ranch Water District (IRWD) provides domestic water service to Irvine residents and
businesses. Approximately 35 percent of IRWD’s drinking water is purchased from the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Imported water comes from the Colorado
River via the Colorado River Aqueduct and from Northern California via the State Water
Project. The remaining 65 percent comes from local wells. The Irvine Ranch Water District
provides all of Irvine’s daily water supply. Adequate water is available for the level of
development projected by the City.
Wastewater Service
Public wastewater lines, which exclude those connecting from private properties, are maintained
by the Irvine Ranch Water District. All planning areas in the City are master-planned to provide

General Plan

adequate wastewater service to the level of development that is projected per the City’s current
land use plan.
Roads
As the City matures, it must coordinate the pace of development with the circulation systems.
Planned roadway capacities may be exceeded if development continues without effective
transportation demand measures, and coordination of alternative transit systems. The City
utilizes a computer traffic model to assist in analyzing proposed land use changes.
Schools
The Irvine Unified School District (IUSD) serves the majority of the City’s residential
neighborhoods. Other school districts which serve Irvine residents include the Santa Ana Unified
School District, Saddleback Valley Unified School District and the Tustin Unified School
District. Each school district’s student generation rate changes over time. Rates are based on
factors such as density, type of new development, and new or existing residential units. Typical
school sizes for the IUSD are as follows:
         Elementary School (K-6): 600 students, with provisions to house a maximum of 720
          students on an average site of ten acres
         Middle School (7-8): 700 students, with provisions to house a maximum of 900 students
          on an average site of 20 acres
         High School (9-12): 1,800 students, with provisions to house a maximum of 2,400
          students on an average site of 40 acres
Trash
Residential, institutional, regional commercial, and industrial solid waste is presently collected
by private firms, with residential and neighborhood commercial collection exclusively handled
by a single waste hauler franchised by the City. Collected waste not intended for recycling is
typically transported directly to the Frank R. Bowerman Landfill. This facility is located north of
Portola Parkway in unincorporated County land within Planning Area 3 and is operated by the
County of Orange.
Waste generation can be expected to increase as the population in the City and County continues
to grow. As landfill capacity decreases, additional solid waste disposal facilities will be
necessary. Efforts to limit waste flowing into landfills through source reduction and recycling
will become increasingly important as the economies of scale for landfill construction and
operation becomes increasingly prohibitive. A significant amount of the solid waste generated in
the City of Irvine is being diverted from the landfill and reused or recycled through City and
private sector waste reduction and recycling programs. In the future, public reliance on County
waste disposal sites may diminish if local private sector development of additional material
recovery, recycling and other non-disposal facilities occurs. Such development could increase
the responsibility of the City to review and control the siting of such waste facilities. In 2009,
Orange County cities renewed an agreement with the County to continue using the Frank R.
Bowerman Landfill and two other regional landfills, which will continue under County
operation.

Public Facilities
City facilities and services include the Civic Center, Lakeview Senior Center, Rancho Senior
Center, the Animal Care Center, the Aquatics Center and 14 community centers. Two County
libraries are also located within Irvine. A Citywide study, which analyzed service programs (not
facilities and infrastructure), concluded that the “majority” of Irvine residents and workers enjoy
access to most of the services they need and that, for the most part, they are satisfied with the
availability of those services.
Parks and Recreation
The City of Irvine’s public park system is divided into two park categories: community parks
and neighborhood parks. The City has 19 developed community park sites totaling 350 acres and
five special facilities totaling 45.5 acres. There are 37 public neighborhood parks totaling 163
acres and many private neighborhood parks. In addition, the City has 11 landscaped public
recreational trails totaling 43 miles. The Great Park currently has 200 developed acres of parks
and recreation, which include six soccer fields, two of which are currently in use and the
remaining four under construction that will open in July 2013.
Fire Services
The Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA) was formed in 1995 as a joint power authority and is
governed by a 24-member board comprised of representatives of the 22 cities and the
unincorporated areas it protects. As a partner agency, Irvine receives regional fire protection and
emergency services from one of the largest regional fire service organizations in California.
OCFA currently operates 70 fire stations, 11 of which are within the City. The OCFA policy for
fire protection and emergency services in Irvine is as follows:
         For fire and basic life safety incidents in urban areas, a first due unit on scene within a
          seven minute, 20 second response time 80 percent of the time.
         For advanced life support incidents, units shall be located and staff available within 10
          minutes response time 80 percent of the time.
Police Services
Police services are provided by the City of Irvine Public Safety Department. The number of
authorized sworn police officers as of February 2013 was 197, plus three recruits. Staffing goals
are adjusted annually as addressed in the City’s Strategic Business Plan to ensure that, at a
minimum, the following emergency response standards are met:
         Responding to Priority E (Emergency) events within six minutes 85 percent of the time.
         Responding to Priority I (Crimes in Progress) events within 10 minutes 85 percent of the
          time.
         Responding to Priority II (Less Serious Crimes just occurred) events within 20 minutes
          90 percent of the time.

Housing Constraints
A number of factors can constrain the development and improvement of housing in a
community. These include governmental, market and environmental constraints.
Governmental Constraints
Land Use Controls
The intent of local government regulations is to protect public health and safety, and to ensure a
decent quality of life for the community. However, local policies and regulations may affect
positively or negatively the price and availability of housing and in particular, the provision of
affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and exactions,
permit processing procedures and other factors can constrain the maintenance, development and
improvement of housing.
State and federal regulations also affect the availability of land for housing and the cost of
producing housing. Regulations related to environmental protection, building codes, and other
topics are designed to protect the public health and safety, but often these regulations have
adverse impacts on housing costs and availability. Perhaps one of the greatest constraints to the
production of housing affordable to lower income households is the chronic shortage of state and
federal financial assistance for affordable housing. While constraints exist at other levels of
government, the City has little or no control over these regulations and no ability to directly
mitigate their effects on housing. Therefore, the City’s efforts emphasize policies and regulations
that can be mitigated by the City.
Land Use Policies
The Land Use Element of the Irvine General Plan contains the primary policies that guide
residential development in the City. These policies are implemented primarily through the
Zoning Ordinance, which establishes the amount and distribution of different land uses within
Irvine, and the Subdivision Ordinance that regulates the division and improvement of land. The
City of Irvine’s Land Use Element allows for significantly higher residential densities and is not
considered a constraint to the development of housing in the City.
The Land Use Element establishes the following designations that accommodate housing:
         Estate Density (0 to 1 unit/acre): This level of density is intended for the development
          of large detached single-family homes in the hillside areas of the City.
         Low Density (0 to 5 units/acre): This level of density is intended for the development of
          attached and conventional detached housing and other appropriate uses, such as schools
          and parks, compatible with single-family neighborhoods.
         Medium Density (0 to 10 units/acre): This level of density is intended for the
          development of attached and conventional detached housing and other types of
          residential uses that have open space characteristics similar to single-family
          neighborhoods.
         Medium-High Density (0 to 25 units/acre): This level of density is intended for the
          development of multiple-family housing with on-site recreation areas for common use.

General Plan

         High Density (0 to 40 units/acre): This level of density is intended for the development
          of multiple-family housing with on-site recreation areas for common use.
         Multi-Use (0 to 50 units/acre): This land use category includes uses that are high
          intensity and urban in character. Typical uses include medium to high density residential,
          commercial, institutional, and offices.
         Orange County Great Park (10 to 50 units/acre): This land use category includes uses
          intended to provide for the development of regionally significant conservation and open
          space, parks and recreation, educational facilities, and other public-oriented land uses,
          integrated with other privately developed, multi-use, residential, commercial, and
          industrial properties at the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro site. The Overlay
          Plan Maximum Intensity Standards for the Orange County Great Park includes 400 acres
          set aside for residential uses to accommodate 4,894 low and medium density housing
          units.
         Urban/Industrial (Irvine Business Complex): This land use category provides for
          offices, industry, and support commercial, mixed with high density housing, and a variety
          of activities. Typical uses are professional/medical offices, industrial manufacturing,
          research and development, support service retail, restaurants, multifamily housing and
          hotel/motels. The IBC Element of the General Plan outlines the framework for future
          development of the IBC as a mixed-use community.
While the City has not established minimum densities in most zoning districts, the majorities of
developments achieve at least the mid-range densities for ownership housing and approach
maximum densities for rental housing. Furthermore, the IBC Vision Plan establishes a minimum
residential density of 30 units per acre. The correlation between General Plan land use
designations and zoning districts is presented in Table C-43.

General Plan

IBC Residential Mixed Use Vision
The IBC Residential Mixed Use Vision Plan is a policy framework that outlines goals and design
guidelines for residential and mixed-use developments in Planning Area 36, the IBC. The
planning area is divided into four districts, two of which (the Urban Neighborhood and the
Multi-Use District) encourage mixed-use with ground floor commercial, urban parks and street
landscape treatments. The Multi-Use District is comprised of nearly all portions of the planning
area located south of Barranca Parkway. This District incorporates portions of the IBC where a
more contemporary era of development exists and is characterized by a horizontal or vertical mix
of land uses within a campus of multiple buildings. Opportunities for future intensification
include freestanding residential or ground floor retail, offices, and restaurants, with upper floors
accommodating offices or residential.
The Urban Neighborhood District incorporates portions of the IBC appropriate for sustainable
residential neighborhoods, employment, and mixed-use blocks in buildings of up to seven
stories. This district is intended for residential uses to be clustered in nodes around local services.
Small, scattered residential projects are discouraged within the Urban Neighborhood District.
Mixed-use is encouraged with ground floor uses including residential, retail, offices, and
restaurants, and upper floors accommodating offices or residential.
Orange County Great Park
The Orange County Great Park land use category is a unique urban setting that is intended as a
zoning designation in which a wide variety of uses are allowed on the same site consistent with
the Great Park land use category as defined in the General Plan. The Trails and Transit Oriented
Development zoning category allows for a mix of residential, commercial, institutional,
industrial and educational uses that promotes and balanced development strategy. Specific uses
that serve to enhance the cultural, educational, and recreational environment are especially
encouraged in this area. The maximum site coverage area of 65 percent and building height of 70
feet permitted in this zoning district allow for either vertical or horizontal housing development.
The Transit Oriented Development zoning category encourages a diverse mix of higher-intensity
commercial, office, residential and institutional uses in areas with high potential for enhanced
transit and pedestrian activity. The category is intended to reduce reliance on the automobile by
encouraging a compact mix of uses within the same site, including the integration of
complementary uses within the same building. The development shall be designed to create a
safe and pleasant pedestrian environment by providing amenities that support the use of transit,
bicycles, and pedestrian facilities and by providing for a safe, pleasant and convenient walking
experience.
Density Bonus
Under state law (California Government Code §65915-65918), developers are entitled to a
density bonus and/or equivalent concessions or incentives for provision of affordable units. The
City of Irvine requires that a minimum of 15 percent of all housing developments be affordable
and allows for a minimum density bonus of 20 percent per state law combined with other
incentives for the development of affordable housing. Effective January 1, 2005 Senate Bill 1818
significantly reduces the percentage of affordable units that a developer must provide in order to
receive a density bonus and requires up to three concessions, depending upon the percentage of
affordable units in the development. Under the law, developers can receive a maximum density
bonus of 35 percent when a project provides one of the following:
City of Irvine                                     C-72                                 Housing Element
General Plan

         11 percent of total units for very low-income households
         20 percent of total units for low-income households
         40 percent of total units for moderate-income households
The legislation also imposes new statewide parking standards and density incentives for
developers that donate land for affordable housing. The City’s density bonus ordinance (Sec.
2-3-10. of the Zoning Ordinance) is consistent with state law since it references current state law
for specific requirements.
Development Standards
Residential development standards established in the Zoning Ordinance are designed to protect
and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents, as well as implement the
policies of the General Plan. These standards also help preserve the character and integrity of
existing neighborhoods. The development standards established by the Zoning Ordinance, as
presented below and summarized in Table C-44 can have an effect on the ability of property
owners to construct and maintain housing. Each of the standards is examined and its impact on
housing within Irvine discussed.
Residential Density
The Zoning Ordinance allows for base residential densities ranging from less than one dwelling
unit per acre to up to 50 dwelling units per acre. Residential density in the Trails and Transit
Oriented Development zoning district in the Orange County Great Park ranges from low to high
density or from 10 to 50 units per acre.
Residential densities set forth in the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance may be exceeded on
a case-by-case basis to encourage development of low and moderate income housing pursuant to
state and local density bonus laws.
Lot Size and Area
The Zoning Ordinance establishes minimum lot areas for single-family residentially-zoned
properties. The minimum lot area varies from 2,400 square feet in the medium and high density
residential districts to one (net) acre in the Estate (one-acre) District. These standards allow for a
range of housing options in Irvine.

Yards and Setbacks
Front yard setback requirements range from eight to 50 feet, depending on the zone district and
where the lot is located. Side and rear yard setbacks range from five to 10 feet for non-street side
yards. These standards are typical to master-planned communities in Orange County.
Lot Coverage
The City imposes reasonable limits on building lot coverage. Within the multiple-family zone
districts (Medium< Medium-High and High Density Residential), structures and parking may
occupy up to 100 percent of the lot, which would permit sufficient square footage to facilitate
construction of a range of variously sized apartment units up to the maximum allowable
densities. Lot coverage requirements within single-family districts allow structures to occupy 25
to 50 percent of the lot.

General Plan
Minimum Floor Area Ratio
The City does not have minimum floor area ratio requirements for residential uses.
Parking
A minimum of two covered off-street parking spaces per unit are required for all single-family
detached residential units (units with four or more bedrooms require three spaces). Second units
require an additional parking space. Parking requirements within multiple-family districts vary
by unit size and unit type (rental versus ownership), with attached rental or low- to moderate-
income ownership developments being less restrictive. In multi-family districts the parking
requirements are as follows:
         Attached development, ownership:
          o Studio: 1 space per unit (1 covered)
          o 1 bedroom: 1.5 spaces/unit (1 covered)
          o 2 or more bedrooms: 2 spaces/unit (2 covered) or .7 spaces/unit if project has resident
               garages
         Attached development, rental and low or moderate income ownership:
          o Studio; 1 space per unit (1 covered)
          o 1 bedroom; 1.4 spaces/unit (1 covered)
          o 2 bedrooms; 1.6 spaces/unit (1 covered)
          o 3 or more bedrooms; 2 spaces/unit (1 covered)
Visitor parking is also determined by unit size. A minimum of 0.25 visitor parking space per unit
are required of all projects within the multiple-family districts.
For projects meeting the density bonus requirements, the following state parking standards may
be used, inclusive of guest and handicapped parking.
         Studio to One Bedroom: 1 parking space
         Two to Three Bedrooms: 2 parking spaces
         Four or More Bedrooms: 2.5 parking spaces
The City’s parking code does allow on-street parking on a development site to count toward
fulfilling visitor parking requirements, whereas the state parking standards (in conjunction with a
density bonus) does not. The City’s parking standards are lower than those adopted by many
surrounding cities and comparable to the parking standards permitted by the state Density Bonus
law for affordable housing projects eligible for a density bonus. Therefore, the City’s parking
standards are not considered a constraint.
Height Limits
Land use regulations establish a height limit of 35 feet in low density residential districts except
for the Estate District, which permits structures up to 50 feet in height. In high density
residential districts, height limits range from 50 feet in medium and high density residential, 70
feet in the Multi-Use district, and higher in other districts such as the IBC and the Urban
Commercial. As demonstrated by the City’s past development trends, high density residential

General Plan

developments are able to achieve close to or exceed the maximum permitted densities.
Therefore, height limits in the City do not constrain housing development.
Housing in the Coastal Zone
Approximately 250 acres of the City of Irvine lie within the coastal boundaries. The majority of
this area is within the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh and a portion of the University of
California natural land and water resources system. The University of California owns all of this
property with the exception of an existing 36-acre research and light industrial development.
Pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 30519 in the California Coastal Act, the City’s Local
Coastal Program only applies to this 36-acre industrial site. As this site is currently developed
and the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance designate it for industrial use, the City anticipates no
housing development on the site in the foreseeable future.
Fees and Exactions
Development impact fees offset the costs of improvements serving the development. Planning
and processing fees cover administrative review of the development by City Community
Development and Public Works departments. The City's fee schedule is based on anticipated
costs associated with review and approval of proposed projects. Irvine’s current planning and
development fee schedule for residential projects is summarized in Table C-45.
Some fees such as permit issuance fees, slurry seal fees, and traffic related fees, are collected at
permit issuance by the Community Development Permit Counter. Transit Corridor Agency
(TCA) fees and school fees are collected by the City’s Building Division. Water and sewer fees
are collected by the Irvine Ranch Water District. In 2007 the City Council passed an Economic
Stimulus Ordinance in response to changes in the housing market throughout the nation,
including Irvine. The Ordinance was adopted to stimulate and encourage new residential
development in the City by allowing deferral of some development impact fees and optional in-
lieu fees, such as park fees, street surface construction impact fees, and affordable housing in-
lieu fees. The fees may be deferred until final inspection, or issuance of a temporary or final
Certificate of Occupancy.

IBC Development Fee
The intent of the IBC Development Fee program is to provide partial funding for the
implementation of the area wide circulation mitigation program identified in the Final Program
Environmental Impact Report 88-ER-0087 for the Irvine Business Complex. The area wide
circulation program ensures that all land uses, including market rate and affordable housing,
City of Irvine                                       C-77                                         Housing Element
General Plan

have adequate infrastructure. The IBC Development Fee program establishes variable fees per
unit of development for specific land uses, which in turn correspond to the trip generation of
each land use. Fair share costs are derived by dividing the total cost of the required circulation
improvements for future development into the total number of trips assumed to be generated by
projects that are subject to this fee program. The cost per trip is then converted into cost per unit
of development for the corresponding land use. Any development for which building permits are
issued within the IBC after 1992 is subject to this fee. In January 2011, the City Council adopted
new IBC fees. However, in June 2012, the Planning Commission received confirmation that fees
would be increased, consistent with Section 9-36-15 (H) of the Zoning Ordinance, based on the
Engineering News Construction Cost index, effective July 1, 2012. These new fees apply to all
new IBC development, including density bonus units, as follows:

University Research Park Fee
The University Research Park (URP) fee was adopted in conjunction with The University of
California Regents’ approval of the UCI Long Range Development Plan in 1989. The fee
provides for the fair sharing of costs related to transportation improvements associated with the
development of the URP, which comprises all of Planning Area 25 and is located adjacent to
UCI. The fee applies to all land owned by the campus of UCI within the URP and is required for
the development of any new building or an increase in square footage to an existing building.
The current URP fee is $3 per gross square foot and is due at the time a building permit is issued.
Table C-48 outlines the various planning related fees charged by Irvine, with a comparison of
similar fees charged by neighboring cities. Irvine is a master planned community; therefore, infill
development opportunities are limited. Most development proposals are large-scale and involve
development on previously undeveloped land. As such, the complexity of project review is not

necessary costs associated with proper review and project mitigation.

  Does not represent the total cost. All development fees are simply the deposit amount for staff to charge against for time
spent working on a project. Therefore, not every project uses the entire deposit for processing.
Combining planning/processing fees and development impact fees, a developer can expect to pay
approximately $13,000 in fees per single-family unit and $23,000 to $56,000 in fees per multi-
family unit, depending on the location of the project within the City.

To facilitate affordable housing development, the City has provided financial subsidies to offset
the cost impacts of development and planning fees. Financial assistance can come in the form of
CDBG, HOME funding and in-lieu fee funds. In-lieu fees are collected from other projects that
did not build affordable units on site, which is a permitted option in the City’s inclusionary
housing ordinance. These fees are then allocated to other projects that are building affordable
units on-site. For example, Granite Court, a 71-unit apartment complex for households earning
60 percent or less of the AMI was allocated a total of $7.7 million from the City’s in-lieu fee
account. Other financial subsidies given to facilitate development of affordable housing also
include reductions in the parkland dedication standard for new affordable units.8 Other forms of
concessions given to projects providing affordable units include priority/expedited processing for
all entitlement and ministerial permits required for development of the project, a reduction in
development standards such as setbacks requirements, landscaping requirements, parking
requirements, and building heights. As previously noted the City adopted the Economic Stimulus
Ordinance, which allows developers to defer payment of certain fees from issuance of building
permits to final inspection or issuance of a temporary or final certificate of occupancy.

     Division 5, Chapter 10, Section 5-5-1004(G). The reduction applies to the affordable units only. The normal
     park dedication fee is five acres per 1,000 population; the reduction allowed for affordable units is three and
     one-half acres per 1,000 population. The park dedication requirements can be met through dedication of land
     acreage, construction of park improvements, payment of park fees in-lieu, or by a combination of the
     aforementioned methods.

Processing and Permitting Procedure
Permitted Uses within Residential Zones
The Zoning Ordinance stipulates the residential types permitted, conditionally permitted, or
prohibited in each zone. Residential types in the City include single-family dwellings, second
dwelling units, manufactured housing, transitional housing, supportive housing, residential care
facilities, multiple-family dwellings, and mixed-use, among others. Summarized below are the
different types of residential uses permitted or conditionally permitted in various zoning districts
within the City.
         Single-Family Dwellings: Detached, single-family dwelling units are permitted in the
          following residential districts: Estate, Low Density Residential, Medium Density
          Residential, Medium-High Density Residential, High Density Residential and Transit
          Oriented Development.
          Single-family homes are also conditionally permitted in the Multi-Use, Trails & Transit
          Oriented Development and IBC Residential districts. This provision allows the
          development of small-lot single-family homes that fall within the density range of the
          multiple-family districts, but offers a product type that may be more compatible with
          surrounding uses.
         Attached Residential: Condominiums, townhomes, and apartments are permitted in the
          Estate, Low, Medium, Medium-High, Transit Oriented Development and High Density
          Residential districts. They are also conditionally permitted in the Multi-Use, IBC Mixed-
          Use IBC Residential and Trails & Transit Oriented Development districts.
         Second Units: Irvine’s Zoning Ordinance outlines the conditions under which second
          dwelling units may be permitted in all residential districts. These conditions are
          consistent with state law and include:
    o     The unit is not intended for sale and may only be rented.
    o     The lot is zoned for single-family or multiple-family use.
    o     The lot contains an existing single-family dwelling.
    o     The second unit is either attached to the existing dwelling and located within the living
          area of the existing dwelling or detached from the existing dwelling and located on the
          same lot as the existing dwelling.
    o The floor area of a second unit shall not exceed 30 percent of the floor area of the
          existing living area. This requirement is not applicable to second units on single-family
          detached lots equal to or greater than 20,000 square feet. Any construction shall conform
          to height, setback, lot coverage, fees, charges and other zoning requirements generally
          applicable to residential construction in the district in which the property is located.
    o Any construction shall conform to height, setback, lot coverage, fees, charges and other
          zoning requirements generally applicable to residential construction in the zone in which
          the property is located.
    o The total area of floor space for a detached second unit shall not exceed 1,200 square
          feet. This requirement is not applicable to second units on single family detached lots
          equal to or greater than 20,000 square feet.

General Plan

    o The second unit shall be in compliance with any local building code requirements that
          apply to detached dwellings, as appropriate.
          Second units are also permitted in the Transit 3.2 Oriented Development and 8.1 Trails &
          Transit Oriented Development zoning districts. Second units are conditionally permitted
          in the Multi-Use and IBC Mixed Use zoning districts. A second unit that conforms to the
          requirements above shall not be considered to exceed the allowable density for the lot
          upon which it is located and shall be deemed to be a residential use that is consistent with
          the existing General Plan and Zoning designation for the lot.
         Manufactured Housing: A manufactured home meeting national standards and installed
          on a foundation system, pursuant to the California Health and Safety Code, on an
          individual lot is treated as a standard single-family residential development.
          Manufactured structures are permitted in all residential districts in the City and the
          Transit Oriented Development district. No additional standards are required for approval
          or construction of units. They are also conditionally permitted in the Multi-Use, Trails &
          Transit Oriented Development, Community Commercial and IBC Mixed Use districts.
         Home Care Facilities: The Irvine Zoning Ordinance defines home care as “the care of
          six or fewer elderly persons or disabled persons or children or persons identified in the
          specific land use identified in the California Health and Safety Code, Section 1566.3,
          such as, but not limited, to transitional housing, congregate care facility, and convalescent
          home.” A state-authorized or certified family care home, foster home, or group home
          serving six or fewer persons with disabilities or dependent and neglected children on a
          24-hour-a-day basis is considered a residential use that is permitted in all residential
          districts. Home care facilities are permitted in all residential districts, as well as in the
          following:
              3.1 Multi-Use
              5.0 IBC Mixed Use
              8.1 Trails and Transit Oriented Development
         Residential Care Facilities: The Irvine Zoning Ordinance defines a residential care
          facility as “any family home, group care facility or similar facility providing 24-hour
          non-medical services, supervision or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of
          daily living. Residential care facilities include: shelters, board and care facilities, halfway
          houses, wards of the juvenile court and the like and excludes Sober Living Facilities.”
          Residential care facilities are conditionally permitted in all residential districts, except the
          Estate Residential Density district. They are also conditionally permitted in the following:
              3.1 Multi Use
              5.0 IBC Mixed Use
              5.5 Medical and Science
              6.1 Institutional
              8.1 Trails and Transit Oriented Development

         Emergency Shelters: Senate Bill 2, enacted in October 2007, requires local governments
          to identify one or more zoning categories that allow emergency shelters without
          discretionary review. The statute permits the City to apply limited conditions to the
          approval of ministerial permits for emergency shelters. The identified zone must have
          sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one year-round shelter and accommodate the
          City’s share of the regional unsheltered homeless population. According to the 2011
          Point in Time Count by the OC Partnership to End Homelessness, Irvine’s share of the
          regional unsheltered homeless population is estimated to be 68 individuals. The estimated
          sheltered homeless population in Irvine is 50 persons.
          In the City of Irvine, emergency shelters are currently permitted by right in the IBC
          Multi-Use, General Industrial, Medical and Science, Business Park, and Institutional
          zoning districts, consistent with state law. The term “permitted by right” means that no
          discretionary permits are required in order to operate an emergency shelter in these
          districts. Emergency shelters must comply with the general development standards
          outlined in the Zoning Ordinance for each zoning district and must obtain a building
          permit if any structural changes will be made to the building. In addition, they must
          comply with parking standards, which require a parking space for every four beds and
          each employee. Building permits are obtained administratively over the counter at the
          City. Properties zoned IBC Multi-Use, General Industrial, Medical and Science, Business
          Park, and Institutional are located near easy access to public transportation and services.
          Over 7,399 acres of properties zoned IBC Multi-Use, General Industrial, Medical and
          Science, Business Park, and Institutional are suitable for emergency shelter use. These
          properties are scattered throughout the City in Planning Areas 12, 13, 31, 32, 34, 35 and
          51. Maps of vacant and underutilized sites that can feasibly be used for emergency
          shelters along with a sites inventory are depicted in Appendix D. They are located along
          transportation corridors with easy access to social services and public transportation.
          These districts will be more than able to accommodate, in vacant and underutilized
          properties or through conversion of older buildings, Irvine’s estimated homeless
          population of 118 sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals.
         Transitional Housing: The California Health and Safety Code (§50675.2) defines
          “transitional housing" and "transitional housing development" as buildings configured as
          rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the
          termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible program
          recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less than six
          months. This definition of transitional housing does not encompass all transitional
          housing facilities, particularly those that operate as group quarters or community care
          facilities that charge fees rather than rents.
          Under the City’s current development regulations, the City facilitates and encourages the
          development of transitional housing by treating facilities that serve six or fewer persons
          as regular residential uses. Such facilities are permitted by right in all residential uses (see
          also discussions under “Housing for Persons with Disabilities”). They are also permitted
          by conditional use permit in the two other non-residential mixed-use zoning districts. The
          City of Irvine regulates these facilities by land use type (single-family homes, multiple-
          family apartments, or condominiums) rather than by their users.
City of Irvine                                      C-82                                   Housing Element
General Plan

          Large transitional housing facilities that operate as regular housing developments are
          considered regular residential use and permitted by right in the City’s residential zones.
          Large transitional housing facilities (serving more than six persons) that operate as
          community residential care facilities (i.e. group quarters) are conditionally permitted in
          all districts except for the Estate Density district. The CUP criteria used to review
          transitional housing pertains to performance standards. The findings are the same as those
          used for other uses requiring a CUP and would not prevent the approval of transitional
          housing facilities. Pursuant to the Zoning Code (Chapter 2-9), the findings are as follows:
              The use is appropriate in the location and circumstances in which it is proposed;
              The use is compatible with the existing and proposed on-site and proximate land uses;
              The use implements the general plan objectives;
              Project impacts are identified and mitigated; and
              Major issues associated with the development of the site have been addressed and
               resolved when development of the site is not subject to the master plan approval.
         Supportive Housing: The Health and Safety Code (§50675.14 (b)) defines "supportive
          housing" as housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by target populations
          (including persons with disabilities, homeless, persons aging out of the foster system,
          etc.) and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the supportive housing
          resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and maximizing his
          or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.
          Most supportive housing is built and managed by nonprofit housing developers in
          partnership with nonprofit service providers. Supportive housing comes in all shapes and
          sizes, and is designed to meet the needs of both the people to be served and the
          communities where it is located. It could be a renovated motel offering furnished Single
          Room Occupancy apartments; a multiple-family development where tenants with
          disabilities live alongside other families with low incomes; a small, more service-
          intensive building; or scattered-site apartments. The City of Irvine encourages
          development of supportive housing by allowing this type of use to operate as multiple-
          family rental housing in all residential zones where multiple-family housing is permitted.
          Single Room Occupancy: The City facilitates and encourages the development of new
          Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units as well as the rehabilitation of existing SRO units,
          which along with any other types of residential units are eligible to receive the density
          bonus as part of the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance. The City includes SRO housing in
          its definition of hotel/motel and conditionally permits SRO units in the Multi-Use,
          Community Commercial, IBC Mixed Use, Industrial, Medical and Science, and Trails
          and Transit Oriented Development zones. SRO units are also permitted in the Lower
          Peters Canyon Regional Commercial zone. The Irvine Inn is an existing SRO complex in
          the City that provides housing with supportive services for homeless or near homeless
          individuals.

General Plan

Conditional Use Permit Process
New residential projects not permitted by right require a CUP in order to ensure the following:
         The use is appropriate in the location and circumstances in which it is proposed;
         The use is compatible with the existing and proposed on-site and proximate land uses;
         The use implements the General Plan objectives;
         Project impacts are identified and mitigated; and
         Major issues associated with the development of the site have been addressed and
          resolved.
Division 2 of the Zoning Ordinance also outlines the application procedures, approval body,
findings, and appeal process. Typical findings to be met for approval of a CUP are as follows:
          The proposed location of the conditional use is in accord with the objectives of Chapter
           1-1 of the Zoning Ordinance and the purpose of the zoning district in which the site is
           located.
          The proposed conditional use will not be detrimental to the public health, safety or
           welfare, or be materially injurious to properties or improvements in the vicinity.
          The proposed conditional use is compatible with existing uses and future uses to the
           extent those uses are known, and will comply with each of the applicable provisions of
           the Zoning Ordinance, except for approved variances and/or administrative relief per
           Chapters 2-2 and 2-37.
          If the proposed conditional use permit affects land located within the coastal zone, the
           proposed conditional use permit will comply with the provisions of the land use plan of
           the certified local coastal program.
          Based upon information available at the time of approval, adequate utilities, access
           roads, drainage, and other necessary facilities exist or will be provided to serve the
           proposed use.
Conditional use permit processes are not considered a constraint to the development of units
identified to meet the RHNA since these sites are covered under a previously approved
Environmental Impact Report (EIR), which contemplated residential uses at all densities, as well
as number of units to be built. An approved EIR allows developers to rely on the certainty of
gaining approval of a conditional use permit since the general plan amendment, zone change and
environmental processes have already been completed. The CUP process only ensures that a
proposed development meets development standards and is consistent with previous approvals.
As evidenced by the numerous existing affordable units in the IBC, the CUP process has not
historically been a governmental constraint on the development of housing. Conditions of
approval are standard and placed on all market rate and affordable housing projects throughout
the City. Granite Court, a 100 percent affordable project for very low income households in the
IBC, was built ahead of schedule, despite the fact that it was a podium style construction and all
standard conditions of approval and CUP processes were applied to the project. Examples of
typical conditions of approval that were placed on the CUP approving Granite Court include:
         Providing evidence that a Notice of Intent (NOI) was filed with the State Water
          Resources Control Board.
City of Irvine                                     C-84                                Housing Element
General Plan

         Submittal of a Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) for review and approval by the
          Chief Building Official.
         Submittal of a report for the suppression of fugitive dust and nuisance in accordance with
          the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s Rules 403 and 402.
         Submittal of a final acoustical report demonstrating that the project will be sound
          attenuated against present and projected noise levels.
         Submittal of an electrical engineer’s photometric survey that demonstrates lighting
          requirements set forth in the Irvine Uniform Security Code are met.
         Submittal of an occupancy disclosure form for review and approval by the Director of
          Community Development. The approved disclosure form, along with its attachments,
          shall be included as part of the rental/lease agreements.
         Submittal of a construction phasing plan demonstrating that emergency vehicle access is
          adequate.
         Submittal of a playground plan that includes detailed playground specifications for
          manufactured play equipment.
Although the timeline for processing a CUP and the associated fees can be a constraint to
housing development, the City has adopted policies and offers incentives to mitigate any undue
burdens on the developer. As previously mentioned, the City Council passed an Economic
Stimulus Ordinance to stimulate and encourage new residential development in the City by
allowing deferral of some development impact fees and optional in-lieu fees, such as park fees,
street surface construction impact fees, and affordable housing in-lieu fees. The fees may be
deferred until final inspection or issuance of a temporary or final Certificate of Occupancy. In
addition, the City offers a reduction in park dedication standards (as permitted by the
Subdivision Ordinance) in order to encourage the construction of affordable housing.
Specifically, the reduction in park dedication standards required for residential development
helps lower the cost of construction of the units planned for lower income households. To further
facilitate affordable housing development, the City provides, where feasible, financial subsidies
to offset the cost impacts of development and planning fees. Financial assistance can come in the
form of CDBG, HOME funding and in-lieu fee funds. In-lieu fees are collected from other
projects that did not build affordable units on site, which is a permitted option in the City’s
inclusionary housing ordinance. These fees are then allocated to other projects that are building
affordable units on-site. For example, Granite Court was allocated a total of $7.7 million from
the City’s in-lieu fee account.
Other concessions given to projects providing affordable units include priority/expedited
processing for all entitlement and ministerial permits required for development of the project, a
reduction in development standards such as setbacks requirements, landscaping requirements,
parking requirements, and building heights.
Timelines for Permit Procedures
Development review and permit processing are necessary steps to ensure that residential
construction proceeds in an orderly manner. It also ensures that development standards of the
City, as well as outside agencies that have a vested interest in the project, are met. However, the
time and cost of permit processing and review can be a constraint to housing development if they
place an undue burden on the developer.
City of Irvine                                      C-85                               Housing Element
General Plan

The processing time needed to obtain development permits and required approvals is commonly
cited by the development community as a prime contributor to the high cost of housing.
Depending on the magnitude and complexity of the development proposal, the time that elapses
from application submittal to project approval may vary considerably. Factors that can affect the
length of development review on a proposed project include: completeness of the development
application submittal, responsiveness of developers to staff comments and requests for
information, and for projects that are not exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA), rezoning or general plan amendment processing, or projects that are subject to a public
hearing before the Planning Commission or City Council.
Certainty and consistency in permit processing procedures and reasonable processing times is
important to ensure that the development review/approval process does not discourage
developers of housing or add excessive costs (including carrying costs on property) that would
make the project economically infeasible. The City is committed to maintaining comparatively
short processing times. Total processing times vary by project, but most residential projects are
approved in two to four months. Table C-50 provides a detailed summary of the typical
processing procedures and timelines of various types of projects in the City. Depending on the
level of environmental review required, the processing time for a project may be lengthened as
the City must completely implement state CEQA processes, which substantially add to
processing times. Given the relatively short time periods required for processing residential
development applications in Irvine, the City’s permit processing procedures are not a significant
constraint on residential development.

Processing times in the City vary according to many factors, including:
         Environmental Determination - Projects that require an EIR can take an additional six
          months to process.
         Projects that require screen check reviews and meetings also take additional time to
          process. Common issues requiring additional processing time include: parking, traffic,
          circulation, and design.
Generally, all residential projects require one or more of the following entitlements:
         Conditional Use Permit
         Tentative Tract Map
         Master Plan
         General Plan Amendment
         Zone Change
Projects that require a Master Plan, Tentative Tract Map and/or Conditional Use Permit take
approximately 12-16 weeks to process and require final approval from the Planning
Commission. Projects that require City Council approval (such as General Plan Amendments and
Zone Changes) take approximately 18-20 weeks to process. These estimates, however, are highly
dependent upon the completeness of the submittal, responsiveness of the developer, and only
apply to projects that do not require preparation of an EIR. Projects requiring an EIR take
approximately one year to 18 months to process. Approval requirements are the same for all
residential projects, regardless of whether it is a single-family or multiple-family development.
Table C-52 lists the typical approval requirements and estimated total processing times for
various residential projects. However, coordination with other impacted parties, such as
community groups and homeowners’ associations may extend the overall timeframe for
development.

Environmental Review: Individual single-family homes are exempt from environmental
review. Other residential projects are subject to varying levels of environmental clearance
depending on potential impacts. However, the required public hearing can be held concurrently
with the entitlement hearing.
Land Use Review: City staff generally reviews projects permitted by right. Projects requiring a
Conditional Use Permit, Park Plan, General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, Variance, Master
Plan, Administrative Relief and/or Tract/Parcel Map require a public hearing by one or more of
the following hearing bodies: Planning Commission, Community Services Commission,
Subdivision Committee, City Council and Zoning Administrator.
Development Review Committee: The purpose of the City’s Development Review Committee
(DRC) is to provide a weekly and on-going forum for City departments to identify and discuss
issues related to development proposals, and work towards resolution of these issues in an
informal setting. The DRC is intended to expedite the project development process and is not
considered a constraint. In addition to providing written comments to the City project manager
the design review process allows City transportation, engineering, and planning staff the
opportunity to discuss design issues and provide other valuable input in an open forum. The
DRC is not intended to be used for all cases, only those in which the project manager feels that
the combined input of the DRC would be helpful in resolving project issues. Design guidelines
are outlined in the Zoning Ordinance and are specific to each of the City’s different planning
areas.
Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance
The City of Irvine has been at the forefront of providing affordable housing. The provision of
affordable housing was always an important goal for the City of Irvine, even before it became a
requirement in 2003 with the passage of the City’s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. The City
attained many of its affordable units before 2003 by working closely with the Irvine Company
and other private developers. Between 2003 and 2013, approximately 362 affordable units (such
as Granite Court Apartments and Tribeca Flats at Central Park West) have been built and/or
approved as a result of the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance.
City of Irvine                                       C-88                                 Housing Element
General Plan

Requirements
In March 2003, the Irvine City Council approved a zone change to revise Chapters 2-3 of the
Zoning Ordinance to require the provision of affordable housing in all residential development
and outline the means of attaining affordability. These provisions are applicable to all residential
developments of 50 or more units, regardless of zoning, within the City of Irvine. Under these
provisions, residential projects are required to provide a minimum of 15 percent of their total
units as affordable units and shall be allocated in accordance with the following percentages:
         Five percent of the actual number of dwelling units shall be affordable as rental or
          ownership units to households earning less than 50 percent of the County median income.
         Five percent of the actual number of dwelling units shall be affordable as either rental or
          ownership units, with the emphasis on ownership units, to households earning 51 percent
          to 80 percent of the County median income.
         Five percent of the total number of dwelling units shall be affordable as rental or
          ownership units, with emphasis on ownership units in projects offering ownership
          housing, to households earning 81 percent to 120 percent of the County median income.
Occasionally, developers will ask the City for permission to deviate from the above ratios and
provide a different mix of affordable units in their projects. These requests are usually for a unit
mix that provides a deeper level of affordability, in order to ensure compliance with tax credit or
density bonus requirements. The Planning Commission has the discretion to approve ratios other
than those described above. Residential developments of fewer than 50 units and projects within
hillside development are exempt from providing on site units per the Inclusionary Housing
Ordinance and may choose one of the menu options listed in Chapter 2-3 of the Zoning
Ordinance.
Affordable units must be located within the planning area or on the site of the proposed project,
unless the developer is qualified to utilize menu option alternatives. Developers are only eligible

         Dedication of land for affordable housing.
         An alternative option acceptable to the City.
Incentives
To assist in compliance with the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Implementation Plan, the City
offers the following incentives:
         Credits based on the unit level of affordability and number of bedrooms;
         Density bonus pursuant to state Density Bonus law;
         One or more density bonus incentives pursuant to state Density Bonus law, including
          regulatory concessions, and/or state parking standards;
         Marketing of for-sale inclusionary units through the Redevelopment Agency or Land
          Trust;
         Financial assistance if excess affordable units are provided; and
         Reduction in overall inclusionary requirements if an increased number of lower income
          units are provided.
The City of Irvine had an informal affordable (inclusionary) housing goal for many years prior to
formalizing this affordable housing goal as a policy implemented through the Zoning Ordinance
in 2003. The original affordable housing goal was included in the City’s 2000 General Plan. In
2003, the City formalized this affordable housing goal into an inclusionary housing policy,
during an upward housing market. Adoption of the inclusionary housing policy had not slowed
housing production in the City. While housing prices soared during those years, that trend was
primarily a result of an inflated market triggered by the abundance of creative and highly
leveraged mortgage financing schemes. In today’s market, the average subsidy required for an
affordable housing unit is approximately $180,000. This level of subsidy is typical and does not
impact the cost of overall housing development to the extent of making a project infeasible. As
described above, the City offers a range of options and incentives to ensure the inclusionary
housing policy does not unduly constrain housing development in the City.

Codes and Enforcement and On/Off-Site Improvement Standards
Codes and Enforcement
In 2001, the State of California consolidated its building codes into the California Building
Standards Code, which is contained in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. The City
most recently adopted the 2010 California Building Code, which is based on the 2009
International Building Code. The 2010 California Green Building Standards Code, Electrical
Code, Mechanical Code and Plumbing Code were also adopted. All applications made after
January 1, 2011 are subject to the most recently adopted code. Effective January 1, 2014 new
building codes will once again be adopted.
The City’s Code Enforcement Office has a staff of four persons. Most are inspectors, each
having expertise in different areas of code enforcement, but capable of investigating any type of
complaint. Staff enforces a variety of codes including:
         California Building Codes
         Zoning Ordinance
         Municipal Codes relating to Water Quality, Noise, Trash, and Public Nuisance.
         Sections of the Uniform Fire Code, Uniform Housing Code, and Building Code including
          ADA accessibility requirements
Typically the Code Enforcement Office responds to complaints concerning all types of structures
in the City. However, complaints related to housing in Irvine typically involve:
         Residential Property Management – Public Nuisance Items
         Drainage
         Illegal Home Occupation
         Construction Without Permits
         Trash/Trash Cans
         Inoperative Vehicles/Illegal Parking
         Noise
         Water Quality violations involving paint spills, oil spills, raw sewage, washing debris
          into gutter, draining pool into gutter, storm drain
Code Enforcement staff responds to approximately 60 new residential complaints and
participates in about 130 active investigations and actions each month. Enforcement procedure
places emphasis on voluntary compliance. On the average, the City’s Code Enforcement Office
administers:
         600 Residential Courtesy Notices per year
         300 Pre-Citation Notices per year
         10 Administrative Citations per year

General Plan

On-/Off-Site Improvement Standards
The City of Irvine’s Standards and Design Manuals are a series of documents that include:
Design Standards, Engineering Standard Plans, the Landscape Manual, Landscape Standard
Plans, the Park Standard Manual, and Traffic Plan Sheets (Plans). These Plans are intended to
ensure uniform design and provide guidance to those preparing improvement plans for the City.
Irvine’s Standard Plans establishes varying standards for residential streets, depending on the
design and scope of the project. The Standard Plan identifies three types of residential streets –
local streets, private ways, and private courts:
         Local Street: These are the streets most common in a residential development. Minimum
          width required is 36 feet.
         Private Way: A low-speed roadway for general circulation in residential neighborhoods
          to access residential units, garages, and parking areas. Average daily traffic on a private
          way cannot exceed 850 trips. Minimum width required is 28 feet.
         Private Court: A low-speed, low-volume, dead-end traveled way in residential
          neighborhoods to access residential garages and parking areas. Average daily traffic on a
          private court cannot exceed 120 trips. Minimum width required is 26 feet.
The City has established landscape requirements that apply to all developments except single-
family detached residential developments. These regulations establish a minimum percentage of
a site which must be landscaped. All landscaped areas are required to be maintained in a healthy
and growing condition and must be free of weeds and debris. For attached residential units, the
City requires a minimum of one 15-gallon tree for every 30 feet of interior boundary on all
building sites. The trees must be located in a minimum five-foot-wide planting area. The Irvine
Zoning Ordinance also requires a building setback of 10 to 25 feet from any local street.
Solid waste collection standards apply to all attached residential developments, except for
residences within Planning Area 4, an area which was annexed to the City in 1994 after
entitlements had previously been granted by the County. A minimum of one outdoor solid waste
collection bin per 12 dwelling units is required by the City, 50 percent of which must be for
recyclable materials. Each solid waste bin must have at least one recycling bin located adjacent
or in close proximity to it.
As a condition of tentative map approval, the City sometimes requires a developer to dedicate
land, make improvements, and/or pay fees for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating
existing park and recreational facilities. Improvements include: site grading, automatic irrigation
systems, adequate drainage, lawn, shrubs, trees, concrete walkways, and walkway lighting. A
developer of residential subdivisions is required to dedicate park land or pay fees in lieu at the
rate of five acres per population of 1,000. In order to encourage the construction of low and
moderate income housing, the City has modified the park dedication policy for developers of
affordable housing:
         Affordable housing developers may reduce the dedication standard to a minimum of 3.5
          acres per population of 1,000.
         In order to qualify for this reduction developers must show: that the reduction in park
          dedication will help lower the cost of construction of the affordable units, that the new
          rental units will be guaranteed for low income households for a minimum of 10 years,

          and that projects for family units will be located within ½ mile of a publicly maintained
          park and/or school playground.
Other on-site improvements can be waived for affordable housing as a processing incentive and
has been done in the past. Possible incentives include:
         Priority/expedited processing for all entitlement and ministerial permits required for
          development of the project.
         Adjustments in development standards such as setbacks requirements, landscaping
          requirements, parking requirements, and building heights.
Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities
State law requires that each local jurisdiction assess its local governmental constraints relating to
the construction and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.
Zoning and Land Use Policies and Practices
The City has a total of 33 residential care facilities including:
         Six adult residential facilities ranging in capacity from three persons to six persons.
         Twenty-seven residential care facilities for the elderly ranging in capacity from two
          persons to 399 persons.
Currently, housing facilities for persons with disabilities are regulated in the Zoning Ordinance
under Residential Care Facilities and Home Care Facilities. There is no local requirement for
proximity between two special needs housing sites. The requirements of Health and Safety Code
§1520.5 are enforced by the State Department of Social Services, Health and Human Services
Agency. The law requires that residential facilities be separated by a minimum of 300 feet to
avoid over-concentration.
Definition of Family
Some local governments may illegally attempt to restrict access to housing for households failing
to qualify as a “family” by the definition specified in that local government’s municipal code.
Specifically, a restrictive definition of “family” that limits the number of and differentiates
between related and unrelated individuals living together may illegally limit the development and
siting of group homes for persons with disabilities, but not for housing families that are similarly
sized or situated.9 The City of Irvine Zoning Ordinance does not define a “family.”
Building Codes
Building procedures within the City are also required to conform to the California Building
Code, as adopted in the City's Municipal Code. Standards within the Building Code include
9
     California court cases (such as City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson (1980) 27 Cal.3d 123, and City of Chula Vista
     v. Pagard (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 785 have ruled an ordinance as invalid if it defines a “family” as (a) an
     individual; (b) two or more persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a
     specific number of unrelated persons as a single housekeeping unit. These cases have explained that defining a
     family in a manner that distinguishes between blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve
     any legitimate or useful objective or purpose recognized under the zoning and land use planning powers of a
     municipality, and therefore violates rights of privacy under the California Constitution.

provisions to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities. These standards are consistent
with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title 24. No local amendments that would
constrain accessibility or increase the cost of housing for persons with disabilities have been
adopted.
The City encourages the participation of homebuilders in the Universal Design Program, which
is a voluntary program. The program encourages participating homebuilders to offer universal
design features that simplify life by making homes and associated living environments more
usable by more people including children, aging populations, and persons with disabilities. Some
of the features that are offered include grab bars in the bathroom, roll-in showers, wider interior
doors, lever door hardware, visual alarms and visual doorbells, and lower countertop heights.
The City provides basic information about the program on its website and provides links with
more detailed information.
Reasonable Accommodation Procedures
Reasonable accommodation refers to flexibility in standards and policies to accommodate the
needs of persons with disabilities. The City’s zoning and building codes, as well as its approach
to code enforcement, allow for special provisions that meet the needs of persons with disabilities
without the need for variances. Specifically, for example, parking requirements are reduced for
senior housing, assisted living facilities, and congregate care facilities.
Accessory uses such as wheelchair ramps are permitted within all residential districts as
incidental structures related to the residence. Most reasonable accommodation requests to
increase accessibility of existing properties are handled through the building permit process.
The City has established procedures in the Building Code to provide the City’s Building Official
with the administrative authority to grant an exception to regulations related to accessibility or
adaptability when such regulations create a hardship and equivalent provisions are provided. As
part of the building permit application, an applicant can request reasonable accommodation. The
Building Official will act upon the request with no formal hearing process before any board
being required. The City provides materials at public counters to inform residents of this service.
Review of Programs
The City has several programs and services in place to meet the needs of its disabled population.
The City of Irvine’s Office of Disability Services provides information and support services to
people with disabilities who live or work in the City. Disability Services offers:
         Social/recreational activities
         Resources and referral services
         Disability awareness events
         Informational seminars
         Inclusion and accommodation services for City sponsored classes, programs and
          activities.
         Access reporting, which forwards citizen complaints regarding community accessibility
          to the appropriate City department for swift investigation and resolution.

General Plan

In addition to the Office of Disability Services, the Irvine Residents with Disabilities Advisory
Board (IRDAB) was established by the City Council in 1990 to ensure that residents with
disabilities have equal access to community life in Irvine. IRDAB consists of a 16-member
board, with half of the members being residents with disabilities and the remainder comprised of
residents who have a family member with a disability and persons who work in the field of
disability services. Meetings are open to the public and are held on a monthly basis at the Irvine
City Hall.
The mission of IRDAB is to:
         Identify and recommend programs and services that would meet the social, physical and
          emotional needs of residents who have disabilities.
         To provide advocacy and support programs.
         To assess community needs and provide appropriate recommendations to City
          Departments.
         To work collaboratively with organizations within Irvine and surrounding areas, which
          have an impact on residents with disabilities.
The City currently has two all-affordable apartment complexes for the disabled: Mariposa Villas
and AbilityFirst Apartments. Additionally, seven out of 165 affordable units in the Woodbridge
Manor apartment complex are designated specifically for disabled seniors. The units are on the
ground floor and feature wheelchair-accessible bathrooms and lower countertops in the kitchen.
The City partnered with multiple agencies to facilitate the development of Mariposa Villas,
which is a handicapped accessible 40-unit apartment complex affordable to very low income
households. Mariposa Villas is currently home to over 60 persons with disabilities.
The City collaborated with AbilityFirst, a nonprofit organization serving children and adults with
physical and developmental disabilities, in the development of a 24-unit apartment complex. The
complex features 14 one-bedroom and nine two-bedroom rental units built specifically for low
income individuals with disabilities and one two-bedroom unit for a manager. Funded partly
through $900,000 in City-awarded CDBG and HOME funds, the units incorporate many
accessibility features affording residents with disabilities the opportunity to live comfortably in
their own homes. Total public funding for the project is estimated at $5.2 million with combined
contributions from the City of Irvine, the County of Orange, the State of California and the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Market Constraints
Market constraints include local housing cost components, such as the availability and cost of
land, as well as cost of construction. These constraints are often out of the City’s control, but can
result in housing that is not affordable to lower income households, or may render residential
construction economically infeasible for developers.

General Plan

Land Costs
While the City of Irvine has vacant land, much of it is already subject to development
agreements or is located in the Hillsides land use category, which permits very limited residential
development due to terrain and physical hazards, or is dedicated as permanent open space.
Under-utilized land offers additional land for housing development, but given that most
properties were developed in the last 20 years, demolition of existing improvements that are in
excellent condition is not a financially feasible option.
In 2012 the estimated land value for a site in the City of Irvine with access, available utilities,
and zoned for medium density residential (12 du/acre), was $3,600,000 per acre, or $82.64 per
square foot.
Construction Costs
Construction factors such as type of construction, custom versus tract development, materials,
site conditions, finishing details, amenities, square footage, and structural configuration can
increase the cost of housing. The International Conference of Building Officials provides
estimates for the average cost of labor and materials for typical Type V wood-frame housing.
Estimates are based on “good-quality” construction, providing for materials and fixtures well
above the minimum required by state and local building codes.
Availability of Financing
The availability of financing may impact the ability of a household to purchase or improve
housing. Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to
disclose information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and
race/ethnicity of the applicants. Table C-53 summarizes the disposition of loan applications in
Irvine by loan type during 2011. HMDA data shows that approximately 73 percent of
government-backed home purchase loan applications were approved, while 72 percent of
conventional loans were approved. The loan approval rate for refinancing applications was
similar to home purchases, at 71 percent.

The ability to maintain housing can often depend on the ability of households to obtain home
improvement loans for repairs and upgrades. The table shows that the 77 percent approval rate
for home improvement loan applications during 2011 was slightly higher than for home purchase
and refinancing applications. To assist lower income households in making improvements to
their homes, the City offers assistance through its Residential Rehabilitation Program (RRP),
which provides financial assistance to low- and moderate-income Irvine homeowners for critical
home improvement projects. Financial assistance through the RRP consists of deferred loans and
emergency grants. This program assists homeowners in need of health and safety, building code,

and accessibility-related repairs. Only owner-occupied single-family dwellings or manufactured
homes located in the City are eligible for funding.
Foreclosures
Between 2000 and 2005, with low interest rates, “creative” financing (e.g., zero down payment,
interest only and adjustable loans), and predatory lending practices (e.g. aggressive marketing,
hidden fees, negative amortization), many households purchased homes that were beyond their
financial means. Under the false assumptions that refinancing to lower interest rates would
always be an option and home prices would continue to rise at double-digit rates, many
households were unprepared for the hikes in interest rates, expiration of short-term fixed rates,
and decline in sales prices that set off in 2006. A significant number of foreclosures occurred as a
result of significantly increased mortgage payments, and mortgage loans that exceed the value of
the homes. In Orange County, 5,555 Notices of Default were filed in the fourth quarter of 2009,
compared to 4,481 filed during the same period in the previous year, representing a 24 percent
increase in one year.10
During the past few years, the foreclosure rate has dropped substantially. For example, from
February 2012 to February 2013 notices of default dropped by 59 percent and notices of sale
decreased by 57 percent in Irvine11. This reduction is likely related to increasing property values,
as the number of “underwater” homes declines. During 2012, the number of homes in Orange
County for which the mortgage amount exceeded home value dropped by nearly 28,00012.

General Plan

Goals, Policies and Programs
The City of Irvine’s long term housing goal is to provide housing that fulfills the diverse needs
of the community. In the short term, this will be accomplished with the objectives, policies, and
programs set forth in this Housing Plan. The goals, policies, and programs in the Plan build upon
the identified housing needs in the community, constraints confronting the City, resources
available to address the housing needs, and a review of accomplishments under the 2008-2014
Housing Element. (The review of accomplishments is contained in Appendix C). The goals,
policies, and programs contained in this section will guide City housing policy through the 2013-
2021 planning period.
Goals are statements of community desires that are broad in both purpose and aim, but are
designed specifically to establish direction. Policies provide specific standards for achieving a
goal. Essentially, goals represent desired outcomes the City seeks to achieve through the
implementation of policies. Further articulation of how the City will achieve the stated goals is
found in the programs that identify specific actions the City will undertake toward putting each
goal and policy into action. Quantified objectives identified in particular programs are estimates
of assistance the City will be able to offer, subject to available resources.
To make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the community,
the programs in the Housing Plan aim to:
         Provide adequate sites for the development of affordable housing
         Assist in the development of affordable housing
         Conserve and improve the existing affordable housing stock
         Preserve units at-risk of conversion to market rate uses
         Address and remove or mitigate constraints
         Provide equal housing opportunities
The City has also adopted the ambitious goal of creating 9,700 units of affordable housing by the
year 2025, representing approximately 10 percent of the City’s total projected housing units. In
order to achieve this goal, the City completed a Housing Strategy and Implementation Plan to
clarify and expand its housing goals, propose an affordable housing strategy for the City, and
offer an implementation plan to put the strategy into action. The Housing Strategy presents the
following goals and priorities:
         Maintain the high quality of both new and existing housing
         Disperse the affordable units throughout the community
         Incorporate green design/sustainable development and accessible development features to
          improve affordability and contribute to resource conservation and accessibility
         Facilitate development of additional rental housing
         Create equity-building opportunities for first-time homebuyers

Goals and Policies
Provide Adequate Sites
A major element in meeting the housing needs of all segments of the community is the provision
of adequate sites, sizes and prices of all types of housing. Persons of different ages, incomes and
lifestyles have a variety of housing needs that evolve over time and in response to changing life
circumstances. Providing an adequate and diverse supply of housing accommodates the changing
housing needs of residents. The Irvine General Plan and Zoning Ordinance establish where
housing may be located to provide adequate housing and maximize use of limited land resources.
New development should be constructed at appropriate densities that maximize the intended use
of the land.
GOAL 1.0        Provide suitable sites for housing development that can accommodate a
                range of housing by type, size, location, price and tenure.

Assist in the Development of Affordable Housing
Affordable housing is essential for a healthy community. In addition to a diverse mix of housing
types, it is necessary to make housing available for residents of all income levels by seeking
funding from various sources to increase the opportunities for development of affordable housing
units. The City actively works with both nonprofit and for-profit developers in the production of
affordable for-sale and rental housing. Recognizing that a safe, decent and affordable place to
live plays a significant role in establishing strong neighborhoods and a sense of community
pride, the City supports programs that make purchasing and renting a home a realistic option for
all households.
GOAL 2.0        Assist in the provision of housing that meets the needs of all economic
                segments of the community.
Policy 2.1      Provide density and regulatory incentives to facilitate permanent affordable
                housing development.
Policy 2.2      Assist developers to access financing to produce a mix of housing.
Policy 2.3      Coordinate with housing developers to access funding sources for permanent
                affordable housing. Assist in creating partnerships between nonprofits and market
                rate developers.

General Plan

Policy 2.4      Assist developers, through new construction, to increase supply of permanent
                affordable rental units with supportive services that target seniors and persons
                with disabilities and extremely low income households.
Policy 2.5      Assist developers to increase supportive services that allow seniors and persons
                with disabilities to live independently.
Policy 2.6      Maintain quality design, siting, construction and maintenance while minimizing
                affordable housing cost.
Policy 2.7      Promote Universal Design Principle and Green Building techniques to reduce
                housing costs in the long-run and to create housing that meet the special needs of
                residents.
Conserve and Improve the Existing Housing Stock
Conserving and improving the housing stock helps maintain investment in the community and
keeps existing housing affordable. Despite the majority of the City’s housing stock being
relatively new, some rehabilitation needs are anticipated. A number of factors can cause
residential units to become unsafe or unhealthy to live in. Preventing these problems from
occurring and addressing them when they do occur protects the safety and welfare of the
residents and assists in meeting housing needs throughout Irvine. The City will focus its efforts
on rehabilitation, code enforcement, and preserving existing affordable units to take a proactive
approach toward conservation of the current housing stock.
GOAL 3.0        Maintain and enhance the existing viable housing stock and neighborhoods
                within Irvine.
Policy 3.1      Identify substandard properties through the Residential Rehabilitation Program.
Policy 3.2      Encourage lower income property owners to utilize housing rehabilitation loans
                and grants to bring properties up to code, make accessibility improvements and
                mitigate lead-based paint threats.
Preserve Units At-Risk of Conversion to Market Rate Uses
Seven projects in the City are considered to be at-risk of converting to market-rate housing due
to expiration of low income use restrictions or rent subsidies. These projects consist of a total of
528 affordable rental units that are assisted with project-based Section 8 assistance and bonds.
GOAL 4.0        Maintain the affordability of all at-risk units in the City.
Policy 4.1      Monitor all units considered at risk of conversion to market rate.
Policy 4.2      Provide incentives to maintain affordability, if feasible, to owners of rent-
                restricted properties at risk of converting to market-rate.
Address and Remove or Mitigate Governmental Constraints
Pursuant to state law, the City is obligated to address and, where legally possible, remove
government constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
Removing constraints on housing development can help to address housing needs in the City by
expediting construction and lowering development costs.

General Plan

GOAL 5.0        Mitigate to the extent legally feasible any potential governmental constraints
                to housing production and affordability.
Policy 5.1      Monitor legislative changes to ensure that City policies and regulations comply
                with state and federal laws.
Policy 5.2      Monitor and adjust City fees, development standards, incentives and development
                review processes to ensure such requirements do not unduly constrain housing
                development.
Provide Equal Housing Opportunities
To meet the housing needs of all segments of the community, the Housing Plan includes a
program to promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex, family
size, marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, age, or physical disability. The City currently
contracts with nonprofit organizations to provide fair housing and tenant/landlord services to
Irvine residents.
GOAL 6.0        Continue to promote equal housing opportunity in the City’s housing market
                regardless of race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry, national
                origin, color, age, or physical disability.
Policy 6.1      Partner with fair housing organizations to provide a variety of fair housing and
                tenant/landlord services.
Policy 6.2      Work with the property managers and residents of rental housing throughout the
                City to ensure compliance with fair housing laws.
Housing Programs
Program 1: Residential Sites Inventory
The City will provide adequate residential and mixed-use designated sites to accommodate the
City’s RHNA of 12,149 units (2,817 very low, 2,034 low, 2,239 moderate and 5,059 above
moderate income units).
Timeframe and Objectives:
 Maintain, in the City’s Geographic Information Systems (GIS) database, a residential sites
    inventory of the City’s RHNA and update this inventory annually.
 To ensure sufficient residential capacity is maintained in the sites inventory to accommodate
    the identified need, the City will develop and implement a formal ongoing project-by-project
    evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code Section 56863 within six months of
    adoption of the Housing Element by the City Council. Should an approval of commercial
    development result in a reduction of capacity within mixed use zones below the residential
    capacity needed to accommodate the remaining need for lower-income households, the City
    will identify sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall.
 Upon request by interested developers (subject to minimum reproduction costs), the City will
    make the map of vacant and underutilized sites available.
 Continue to pursue alternative options for meeting the RHNA (through preservation,
    legislative changes and regional cooperation). Annually, beginning in May of each year,
    evaluate the City’s funding availability and opportunities to pursue acquisition/rehabilitation
    of affordable housing projects and preservation of at-risk housing.

acquisition opportunities for a range of affordable housing options, including rental apartments,
ownership housing, emergency shelters, transitional housing, supportive housing, and SRO
housing, during the time period of this Housing Element update.
Timeframe and Objectives:
 Assist in the development of 100 permanent affordable units (100 rental housing units),
    including units for extremely low income households, by 2014. Specifically the City will
    assist the ICLT in the development of these units through the following actions:
               o Annually allocate funding in May to the ICLT for the development of affordable
                 housing development when CDBG, HOME or other funding is available.
 Partner on an on-going basis with for-profit and nonprofit housing developers and other
    entities to pursue permanent affordable housing opportunities in concert with the ICLT.

Program 3: Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance
The City will continue to implement the Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance to require 15 percent of
all new residential development be set aside as housing for very low, low and moderate income
households. As appropriate, payment of in-lieu fees, alternative methods of meeting affordable
housing requirements, or modification of affordability levels will be permitted, subject to
approval by the Planning Commission.
Timeframe and Objectives:
 Continue to implement the Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance.
 Monitor the impact of the Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance on housing supply and price

Program 4: Mixed-Use and Transit-Oriented Development
The City promotes mixed-use and transit-oriented development as a means of coordinating
residential and employment development, reducing traffic congestion, and enhancing the jobs to
housing balance in the community. Three areas allow for mixed-use development – the IBC, the
Irvine Spectrum Center and the private Great Park Neighborhoods development surrounding the
Orange County Great Park. Increased densities and height limits are offered in these areas.
Timeframe and Objectives:
 Continue to implement on a project-by-project submittal basis the Irvine Business Complex
    Vision Plan and Mixed Use Overlay Zoning Ordinance that was approved by the Planning
    Commission on April 1, 2010, and the City Council on July 13, 2010.
 Continue to monitor development trends bi-annually in the Great Park and IBC to ensure that
    appropriate development standards and adequate incentives are provided to encourage
    mixed-use and transit-oriented developments. As appropriate, modify incentives and
    development standards to enhance feasibility of mixed use developments in these areas.
 Monitor, in conjunction with the annual progress report to HCD, development in the Great
    Park Neighborhoods and IBC areas to ensure adequate sites continue to be available for
    meeting the City’s RHNA. When non-residential development occurs in the Great Park
    Neighborhoods and IBC, update the sites inventory and RHNA progress to make sure
    remaining sites in the City are able to accommodate the City’s remaining RHNA. Through
    the annual report to HCD on the progress of implementing the City’s Housing Element,
    provide an update on the City’s sites inventory and RHNA status.

Program 5: Financial Participation
The City will provide deferred payment loans and/or grants if available, to local housing
developers to subsidize the cost of developing affordable housing units. There are sources
available that must be used exclusively for the production of affordable housing. A priority for
the funds will be housing that is permanently affordable. The City will also assist developers in
accessing financing from state and federal housing programs to produce a mix of housing.
Timeframe and Objectives:
 Assist in the development of 100 new permanent affordable rental units by 2015.
 Partner with for-profit and nonprofit housing developers to pursue permanent affordable
    housing opportunities on an on-going basis.

Timeframe and Objectives:
The City of Irvine will work with property owners, interest groups and the state and federal
governments on an ongoing basis to implement the following measures to conserve its affordable
housing stock:
              Monitor At-Risk Units: Annually monitor the status of at-risk units in conjunction
               with the annual progress report to HCD.
              Work with Potential Purchasers or Property Owners: Where feasible, provide
               technical assistance to public and nonprofit agencies (including the ICLT) interested
               in purchasing and/or managing units at risk. Work with existing property owners to
               explore options of preserving the at-risk units. Annually meet with the Irvine
               Apartments Company (IAC) in conjunction with the annual progress report to HCD
               to identify projects with expiring Section 8 contracts and discuss
               incentives/conditions for extending the affordability covenants.
              Tenant Education: California Legislature extended the noticing requirement of at-
               risk units opting out of low-income use restrictions to one year. Should a property
               owner pursue conversion of the units to market rate, the City will ensure that tenants
               are properly noticed and informed of resources available to them for assistance.

Program 9: Housing Choice Voucher
The federal Housing Choice Voucher Program extends rental subsidies to extremely low and
very low income households, including families, seniors and the disabled. The program offers a
voucher that pays the difference between the current fair market rent as established by HUD and
what a tenant can afford to pay (i.e. 30 to 40 percent of household income). The voucher allows a
tenant to choose housing that costs above the payment standard, providing the tenant pays the
extra cost. In Irvine, the program is administered by the Orange County Housing Authority.
Given the continued need for rental assistance, the City supports and encourages the provision of
additional subsidies through the Housing Choice Voucher Program. The City will continue to
provide referrals to households and homeowners interested in participating in this program.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     Continue to refer income-qualified households to the Orange County Housing Authority
          on an on-going basis.
     Assist in publicizing the program on the City website and at public counters.

Program 10: Housing for the Homeless/Special Needs Populations/Extremely Low Income
Households
Extremely low income households and households with special needs typically have limited
housing options. Special needs populations include persons with disabilities (developmental,
physical or mental), senior households, large households, single-parent households, the homeless
and farm workers. Housing types appropriate for these groups include: emergency shelters,
transitional housing, supportive housing, residential care facilities, convalescent homes,
congregate care facilities and SRO units. The City Zoning Ordinance allows housing types that
serve special needs populations as residential uses subject only to those restrictions that apply to
other residential uses of the same type in the same zoning district.
Timeframe and Objectives:
     Encourage on an ongoing basis the development of housing for extremely low income
          households and persons with special needs through:
               o Financial assistance when available through funding sources such as the federal
                 Section 811 program;
               o Reduced park fees;
               o Flexible development standards; and
               o Expedited processing.
     Partner when feasible with for-profit and nonprofit housing developers and other entities
          to pursue affordable housing opportunities for special needs households on an on-going
          basis.
     Establish a developmental disability task force to consider the concerns, policies and
          programs proposed by the community and address housing needs of this special needs
          population. The task force will:
               o Be comprised of nine members from various stakeholder organizations such as
                 the Regional Center of Orange County;
               o Provide recommendations to the City Council on housing policies based on the
                 needs of the developmentally disabled;
               o Begin meeting on a monthly basis in September 2013;
               o Dissolve in minimum six months’ time or upon completion and submission of a
                 report to the City Council.

 Note 1: AB2634 from the 2005-2006 Legislative Session mandates that localities calculate the subset of the very low income
 regional need that constitutes the communities need for extremely low income housing. As an alternative to calculating the
 subset, local jurisdictions may assume that 50 percent of the very low income category is represented by households of
 extremely low income (less than 30 percent of the MFI).
