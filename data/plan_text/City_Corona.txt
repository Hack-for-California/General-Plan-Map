                                                     updated General Plan.
However, a plan’s success is dependent upon its
ownership by a community’s residents,
businesspersons, and property owners. They
must concur with its issues, visions, and policies
and actions that are defined to address these.
Without community support, decision-makers
are often inclined to disregard a plan’s policies
as not being reflective of their needs, values,
and aspirations.
To this end, a vigorous program was conducted
to engage Corona’s residents and business-
persons in the General Plan update process.
Components of the program involved:
! Interviews with residents, developers,
    business representatives, community service
    providers, City department representatives,
    the Planning Commission, and City Council
    to identify their perception of key planning
    issues and challenges and their strategies to
    address these.
! Distribution of a survey to over 20,000
    households and businesses, again asking
    questions regarding key community issues
    and visions for the future. In excess of 1,650
    responses were received.
! Publication and distribution of a brochure
    (“Corona Snapshot”) that presents salient
    information about existing community
    conditions and trends and forecasts for the
    future.
! Conduct of five community workshops
    where participants were requested to
    confirm the issues defined through the
    earlier processes and identify their plans for
    how Corona should evolve in the future.
    The latter was facilitated through a mapping
    exercise, where participants applied color
    markers and “game pieces” simulating land

IMPLEMENTING AND AMENDING THE PLAN
A       fter the General Plan is adopted, it will
        be implemented through a variety of
        ordinances, programs, and activities.
These specific actions are described in Chapter
7 and referenced by applicable policies for each
Element. It will be especially important to
review local land use regulations and procedures
to ensure that they are consistent with the
General Plan. The zoning map should be
consistent with the General; Plan Land Use
Plan and the Zoning Code should be consistent
with the land use classification system and
density/intensity and design and development
policies stipulated by policy.
The General Plan is intended to be a dynamic
document and must be periodically updated to
respond to changing community needs. An
annual review of the Plan is required to ensure
that it remains relevant. Moreover, the Plan
may be amended up to four times a year.
Requests for amendments may be submitted by
individuals or initiated by the City itself. Most
amendments propose a change in the land use
designation for a particular property. Policy and
text amendments also may occur. Any proposed
amendment will be reviewed to ensure that the
change is in the public interest and would not
be detrimental to public health, safety, and
welfare. Environmental review is required for all
General Plan amendments.

C        orona, the Gateway to the Inland Empire, is a vibrant and diverse community, with small
         town charm. We cherish our rich cultural heritage and surrounding natural resources. Our
         citizenry is active and engaged, dedicated to protecting our quality of life. Looking to the
future, Corona must meet the challenges of economic competition, adequate housing, sustained
environmental resources, and efficient mobility.
The General Plan recognizes the complexities involved in balancing historical patterns of development
in a region experiencing unparalleled rates of growth and legal mandates to accommodate a fair share
of that growth. It recognizes that there are fundamental underlying values about the nature of Corona
as a place for living, working, and playing and that must be maintained and are nonnegotiable. It
recognizes that change is inevitable and that it must be managed to sustain livability, economic
vitality, social well-being, and environmental quality.

Community Development
Land Use
This chapter of the General Plan provides guidance for the ultimate pattern of development in the
City of Corona and its Sphere of Influence. It defines how lands are to be used, the density, intensity,
and physical form and character of development, and a strategy that articulates where growth will
occur and what lands and uses will be conserved.
C
            orona is a city containing uses that promote and sustain a high quality of life for its residents. It
            offers places to live, work, shop, recreate, be educated, be entertained, celebrate culture and
            history, socialize with other residents, have personal privacy, pursue religious freedoms, and
contemplate nature. It offers choices for a population that is diverse in its ethnicity, culture, age, education,
and income. As the City continues to mature, these choices enable residents to have access to fully meet their
needs without traveling to other communities in the region.
Corona balances its uses, assuring that there are retail, business, and other uses to contribute sufficient
revenue to enable the City to provide essential services and amenities to its residents that enhances their
quality of life
The City consists of a diversity of residential neighborhoods, commercial and industrial districts, and civic
places that are differentiated in their functional role and physical form and character. While these primarily
serve the needs of Corona’s residents, at the same time they provide opportunities for business and
employment for residents of the greater region. Their form varies from those that recognize the primacy of the
automobile in our culture during recent decades to revitalized historic districts and new places that induce
walkability and social interaction through their concentration of multiple destination uses and attractive
design of streets, plazas, and other public amenities.
Corona’s built places consider its natural setting at the base of mountains and canyons that is traversed by
creeks and drainages. Throughout Corona, parklands, greenways, and open spaces are integrated with
development to protect important resources, provide public safety, and as relief from patterns of urban and
suburban development.
Corona’s future land use development will recognize these assets that distinguish the city as a special place in
the region, contribute to a quality life for its residents, and sustain its natural environmental resources.
LAND USES TO BE ACCOMMODATED IN THE CITY OF
CORONA
CONTEXT
The City of Corona contains a broad diversity of uses including housing, supporting schools, parks,
libraries, religious facilities, and civic uses, retail uses that provide shopping opportunities for residents
and visitors, industries and professional offices that provide employment opportunities, and open
spaces. In 2002, approximately 30 percent of the City was developed with housing, four percent for
commercial and office uses, 12 percent for industrial uses, 37 percent for public, parks, and open
spaces, and 17 percent was undeveloped or not committed as permanent open space. Less than one
percent of the lands continue to be used for agricultural purposes.
City of Corona General Plan                                                                                       19

   Land Use
  While there is a broad mix of uses, many residents have indicated that there are a number of unmet
  needs including a greater diversity of retail uses, particularly clothing, restaurants, entertainment, and
  industries and professional offices that provide job opportunities matched to their education and
  skills. The latter are particularly critical, as their presence would lessen the need for Corona’s residents
  to travel to Orange County and other communities for their jobs.
  This mix and balance has evolved substantially during the last decade. In earlier years, Corona was
  primarily a “bedroom” community, providing housing that was more affordable than Orange County,
  with few industrial and commercial uses, thus necessitating residents to travel to adjoining
  communities for these purposes. As the balance has improved, housing costs have escalated, which has
  shifted the most affordable housing further outward along the I-15 corridor to the south and other
  rural areas of Riverside County.
  At the same time, the balance of commercial, industrial, and residential uses has been integral in
  sustaining revenue for the City to enable it to provide essential services to its residents.

DISTRIBUTION AND PHYSICAL FORM OF LAND USES
CONTEXT
The City of Corona is built around a historic core defined by a one-mile diameter circular street,
Grand Boulevard. The area is bisected by primary arterials, Main Street and Sixth Street, and overlaid
by a north/south–east/west grid street system. The core and arterials form the spine along which land
uses have developed over the years. Commercial uses are concentrated in the core and along these
arterial corridors, with a mix of low and higher density housing. Industrial uses are developed north of
the core and perpendicular to the Main Street spine paralleling SR-91 and Temescal Creek, with
mining activities located in the southeast foothills. Extending outward from these uses is a diversity of
residential neighborhoods that contain a mix of housing types, schools, parks, and local-serving
commercial uses. Highway and community oriented commercial centers are developed at major
interchanges of the SR-91 and I-15 freeway corridors including Sixth Street, Lincoln Avenue,
McKinley Street, Magnolia Avenue, and Ontario Avenue. A new commercial node is planned for the
I-15/Cajalco Road interchange.

GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
CONTEXT
The City of Corona’s recent history has been as one of the fastest growing cities in the United States
during the 1980s and 1990s. Now, the City is at a major crossroads as most of its lands most suitable
for development have been exhausted. As of 2002, only 16 percent of the City’s lands, or 3,977 acres,
remained vacant and may be considered for development. Another 601 acres were being used for
agricultural purposes. The pace of future growth is likely to slow and occur on the limited vacant
lands on the periphery of the City’s existing urban development and the smaller remaining parcels
within this pattern. Without annexation of surrounding properties in the City’s Sphere of Influence
(SOI), any additional growth would occur as re-use of existing underutilized parcels and obsolete
developments. The trend in this direction has been initiated through the City’s efforts to foster
revitalization of its Downtown and North Main Street. In addition, increasing use of Metrolink for
regional transportation may spur opportunities for higher densities of development in proximity to its
stations.

COMMUNITY QUALITY AND SENSE OF PLACE
CONTEXT
The character and quality of Corona’s residential neighborhoods, commercial centers, and business
and industrial districts are largely reflective of the era of their construction. Downtown Corona’s
development pattern and character are uniquely defined by the Grand Boulevard circle that is overlaid
by a regular street grid, within which commercial, office, and civic structures are principally located
directly along the street frontages and housing is set back from the street with landscaped front yards
and parkways.
Much of the architecture is representative of design styles visible in early developments throughout
southern California, with simple storefront styles for commercial structures and a range of residential
idioms including Craftsman, Spanish Colonial, Gothic Revival, Victorian, Spanish/Mission Revival,
and Queen Anne. Fragments of these historic styles and buildings remain in the Downtown area and,
coupled with mature trees along the street frontages, convey the City’s history and contribute to the
area’s distinct identity. However, some of this building and landscape fabric has been modified over
time, with the addition of nondescript single- and multi-family houses and commercial structures
diminishing the area’s character and distinctiveness.
Post World War II, the Downtown’s grid development pattern was extended outward. Housing was
constructed in comparable development forms but used simpler, somewhat anonymous, functional
design styles. Commercial buildings were grouped in multi-tenant centers or independent structures
that were set back from the street, surrounded by minimally landscaped parking lots, and facilitated
automobile rather than pedestrian access. The growing primacy of the automobile also resulted in a
reduction in the intensity of public street trees
More recent development, occurring from the mid 1970s to the present, embraced development
typologies typical of suburban master planned communities throughout California. These established
neighborhoods characterized by homogeneous residential types, primarily single-family detached
units, built within a street pattern that limited neighborhood entries, emphasized discontinuity with
cul-de-sacs, and became more curvilinear. Schools and parks were incorporated within or on the edges
of the neighborhoods. Grocery stores and commercial centers were pulled outside and to the edges of
the neighborhoods rather than as their focus, primarily to major street intersections. Higher density,
multi-family neighborhoods tended to be concentrated along the primary travel corridors and adjacent
to the commercial centers.
The Land Use Element provides for the evolution of existing and development of new neighborhoods
and commercial districts to development forms and patterns that re-introduce the principles of
livability and walkability, in lieu of the automobile, that characterized the early development of the
City of Corona. While it is recognized that the automobile will continue to be the primary form-giver
of the City, there are opportunities to achieve greater pedestrian activity through the re-use of the
Downtown’s street frontages, selective infill and re-design of existing commercial centers as existing
retail uses are naturally replaced by new, emerging businesses over time, and the greater intermixing of
housing types in new residential neighborhoods.
Additionally, there are opportunities to improve the design of buildings and properties to lessen their
impacts on the consumption of nonrenewable environmental resources. Mixed use development

projects that integrate housing with retail commercial and office uses and in proximity to public
transit can promote greater walking and reduce automobile trips, thereby reducing air pollution,
noise, and energy consumption. Master planned residential subdivisions and business and industrial
parks can be designed to capture and re-use rainwater on-site, reducing the consumption of the
region’s groundwater and imported water. Similarly, the use of efficient building construction
techniques and materials can reduce heat gain and loss, reducing energy consumptions and the costs
to residents and businesses.

CORONA’S RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
CONTEXT
The City of Corona is characterized by its diversity of residential neighborhoods. These range from
the historic neighborhoods flanking the Downtown and Grand Avenue circle that contain a mix of
single and small scale multi-family dwellings to the master planned residential neighborhoods that
extend outward from the Downtown into the foothill slopes that contain a greater homogeneity of
housing types often oriented around schools and parks.
The older neighborhoods are characterized by their diverse architectural design and quality. Some are
distinctive in their architectural design and representative of important styles that are evocative of
Southern California’s agricultural-based community development. Others reflect a “ranch style”
character typical of rural communities. Many others, particularly those built in later years, are simple,
nondescript in their design, often characterized as “stucco boxes.” Typically the houses are built on
lots of 7,200 to 10,000 square feet in a grid street pattern, oriented to the street with well-defined
entries and porches, and set back from the street by large landscaped front yards. Garages are small
and located to the side or rear of the property. As these neighborhoods have aged, they are increasingly
in need of property maintenance and enhancement.
The newer neighborhoods generally are characterized by their higher intensity of green space and
amenity. In turn, this has been accommodated by their smaller lot sizes for single-family detached
units and greater sense of building bulk and mass. Houses are located closer to the street and their
frontages are often visually dominated by the width of three car garages, with house entries substan-
tially reduced in size. In many respects, the houses have “turned inward” away from the street, with
the social “life” of the unit internalized or focused in back yards. The neighborhood street pattern has
been internalized as well, with the extensive use of cul-de-sacs and curvilinear alignments that are con-
nected to the arterial network in limited locations and disconnected from adjoining residential areas.

CORONA’S COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE DISTRICTS
CONTEXT
The City of Corona contains a diversity of commercial and office uses that support local resident
needs and serves surrounding communities. Generally, these fall into five functional categories:
a. A Downtown that serves as the symbolic and historic center of the City containing a mix of retail,
    personal service, and office uses located in one- and two-story buildings on small lots
46                                                                          City of Corona General Plan

                                                                                                     Land Use
b. A local and region-serving corridor along North Main Street containing a mix of “large format”
   retailers, offices, and highway-oriented uses located in one- and three-story structures developed on
   large parcels
c. Multi-tenant centers containing a mix of region- and some local-serving uses (grocery, drug stores,
   and restaurants) located at freeway interchanges (e.g., McKinley Street and Magnolia Avenue)
d. Community and neighborhood-serving multi-tenant centers containing grocery stores and
   supporting uses developed as nodes within residential areas (e.g., Ontario Avenue and Magnolia
   Avenue)
e. Arterial corridors containing a mix of multi-tenant centers and strip buildings and freestanding
   highway and community serving uses
In addition, a major retail center that incorporates office and housing uses is planned for the I-15
intersection with Cajalco Road.
As indicated previously, many residents have expressed their opinion that, while most retail needs can
be met within the City, there is an absence of high quality soft-goods retailers that would typically be
found in a major department store, quality restaurants, entertainment such as movie theaters, and
specialty food stores such as Trader Joes.
Both the Downtown and North Main Street are under-performing in the economic marketplace: the
former largely due to the numerous small parcels that are not suitable for larger contemporary retail
uses and the latter due to competition from adjoining communities. The City has adopted
revitalization and Specific Plans for these areas to foster their revitalization (these areas are discussed in
greater depth in subsequent sections of the Land Use Element).

CORONA’S INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
CONTEXT
The City of Corona is characterized by four general typologies of industrial development that reflect
the evolution of the industrial market within the region. The first consists of the mineral extraction
and heavy mining activities located in the eastern and southeastern portions of the City and SOI.
These were developed to exploit the resources that have been identified as “significant” by the State of
California. These have little relationship to other City uses, though their trucks, noise, and
unattractive visual character impact the City.
Large warehousing and distribution facilities account for the second type of industrial use. Initially,
these developed in support of the City’s and region’s citrus crop and other agricultural activities
optimizing their location on the major regional and interstate transportation corridors (SR-91 and
I-15) and the railroad. In recent years, these have evolved for the storage and distribution of home
furnishings, retail goods, and locally manufactured goods.
Areas along the SR-91 corridor support the third typology, a diversity of general (or “heavy”)
manufacturing uses. Many of these were developed before the population explosion and housing
development of the 1980s and 1990s, utilize extensive land areas, and are visually unattractive. They,
generally, provide jobs that are unrelated to the education and skills of many of Corona’s residents.
In recent years, there has been the increased development of “cleaner” industries, the fourth typology,
that feature light manufacturing, research and development, and high technology uses that take
advantage of the education and skills of the City’s emergent population. These are developed in
business parks and on sites with more attractive architecture and landscape.
As indicated earlier, many residents still commute to jobs in Orange County and other areas, as the
types of industries developed in the City have not kept pace with the residents’ skills. Many residents
have expressed the desire to accommodate a greater diversity of jobs to lessen their need to commute
to other cities for their employment.

CORONA’S MIXED-USE DISTRICTS
CONTEXT
+ Mixed Commercial and Residential Development
Mixed-use development is increasingly being perceived in southern California as a viable strategy to
increase the supply of housing as developable lands become constrained and housing prices escalate. It
is conceived as an urban planning solution to enhance community livability by locating residents in
close proximity to commercial services, jobs, and transit. In many respects, this is the re-birth of a
form of building that was prominent in the early development of United States. Many town and
village centers contained shops with housing on the second floor for the merchants. In the early
development of Corona, there were a number of these developments within its central core. However,
with cheap land and a preference to live in single-family units on large lots, mixed-use buildings
became less attractive as an option and ultimately were occupied only by the lowest income residents.
This form of development has re-emerged with some intensity during the past ten years. Numerous
projects have been developed throughout southern California, with “signature” examples in San
Diego, Pasadena, Santa Monica, and Huntington Beach. While many considered such projects to be
only viable in the most urban settings, there are several important and successful precedents in
suburban settings comparable to Corona, with one of the most successful located in the City of Brea.
Communities that have successfully developed contemporary mixed use projects have focused on three
primary opportunities: the (a) re-use of underutilized commercial corridors and industrial properties,
(b) establishment of high activity town centers and downtowns, and (c) intensification at rail and bus
transit stations. The first, commercial re-use, is based on the fact that many communities over-zoned
their lands for commercial development, somewhat arbitrarily assigning commercial classifications
along arterial streets without consideration of the market required to support such capacity. Many of
these are characterized by their shallow property depths that are unsuitable for contemporary
commercial development, such as Sixth Street. The second recognizes that successful town centers,
such as Downtown Corona, depend upon some density and a resident population that lives in
proximity to the commercial uses. Development of mixed-use projects that increase resident

populations in proximity to transit stations is considered as an opportunity to reduce automobile
dependency for transit users.
Two potential forms of mixed residential and commercial development have been defined for the City
of Corona and SOI. The first follows the traditional pattern that accommodates housing units on the
second or higher floor of buildings in which the first floor is occupied by retail or office uses. The
second, applicable to deeper parcels, provides for their integrated development with commercial or
office uses located on the primary frontage and residential to the rear as a transition to abutting
residential neighborhoods.
+ Mixed Industrial and Commercial Development
A second mixed use prototype that may be considered for Corona integrates industrial, office, and
commercial uses on the same site or in proximity to one another. This recognizes the premise that
viable industries and business districts often benefit from the easy accessibility to the network of
supporting activities. For example, a number of successful research and development parks in the City
of Irvine contain restaurants, hotels, financial institutions, business supply stores, computer sales
stores, and health clubs. A number of recent projects in Corona, including Corona Pointe on
Magnolia Avenue, demonstrate this intermixing of uses.

CORONA’S PUBLIC AND INSTITUTIONAL USES
CONTEXT
The City of Corona contains a diversity of public and institutional uses including schools, parks,
libraries, administrative (City Hall), corporate yards, fire and police facilities, utility facilities, and
comparable uses. As of 2002, approximately five percent of the City’s lands were occupied by these
uses. Major public uses, such as the City Hall, Police Department, and Main Library, and the City’s
primary health facility, Corona Regional Medical Center, are concentrated in Corona’s core. Other
public and institutional uses are dispersed throughout the City’s commercial districts and residential
neighborhoods to provide convenient access for residents and businesses.

CORONA’S OPEN SPACES
CONTEXT
In addition to parklands, the City encompasses a variety of lands that are committed to be retained as
open space in perpetuity. Cumulatively, these lands define the character and image of the City,
affecting the distribution and form of development, as well as serving as an important amenity for its
residents. They encompass steeply sloped hillsides and canyons, the major floodways and improved
flood control channels that drain from these, habitats that contain significant and endangered plant
and animal species, earthquake faulting and seismic risk corridors primarily along the foothills, utility
easements, and National Forest lands. Additionally, many master planned residential subdivisions
incorporate landscaped corridors and buffers, natural lands, and significant topography that are
preserved as open space. Approximately 3,500 acres were committed as open space in 2002, excluding
parks.

  Land Use
CORONA’S OPPORTUNITY DISTRICTS AND SITES
This section of the Land Use Element provides direction for seven “opportunity districts and sites”
within the City of Corona. Each area has unique issues that require additional policy than is provided
in the rest of the Element. Some of the “opportunity sites” have been targeted for immediate land use
changes, while others will gradually transition over an extended time period.
Downtown Corona
CONTEXT
Downtown is the historic and symbolic heart of Corona. Within this area the living, business,
cultural, governance, and transportation center of a booming agricultural economy was developed. It
includes the City’s greatest concentration of historic structures, some of its densest housing, and its
most pedestrian-oriented streets. Yet, while Downtown is Corona’s most “urban” area, its role as the
city center has diminished during modern times. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s new
commercial centers were developed outside of the Downtown and attracted the major grocery store
chains and retailers by their larger parcels and convenient parking. The Downtown evolved as an
inconsistent mix of community and automobile oriented uses, including retail, automobile supply and
service, restaurant, personal and business service, real estate and other offices, and similar uses
developed on shallow parcels that primarily abutted single-family residential neighborhoods.
Efforts were initiated to reshape the central portion of the Downtown based on suburban principles of
larger parcels with plentiful parking, in the form of the Downtown Mall. This was intended to create
the capacity and land configuration to enable the Downtown to effectively compete with the new
centers. However, the City was unable to attract a major retail or other destination use to the Mall,
and the revitalization efforts have had marginal success.
Today, the area is characterized by its inconsistent economic vitality, physical quality, maintenance of
its buildings and sites, and visual quality. While many sites are economically underutilized, they are
constrained in their ability to accommodate contemporary and more intense commercial development
due to their limited parcel size and depth and adjacency to single-family housing.
Recognizing the importance of Downtown, the City has adopted a Specific Plan for the area shown in
          2
Figure 6 that provides for its redevelopment as one of the City’s primary activity centers. The Plan re-
conceives the Downtown as a center of small-scale shops, restaurants, entertainment, professional
offices, and civic uses fronting onto well-landscaped sidewalks that support an active pedestrian
environment. The built fabric of buildings located along street frontages would be maintained with
parking located to their rear or in structures. New housing opportunities would be provided through
mixed-use development projects.
The Downtown’s existing commercial areas are categorized into five classifications differentiated by
their functional role, intensity, and mix of uses. These include: “Downtown” for the core area
surrounding the Sixth Street and Main Street intersection, “Gateway Business” for the properties
flanking Main Street’s intersection with SR-91, “Community Services” for the areas along South Main
2 The area depicted excludes properties east of Rimpau Avenue, which are incorporated in the “East Sixth Street and Magnolia
Avenue Corridors” Opportunity Area, shown on Figure 8.

Street south of the core area (currently, largely developed for medical-related uses), “Transitional
Commercial” for parcels flanking Sixth Street extending outward east and west from the core to
Grand Boulevard, and “General Commercial” for those parcels along Sixth Street west from Grand
Boulevard to Lincoln Avenue and east toward the I-15 freeway.
The Land Use Element amends the Specific Plan’s “Downtown” classification as “Downtown/Mixed
Use” and re-designates the “Community Services” area as “Office Professional,” the “Gateway
Commercial” as “General Commercial,” and the “Transitional Commercial” and “General
Commercial” areas as “Mixed Use: Commercial and Residential.” Though these classifications may
differ, the Specific Plan’s permitted uses and densities are considered consistent with the more broadly
defined General Plan categories. However, the Land Use Element’s mixed-use development policies
encourages the development of integrated commercial and residential structures in the core
Downtown area and along the Sixth Street, which may also be redeveloped for multi-family housing.
This is intended to enhance the area’s vitality, increase the customer market for Downtown uses, and
improve the interface with adjoining residential neighborhoods.

North Main Street
CONTEXT
The North Main Street corridor is characterized by its large land parcels that are suitable for the
development of major chain and other large format retailers and supporting uses. However, over a
period of several years, the corridor experienced a gradual transition from neighborhood retail, food,
and drug stores to more of a secondary/off-price discount retail orientation. Currently, there is a
considerable mix of large and small retail, auto-oriented, fast food, and other uses, with many parcels
considerably underutilized. The development of new commercial centers in Norco and other
surrounding communities effectively attracted the major retailers away from Corona.
66                                                                        City of Corona General Plan

In 2000, the City of Corona adopted a Specific Plan for the area shown in Figure 7 intended to give
focus and spur North Main Street’s revitalization. It organizes the corridor into separate areas based
on land use. These include
a. The Corona Entertainment Center that serves as the area’s central focus by providing for food,
   entertainment, and retail/recreation opportunities
b. The Corona Retail Center targeting general merchandise and comparison retailing such as apparel,
   household furnishings, and similar types of uses
c. The Corona Transit Center that emphasizes the development of transportation-related uses
d. The Corona Business Center providing for office, multi-tenant, and business park uses
e. Service Commercial area providing support uses for retail and industrial uses
f. Industrial area providing for a mix of nonpolluting, “clean” industries such as research and
   development, light manufacturing, and high technology businesses
The Land Use Element consolidates the Specific Plan’s “Entertainment,” “Retail,” and “Service
Commercial” designations into the “General Commercial” category, consolidates the “Industrial” and
“Business Center” designations into the “Light Industrial” category, and re-designates the “Transit
Center” and small portions of adjoining properties as “Mixed Use: Commercial and Residential.”
Though these classifications may differ, the Specific Plan’s permitted uses and densities are considered
consistent with the more broadly defined General Plan categories. However, the Land Use Element’s
mixed-use development policies place more emphasis on the development of integrated commercial
and residential structures in proximity of the Metrolink to enhance the area’s vitality and increase the
customer market for North Main Street’s uses. Additionally, the Land Use Element’s policy place
more emphasis on the development of professional office uses, particularly in areas designated by the
Specific Plan as “Entertainment Center.”

East Sixth Street and Magnolia Avenue Corridors
CONTEXT
Properties on Sixth Street east of Rimpau Avenue and flanking Magnolia Avenue east of I-15, as
shown in Figure 8, contain a mix of light and heavy industrial uses including manufacturing and
warehousing facilities, with limited commercial uses. These vary considerably in their economic
vitality and physical appearance and many can be expected to change in use and density over the next
twenty years.
Throughout California there has been a considerable shift in the character of industrial development,
from heavy manufacturing functions to cleaner industries (research and development, high
technology, and bio-medical) that prefer campus-like development projects that integrate a diversity of
services and functions that support their primary use. The latter may include banks and financial
institutions, business supply stores, hotels and motels, restaurants, entertainment, convenience food
stores and retail, and similar uses. Re-use of the Sixth Street and Magnolia Avenue corridors can
capitalize upon these trends and is supported by the Land Use Element.

Eagle Valley
CONTEXT
Eagle Valley is a mountainous area located at Corona’s eastern edge, generally south of Home Gardens
and west of Lake Matthews, as shown in Figure 9. The site is not currently served by roadways or
utility infrastructure. A Specific Plan has been adopted by the City for the development of a
residential community oriented around a golf course, which preserves the most significant topography
as open space. The Metropolitan Water District has acquired the site and has tentative plans to
construct a water treatment facility on a portion of the site.
The Land Use Element re-considers the future of the property as an opportunity for the development
of a master planned industrial and business park that integrates a diversity of uses into a cohesive and
distinctly identifiable employment center for the City and surrounding region. Its natural setting can
be uniquely used to shape the form and character of development, which differentiates it as a special
place among business park environments.

Thomas Ranch
CONTEXT
The vacant Thomas Ranch site located southwest of the intersection of Serfas Club Drive and
Palisades Drive, as shown in Figure 10, is contaminated and is being “capped” as remediation by the
State of California prior to any development. A number of land use proposals have been considered
for the site, including residential, commercial, and light industrial uses. None of these have been
approved due to community concerns regarding the compatibility of the site’s development with and
impacts of traffic on adjoining low-density residential uses. The Land Use Element provides for the
limited development of the site with a park-and-ride facility at the street intersection and re-use of the
balance of the site for a community park.

CONTEXT
Properties located primarily to the west of the Cajalco Road and I-15 interchange, as shown in Figure

interchange adjoining the proposed Dos Lagos project remains undeveloped. The Land Use Element
designates these lands consistent with their current use and provides for the future consideration of
urban uses that would complement development located on adjoining properties.

SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
CONTEXT
Corona’s Sphere of Influence contains a diversity of lands that are developed, vacant, and permanently
protected as open spaces. Prado Basin occupies most of the City’s northwest SOI and is committed for
flood protection, habitat conservation, and limited recreational uses. A small area at the SR-91 and
Green River intersection is developed for residential and highway-serving commercial uses. To the
south of the Prado Basin and the SR-91 freeway, Coronita is fully developed as a residential
community oriented around a golf course with highway-oriented commercial at Serfas Club Drive.
South of Coronita are SOI islands that extend into the foothills.
Corona’s eastern SOI encompasses the Home Gardens, the mountainous and vacant East Eagle Valley
area, and El Cerrito. Home Gardens is an almost fully developed area that contains some older
housing, commercial, and industrial uses that are likely to be redeveloped during the next 20 years. El
Cerrito is a low density, rural residential community with commercial uses located along its primary
corridors (Temescal Canyon Road and El Cerrito Road) and aggregate mining in the foothills that has
the potential for future residential infill at densities comparable to existing uses.
The southern SOI encompasses the Temescal Valley area with a mix of older rural, residential, new
residential subdivisions, recreational resort (Glen Ivy Hot Springs), highway and local-oriented
commercial centers, and aggregate mining. This area has been subject to considerable development
and growth during recent years, with a number of master planned communities entitled and
development constructed (Mountain Springs, Wildrose, Sycamore Retreat, and The Retreat). Several
of these are being developed as high amenity, golf course-related communities. A number of
additional development proposals are anticipated for surrounding foothill areas.
While the designation of an SOI is an indication that such areas would logically be served by the
adjoining City, the appropriateness of annexation must be considered in context with its fiscal impacts
and willingness of its property owners to be annexed to the City. Specifically, it is critical to assess
whether the costs of services in an annexation can be adequately borne by the revenues generated by
its uses and not result in an undue impact on the existing City’s cost and revenue balance.

Community Design
This chapter of the General Plan provides guidance for the design character of the Corona’s public
streetscapes, entries, and activity places. It expands upon and complements the design and
development guidelines defined for the City’s residential neighborhoods and commercial, industrial,
and mixed use districts by the Land Use Element, which largely apply to future private development
and investment actions.
C
           orona is an attractive and well-designed city that is uniquely identifiable in the region and whose
           aesthetic strengths contribute to a high quality of livability for residents and imageability for
           visitors. Design quality is achieved through the City’s streetscapes, entry treatments, architecture,
signage, and physical form and architecture of private buildings and public places.
The City contains street trees and landscape along its primary transportation corridors that unify its
neighborhoods and districts. Within the citywide framework, these are differentiated among neighborhoods
and key business and civic locations to convey a unique identity for each.
Entries from the freeways are clearly delineated by landscape, signage, lighting, and public art to ensure the
sense of arrival into and identity for Corona. These are integrated with improvements of adjoining private
property to establish a unified sense of place.
The public streets of Downtown will be designed to promote active pedestrian use. Street trees serve as visual
landmarks to define the area and a dense tree canopy provides shade. Sidewalks are paved with distinctive
materials and incorporate well-designed planters, benches, newsracks, trash receptacles, and public art.
Public signage is designed in a coordinated manner. Street lighting is scaled to the pedestrian, while
providing adequate illumination for automobiles on the street. Architectural and landscape design elements
and markers are used to reflect Corona’s history.
North Main Street contains well-designed signage, landscape, lighting, and other unified streetscape
improvements that promote its identity as a key activity and business area of the City. This establishes a
consistent visual framework that unifies the diversity of uses and building types of the district.
Freeway and neighborhood-serving commercial centers are consistently designed to complement adjoining
residential neighborhoods. Each contains signage, landscape, and other elements that visually distinguish the
center. As these centers evolve and are improved over time, they will incorporate additional amenities such as
landscaped sidewalks and public plazas that will enhance neighborhood socialization and pedestrian
activity.
Business and industrial parks are designed to convey a unique and high quality identity. Each contains
unifying signage, landscape, street lighting, entry identification, and common open spaces. Architectural
styles and building materials among individual businesses complement one another.
Residential neighborhoods are planned and designed to enhance livability and maintain high economic
value. Each is uniquely identified by signage, landscape, lighting, and other distinctive elements. Landscape
is used extensively to assure high aesthetic values.
A network of trails and greenways will interconnect Corona’s parklands and open spaces. Temescal Creek
and other drainages contain hiking and bicycle trail networks along their corridors that provide access into
surrounding open spaces and natural areas.

 Community Design
Physical development is located and designed to maintain the City’s hillsides and canyons, creeks, and other
natural open spaces as a visual backdrop and amenity for its residents and visitors.
STREET LANDSCAPE
CONTEXT
A lasting impression of Corona is the lushness and diversity of its landscape, particularly along the
street frontages. From freeway entries to neighborhood cul-de-sacs, industrial parks to historic
districts, planted parkways to old palm-lined drives, remnant palm and citrus groves to neighborhood
entries, the City is distinctly characterized by the intensity and scale of its greenery. This is most
evident when viewing the City from a distance, when trees collectively create an urban forest in
contrast to the adjacent natural areas. The City's primary entry at Sixth Street and SR-91 is well
marked with street trees. Certain streets in the City have received special landscape treatment due to
their importance and proximity to destinations deemed important to the City's image. Ontario
Avenue has old palm trees and street trees, as does North Main Street between Ontario and Foothill
Parkway.
Remnants of the historic citrus industry era are seen throughout Corona. Double rows of palm trees,
once lining driveways, dot the skyline, and contribute to the perception of the City’s agricultural
history. A number of these palm rows have been integrated into subsequently developed master
planned communities. Additionally, some new developments within the City have incorporated new
palm-lined streets as part of their design themes, such as in Eagle Glen.
While most of Corona’s streets are characterized by their trees and landscapes, in some of the older
areas of the City these species and scale are inconsistent and do not provide a unifying image. Grand
Boulevard, for example, contains numerous species of mature and large scale trees that vary
considerably along its circumference. The use of a consistent tree, such as tall palms, as an alternative,
would promote a more positive identity that would distinguish the historic circle from surrounding
residential neighborhoods and commercial areas. In contrast, the City’s master planned residential
communities and business parks developed during the last decades are characterized and distinguished
by their use of common street landscapes.
Corona has established landscape assessment districts to maintain extensive streetscapes, primarily
serving newer neighborhoods in the south, west, and northeast portions of the City. In addition to
maintaining the principal streets, the districts also maintain street trees within the neighborhoods as
well as parks and other open spaces.

CITY ENTRIES
CONTEXT
The sense of arrival into the City of Corona from adjoining communities is defined principally by the
visual transition from rural open spaces to urban and suburban development patterns and from
mountainous topography into an open valley. With minor exceptions, there are not physical
monuments or other visual elements at the SR-91 and I-15 freeway interchanges that convey the sense
of entry into Corona. Signage identifying the City’s new residential subdivisions is located on the
Main Street off-ramps of the SR-91 freeway. North of this intersection, signage and streetscape
improvements have been implemented to “announce” the entry into the planned entertainment and
office district. At other off-ramps, there is a mix of signage and landscape that are used to identify
adjoining commercial centers.

COMMUNITY SIGNAGE AND GRAPHICS—WAYFINDING
CONTEXT
A diversity of street signs and graphics are used throughout the City’s public places. The most unique
signage, today, are the system of signs that provide directions to developing residential subdivisions
and those that identify the redeveloping North Main Street entertainment/office district. Otherwise,
street identification, traffic control, parking, and other wayfinding signs use simple graphics and
greatly vary in their fonts, colors, and design. Typical of many communities, multiple signs that differ
in their size and graphic design are affixed to utility poles and street light standards.

Corona’s identity and visual quality would benefit from the establishment of a comprehensive public
signage program that establishes a logo and graphic style for consistent use throughout the City,
consolidates multiple signs, where feasible, and defines a plan for their distribution to facilitate
wayfinding and the identification of key districts and places by residents and visitors to the City.

TRAILS AND GREENWAYS
CONTEXT
The City of Corona’s community design character is influenced by its rich resource of parklands,
surrounding open spaces of the Cleveland National Forest and Prado Basin, and Temescal Creek and
Wash, which traverse the City. The parklands and open spaces are separated and offer opportunities
for the establishment of interconnecting greenways and trails that would considerably enhance the
City’s urban character.
Additionally, some of Corona’s recent master planned residential communities have incorporated
extensive open spaces that contribute high aesthetic value and character. Sierra del Oro and Eagle
Glen retain natural slopes and canyons, while the latter and other communities are built around golf
courses. As most of the lands available for future development extend into the City’s foothills, there
are opportunities to continue to incorporate topography and natural areas into the development
pattern as a community amenity.

 Community Design
COMMUNITY PLACES—DISTRICTS, NODES, AND
CORRIDORS
CONTEXT
As discussed in the Land Use Element, the City of Corona contains a wide variety of residential
neighborhoods, commercial districts and corridors, and industrial districts. Some of these convey a
unique identity and character through their visual character, urban form, and landscape, while many
others are nondescript and blend into an overall urban fabric.
Downtown Corona is distinctly identifiable by its street pattern, form of development, historic
buildings, and landscape. It is defined by a grid street pattern circumscribed by the Grand Boulevard
circle, within which retail, office, civic, and other buildings are developed in a traditional “Main
Street” configuration directly fronting onto the streets with limited parking located in the rear.
Residential areas are characterized by their orientation to the streets and landscaped front yards and
parkways. Many commercial and residential structures exhibit historically important architectural
design styles. The Downtown Mall reconfigured this pattern into a larger superblock in an effort to
attract larger scale retailers. It is the intent of the General Plan, as reflected in the adopted Specific
Plan, to reinvent the Downtown as a center of community and identity. Improvements in the
streetscape and public places are essential in achieving this objective.
North Main Street is characterized by its large parcels on which are built a mix of retail, office, and
industrial uses of varying building size and character and landscape quality. Recently, new signage and
streetscape have been implemented to establish an identity for the district as a stimulus for its
revitalization for entertainment, office, retail, and other uses.
Sixth Street east and west of the Downtown core is an automobile oriented corridor that contains a
fragmented mix of commercial centers, strip malls, and independent buildings that convey little
architectural or landscape merit. Its streetscape varies in the density and species of trees and plantings,
with some area lushly landscaped with evergreens and others almost absent of any vegetation. The
General Plan’s intention to revitalize the corridor for mixed-use development affords the opportunity
to introduce new streetscapes that are complementary to the uses and enhances the area’s imageability
and quality.
The City’s freeway- and neighborhood-oriented commercial centers typify those found in suburban
environments, with primary structures set back from streets by large modestly landscaped parking lots.
Buildings in newer centers exhibit a higher level of architectural character, primarily as a reflection of
the character of surrounding residential neighborhoods.
Industrial districts in the City are uniquely identifiable due to their disparate characteristics. Older
areas contain large warehouse style buildings on minimally landscaped sites, some of which are used
for the storage of materials and equipment used in the manufacturing process. Newer developments
exhibit a higher level of architectural design and site landscaping, some in a “campus-like” setting.
The community design character of Corona’s residential neighborhoods fall into three categories. The
older Downtown neighborhoods reflect the historic grid pattern described above containing a mix of
housing types on moderate to large lots. Neighborhoods adjoining the Downtown largely continue
the grid, but are less distinctive in their architecture and landscaping and exhibit less “sense of place.”

Many residential communities developed since the 1970’s in the southern and northeastern portions
of the City have been master planned and contain housing characterized by curvilinear and cul-de-sac
street networks, semi-homogeneous architecture (colors, design styles, and building form) and, in
some cases, extensive landscape and open spaces.

Housing
The Housing Element, per the requirements of State Law, is a policy document that focuses on the
actions that will be undertaken by the City of Corona during a five-year time period to provide
adequate housing for all segments of the population, in particular the low and very low income and
those with special needs. It establishes specific targets regarding the number of housing units to be
developed during this time period and specific strategies on how these will be produced. Due to its
short-term nature and mandate for updating in 2006, only its goals and policies have been
incorporated into the comprehensive General Plan. The complete Housing Element is a legal
component of the General Plan and may be obtained separately from the City.

Historic Resources
This section addresses the protection and sustainability of the City’s historic resources. Goals and
policies are presented to recognize the community’s unique cultural, social, environmental, and
economic heritage. There are several buildings within the City that exhibit significant heritage
distinction, one of which is the Women’s Improvement Club, which is listed on the National Register
of Historic Places. The Corona Register of Historic Resources and the Corona Heritage Inventory
comprise listings of structures, sites, and features of local significance, civic identity, and character.
This General Plan element is an extension of these initiatives, setting out a policy framework within
the General Plan for the identification, recognition, conservation, and management of historic
resources.
Planning, conserving, and managing historic structures and landscapes is not a State-mandated
requirement of a General Plan. However, such provisions can be included in an optional element and
will carry the same legal weight as the mandated elements.
The following are the key components of Corona’s Historic Resources element:
! Architectural character of urban and agricultural structures
! Urban landscapes, landforms such as trees, and streetscapes
! Archeological resources
! Landmarks of National and Statewide significance
! Historic districts
! Historical markers (monuments and plaques)
C
           orona is a city rich in historic resources and sustaining the community’s heritage is a matter of
           civic pride among residents and businesses as it translates to fostering a sense of place and identity,
           sustaining a high degree of quality of life, and strengthening economic growth through tourism.
Corona will continue to identify, maintain, rehabilitate, protect, and display its heritage and its resources as
it grows.
HISTORIC RESOURCES
CONTEXT
The City of Corona is noted for its rich cultural heritage as evidenced by its many historic structures,
sites, and natural features. An effective historic conservation program enhances the community’s
understanding and appreciation of history and contributes to increased property values, economic
benefits, and the overall attractiveness of the City to residents, businesses, and visitors.
+ Archeological Resources
Artifacts left from the Luiseño Indian habitation in Corona include straw baskets, clay pots, tools, and
stone grinding sticks. Prehistoric or paleontological resources, such as fossilized plants and animals,
have also been discovered in some of the deeper canyons and drainages in the South Corona area. In
general, very few archeological or paleontological sites have been found or recorded in Corona. The
City has required that field surveys be performed in conjunction with large-scale development

 Historic Resources
activities on vacant lands to determine the presence of potential resources. During the period of 1951
to 2000, nineteen archeological sites have been officially recorded in Corona.
+ Architectural Character/Historic Resources
A considerable number of the original residences, churches, and to a lesser extent institutional
buildings, adjacent to Grand Boulevard Circle, remain in existence today. Corona has a variety of
historic residential architectural styles constructed over many decades. The majority of the historic
homes in Corona are of the Craftsman bungalow, California bungalow, or Vernacular Wood Frame
style, typical of many California communities. Other styles include the Spanish Revival and Spanish
Colonial, Queen Anne, Gothic Revival, Colonial Revival, Victorian Cottage, and the Spanish/Mission
Revival architecture of City Hall. Most of Corona’s original commercial and institutional buildings in
the downtown core are no longer present, due to urban renewal efforts in the 1970s.
In addition to the historic buildings within the downtown area, other physical elements also evoke
Corona’s history and can be considered as historic resources. Examples of these resources include the
historic street lights, old sidewalks, stone curbs and walls, the mature trees of Grand Boulevard and
other downtown streets; and the tall palm trees along Chase Drive. Accessory structures associated
with Corona’s agricultural origins—such as barns, out buildings, or rock-lined irrigation channels—
are also considered as historical resources.
+ Corona’s Historic Sites
Corona’s historic sites are commemorated with recognition in the National Register of Historic Places
and through its own Historic Markers program. In addition, the City is establishing an inventory of
heritage properties to be preserved due to age or historic significance.
Two locations within the City are currently included in the National Register of Historic Places (only
one structure remains standing), and a third was determined eligible but not listed at its owners’
request. They are as follows:
! Woman’s Improvement Club Clubhouse, 1101 S. Main Street—Southern California architect
    Thomas Preston designed this one-story, multi-gabled, Craftsman style bungalow clubhouse that
    was built in 1913. The building’s architectural features include painted wood shingles on the
    exterior walls, a steep-gabled main roof with clipped gables over the side wings, an original oak
    front door with beveled glass, and wooden porch piers on a prominent brick base. It was added to
    the National Register on November 3, 1988, and is the only remaining structure within Corona
    city limits with that status.

                                                                                          Historic Resources
!   Andrew Carnegie Library, 8th & Main Streets—This neo-classical building was designed by Los
    Angeles architect Franklin Pierce Burnham, with construction with construction completed on July
    2, 1906. The exterior was of cream and red colored pressed brick, with stone and concrete trim. It
    was symmetrically designed with a central staircase flanked by sloping banisters, which held
    decorative iron lights. The entrance was topped by an overhanging triangular pediment with ornate
    plaster designs and supported by fluted Ionic columns on either side. This building served as the
    City’s public library until July 3, 1971, much larger public library facility was constructed several
    blocks away. The building remained empty for the next six years. Despite efforts to have it
    restored, it fell into disrepair and was damaged by fires and vandalism; the building was demolished
    April 18, 1978.
!   Corona Theater, northeast corner of Ramona Avenue & East Sixth Street—The Spanish Revival-
    style Corona Theater, also known as the Landmark Building, was designed by Southern California
    architect Carl Boller and dedicated on August 29, 1929. The building was constructed of brick,
    with stucco on its front elevation. Some remodeling has been done to the exterior, but significant
    details remain. Over the years, the building has had various uses, including commercial office
    space, a Masonic Lodge meeting hall, and a large theater. The building is the only pre-Depression
    Era theater remaining in Corona. It was nominated and determined eligible for the National
    Register, but the owners declined formal listing.
Historic resources are also existent outside the Corona city limits, but within the SOI, all of which are
in the South Sphere (Temescal Canyon). These sites are described in detail in the Technical
Background Report associated with this General Plan.
+ City Initiatives
An inventory of 481 properties that warrant preservation because of their age or historic significance
was adopted by the Planning Commission in April 2003. These are based upon the recommendation
of the Heritage Inventory Committee, which is comprised of representatives from Planning, Code
Enforcement, Heritage Room of the Library, and the Corona Historic Preservation Society.
A Historic Resources Element and implementing ordinance was adopted in June 2001. The purpose
of the Historic Resources Element is to provide policies for the planning and future management of
historic resources in the City of Corona. At the time the ordinance was adopted, the Corona Register
of Historic Resources was established with nine landmarks, nine districts, and nine markers that
identified local sites of important historical and/or cultural interest.
City of Corona General Plan                                                                              113

   Historic Resources
  A Historic Property Preservation (Mills Act) Program was adopted by the City of Corona in February
  2002. Under this program, tax relief is offered for properties on the Corona Register of Historic
  Resources, which in turn are maintained or restored in accordance with City design and historic
  building standards. Participation in the program by the owner is voluntary and the minimum term of
  a preservation agreement is ten years with automatic annual extensions. Furthermore, the City has also
  established a number of programs to help homeowners maintain historic homes. Ordinance 2270
  (1995) allows the designation of “landmark trees” meeting certain criteria. These programs are
  intended to encourage the continued preservation of Corona’s historical resources.
  More detailed descriptions of historic resources in Corona are presented in the Technical Background
  Report. The following section presents the goals and policies for historic resources in the City of
  Corona.

  Economic Development
  The Economic Development goals, policies, and implementation programs build upon ongoing City
  programs and provide a framework to insure that the City of Corona is able to maintain its strong
  economic base and take advantage of future economic opportunities. A strong economy not only
  provides local workers with adequate income to afford a high quality of life, but it also provides local
  government with adequate public revenues to maintain a high quality of public services.
  T
             he City’s position at the intersection of SR-91 and I-15, and its proximity to both the San
             Bernardino and Orange County borders, have made Corona a desirable location for firms
             migrating from other Southland areas. Additionally, the lower cost of housing relative to other
  areas has made the City an attractive housing market. Both of these factors have resulted in significant
  growth in the City’s population and employment base. Corona has been in the process of transitioning from
  a market based primarily upon industrial development to one in which office development becomes an
  emerging focus. Although the City’s industrial growth is expected to remain strong, recent activity levels
  indicate that Corona is playing a major role in the Inland Empire’s expanding office space market. These
  trends have contributed to a strong economic base in the City of Corona.
  In order to maintain the City’s vision of a fiscally healthy and balanced economy, broad goals and policies
  are defined to guide future economic development efforts. The Economic Development goals and policies are
  long-term to provide an organizational framework and process that can guide ongoing development efforts.
  Recognizing that economic development is not a static process, the goals and policies should provide direction
  to guide development activities while at the same time maintaining flexibility to respond to changing
  economic trends and local market conditions.
  The City’s strategic approach to economic development has been to attract, retain, and expand businesses for
  the purpose of encouraging profitable enterprises, creating sustainable local jobs and generating revenue to
  support municipal functions. This section outlines the over-arching economic development goals and
  associated policies that should be considered. Under each broad goal, policies are recommended. Policies set
  the parameters for actual implementation steps to be taken by the City to achieve its Goals.
  ECONOMIC BASE
  CONTEXT
  The City’s key location in the Inland Empire and Riverside County allows it to position itself as a
  regional location for retail, commercial and industrial activity. The City’s location and accessibility
  present opportunities for encouraging the development of industries in emerging markets and new
  technologies, as well as in the professional office market. Research and Development firms present
  opportunities for development in high-technology sectors such as electronics and medical
  manufacturing, which also are associated with a high-skilled labor force. Job diversification and a
  skilled labor force are two elements that are essential to maintaining a strong economic base.

LABOR FORCE
CONTEXT
The City is well positioned as a gateway to Orange County along State SR-91, allowing those who
work in Orange County to live in Corona’s more affordable housing. However, quality of life issues
become paramount as commuting and traffic increases. There is a need for local economic growth to
provide a better match between the City’s labor force (Corona residents) and the City’s available
employment, and to satisfy a significant portion of the employment and income needs of the City’s
labor force.

REVITALIZATION OF TARGETED GROWTH AREAS
CONTEXT
While the City has grown quite rapidly over the 1990s in terms of jobs, retail sales and average
household income, there are areas of the City that need economic attention and revitalization. Due to
the older nature of the Downtown and North Main areas, revitalization is important both to create a
sense of place in Corona, and to promote economic development and expansion. Mixed-use
residential and commercial land uses can contribute to this success.
An important component to creating a vibrant town center is a district that is active and lively into the
evening hours. Cafes, bookstores, and restaurants with evening hours draw a variety of people and
offer a welcome setting. The increased focus on office development, including professional and
medical, will provide opportunities for revitalization of the downtown core. Creating a pedestrian-
oriented environment, community facilities, and mixed-use projects with residential, retail, and office
are key to a successful downtown core. The North Main area should also provide a focal point for
office and residential uses in addition to retail and entertainment.
In addition to the Downtown and North Main areas, other targeted growth areas in the City have
opportunities for commercial, industrial, and residential development that can contribute to a
balanced City economy. These include underutilized and transitioning areas such as the southeast
corner of the SR-91 and I-15 interchanges, along the Sixth Street corridor and the City’s Sphere areas.
These areas are targeted for office, industrial, residential or a mix of uses that require a different
economic focus than the Downtown or North Main area.

FISCAL VIABILITY
CONTEXT
The rapid growth experienced by Corona has placed greater demand on the City to provide essential
public services such as fire, law enforcement, parks and recreation, public works and schools.
Attention to the fiscal viability of new land uses will be an ongoing priority. In order to provide a high
level of services to the community and finance capital projects, Corona must maintain fiscal strength.
Property taxes were once the primary source of revenue for funding municipal activities. However,
sales taxes have become a primary municipal source of revenues for most communities. In addition,
other financing sources are necessary to supplement the primary revenues for both capital facility costs
and ongoing operations and maintenance costs.

FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES
CONTEXT
Once primarily dependent on property tax revenues to fund infrastructure and other public facilities,
as well as programs, local governments have sought alternative methods to obtain funds to finance
such projects. Today, Corona, like other local governments, must rely upon a mixture of various
funding sources to finance capital facilities. These include a variety of techniques including
redevelopment tools, development impact fees, and assessment and special tax districts.

Infrastructure & Public Services
Circulation
This chapter of the General Plan describes the location and extent of planned circulation facilities and
services, and identifies standards for those facilities. The circulation element outlines the long-term
plan for roadways, including number of lanes, right-of-way, and general operating conditions. It also
provides guidance relating to the transit system, goods movement system, and nonmotorized travel,
including bicycle and pedestrian travel. To portray the continuity of the circulation system, the plan
graphics include planned facilities outside the City limits but within the City’s Sphere of influence
(which are inside the planning area boundary used for the overall circulation analysis). Regional
circulation is also of critical interest in Corona since the city is heavily influenced by the freeway
system, and some of the trips on local roadways are actually regional trips that cut through Corona.
To address the future local and regional circulation issues, a travel demand model was created. The
model is based upon the regional model of the Southern California Association of Governments, and
it includes regional growth outside the City of Corona. Inside the City, the buildout of the proposed
land use plan has been modeled to determine the future increase in trip making on city streets. The
model results were used to develop the goals and policies listed herein, and to determine the
functional classification system for city streets that will guide the development of the circulation
system.
LOCAL THOROUGHFARES AND TRANSPORTATION
ROUTES
CONTEXT
The street system in Corona has traditionally served residents and businesses in the city relatively
efficiently. Recent growth in population and land uses both within the City and in the adjacent
communities has put increasing pressures on the arterial street system. Congestion on SR-91 and I-15,
as well as congestion at the interchange of the two freeways, has resulted in a significant amount of
regional “by-pass” traffic using City streets to avoid freeway congestion.
Other critical transportation issues that have been noted by residents and businesses include
completion of Foothill Parkway to serve east/west traffic and help alleviate congestion on other
east/west routes, mitigation of north/south traffic flow in the southern portion of the City,
interconnectivity with other cities including Norco and Riverside, the potential for a new freeway
connection through the Santa Ana Mountains linking I-15 to SR-241 (a regional issue),
improvements to interchange access at SR-91, mitigation of local street impacts such as speeding and
excess traffic on local streets, efficient and safe traffic movement around schools, efficient transit
services, and efficient goods movement systems.
It is critical for the circulation system to support the Land Element of the General Plan, while not
promoting increasing regional through traffic. Also, the need for improving the street system via
widening and intersection improvements must be balanced against other goals in the city such as the
livability of adjacent properties. Other improvements besides simply widening roadways must be
included in all circulation planning. This includes traffic signal system improvements to maximize the
efficiency of the arterial roadway system. Figure 13 illustrates the City of Corona roadway functional
classification system, and Figures 14a, 14b, and 14c depict the standard cross section for each street
classification. As shown, the functional classification system includes five types of boulevard/arterial

INTERCITY AND REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION
CONTEXT
The City of Corona is greatly influenced by the regional transportation system and by the travel
demand that is generated by adjacent communities. In addition, the residents and visitors to the City
rely upon an efficient intercity and regional transportation system. Increasingly, congestion on the
SR-91 and I-15 freeways causes significant traffic impacts in the City. The freeway congestion results

in significant amounts of regional traffic utilizing City streets for relief from poor freeway service
levels. This impacts residents and businesses by creating local congestion, affecting safety, making
access to adjacent land uses and driveways difficult, and causing delays for residents and visitors
accessing the freeway system.
There are several key initiatives that are proposed to improve regional traffic flow. These include the
State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP), Measure “A” Freeway and Highway
improvements, the Riverside County Community and Environmental Transportation Acceptability
process (CETAP) plan, and the Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee (TUMF). The regional
improvements will help to alleviate local congestion. There are several potential corridors under
consideration for new regional east/west routes. These must be reviewed carefully in conjunction with
local transportation planning.

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MANAGEMENT AND
TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
CONTEXT
Major physical improvements such as widening to add lanes to the regional freeway system and to the
city’s arterial system are often costly, require right-of-way, and may disrupt the quality of life for
adjacent residents and businesses in some cases. Throughout southern California it is increasingly
recognized that it may not be feasible to simply “build our way out” of traffic congestion and impacts.
A multi-modal approach to solving transportation solutions is required. A key element of the
approach is to reduce the number of vehicles using the freeway and roadway systems, and to reduce
the vehicle miles traveled. This may be accomplished by simply eliminating some trips via transit or
carpooling, consolidating other trips and making the trip length shorter.
It is recognized that not everyone can carpool, take a bus, or work close to home. However, there are
many trips that can be modified using various transportation demand management (TDM)
techniques. TDM techniques include incentives to use transit, incentives to form carpools rather than
to drive alone, and making home, work, and shopping closer together to shorten travel distances. In
addition, there are less costly improvements that can be made to the roadway system to more
efficiently use the capacity that is available. Such improvements include better traffic signal operations
to reduce delay by motorists at traffic signals. These “Transportation Systems Management”
techniques help utilize the existing circulation system in the most efficient manner possible, and cost
far less than major physical infrastructure improvement projects.

PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
CONTEXT
Public transportation/transit plays a vital role in the overall circulation system. Public transportation
not only serves those who cannot afford other means of travel, but it also provides alternatives to those
who do not want to drive themselves. Much of the available public transportation is provided by the
Riverside Transit Agency (RTA) via fixed route bus services. Also, Metrolink provides commuter rail
service for the City and the region. The City also provides transit services though the Corona Cruiser,
the local fixed route bus service. Enhancing the availability and efficiency of transit services for
residents and visitors to the City will be vital in the future. The city also has park-and-ride lots that
facilitate the use of regional transit services by allowing residents and visitors to park and use the
adjacent transit service. Another element of transit is demand-responsive service, which operates on as
“as-needed” and “where needed” basis rather than on fixed routes and schedules. Figure 15 illustrates
the fixed route transit services that are operated within in the City.

BICYCLE, PEDESTRIAN, AND HIKING FACILITIES
CONTEXT
Nonmotorized transportation is important for many reasons. Nonmotorized transportation, via
pedestrian activity and bicycles, can enhance the urban environment, reduce motor vehicle emissions,
promote a healthy lifestyle, and reduce automobile trips. In the Sixth Street mixed-use corridor, there
will be an increased emphasis on nonmotorized transportation. In other part of the City, walking and
biking will continue to be important for short distance trips, recreation and school trips. Bicycle
facilities include Class I Bike Paths (completely separated from auto traffic), Class II Bike Lanes
(striped bike lanes on roads), and Class III Bike Routes (designated bike routes noted by signs
alongside roadways but without separate striping). Pedestrian facilities include sidewalks, pedestrian
trails, and multi-purpose trails. Figure 16 illustrates the existing and proposed bicycle and trails
system.

PARKING
CONTEXT
Adequate and convenient parking is important in both residential neighborhoods and also in
commercial and industrial areas. In residential areas, adequate off-street parking will minimize on-
street parking impacts and spillover of parking to areas that impact adjacent land uses. In commercial
areas, parking must be sufficient in terms of number of spaces and convenient so that businesses can
succeed. Conversely, the overbuilding of too much parking in a commercial area can be detrimental
because it uses up too much land, makes development inefficient, and is not attractive. In mixed use
areas, such as the Sixth Street Corridor, reductions in parking supply may be appropriate since the
mixed use nature of the area will encourage the “park once” concept whereby a visitor parks one time
and visits multiple land uses in a single trip without moving the car. City codes will ensure the
provision of adequate parking, and allow mixed use parking solutions where they are appropriate.

TRUCK ROUTES/GOODS MOVEMENT SYSTEMS
CONTEXT
Efficient and safe goods movement is vital for both residents and businesses in Corona. Goods
Movement in the City occurs primarily via trucks. Regional truck movements occur on the freeway
system, and local truck deliveries to and from land uses in Corona occur on the arterial and local
roadway systems. Maintaining efficient and safe goods movement requires the development of a truck
route system for through truck trips, ensuring that roadways are designed to standards to support
truck travel and providing adequate off-street truck parking and loading to make the transfer of goods
efficient and also to avoid unsafe loading and truck parking on city streets. The city has adopted a
truck route system that designates various facilities for through truck movements. On those routes,
trucks over three tons may legally travel even if they do not have a trip origin or destination along that
route. On all other streets, trucks may only travel on them if the truck has an origin or destination at a
land use located along the facility. The truck route system is illustrated in Figure 17.

Infrastructure & Utilities
The following presents the goals and policies for the various public utilities within the City of Corona,
including
! Water Systems
! Sewer/Wastewater Systems
! Storm Drainage
! Solid Waste
! Energy Facilities
! Telecommunication Services
Infrastructure, as it pertains to utilities, is not a mandatory Element, however, it may be included
within Corona’s General Plan as an optional element. California Government Code Section 65303
states: “The General Plan may include any other elements or address and other subjects that, in the
judgment of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county or city.” Once an
Optional Element is adopted, it becomes a component of the General Plan with the same legal status
as one of the mandatory elements.
C
           orona is a growing community that must continue to provide adequate infrastructure and utility
           systems to meet the future needs of businesses and residents. The City is committed to public service
           by ensuring infrastructure utility services are safe, adequate and are available to all users in
existing and newly developing areas.
WATER SYSTEMS
CONTEXT
The Corona Department of Water and Power is responsible for supplying clean water to the City of
Corona. The City presently provides municipal water service to an area of approximately 50 square
miles. This area includes approximately 37.6 square miles within the City’s municipal area, and 35.2
square miles within the City’s Sphere of Influence (SOI) in Riverside County. The City provides
water service to nearly 137,000 people via approximately 36,000 metered service connections.
As of 2002, approximately 55 percent of the City’s water supply was obtained from imported water
(10 percent State Water Project water and 45 percent Colorado River water), and 45 percent comes
from local groundwater production wells. The City’s water system consists of six primary pressure
zones that serve elevations varying from a minimum 430 feet (Zone 1) at Green River to a maximum
of 1510 feet (Zone 6) at South Corona. Pressures to City customers vary from about 40 pounds per
square inch (psi) to over 150 psi.
The City’s total water use during 2002 was just over 13 billion gallons, averaging 35.8 mgd. The
maximum day demand in recent years has been as high as 53 mgd.
Other components of the City water system include
! Three water treatment plants with a total capacity of 26.5 million gallons per day (mgd), one
    desalter with a total capacity of 10 mgd, and fifteen wells from Bedford, Coldwater, and Temescal
City of Corona General Plan                                                                                 151

   Infrastructure & Utilities
      Basins with a total of 8.67 mgd. Local groundwater is extracted by wells from the Temescal Basin,
      Bedford Basin, Coldwater, and one potable well in the Santa Ana Narrows Basin.
  !   Eighteen domestic water booster pump stations (BPSs). These BPS units range in capacity from 50
      gpm to over 7,000 gpm. The power drive includes both electrical motors and natural gas engines.
  !   Seventeen reservoirs ranging in size from 0.5 million gallons (MG) to 6 MG with a total capacity
      of 37.3 MG. The City operates three blending stations at Lester Reservoir, Reservoir R-3, and
      Mangular Reservoir. These stations blend high nitrate (NO4) Temescal Basin groundwater with
      desalter and low nitrate imported water from the Colorado River and northern California.
  !   A recently completed Recycled Water Master Plan that would allow for the provision of 5,220
      acre-feet of recycled water per year. Recycled water would primarily be used for irrigation of
      nonresidential uses including parks, golf courses, freeway landscaping, and schools. The City,
      having secured a $5 million dollar grant and a $20 million low-interest loan to finance the $25
      million project, has set up a demonstration project in Butterfield Park.
  The City’s Water System Master Plan addressed water needs in all areas within the City (37.6 square
  miles), plus 35.2 square miles in Riverside County (the City’s SOI). The plan is designed to serve
  250,000 people within a future municipal area of 71.2 square miles by the year 2020. Based on the
  City’s projected population increase and SOI annexation, the City will require by year 2020 an annual
  water supply of 38 mgd with a peak maximum day supply of 68 mgd. These water supply
  requirements in year 2020 are based on the City providing water for a population of over 175,000
  people with other water agencies providing water for a population of 75,000 people.
  In terms of newly developing areas within the Corona SOI, the City provides municipal water service
  to an area of approximately 35 square miles within the City’s SOI in Riverside County. These areas
  outside the current City limits include Coronita, Green River, El Cerrito, and Temescal Canyon. The
  City also provides service to approximately twenty connections in the Temescal Canyon area south of
  the City boundary. Annexed areas of Murdock and Dos Lagos are to be served by City sewer and
  water.
  Within the West Sphere (the Prado Basin, Coronita, and Foothills areas), domestic water is provided
  by the City of Corona. In the East Sphere, the City of Riverside and the Home Gardens County
  Water District provide water to the Home Gardens area; the Western Municipal Water District
  (WMWD) serves the East Eagle Valley area; the WMWD and City of Corona serve the El Cerrito
  area. Within the South Sphere, the Temescal Canyon area is served by the City of Corona, the
  WMWD, and the Lee Lake Water District. The area south of Dos Lagos is within the SOI of Lee
  Lake Water District. The future City’s easterly SOI service area above 1,000 feet elevation will be
  served by the WMWD.
  More detailed descriptions of Water systems in Corona, as well as historic and projected water use, are
  presented in the Technical Background Report. The following section presents the goals and policies for
  Water service in the City of Corona. The intent of these policies is to provide direction for the Corona
  Department of Water and Power, and other municipal departments in the planning, development and
  administration of water-related facilities. Water provision related issues brought up during the data
  gathering and public processes are incorporated herewith.

SEWER/WASTEWATER SYSTEMS
CONTEXT
The City of Corona’s sewer system currently serves a population of approximately 133,966 people
with plans to serve a future population of 147,400 within the City and SOI. The current Sewer
Master Plan Planning Area encompasses approximately 45 square miles of land area, including areas
within the existing City’s corporate limits and 7.4 square miles of the SOI. The majority of the service
area is residential, and it is projected that residential land use will encompass 57 percent of the
ultimate development of the City for sewer service purposes. The Corona Department of Water and
Power is updating the Sewer Master Plan in order to include all portions of the City south of
Cleveland, in addition to some SOI areas.
The existing collection system for the City of Corona includes approximately 332 miles of gravity and
force flow sewer mains, varying in size from 6 to 42 inches in diameter and accessed via 7,056
maintenance manholes. There are currently eleven sewer lift stations operated by the City, most of
which are small stations lifting only local flows. There are currently no City-maintained main lines
located outside the City limits, except for those that serve the Green River area at the extreme
northwestern corner of the service area.
All sewer flows generated within the City are conveyed by City facilities to one of the three sewer
treatment plants. The City of Corona currently serves the Green River area, west of the City and
north of SR-91, with the majority of this flow being lifted by the Ahmanson Lift Station into the
SARI line just north of Golden Ridge Drive. The City is considering diverting this flow to Wastewater
Treatment Plant No. 1 by constructing a new lift station at Golden Ridge Drive and a force main to
Prado Road.
Based on information from the Sewer Master Plan dated October 1998, portions of the existing
collection system are in need of improvement or replacement. The City’s pumping system has also
been reviewed and several deficiencies identified. The City operates twelve lift stations. Many of these
stations are in need of upgrading and improvement, some having exceeded their life expectancies.
Others are aged and in poor condition, with a majority of them needing to be upgraded to meet
City of Corona General Plan                                                                                   155

current electrical and building codes. It is anticipated that the City should replace three of the smaller
stations in the near future, due to the deficient nature of the plants.
The City currently operates three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). WWTP No. 1 and WWTP
No. 2 serve the majority of the City’s treatment needs. WWTP No. 3 services current and proposed
development areas in the southern portion of the City. WWTP No. 3 currently serves a small part of
the unincorporated area of El Cerrito. In addition, WWTP No. 3 also serves the Eagle Glen and the
Dos Lagos developments.
WWTP No. 1, which has two components (1A and 1B) is located near the northwestern border of the
City and is designed to serve flows from the east, south, and western portion of the City. WWTP No.
1 is currently used to treat flows from a service area of 14,000 acres within the City boundary.
WWTP No. 1A has a secondary treatment capacity of 5.5 mgd and WWTP No. 1B has a tertiary
capacity of 6 mgd. In 2002, WWTP No. 1 handled flows of 8.633 mgd.
WWTP No. 2 is located near SR-91 and Grand Boulevard. This plant handles flows from the south
and east portions of the City, a service area of approximately 8,300 acres. WWTP No. 2 handled
flows of 2.067 mgd in 2002 and has a capacity of 3.0 mgd of secondary effluent.
A third treatment plant, WWTP No. 3, was recently constructed in the southeastern portion of the
City. This plant handles some of the annexation areas in the southern portion of the City. The plant
has a current capacity of 1.0 mgd; however, it was designed such that capacity could be expanded to
3.0 mgd. WWTP No. 3 is the only treatment plant with planned expansion at this time.
Given the combined capacity of WWTPs No. 1, 2, and 3, enough wastewater capacity exists for the
entire City and SOI at buildout. In addition, the Corona Department of Water and Power has begun
the process to obtain approval to rerate WWTP No. 1 and No. 2 through the State Water Resources
Control Board. Rerating would allow the WWTPs to treat and release more effluent without
renovating the plants.
With respect to other areas outside the City limits but within the SOI: Within the East Sphere, the
Home Gardens Sanitary District serves the Home Gardens area. The El Cerrito area relies on septic
systems, and the East Eagle Valley is not served by sanitary sewer systems. Within the West Sphere,
the Foothills area is not served by sanitary sewer systems, nor is the majority of the Prado Basin area,
although a small portion of the area is served by the City of Corona. The Coronita area is served by
septic systems. Within the South Sphere, the Lee Lake Water District serves the Temescal Canyon
region.
More detailed descriptions of wastewater systems in Corona are presented in the Technical Background
Report. The following section presents the goals and policies for wastewater service in the City of
Corona. The intent of these policies is to provide direction for the Corona Department of Power and
Water, and other municipal departments in the planning, development and administration of sewer-
related facilities. Wastewater related issues brought up during the data gathering and public processes
are incorporated herewith.

STORM DRAINAGE
CONTEXT
The watershed characteristics of the City of Corona vary significantly from the alluvial fan at the
north end adjacent to the Prado Dam Basin to abruptly rising terrain of the Santa Ana Mountains on
the City’s southwest. The general drainage pattern is in a northwesterly direction towards the Santa
Ana River. Substantial flows reach the mouths of the canyons and then spread out onto the alluvial
fan formed by several watercourses draining the mountains. The alluvial fan runs northerly at an
average grade of 4 percent from an elevation of approximately 1,500 feet at the toe of the mountains
to an elevation of approximately 600 feet along Temescal Wash. Several major watercourses provide
some protection against major flood flows from runoff generated in watersheds south of the City.
These watersheds are as follows:
! Temescal Canyon Wash. The Temescal Canyon Wash is the major watercourse and flows
    northwesterly through the northern half of the City. Temescal Wash joins the Santa Ana River at
    the site of Prado Dam, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers flood-control reservoir. This reservoir is
    located at the northwestern City limits. Temescal Wash/Channel presently exists in various states
    of improvement from Magnolia Avenue through the northeastern part of the City, and terminates
    at Prado Flood Control Basin. The improvement varies from concrete sections in the northeast
    part of the City to a natural channel from Lincoln Avenue to the Prado Flood Control Basin.
    Based on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) of November 20, 1996, there are several
    deficiencies along the Temescal Wash, a major one being located at the Cajalco Road crossing.
! Oak Street Channel. This channel traverses generally from the Oak Street Debris Basin northerly
    across SR-91, and terminates at the Temescal Wash. The channel is generally open rectangular
    concrete-lined section with various culvert crossings at the major streets.

                                                                                      Infrastructure & Utilities
!   Main Street Channel. This channel traverses through the southeasterly corner of the City and
    consists of a concrete-lined rectangular channel at the upstream end of the channel. It joins the
    Temescal Wash at Sixth Street.
!   Arlington Channel. This channel consists of vertical wall concrete-lined section that flows westerly
    through the Home Gardens area and joins Temescal Wash near the AT&SF Railroad, north of
    SR-91.
!   South Norco Storm Drain. This drain runs from southwest of Norco through Parkridge Avenue at
    City limit and terminates at Temescal Wash.
!   North Norco Storm Drain. This drain enters City limits at River Road and terminates at Temescal
    Wash.
!   Other Facilities include the Main, Oak, Mabey basins, the Line 36 storm drain, the Line 7-A
    storm drain, and the Compton Avenue storm drain. In addition, the drainage facilities in the newly
    annexed Eagle Glen area also adequately meet the design requirements of the County and the City.
    The smaller drainage facilities that drain into these major channels are the general responsibility of
    the City, which oversees their implementation, operation, and maintenance.
The City of Corona uses 10-year and 100-year design storms to determine the peak runoff quantities
in analyzing existing storm drain facilities and sizing the potential improvements. To determine the
most deficient facilities or those of with highest priorities for improvement, the City utilizes a 2-year
design storm standard.
The City’s Drainage Master Plan identifies two related issues—periodic street flooding and occasional
large infiltration/inflow “spikes” in the City’s sewer system which may be partially rectified by
enhanced maintenance, but are mostly the result of deficient storm drain links or
damaged/deteriorated sewer lines. Specific projects to define and rectify these problems are identified
in the Sewer Master Plan and the Infiltration/Inflow Evaluation (Boyle 1998) and the Drainage
Master Plan (Boyle 1999).
Based on the hydraulic analysis conducted as a part of the City’s Drainage Master Plan dated
December 1999, it was determined that 30 percent of the facilities, including the combination
capacities of streets and existing drainage facilities, were insufficient to convey the runoff for the 10-
year or 100-year storm event events. Of the existing drainage facilities, 36 percent were determined to
be inadequate for 10-year or 100-year storm events.
The 2-year hydraulic analysis found that 14 percent of the analyzed streets and existing drainage
facilities were insufficient to convey runoff for the 2-year design storm and was therefore determined
deficient. The significantly deficient areas include
! Sixth Street and Radio Road
! Sixth Street and Rimpau Avenue
! Magnolia Avenue and Sherborn Street
! Railroad Street and N. Sherman Avenue
! Railroad Street and Buena Vista Avenue
! Joy Street and Harrison Street
! Joy Street and W. Grand Boulevard
! Main Street and Harrison Street

In the unincorporated parts of the County, the Riverside County Flood Control and Water
Conservation District (Flood Control District) maintains all storm drain inlets and pipes 36 inches or
greater in diameter. The Riverside County Transportation Department maintains all inlets and pipes
less than 36 inches in diameter. In the West Sphere, the Flood Control District and County
Transportation Department serve the Prado Basin, Coronita, and Foothill areas. In the East Sphere,
the Flood Control District and County Transportation Department serve the Home Gardens, East
Eagle Valley, and El Cerrito areas. In the South Sphere, the Flood Control District and County
Transportation Department serve the Temescal Canyon area.
The City’s objective is for all existing and proposed storm drain systems to meet the minimum 10-
year frequency storm event. For arterial streets, the City has adopted criteria to keep one lane open for
the 10-year frequency storm event. For the 100-year storm event, the maximum street flow depth shall
not exceed the street right-of-way. Ponding is not allowed at major arterial intersections during 10
year flooding events. For collector streets, the depth of flow for 2- and 10-year storm runoff shall be
maintained below the top of curb. The adopted criterion for collector streets is also that the 100-year
storm runoff will be maintained in the street right-of-way.

Report. The following section presents the goals and policies for stormwater management in the City

SOLID WASTE
CONTEXT
Waste Management, Inc. (WMI) is contracted by the City of Corona and Riverside County as the
sole hauler of solid waste and provider of recycling services in the City and SOI. Solid waste service
within the City is coordinated through the City’s Public Works Department and is coordinated by the
County Environmental Health Department in the unincorporated areas of the County.
WMI provides refuse collection to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. The company is
responsible for 99,930 residential pickups in the City each week; 2,962 commercial customers
typically with pick up service twice a week; and 286 industrial customers with roll off containers in the
City. The monthly average for all users in the City and SOI is 11,210 tons of trash, 1,768 tons of
green waste, and 1,040 tons of recycled materials.
WMI transports all solid waste from the City and the SOI areas to the El Sobrante landfill. Although
owned by WMI, the landfill was constructed as a partnership between Riverside County and WMI in
1986. The El Sobrante Landfill, located at 10910 Dawson Canyon in Corona, is a Class III landfill
that accepts regular municipal solid waste. The site is permitted to accept 10,000 tons of solid waste
per day from the Counties of Riverside, Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, and San Bernardino.
Currently, the landfill accepts approximately 7,500 tons per day on the weekdays and approximately
3,000 tons on weekends. The landfill was expanded in August 2001 and now has a lifespan of 36
years. The landfill has 495 acres of permitted area for disposal activities with more than 165 million
cubic yards of remaining capacity.
The following section presents the goals and policies for solid waste management in the City of
Corona.

ENERGY
CONTEXT
Southern California Gas Company (SCG) provides natural gas service in City of Corona and the SOI.
Currently, SCG maintains transmission and distribution lines throughout the City. Most lines operate
at a medium pressure of approximately 30 to 60 pounds per square inch (psi), except for those located
in the industrial areas and require higher pressures.
Most of the major natural gas transmission pipelines in Riverside County are operated by SCG,
including three major pipelines extending east to west through Riverside County. These main
pipelines follow I-10 through most of the County. Dual pipelines branch off these main lines near
Desert Center. Near the I-215 interchange, one pipelines veers to the south and extends west across
the County following SR-91.
Near Desert Center, an additional natural gas transmission line extends northward from the main
pipelines following the I-10 corridor. This pipeline follows Kaiser Road before terminating near Eagle
Mountain. A separate pipeline operated by Imperial Irrigation District extends north from MWD’s
Eagle Mountain water pumping plant and terminates near the intersection of SR-62 and SR-177.
As development occurs, SCG will extend its service to accommodate the development and supply the
necessary gas lines.
Electric service in the City and the SOI is provided by Southern California Edison Company (SCE).
SCE uses the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, the Big Creek hydroelectric system, and the
Mohave Generating Station for power generation used in Corona.
As of 2002, SCE operated three substations serving the area, and have indicated that a fourth may be
needed as development increases. Within the City and the SOI, SCE operates three minor substations
that distribute power and has indicated that this infrastructure is in good condition. Power is
distributed to the substations from a Main Bulk Power Station. SCE plans to upgrade the substations
as the demand at each substation increases. Each substation has a capacity of 120 mega volt amps, in
turn one mega volt amp is sufficient to service approximately 200 residential house holds. For
industrial, commercial, and institutional uses, the current capacity is sufficient.
Major electricity transmission lines in Riverside County are operated by Southern California Edison
and Imperial Irrigation District. Major electricity transmission lines are those that carry a minimum of
220 kilovolts (kV) of power. SCE operates a 500 kV transmission line extending east-west through
most of Riverside County. The 500 kV line follows the I-10 corridor from the Arizona border west to
the San Gorgonio pass area, veers south of I-10 towards Perris, and then extends west from Perris into
Orange County. Portions of SCE’s 220 kV transmission lines pass through the northwest corner of
Riverside County.
On April 4, 2001, the City of Corona’s City Council passed Resolution No. 2001-25, which
established a municipally owned electric utility. In August 2001, this electric utility, which is part of
the Corona Department of Power and Water, entered into an agreement with SCE to provide retail
services as an Electric Services Provider (ESP). The electric utility, in the role of ESP, buys and sells
power on behalf of all of the City’s municipal electric accounts and more than fifty businesses within
the City. While the municipal electric utility is capable of providing various utility services, such as

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
CONTEXT
Current telecommunication services in the City of Corona include
! The default local telephone service is SBC. Much of the telephonic infrastructure in Corona is
   owned and maintained by SBC.
! Cable television service provided by Comcast. The City Manager’s Office is responsible for
   administering general franchise requirements for Corona’s cable television service.
! Internet service provided by various providers via dial-up and broadband (DSL and Cable) services.
   Both SBC and Comcast offer high speed internet access services.
! Cellular phone service available through various providers. Cellular phone service companies are
   licensed and monitored by the State of California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The City
   is responsible for oversight and approval authority for the siting of and operation of cellular
   transmission antennas located within the City, but does not exercise control over the provision of
   cellular service.
SBC provides telephone service to the West Sphere (Prado Basin, Coronita, Foothill), the East Sphere
(Home Gardens, East Eagle Valley, El Cerrito), and South Sphere (Temescal Canyon). In the east
sphere, Comcast provides cable service to East Eagle Valley and El Cerrito; there is no cable service in
the Home Gardens area. In the west sphere, Comcast provides cable service to Coronita and Foothill;
there is no cable service in the Prado Basin area. In the south sphere, there is no cable service in
Temescal Canyon.

Parks, Schools, & Libraries
Parks, Schools, and Community Facilities are essential to an urbanizing environment. These facilities
provide the building blocks of neighborhoods and communities and are key to this General Plan. A
challenge to sustaining a high quality of life in Corona is being able to balance the provision of public
lands and facilities in accessible locations while at the same time protecting open spaces and significant
natural resources, and allowing for adverse human impacts. As the City of Corona continues to
urbanize and its remaining agricultural and vacant lands experience development pressures, it is
imperative to identify and dedicate lands for preserved open space, recreational uses, and community
uses before they are lost to other forms of urban development.
California State law does not mandate the preparation of this Element in the General Plan. In 1989,
the City of Corona amended the General Plan to include the optional Parks and Recreation element.
The inclusion of a Parks, Schools, and Libraries element assures that a balance will be made between
the provision of sufficient parks, schools, and library facilities appropriate to the planned-for
residential and business population of the City. The inclusion of this Element also enables a
municipality to mandate a requirement for providing parkland resources as a condition of
development approval as set out in the Quimby Act (66477).
P
          ublic facilities in Corona are an integral component to the high quality of life available in the
          City. Such civic facilities are often referred to as the “building blocks” of community and offer
          social interactions that confirm community identity, allow for relationships to develop between
neighbors, and help in creating a sense of place. The City is committed to continuing to maintain and create
these facilities in a manner that is consistent with the demographic makeup of the diverse community
residing in Corona. Rapid growth in Corona is a concern of existing residents, and one component of this
concern is the impacts and strain that such growth will put on existing community facilities and the demand
created for new ones. Corona’s future development shall occur in a manner such that community facilities
are constructed at a pace to meet the needs of all Corona’s residents and to maintain a high level of service.
PARKS AND RECREATION
CONTEXT
The City of Corona Department of Parks and Community Services is charged with providing
community services and recreational opportunities. This Department is responsible for several
divisions, including the Park Maintenance and Park Development Divisions and is responsible for the
planning, development, and maintenance of the City’s parks and recreation facilities. This General
Plan Element will serve as a guiding document for any implementation documents prepared by the
Department of Parks and Community Services.
Based on January 1, 2002 Planning Department estimates, Corona’s population at that time was
133,966 residents. The existing City of Corona General Plan established a goal of 3.5 acres of
parkland per one thousand residents. This General Plan maintains that ratio as the parkland standard
in Corona. The current stock of 415 acres equals a parkland ratio of 3.1 acres per one thousand
residents, or approximately 54 acres less than that required to fulfill the 3.5 acres/thousand goal.
City of Corona General Plan                                                                                 169

 Parks, Schools, & Libraries
As stated above, the City of Corona Department of Parks and Community Services currently
maintains approximately 317 acres of public parks and 68 acres of undeveloped parklands, which
include the lands contained within the Corona Municipal Airport, for a total of 415 acres. A
comprehensive listing and description of these facilities is presented in the Corona General Plan
Update Technical Background Report.
Corona’s parklands include a variety of park types and uses. Parks range in size from mini-parks such
as Contreras Park (0.3 acre) to the 64-acre Butterfield Park, a major park. Corona’s park types and
uses are described below:
! Mini parks, special park facilities of less than 2 acres, often consist of vista points, greenbelts, rest
    areas, or picnic areas. Currently, four parks are categorized as mini parks.
! Neighborhood parks typically include passive or active recreational activity areas with fields,
    courts, and/or picnic areas. These parks vary in size from about 5 to 20 acres and can serve a
    population up to 5,000. The majority of Corona’s parklands are neighborhood parks.
! Community parks are at least 20 to 50 acres, serve several neighborhoods, and can include both
    passive and active recreation facilities. Community Parks in Corona include Santana Regional
    Park, Promenade Community Park, and Citrus Community Park.
! Major parks, 50 to 100 acres, are also included in the City’s classification of parklands. Major
    parks often include active recreation facilities and serve a greater proportion of the population than
    community parks. Butterfield Park is the City’s only major park.
In addition to these park types, school recreation facilities are often open to the public during non-
school hours. Typically elementary schools provide adjunct recreation opportunities to surrounding
neighborhoods, while junior highs schools and high schools provide adjunct community-wide
facilities. Formal agreements for general public use of school facilities have been entered into by the
City of Corona and the Corona Norco Unified School District. Under these agreements, two
swimming pools are made available to the public. For its summer aquatics programs, the City uses the
Corona High School and Centennial High School pools.
In addition to recreational opportunities within the City, Corona’s location near the convergence of
Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties allows residents access to regional facilities in the
all three counties. Corona residents have access to the adjacent Cleveland National Forest, which
forms the southern boundary of the City, and the Prado Basin, to the northeast of the City. Both the
Prado Basin, with recreational areas leased by the Counties of Riverside and San Bernardino, and
Cleveland National Forest provide regional recreation opportunities for Corona residents.
Federal, State, and County agencies also provide regional park and recreation facilities. The Chino
Hills State Park and Featherly Park (a private facility) in Orange County and Prado Regional Park in
Riverside County provide nearby regional facilities for Corona residents. The Santa Ana River
Wildlife Area, located in Riverside County, also presents recreational opportunities such as hiking and
equestrian trails. The Santa Ana River Trail connects Corona to Yorba Linda by bicycle trail.
Also, the City of Corona owns portions of Wardlow Wash, located directly south of the westernmost
area of Corona. Other portions are under private ownership. The wash area is reserved from
development through a landscape maintenance district. The wash has future potential as significant
hiking/natural area and as access point to the Cleveland National Forest. Other washes and channels
identified as potential connections to parks and recreation facilities and/or opportunities for a
hiking/biking network include Wardlow Wash, Oak Street Channel, Main Street Channel, and

Temescal Wash. Debris basins located at Main Street, Oak Street, and the National Forest boundary
present opportunities for passive recreational areas.
As of early 2003, several park facilities were under development in the City of Corona. These include
! Buena Vista Park—Construction plans are finalized for the first phase of Buena Vista Park in
   South Corona. Construction is scheduled to begin in late winter 2003.
! Citrus Community Park—The first of several phases of construction of Citrus Park in South
   Corona is complete. This 20 acre park includes turf, a soccer field and open turf, a large
   playground with benches, a paved parking lot, concrete walkways with lights and picnic tables.
! Auburndale Recreation Center—The City recently purchased approximately two acres of property
   on Auburndale Street. Repairs are currently taking place. The facility is scheduled to be available
   for use in the fall.
Other recreational resources within the City include three community centers, several multipurpose
recreation centers, a senior center, several tennis courts, two skate parks, a gymnasium facility, and an
auditorium within the City Hall Civic Center, originally the Corona High School campus. The City
does not own or maintain any municipal golf courses. Finally, Heritage Park is a 4.5-acre special use
park that contains gardens, a museum, a visitor center, and an art center showcasing Corona’s
agricultural history. The City acquired the park and ownership was transferred to the Corona Heritage
Foundation, a nonprofit foundation, which now operates and maintains the park.
Information collected by the Department of Parks and Community Services and public comments
from a community survey, interviews and public workshops conducted for the General Plan Update
show a high demand for park facilities. All playing fields are used throughout the year by various
youth and adult groups, for both recreational and competitive sports leagues. Park buildings are
regularly used to maximum capacity during the year throughout the day and evening for cultural and
recreation programs, and for community meetings.
Several park-related issues were brought up during the data gathering and public processes associated
with the General Plan Update. The goals and policies presented here attempt to address these issues,
which are detailed in the Technical Background Report. The following section presents the goals and
policies for Parks and Recreation facilities in the City of Corona. The intent of these policies is to
provide direction for the Department of Parks and Community Services and other municipal
departments in the planning, development and administration of parkland, recreational facilities, and
programs for residents and visitors of Corona.

SCHOOLS
CONTEXT
The City of Corona is served primarily by the Corona-Norco Unified School District, with exception
of the northeastern portion of the City, which is served by the Alvord Unified School District. The
Corona-Norco Unified School District encompasses Corona, Norco, and several unincorporated areas
of Riverside County and is headquartered in Norco. As of 2003, eighteen elementary schools (grades
K–6), four intermediate schools (grades 7–8), four high schools (grades 9–12), and two alternative
high schools (grades 9–12) are locate d with the Corona city limits and provide educational services to
Corona residents. Additionally, six elementary schools, one intermediate school, and one high school
are located in the City of Norco, and also serve some Corona residents. The Corona-Norco Unified
School District and Alvord Unified School District serve the unincorporated areas surrounding the
City of Corona. The Alvord Unified School District serves the eastern portion of the City of Corona,
and the western portion of the City of Riverside. Specifically, SOI areas that are served by the Corona-
Norco Unified School District include the West Sphere (Prado Basin and Coronita), parts of the East
Sphere (El Cerrito), and South Sphere areas. School service to the eastern portion of Home Gardens
and the remainder of the East Sphere area is provided by the Alvord Unified School District. The
Promenade Elementary School is the only school located in the City within the Alvord Unified School
District. A comprehensive listing, description, and enrollment data for these facilities is presented in
the Corona General Plan Update Technical Background Report.
Student generation rates in the Corona-Norco Unified School District are 0.4598 per dwelling unit
for K–6 grades, 0.4117 per dwelling unit for 7–8 grades, and 0.4225 per dwelling unit for 9–12
grades.

As of 2002, planned improvements for the Corona-Norco Unified School District include classroom
additions and facility improvements to Adams Elementary, Chavez Elementary, Jefferson Elementary,
Corona High, and Santiago High Schools. Additionally, the District is planning five new schools for
the City of Corona.
Planned improvements in the SOI include two new elementary schools in the South Sphere. It is
anticipated that Temescal Canyon Elementary School, located at 22950 Claystone Avenue, will be
open in July 2003. Another new elementary school, Sycamore Creek Elementary School, will be
located on Temescal Canyon Road and is anticipated to be open in July 2006. The elementary school
site located in the East Sphere at 7610 El Cerrito Road will be converted to the El Cerrito Middle
School.
Several school-related issues were brought up during the data gathering and public processes associated
with the General Plan Update. The goals and policies presented here attempt to address these issues,
which are detailed in the Technical Background Report. The following section presents the goals and
policies for Educational facilities in the City of Corona.

LIBRARIES
CONTEXT
Libraries are a key component of network of facilities that support the civic and social needs of a
community. One public library is located in Corona: the 62,000-square-foot Corona Public Library at
605 S. Main Street. As of 2002, the library had a collection of 144,563 items, which includes book
volumes and other media.
The library has a variety of meeting rooms that can hold as many as 200 people. Other smaller
meeting rooms hold 30 to 40 people. The rooms have audio-visual and computer amenities available
and provide a central meeting space for local community groups and organizations.
While library services for the SOI, in theory, are provided for by Riverside County, none of its
facilities is located in proximity to the SOI and residents use the City of Corona Library. As of May
2003, a new library was under construction in the unincorporated area of El Cerrito, within the East
Sphere. This library will be a joint facility situated on the campus of El Cerrito middle school, and run
by Riverside County. The library will serve the school during school days, and the community at large
for approximately 30 hours per week during non school hours. In addition, the County has plans for
an 11,000-square-foot library to be situated in Home Gardens, at the corner of Neece and Magnolia.
Several library-related issues were brought up during the data gathering and public processes
associated with the General Plan Update. The goals and policies presented here attempt to address
these issues, which are detailed in the Technical Background Report. The following section presents the
goals and policies for library facilities in the City of Corona.

Police & Fire Services
This section presents goals, and policies pertaining to programming police and fire personnel and
facilities within the City of Corona. California State Law does not mandate the preparation of an
Element that specifically addresses police and fire services. The law does, however, stipulate that an
Emergency Preparedness Plan be included in the mandated Safety Element. Consequently, police
protection and fire prevention services represents an “optional element,” which once adopted by the
City Council, becomes an integral component of the General Plan and carries the same legal weight as
the mandatory Elements.
C
            orona is committed to providing effective and caring public safety services to the resident, business,
            and visitor population that effectively addresses quality of life issues, fear of crime and crime
            reduction. The police and fire departments will further a genuine sense of security for residents,
businesses, and visitors through our quick response to problems and their ability to resolve difficult issues.
The Police and Fire departments will honor the community's diversity by serving all people fairly and
equitably. The departments will effectively train personnel and suitably equip them to meet the many needs
of the city as the city grows and reshapes itself.
POLICE & FIRE SERVICES
CONTEXT
+ Police Services
The Corona Police Department (CPD) provides local police services within the City of Corona.
Located at 849 W. 6th Street, adjacent to City Hall, the CPD provides services in crime investigation,
offender apprehension, community awareness programs, and other services such as traffic control. The
CPD conducts ongoing assessments to determine future funding, staffing, and equipment needs.
As of July 1, 2002, the number of sworn-in officers was 157; with City Council approved increases
the total number of officers is expected to be 163 as of March 2003. As of July 1, 2002, the level of
service was 1.2 officers per one thousand City residents. This figure is a broad indicator of available
service and considered in concert with other indicators including
! Response time
! Volume of calls for service
! Number of officers available at any given time
! Number of violent crimes
! Number of Part 1 crimes (Part 1 crime includes robbery, assault, residential and nonresidential
    burglary, vehicle burglary, vehicle larceny, vehicle theft, grand theft automobile, and arson)
The CPD is divided into three Divisions: Field Services, Investigation Services, and Support Services.
The Animal Control Unit is located at a separate facility at 608 Harrington, in Corona.
In addition to the main police station, three other police facilities that serve designated geographical
patrol districts are located in the City of Corona. These are as follows:
City of Corona General Plan                                                                                    185

 Police & Fire Services
!   Special Enforcement Bureau (in Zone 1) at 515 South Corona Mall. Includes the Traffic Bureau,
    Youth Services, and a domestic violence unit. Patrol officers also use the office to follow-up with
    phone calls and write reports.
!   Zone 2 Office at 340 N. McKinley. Provides a satellite office for field officers and a volunteer staff
    for children identification fingerprinting.
!   Zone 3 Office at 1451 Rimpau. Not staffed; provides office space and a child friendly interview
    room for child and social services, trauma intervention, and serves as a satellite office for field
    officers.
!   A Narcotics/Vice Investigation Facility is also included within City limits and is located at a
    confidential site.
The City of Corona is constructing the Temescal Public Safety Facility. The new facility is located at
3777 Bedford Canyon Road. The Corona Fire and Police Departments will jointly occupy the facility,
which is located near Eagle Glen. The 16,200-square-foot facility will include living quarters, office
facilities, and apparatus garage for the City’s seventh fire station. The CPD anticipates staffing their
offices at the facility with approximately 15 personnel. Occupancy is anticipated in September 2003.
A comprehensive listing and description of these facilities is presented in the Corona General Plan
Update Technical Background Report.
Maintaining the highest possible standard for response times is a key concern for the CPD. Factors
such as growth, vehicle location, distance, call load, and staffing have increased response times.
Additionally, population growth has occurred in areas that are located further from police services and
in areas that previously did not require many police services (e.g., South Corona). The new Temescal
Public Safety Facility, described above, should reduce response times in newly developed areas.
The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department serves areas outside the City limits and within the SOI. In
the South Sphere, the Temescal Canyon area is served by the Lake Elsinore station, located at 333
Limited Avenue in Lake Elsinore. In the West Sphere, the Jurupa Valley Station, located at 7477
Mission Boulevard in Riverside, serves the Prado Basin, Foothill, and Coronita areas. In the East
Sphere, the Jurupa Valley Station serves the El Cerrito, Eagle Valley East, and Home Gardens areas.
+ Fire Services
The City of Corona Fire Department provides fire protection, prevention, and emergency medical
services utilizing six fire stations in the City, with a seventh scheduled to open in January 2004. A
comprehensive listing and description of these facilities is presented in the Corona General Plan
Update Technical Background Report. Each station serves a specific area of the City. Response district
boundaries are established by performing a network analysis of routes between existing station
locations and subsequent identification of midpoints. However, this does not preclude the stations
from assisting one another. The City of Corona currently employs 120 people in fire services: 93
employees throughout the area’s six fire stations and 27 at its headquarters located in the Civic Center,
and other strategic facilities for additional fire services support. Twelve additional emergency response
personnel will be employed at the seventh station.
The Fire Department and a local, private ambulance service, American Medical Response, provide
emergency medical service. Each fire engine is staffed with a licensed paramedic and three EMTs. The
transport ambulance is staffed with a licensed paramedic and an EMT. If needed, secondary response
can be provided by other engine companies in the surrounding area, according to standard response
procedures as outlined by the Fire Department.

  The City of Corona Fire Department, Riverside County Fire Department, and the California
  Department of Forestry all provide service to areas outside the City limits but within the SOI,
  depending on the location of a fire. The County Fire Department is part of a mutual aid program
  with the City of Corona. Three Riverside County fire stations are located in or near Corona. These
  stations include Station No. 14, located at 1511 Hamner Avenue in Norco; Station No. 13, located at
  3770 Blair Street in Corona; and Station No. 15, located at 20320 Temescal Canyon Road in
  Corona. In the East Sphere, Station No. 13 serves the Home Gardens and East Eagle Valley areas. In
  the West Sphere Station No. 14 serves the Prado Basin, Coronita, and Foothill areas. In the South
  Sphere Station No. 15, serves the Temescal Canyon and El Cerrito areas. Also, The California
  Department of Forestry (CDF) has a Riverside Unit with several stations near Corona.
  The following section presents the goals and policies for Police and fire services in the City of Corona.
  The intent of these policies is to provide direction for the Police and Fire departments, and other
  municipal departments in the planning, development and administration of public safety facilities.
  Public safety related issues brought up during the data gathering and public processes are incorporated
  herewith.

Environmental Resources
Environmental Resources
The primary objective of the Environmental Resources Element is to provide direction regarding the
conservation and development of natural resources. This Element addresses the following resources:
! Hydrological Resources
! Biological Resources
! Agricultural and Mineral Resources
! Air Quality
! Visual Resources
The wise use and conservation of natural resources to meet the needs of the community, both today
and in the future, is a commitment to sustainable development. Commitment to conservation secures
ongoing availability of finite resources, such as an ample supply of safe water, uncontaminated soils,
available energy resources, and aesthetic viewsheds. This assurance contributes substantially to the
physical and psychological health and well-being of the community and strengthens the vitality of the
local and regional economic base.
California State law requires the preparation of two Elements that address a city’s or county’s
environmental resources: the Conservation and Open Space Elements.
Section 65302(d) of the California Government Code specifies:
           A Conservation Element for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources,
           including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries,
           wildlife, mineral, and other natural resources. That portion of the Conservation Element including
           waters shall be developed in coordination with any countywide water agency and with all district
           and city agencies which have developed, serves, controlled, or conserved water or any purpose for
           the county or city for which the plan is prepared.
This Environmental Resources Element provides an inventory of natural resources and a series of
policies and programs deemed necessary to utilize and protect those resources in a substantial manner.
Policies and programs address the planning and management of natural resources in a site specific
manner as well as on a more comprehensive an inclusive basis such as watersheds where entire natural
systems from which resources are generated.
R
          ecognizing the unique natural resources located within and surrounding the City of Corona, the
          city is committed to enhancing, maintaining, and protecting those resources. Corona will be a
          vibrant city in which natural habitats are maintained and available as an educational and visual
amenity for its citizens and for the sake of the natural environment. Consumable natural resources, such as
water resources and mineral resources, will be maintained and used in a manner that balances environment
impacts and the needs of the community.
HYDROLOGICAL RESOURCES
CONTEXT
This section addresses surface water and groundwater resources in the City of Corona and Sphere of
Influence. The City of Corona and SOI areas are located within the central portion of the Santa Ana
Watershed and its SOI overlays the Arlington, Temescal, Chino, Bedford, Lee Lake, Coldwater, and
City of Corona General Plan                                                                                      193

 Environmental Resources
Santa Ana Narrows Basins. Four washes run north to south through the City, mostly in concrete
channels.
+ Surface Water
The watercourses that flow through and collect runoff from the City of Corona are tributaries to the
Prado Flood Control Basin and ultimately, the Santa Ana River. Flowing over 100 miles from the San
Bernardino Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, the Santa Ana River traverses portions of San
Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange Counties and, at its nearest point to the City, the Prado Flood
Control Basin. The Prado Basin and Santa Ana River are the “receiving waters” of Corona’s urban,
industrial, and agricultural runoff. The River provides water for recreation and for aquatic and wildlife
habitat. River flows are a significant source of groundwater recharge in the lower basin, which
provides domestic supplies for more than two million people. These flows account for about 70
percent of the total recharge.
Temescal Creek is an intermittent stream fed by a minimum of fifty ephemeral streams that emanate
from the Santa Ana Mountains and the Gavilan Hills. It is the principal drainage course within the
Temescal Valley, traversing the eastern portion of the south end of the City. The creek serves as the
primary drainage for a 164 square mile area of the Santa Ana River Basin, which includes a majority of
the Lake Mathews area. Spanning a length of approximately 28 miles, from Lake Elsinore to the Santa
Ana River, Temescal Creek generally meanders through Temescal Canyon as a broad unimproved
bank with a gradual westward migration.
+ Washes
The Temescal Wash intersects Temescal Creek in north Corona at about Lincoln Avenue and Rincon
Street. This wash—the most significant of these watercourses—flows northwesterly though the
northern half of the City. The Temescal Wash joins the Santa Ana River at the site of Prado Dam,
which is located at the northwestern end of the City’s corporate limits.
The Bedford Canyon Wash originates in steep terrain near the eastern face of Bedford Peak and drains
a total subwatershed area of 4,480 acres before joining Temescal Wash in south Corona.
The Joseph Canyon wash drains an approximately 1,536-acre subwatershed that lies between the
Main Street Canyon and Bedford Canyon watercourses. The portion of the wash that runs through
the City is in a concrete channel.
The Main Street Wash is a reinforced concrete channel designed to carry 100-year storm run-off and
includes a debris basin at it upstream limit (south of Upper Drive).
Mabey Canyon Wash intersects Temescal Creek in north Corona at about Lincoln and Rincon. It
collects run-off from the mountains in the Cleveland National Forest and is channelized in concrete in
most areas of the City.
+ Groundwater
Many reaches of the Santa Ana River Basin serve as recharge areas for groundwater aquifers.
Downstream of the City, recharge basins provide groundwater replenishment for a large portion of
Orange County’s groundwater resources. The City of Corona and other water purveyors have the
right to use all surface and ground water supplies originating above Prado Dam. Currently, the City

   receives approximately 45 percent of its total water production from local groundwater. The City can
   extract and utilize groundwater from the Bedford, Temescal, Coldwater, and Santa Ana Narrows
   Basins. The City does not utilize groundwater from Lee Lake, Arlington Basin, or Chino Basin.
   + Basins
   The Temescal groundwater basin encompasses an area of approximately 26 square miles bounded by
   the SAR, La Sierra Hills, El Sobrante Hills, and the Santa Ana Mountains. This basin is the major
   groundwater supply source for the City, and the City has fifteen wells in this basin.
   The Bedford Basin in located south of Temescal Basin in Temescal Canyon between the Santa Ana
   Mountains and the El Sobrante Hills. The basin covers an area of approximately 10 square miles with
   an alluvium depth ranging from 30 to 200 feet. The City operates one well in this basin.
   The Coldwater Basin is located southwest of the Bedford Basin and the Temescal Wash. The basin
   encompasses an area of approximately 2.6 square miles and lays at the most southwest corner of the
   City’s SOI adjacent to the County line, the Santa Ana Mountains to the west and the El Sobrante
   Hills to the east. The City of Corona currently operates three wells in this basin. The Coldwater Basin
   has the highest water quality, with low TDS and low nitrate concentrations, of the basins discussed
   here.
   The Santa Ana Narrows Basin, bisected by the Santa Ana River, lies south of the Chino Basin and
   west of the Temescal Basin. The water from this basin contains high TDS and nitrate levels and is
   used for landscape irrigation. It has been shut down due to high operation and maintenance expenses.
   The Lee Lake Basin lies within the southwestern portion of the City’s SOI, southeast of the Bedford
   Basin. It encompasses an area of approximately 7 square miles. The water quality of the basin is
   typically moderate to high in TDS and nitrates. Water from this basin is used for nondomestic
   purposes. The City has no wells in this basin and does not plan to construct any in the future.
   The northeast portion of the City overlies a portion of the Arlington Basin. The quality of the basin
   water is generally unsuitable for domestic purposes. The City does not currently have any wells in this
   basin.
   The upstream flood plain of Prado Dam, within the City’s SOI, overlies the Chino Basin, which is a
   major groundwater resource. The basin encompasses an area of 230 square miles in southwestern San
   Bernardino County, southeastern Los Angeles County, and northwestern Riverside County. The basin
   is filled with younger alluvium ranging in depth from 20 to 150 feet in thickness and older alluvium
   ranging in depth from 600 to 700 feet. Over the years, the basin aquifers have degraded due to
   agricultural activities causing high nitrates and other pollutants to percolate into the basin’s
   groundwater. The major Riverside County extractor in the basin is the City of Norco. It is not
   anticipated that the City of Corona will acquire rights to extract groundwater from the basin.
   Comprehensive descriptions and maps of hydrologic resources in Corona are available in the Corona
   General Plan Update Technical Background Report. The following section presents the goals and
   policies related to these resources in the City of Corona and the SOI.

BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
CONTEXT
This section addresses biological resources in the City of Corona and Sphere of Influence. Parts of the
planning area contain significant biological resources, which are outlined below. A large portion of the
City of Corona is developed; however, some natural areas and habitats, typically along waterways, still
exist within the City limits. In addition, substantial undeveloped areas exist that are contiguous with
large areas of undeveloped open space to the northeast (Prado Basin) and southeast (Cleveland
National Forest).
+ Special Status Biological Resources
Several sensitive plant species and habitat communities of concern potentially occur in and near
Corona. Special status habitats are vegetation types, associations, or subassociations that support
concentrations of special status plant or wildlife species, are of relatively limited distribution, or are of
particular value to wildlife. Areas that may provide habitat for special-status species are located within
orchards and remnant habitat along the Temescal Wash, as well as the Santa Ana River and its
associated river channels. These areas provide potential habitat for the Santa Ana sucker, the arroyo
chub, least Bell’s vireo, the yellow-breasted chat, the yellow warbler, the western yellow-billed cuckoo,
and the southwestern willow flycatcher. Sensitive wildlife species observed within the City include the
coastal California gnatcatcher, the sharp-shinned hawk, the Cooper’s hawk, the grasshopper sparrow,
the yellow-breasted chat, the black-crowned night heron, and the Stephen’s kangaroo rat.
+ Wildlife Resources
A variety of wildlife species are present throughout the City. Common amphibians include bullfrogs,
identified in Temescal Wash, and tree frogs, observed within the vicinity of the wash. Nonnative carp
and mosquitofish were also observed in the wash. Reptiles within the City include many species of
lizards and snakes. A large number of resident and migratory bird species have also been observed,
including those found in riparian, wetland, oak woodland, safe scrub, and grassland habitats. Mammal
species include the California ground squirrel, the desert cottontail rabbit, the coyote, and the bobcat.
+ Plant Communities
Native plant communities that occur in the City include Riversidean sage scrub (RSS), freshwater
marsh, and southern willow scrub. RSS—the driest, most inland expression of the collection of sage
scrub or coastal scrub plant communities—is widespread in undeveloped portions of the City.
City of Corona General Plan                                                                               199

 Environmental Resources
Freshwater marshes exist in limited distribution, including areas of one acre or less in size. Southern
willow scrub is present within Temescal Wash, although channelization and clearing of portions of the
wash have limited distribution of this habitat. Southern willow scrub is classified as a sensitive habitat.
Several other types of sensitive habitats are known to occur in or near the City, including southern
riparian forest, southern sycamore alter riparian woodland, and southern coast live oak riparian forest.
Coastal live oaks, which are a protected species in the Conservation Element of the Riverside County
General Plan, exist within the City.
Nonnative vegetation within the City includes nonnative grassland, Tamarix ssp. infestations, Arundo
donax infestations, and ruderal plant communities. Nonnative grassland is widespread in undeveloped
portions of the City. Tamarix ssp. and Arundo are both invasive plants listed on the California Exotic
Plant Pest Council (CalEPPC) list A-1, “Most Invasive Wildland Pest Plants.” Lands that are subject
to anthropogenic disturbances are scattered throughout the City, and include fallow pastureland, land
that is cultivated, developed, mined, or graded, and areas that are grubbed and lack vegetative cover
altogether, such as access roadways, recently cleared spoils piles, and areas recently uncovered by spoils
that have not yet been vegetated. Vegetation throughout the City also includes nonnative ornamental
species that are commonly used for landscaping.
A significant inventory of biological resources exists in the Sphere of Influence areas, as these areas are
largely undeveloped. A comprehensive discussion of the resources located in each of the Sphere areas is
presented in the Technical Background Report. Also included in the Technical Background Report is a
more comprehensive set of descriptions and maps for all biological resources in the City. The
following section presents the goals and policies related to these resources in the City of Corona and
the SOI.
Goal 10.6

AGRICULTURAL AND MINERAL RESOURCES
CONTEXT
This section addresses the agricultural and mineral resources in the City of Corona and its Sphere of
Influence (SOI).
+ Regional Geologic Setting
The Planning Area is situated in the Peninsular Ranges geomorphic province. This geomorphic
province encompasses an area that extends approximately 900 miles from the Transverse Ranges and
the Los Angeles Basin south to the southern tip of Baja California (Norris and Webb 1990). The
province varies in width from approximately 30 miles to 100 miles. In general, the province consists
of rugged mountains underlain by Jurassic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks, and Cretaceous
igneous rocks of the Southern California batholith.
+ Local Geologic Units
The Planning Area is underlain by surficial soils such as fill, alluvium and topsoil, and formational
units such as divided and undivided Cenozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks and by Cretaceous
igneous rocks of the southern California batholith. These units, described in detail in the Technical
Background Report, are as follows:
! Landslide Deposits
! Younger Alluvium
! Older Alluvium
! Alluvial Terrace Deposits

!  Fernando Formation
!  Puente Formation
!  Vaqueros and Sespe Formations (undivided)
!  Silverado Formation
!  Igneous Rocks
!  Santiago Peak Volcanics
!  Bedford Canyon Formation
+ Mineral Resources
Several significant mineral resources are located in the Planning Area, and can be categorized by the
now-standard method for classifying areas that may contain mineral resources of local or statewide
importance. Under the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act (SMARA), areas are categorized into
four mineral resource zones (MRZs) as follows:
! MRZ-1—Areas where adequate information indicates that no significant mineral deposits are
   present, or where it is judged that little likelihood exists for their production
! MRZ-2—Areas where adequate information indicates that significant mineral deposits are present
   or where it is judged that a high likelihood for their presence exists
! MRZ-3—Areas containing mineral deposits of which their significance cannot be evaluated from
   available data
! MRZ-4—Areas where available information is inadequate for assignment to any other MRZ zone
The City has refined the State’s Mineral Resource Maps and is only required to respond to those areas
that have been designated by the State as MRZ-2, and to meet the local needs of the Community, the
City has developed three new designations that act as an overlay to the State’s four MRZ zones. These
three additional categories are as follows:
A. Areas where State designated MRZ-2 districts exist, but due to urbanization or previous
   commitment to development, the City has determined not to protect as a mineral resource area
B. Mineral resources that do not have a State designation of MRZ-2, but have been determined by
   the City to be a mineral resource that should be preserved
C. Mineral resources that do not have a State designation of MRZ-2, but have been determined by
   the City to be a “potential” mineral resource, and that further investigation is warranted
In terms of mineral resources in the Planning Area, the active mines within the City of Corona are
mostly located directly east of the I-15 and SR-91. Despite the substantial amount of mineral
extraction that has occurred in the past, these mines still have a long life to provide crushed rock, sand,
and gravel. Mines in Corona that are currently reporting to the Office of Mine Reclamation includes
Glen Ivy, Indio Mine, U.S. Tile No. 6, Chandler Aggregates, 3M Corona, Alberhill Shale Clay Mine,
Corona Clay Pit, Uston Clay Pit, Ben’s Mine, and All American Aggregates.
Portions of the City of Corona, along with portions of its SOI, are designated by the California
Department of Conservation as a “Construction Aggregate Resource Area” and are classified as MRZ-
2 areas. The mineral resources found in these areas generally consist of clay and construction
aggregates: crushed rock, sand, and gravel. These mineral resources are as follows:
! Rock Products. Although aggregate resources such as crystalline, sedimentary, and
   metasedimentary rocks are found within the City, the majority of these mineral resources is located
206                                                                          City of Corona General Plan

                                                                                     Environmental Resources
    in the SOI. These resources have been designated by the State as significant mineral deposits that
    have regional and state importance.
!   Clay Production. The City currently has one known clay resource site within its limits that has a
    State Classification of MRZ-2. This site, known as the Dominguez Mine, was first discovered in
    1975 and is located south of the Sierra Del Oro Specific Plan area. Currently, sedimentary clay
    from calcareous shale members of the Ladd Formation is being extracted from the site. The clay is
    removed in slices by using a bulldozer and then is loaded by a front-end loader onto 25-ton trucks
    and shipped 7 miles to a plant site within Corona. The bulk of the clay goes into the production of
    roofing and patio tile.
!   Sand and Gravel Deposits. The sand and gravel resources within the City of Corona occur both as
    stream deposits and as deposits in older geologic formations. Stream deposits include stream
    channel deposits (in the currently active channel of the stream) and flood-plain (terrace) deposits
    that occur adjacent to the active channel. Sand and gravel are also occasionally produced from
    deposits of intrusive granitic or volcanic rock (“hardrock deposits”).
Past mining activities and petroleum exploration in the City have resulted in numerous open pits and
wells scattered across the City. In some cases pits and wells may have been abandoned and backfilled
with undocumented fill materials. Existing pits and wells backfilled with undocumented fill materials
are likely to be subject to differential settlement. However, mining activities continue within the City,
and mining sites generally describe an arc along the eastern boundary of the City, and oil and gas well
sites are generally concentrated in the west and northwest portions of the City.
A significant inventory of geological, soil, mineral, and agricultural resources exists in the Sphere of
Influence areas, as these areas are largely undeveloped. A comprehensive discussion of the resources
located in each of the Sphere areas is presented in the Technical Background Report. Also included in
the Technical Background Report is a more comprehensive set of descriptions and maps for all
geological, soil, mineral, and agricultural resources in the City. The following section presents the
goals and policies related to these resources in the City of Corona and the SOI.

AIR QUALITY
CONTEXT
The City of Corona and its Planning Area are situated within the eastern portion of the South Coast
Air Basin in the upper Santa Ana River Valley. Within the Basin, air quality management is under the
jurisdiction of the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AWMD).
The South Coast Air Basin has been designated as a nonattainment area, which is defined as an area
not expected to be able to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Air population and its
adverse impacts on the health of the community and vitality of the local economy is continually a key
concern for all communities in the Basin, including the City of Corona. Notwithstanding that per
capital emissions have been reduced significantly in the Basin through forty-five years of air quality
centrals, substantial increases in population and associated vehicle and point-source emission have
reduced the potential air quality benefits of new controls.
+ 2003 Regional Air Quality
In an effort to monitor the various concentrations of air pollutants throughout the South Coast Air
Basin, the SCAQMD has divided the region into 27 source receptor areas (SRAs) in which 31
monitoring stations operate. Pollutant levels vary widely at each SRA depending on location and time
of year. The highest levels of ozone and particulate matter are generally recorded in SRAs in the
interior valleys during warm, stable periods in summer and autumn. Carbon monoxide concentrations
are highest near heavy traffic on freeways or near large business districts.
The quality of the surface ambient air quality is evaluated by measuring the concentrations of the
regulated pollutants and comparing these with national and State air quality standards. Based on these
comparisons, the entire South Coast Air Basin is designated as a national-level extreme nonattainment
area for ozone, meaning that national ambient air quality standards are not expected to be met for
more than seventeen years.
Exhaust emissions from on-road motor vehicles are the primary source of reactive organic gases,
nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide in the South Coast Air Basin, and road dust sent airborne by
traveling vehicles is a primary source of particulate matter. Area-wide and stationary sources make up
the remainder of the emission inventory.
The City of Corona Planning Area is located within SRA 22, which covers the Norco/Corona area of
Riverside County. Ambient air pollutant concentrations within SRA 22 are monitored in Norco.
Only ambient concentrations of PM10 are monitored in SRA 22. The air quality of the other criteria
pollutants in Corona is best represented by data gathered in SRA 23, which covers the Metropolitan
Riverside County area. National and State ambient air quality standards for relevant air pollutants
along with the ambient pollutant concentrations that have been measured within SRA 22 and SRA 23
through the period of 1999 to 2002, and national and State ozone standards have been exceeded
several times over the last five years. The State PM10 standard has also been exceeded several times per
year. Carbon monoxide concentrations measured in SRA 23 have not exceeded national or State
standards in recent years.

+ Land Use Planning and Air Quality
The land use pattern and density of development affects the amount of air pollutants that are
generated by communities. Land uses that are segregated throughout a community increase the
number of motor vehicle trips and associated air pollutant emissions since opportunities to walk, ride
bicycles, and use public transportation between such uses as homes and work/shopping are generally
reduced. This is compounded in communities such as Corona and the surrounding areas where low
densities increase the distance between uses, and public transportation routes and vehicles are limited.
Higher density communities often mix residential uses with, or very near, commercial, business, and
employment uses, thus reducing people’s reliance on motor vehicle use or reducing the distance of
necessary vehicle trips. Smaller, higher-density uses also produce less air emissions on a per unit basis
from the use natural gas for space and water heating. Higher-density uses also have smaller properties,
which reduce the emissions associated with the use of landscape maintenance equipment.
Communities that are either jobs rich or, like Corona, housing-rich also increase the potential for
emissions to be generated as employees or residents have to commute long distances to and from their
homes and work.
The City of Corona recognizes the importance of ongoing land use planning, development, and
public education measures to reduce contributing air pollution constituents and addresses these
concerns in the following policies.

VISUAL RESOURCES
CONTEXT
One component of the Environmental Resources Element is the identification and conservation of
significant hillsides, valleylands, floodplains, and other aesthetic view corridors, or viewsheds.
Protection of significant landforms, as a part of the planning and development process, enables a
community to sustain its visual quality and character as it proceeds toward build-out, as prescribed
through the General Plan. While protecting viewsheds may be regarded as a constraint to land use
development, it can equally be considered an opportunity to achieve sustainable development by
ensuring that natural landscapes, which contribute to a community’s unique identity and quality of
life, are not lost or permanently altered to the detriment of the natural environment.
This section addresses the existing visual environment of the Planning Area. Visual resources are an
important component of the quality of life of any geographic area. As users experience a place, their
primary sensory interaction with that place is visual in nature, and a wide variety shapes, colors, and
textures, composed by topography, structures, roadways, and vegetation, forms the views of and from
the City. Corona is sited on a river plain and is bounded on three sides by the Santa Ana and San
Bernardino Mountains and the Chino Hills, which are visible from all parts of the City and dominate
most viewsheds from within the City, except views to the north, which provide sweeping views of the
heavily vegetated Prado Basin. Additionally, the Temescal Wash, a major drainage facility on the
Santa Ana River, bisects the City. This combination and intersection of mountains, valleys, and plains
create a visually dynamic landscape.
+ Mountains
The San Bernardino Mountains, one of Southern California’s Transverse Ranges, are located north of
the City. Changes in light and shadow throughout the day change the view as the day progresses. This
effect is enhanced by the highly textured nature of the slopes, which are generally covered by low
scrub and punctuated by large bedrock outcrops and small stands of oak trees or solitary trees. To the
west and south are the Chino Hills and the Santa Ana Mountains. To the east are low hills that
complete the feeling of enclosure. The Santa Ana Mountains are within the Cleveland National Forest
and provide the southern backdrop of the City. The National Forest is composed of primarily
evergreen native chaparral and is considered a major scenic resource. Views of these mountains are
216                                                                          City of Corona General Plan

                                                                                   Environmental Resources
particularly significant from newer developments on the City’s south side; however, the mountains
also comprise the dominant natural feature of most views from the City to the west, south, and east.
The slopes that line the western, southern, and eastern City limits are generally steep (over 25 percent)
and because most urban development within and immediately abutting the City has not yet
substantially encroached into the hillside areas, the slopes provide a dramatic contrast to the generally
flat topography within the City and visually dominate the majority of the relatively low-scale urban
development.
The mountains also frame views of the City from major entry points into the City along SR-91 to the
east and west, as well as I-15 from the north and south. This effect is particularly striking at the
eastbound approach into the City from the SR-91: the freeway runs northeast through the Santa Ana
Canyon, and its viewshed near the western portion of the City is tightly bounded by the Chino Hills
on the north and the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains on the south, and the narrow gap between
these groups of hills at the westernmost portion of the City provides a frame for the first visual
impression of the City. The Chino hills then turn abruptly northward and the Santa Ana Mountain
foothills trend to the southeast, with the gap between the two framing a wide vista that includes the
Prado Basin, as well as the City, with the San Bernardino mountain foothills as a backdrop.
+ Open Space
Open space and agricultural areas also provide visual relief from urbanized areas and provide views for
motorists, pedestrians, and residents. Larger contiguous areas of passive open space and agriculture are
concentrated in the western and southeastern portions of the City. A large (approximately 920-acre),
vegetated flood control area is located in the northwestern portion of the City, adjacent to the Prado
Dam spillway, and parks are interspersed throughout generally residential areas in the other portions
of the City, as well as adjacent to the Prado Basin area. The City currently maintains 33 parks,
including recreational areas at the Corona Municipal Airport, which provide approximately 385 acres
of parkland and passive open space, as well as 601 acres of agricultural areas.
+ City Views
The wide-open vistas in the City of Corona are associated with natural features that dominate visual
image of the City. Internally, the visual elements of major arterials, such as Grand Boulevard, provide
unique vistas that characterize individual neighborhoods. Significant vistas include
! The Prado Basin views from Sierra del Oro, which encompass the basin on the south and canyon
    areas on the west
! The view south to the Santa Ana Mountains from the I-15/SR-91 (Riverside) Freeway interchange
! The southern view of the foothills from major north-south streets south of Ontario Avenue
! The views from the higher elevations south of Ontario Avenue, which encompass panoramic views
    to the North and the San Gabriel Mountains
! Grand Boulevard, including the circle of palm trees visible from a variety of locations
One of the best views in the City is provided from Eagle Glen. Eagle Glen is located on the east side
of the City, adjacent to a spectacular canyon, and has been maintained as a scenic amenity, although
the lower portions of the site are vulnerable to development pressures. Eagle Glen Parkway runs along
the top of the west slope of Eagle Glen. Another scenic road in the City is Palisades Drive/Green River
Road south of the State Route (Highway 71/SR-91) interchange. This corridor passes through a
narrow canyon slot, with the road being located against one of the hillsides. Views from South

 Environmental Resources
Corona, including Ontario Avenue and Foothill Boulevard that traverse the higher slope areas,
provide views looking north. This includes the Prado Basin on the west and the hills and valleys
leading toward the San Bernardino Mountains in the north and east.
Another significant view of Corona is provided from I-15, north of the City, as it descends from the
San Bernardino Mountains. The breadth and width of the City is visible to motorists and is
particularly beautiful at night and on clear winter days. For hikers, significant views of the City are
available from ridges and peaks surrounding the City.
Residents who live on the urban/chaparral interface often have direct canyon and mountain views
from their residences. Residents who live north of the airport and to the east of Prado Basin in
northwest Corona have views into the Basin and further south to the mountains behind the City. The
Prado Basin, sandwiched between the hills near the Highway 71 entrance to the City, is also dramatic
and densely covered by trees adapted to the moist environment of the Basin. Its green mass is best seen
from Sierra del Oro, Highway 71 near its intersection with SR-91, and from the industrial and
residential areas flanking the Basin in the northwest quadrant of the City.
Much of the built environment within the City is scenic because of it’s setting, the presence of low-
rise buildings that preserve views, and wide landscaped roadways.
+ Scenic Highways
The City’s Scenic Highway Plan is a composite of various networks and systems such as vistas, activity
centers, corridors and pathways, edge areas, and entry and approach areas. It provides for the
establishment, development, and protection of the City’s highways and corridors for scenic purposes.
The Plan includes the following elements:
! Scenic corridors—visible land area outside the highway right-of-way generally described as the
    view from the road
! Rural designated scenic highway—a route that traverses a defined corridor within which natural
    scenic resource and aesthetic values are protected and enhanced
! Urban designated scenic highway—a route that traverses a defined visual corridor, which offers an
    unhindered view of attractive urban scenes
! Unique functions of a scenic highway—vistas and views for enjoyment of highway users, visual
    relief from intense urban development, connection between activity centers such as the central
    business district, schools, and parks, and community identification and accents to entranceways
    and special areas of importance in the City
Designated scenic highways in the City include
! Grand Boulevard, which provides views of the City’s historic core, particularly the large estates
    established on the irregularly shaped parcels along the edge of the circle, as well as associated
    landscaping and mature street vegetation
! Main Street, from Third Street to the southern terminus, which also provides views of the historic
    core of the City, as well as views of the Santa Ana Mountains to the west and south, and the low
    foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains to the east
! Ontario Avenue, from Mangular Avenue to State Street, which provides views of the Santa Ana
    Mountains to the west and the low foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains to the east

!  Chase Drive, from Mangular Avenue to State Street, which also provides views of the Santa Ana
   Mountains to the west and the low foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains to the east
!  Magnolia Avenue from Garretson and Ontario Avenues to Rimpau Avenue, which also provides
   views of the Santa Ana Mountains to the southwest, as well as views of the narrow pass between the
   San Bernardino Mountain foothills at the northwest end of the City, through which I-15 travels
In addition to the designated scenic highways listed above, SR-91, from the I-15 interchange to the
SR-55 interchange near Santa Ana, is considered by the County to lie in a State-eligible scenic
corridor.
A significant inventory of visual resources also exists in the Sphere of Influence areas and a
comprehensive discussion of the resources located in these areas is presented in the Technical
Background Report. Also included in the Technical Background Report is a more comprehensive set of
descriptions and maps for visual resources in the City. The following section presents the goals and
policies related to these resources in the City of Corona and the SOI.

Environmental Hazards and Public Safety
Public Health & Safety
The primary objective of the Public Health & Safety Element is to identify and evaluate natural and
human-induced public safety risks that can have an impact on the health, safety, and social well-being
of a community. Natural hazards include seismic, landslides and other geological hazards, flooding,
and urban and wild land fires. Human-induced risks are hazardous material spills including their
transport, storage, and disposal within or adjacent to communities.
This Public Safety Element recognizes and responds to both natural and human-induced public health
and safety risks. Implementation by emergency response agencies such as the police and fire
departments, hospitals, and municipally elected officials and staffs from the City of Corona and
Riverside County will enable the community to avert or minimize social and economic dislocation to
the extent practical and feasible. Tools available to achieve this include land use controls and the
City’s emergency/disaster preparedness plan By defining policies addressing these risks, the City of
Corona and it’s agency partners will be able to provide a comprehensive range of services aimed at
minimizing human injury, loss of life, and the degree or magnitude of property damage as a result of
anticipated hazards.
California State law, specifically Assembly Bill 890, Chapter 1255, and California Government Code
Section 65302(1), establishes and requires that each city or county prepare and adopt a Safety
Element as follows:
           A safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks associated with
           the effects of seismically-induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche,
           and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence and other geologic
           hazards known to the legislative body; flooding; and wild land and urban fires. The safety element
           shall include mapping of known seismic and other geologic hazards. It shall also address evacuation
           routes, peak load water supply requirements and minimum road widths and clearances around
           structures, as those items relate to identified fire and geologic hazards.
This Element addresses the following Public Health & Safety concerns:
! Seismic, Geologic, and Erosion
! Flooding
! Hazardous Materials
! Noise Control
! Emergency/Disaster Preparedness
Policies regarding Fire Hazards, Fire Protection, Crime Prevention, and Police Protection are detailed
in the “Police & Fire” chapter of this General Plan.
C
          orona is committed to providing protection to residents and businesses from natural and human-
          induced hazards. The City is also committed to coping and rebuilding from emergency or disaster
          events in a manner that is efficient, safe, and provides for a quick return to the quality of life that
exists daily in Corona. Residents and visitors will feel safe in their homes, neighborhoods, and public places.
A wide variety of community and regional resources—public, private and nonprofit—will work together to
ensure the safety of all residents.

SEISMIC, GEOLOGIC, AND EROSION HAZARDS
CONTEXT
The following describes potential geologic hazards that exist in Corona and the surrounding region,
including issues of faulting and seismicity, liquefaction, land subsidence, and landsliding.
+ Faulting & Seismicity
The City is considered to be seismically active, as is most of Southern California. Several known active
or potentially active faults are located in and around Corona. The Elsinore Fault zone is the closest
major fault system to the City and one of the largest in Southern California. Historically, the Elsinore
Fault zone has also been one of the least active systems. At its northern end, near the City, the Elsinore
Fault zone splays into two segments, the Chino-Central Avenue Fault and the Whittier Fault. Along
the southwestern portion of the City the Elsinore Fault zone is referred to as the Glen Ivy Fault. A
summary of these faults is as follows:
! Chino–Central Avenue Fault. At its closest, the Chino-Central Avenue Fault is located
   approximately 1.9 miles (3.1 km) west of central Corona. The fault branches away from the
   Elsinore (Glen Ivy) Fault at a point southwest of central Corona and extends northwest for a
   distance of approximately 13 miles through the Prado Flood Control Basin and into the Chino
   Hills. The Chino–Central Avenue Fault could produce a maximum moment magnitude 6.7
   earthquake.
! Glen Ivy Fault. The Glen Ivy Fault consists of two strands, the Glen Ivy North Fault and the Glen
   Ivy South Fault. Both strands of the Glen Ivy Fault are included in an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
   Fault zone, which is located along the southwest boundary of the City and through the Temescal
   Valley portion of the SOI. At its closest, the Glen Ivy Fault is located approximately 3.4 miles west
   of central Corona. The fault extends northwest from approximately Lake Elsinore for a distance of
   approximately 23.6 miles to approximately west of Corona, where it splits into two different fault
   segments. The Glen Ivy Fault could produce a maximum moment magnitude 6.8 earthquake.
! Whittier Fault. At its closest, the Whittier Fault is located approximately 4.6 miles northwest of
   central Corona. The fault branches away from the Elsinore (Glen Ivy) Fault at a point west of
   central Corona, outside of the City, and extends northwest for a distance of approximately 23 miles
   through the Santa Ana Mountains and into the Whittier Hills. The Whittier Fault could produce a
   moment magnitude 6.8 earthquake.
Ground surface rupture due to active faulting is considered possible in the western portion of the City
where known active or potentially active faults are mapped. Geological evidence indicates that the
Glen Ivy and portions of the Whittier Faults are active and that the Chino–Central Avenue Fault is
potentially active.
Historically, the Corona region has generally been spared a major destructive earthquake. However,
based on a search of earthquake databases of the USGS National Earthquake Information Center,
several major earthquakes (magnitude 6.0 or more) have been recorded within approximately 100
kilometers of the City since 1769.
224                                                                       City of Corona General Plan

                                                                                               Public Health & Safety
   + Liquefaction
   Liquefaction of cohesionless soils can be caused by strong vibratory motion due to earthquakes.
   Several areas within the City have a susceptibility to liquefaction. Generally, areas with a high
   potential for liquefaction include the Prado Basin and adjacent areas in the northwestern portion of
   the City. Areas in the City with a low potential for liquefaction occur as generally north/south
   running bands in the western, central, and southeastern portions of the City, with an east/west
   running band across the northern portion of the City. Although liquefaction represents a potential
   risk to structures, liquefaction potential does not necessarily limit development potential, if
   appropriate mitigation, such as the excavation of liquefaction-prone soils and backfilling with stable
   fill and the use of concrete piles, is implemented.
   + Land Subsidence
   Land subsidence is the lowering of the land-surface elevation from changes that take place
   underground. Common causes of land subsidence in California from human activity are pumping
   water, oil, and gas from underground reservoirs. Land subsidence has been identified in the Chino
   region and the most northerly part of the Corona North USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle, which
   includes the northern portion of the City. However, no indications show that the City located south
   of the Prado Flood Control Basin has experienced significant regional subsidence over time.
   + Landslides
   Several areas within the City and portions of the SOI are potentially susceptible to landslides.
   Generally, these events occur in the steep slopes of the Santa Ana Mountains. Landslide deposits are
   also relatively abundant in terrain near the trace of the Elsinore Fault zone.
   The potential for earthquake-induced landsliding in hillside terrain in the City exists. Generally these
   types of failures consist of rock falls, disrupted soil slides, rock slides, soil lateral spreads, soil slumps,
   soil block slides, and soil avalanches. Areas having the potential for earthquake-induced landsliding
   generally occur in areas of previous landslide movement, or where local topographic, geological,
   geotechnical, and subsurface water conditions indicate a potential for permanent ground
   displacements. In general, areas such as the steep slopes of the Santa Ana Mountains and the steep
   slopes within the Elsinore Fault zone are considered to be relatively susceptible to earthquake-induced
   landsliding. In addition to earthquake-induced failures of natural slopes, failures of man-made slopes
   could also occur in some of the existing quarries located across the City.
   Comprehensive descriptions and maps of seismic and other geologic hazards in Corona are available in
   the Corona General Plan Update Technical Background Report. The following section presents the goals
   and policies for these hazards in the City of Corona and the surrounding areas. The intent of these
   policies is to provide direction under which land use planning and mitigation measures for public
   safety can be achieved. A primary directive of these policies is to ensure that development satisfactorily
   addresses the proper siting, design, and construction of “Essential Facilities” including their continued
   functioning in the event of a seismic or other geologic disaster. “Essential Facilities” include buildings,
   services, and infrastructure that serve or house people and include hospitals and other medical
   facilities, fire, police and emergency services; water, electricity and natural gas supply infrastructure;
   sewage and solid waste disposal; communications infrastructure; transportation infrastructure.

Several creeks, washes, channels, and flood zones contained in the Planning Area. Areas of the City
adjacent to the Santa Ana River, Temescal Creek and Maybe Canyon Wash are designated as Flood
Zone A, which indicates the area is inundated by one percent annual chance flooding. Portions of the

been designated as Flood Zone X500, which is inundated by 0.2 percent annual chance flooding.
Other portions of the Planning Area are either designated as Flood Zone D, which is an area with
undetermined possible flood hazards, or Flood Zone X, which lies outside the one percent and 0.2
percent annual chance flood plains.
Temescal Wash has the highest flooding potential in the Corona Planning Area. Due to the size of the
Temescal watershed, and the amount of rainfall received, several peak discharges have been recorded.
Based on the stream gauge analysis data obtained from Flood Insurance Study dated September 30,
1992, the peak discharges for the 500-year, 100-year, 50-year, and 10-year are 110,000 cfs (cubic feet
per second), 25,000 cfs, 11,000 cfs, and 2000 cfs, respectively, for the 164-square-mile watershed.
These discharges are obtained from the Flood Insurance Study report for the Stream Gauge No. 11-
720 near Corona above the 3M plant location. The peak discharges are determined from the stream
gauge data analysis, which is based on clear flow and existing conditions.
The Planning Area has experienced major flooding during periods of heavy runoff. The 1969 flooding
in Temescal Wash caused extensive damage, which was determined to be higher than 100-year storm
levels. Major flooding in the Planning Area could occur along the Temescal Wash, and in west
Corona, and storm sheet flows would produce a variety of damage depending upon the location. This
sheet flow would be the result of overflows from the Oak Avenue Channel, Lincoln Avenue drain,
Main Street Channel, Buena Vista drain, and Taylor Avenue drain. Other significant flooding areas
are found along the open channel facilities near the City Yard. These facilities are determined to be
inadequate for the 2-year storm event.
Several flood control projects including the Main Street Channel and Arlington Channel have been
built in the Planning Area to help lessen the severity of heavy flooding.
+ Dam Inundation
Corona is the nearest city to four of Riverside County’s dams. Three of these four dams have a high
hazard potential, while the fourth is characterized as having significant hazard potential.
The primary inundation threat to the City of Corona is from Lake Mathews, which impounds
182,000 acre-feet. Lake Matthews is approximately seven miles southeast of Corona. Two dams
contain Lake Mathews, one on its north side and the other one on the south side. Failure of either
dam would cause flooding along the Temescal Wash in the eastern and northeastern portions of the
City. Should either of the two Lake Matthews dams fail, inundation is 40 minutes to Corona city
228                                                                       City of Corona General Plan

                                                                                       Public Health & Safety
limits and about 65 minutes to the Prado Basin. The water flow would generally follow the Temescal
Channel from southeast to northwest of the intersection of I-15 and SR-91. The Prado Basin and
Dam are located about five miles west of the City of Corona. The flow pattern from this dam is
westward away from Corona and as a result, Prado Dam does not pose as severe of a threat of
inundation as do the Lake Matthews Dams.
Relatively less significant is Mabey Canyon Debris Basin. This basin is located near the southwesterly
City limits and would pose a threat of inundation for a short duration in the western portion of the
City, as waters would empty into the Oak Avenue and Mangular Avenue Channels. Mabey Canyon
Debris Basin was built to provide flood protection for the developed areas downstream, and is
completely dry during most of the year. This, along with its limited capacity, helps minimize the
likelihood of a damaging inundation.
The Santa Ana River no longer poses a major flooding hazard to the City of Corona due to several
upstream flood control projects, including the Seven Oaks Dam.
+ National Flood Insurance Program
The City of Corona participates in the national flood insurance program, as administered through the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Consequently property owners are able to purchase
Federal flood insurance. In turn, the City of Corona has identified flood hazard areas and protective
controls including land use planning measures to reduce the potential risk of flood damage to property
and loss of human life.
Comprehensive descriptions and maps of flooding hazards in Corona are available in the Corona
General Plan Update Technical Background Report. The following section presents the goals and
policies pertaining to the protection of human life and property from flooding hazards. The intent of
these policies is to provide direction under which land use planning and mitigation measures for
public safety can be achieved. Policies pertain to maintaining flood control systems, and restricting
development in flood hazardous zones that currently lack adequate mitigation.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
CONTEXT
The California Health & Safety Code defines a hazardous material as “any material that because of its
quantity, concentration, or physical or chemical characteristics poses a significant present or potential
hazard to human health and safety, or to the environment.” State guidelines define hazardous
materials to include injurious substances including pesticides, herbicides, toxic metals and chemicals,
liquefied natural gas, explosives, volatile chemicals, and nuclear fuels.
230                                                                          City of Corona General Plan

State legislation AB294B (Tanner) and Government Code Section 41500 et seq. mandates that cities
conform with and implement countywide hazardous waste management plans as well as institute
county level actions in the city General Plan.
The County Plan Element must contain the following:
! A statement of goals and policies for the environmentally safe transformation or disposal of solid
   waste that cannot be reduced, recycled, or composted
! An estimate of the total transformation or disposal capacity in cubic yards that will be required for
   a 15-year period to safely handle solid wastes generated within the county, which cannot be
   reduced, recycled, or composted
! The remaining combined capacity of existing solid waste transformation or disposal facilities
   existing at the time of the preparation of the Element, or revision thereto, in cubic yards and years
! Identification of an area or areas for the location of new solid waste transformation or disposal
   facilities or the expansion of existing facilities that are consistent with the applicable City or
   County General Plan, if the County determines that existing capacity will be exhausted within 125
   years or additional capacity is deemed necessary
This section presents goals and policies pertaining to the safe transport, handling, storage, and disposal
of hazardous materials within Corona and the Planning Area. These policies are designed to provide a
high degree of public safety, to minimize damage to property, and prevent economic and social
dislocation that could result as a result of a hazardous material spill or leak into the natural and built
environments. Hazardous material policies also provide protection to surface and groundwater quality,
land resources, air quality and environmentally significant areas from potential contamination.

NOISE
CONTEXT
This section identifies noise sensitive land uses, at-source noise generators, and the geographic extent
of noise impacts for the purposes of protecting residents and businesses from excessive and persistent
noise intrusions.
California State law, Government Code Section 65302(g), requires the preparation and adoption of a
Noise Element, as follows:
            The General Plan shall include a Noise Element that shall identify and appraise noise problems in
            the community. The Noise Element shall recognize the guidelines adopted by the Office of Noise
            Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify to the extent
            practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and projected noise levels for all of the
            following sources:
            ! Highways and freeways
            ! Primary arterials and major local streets
            ! Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid transit systems
            ! Aviation and airport related operations
            ! Local industrial plants
            ! Other ground stationary noise sources contributing to community noise environment”
A local Noise Element should accurately reflect the noise environment, the stationary sources of noise,
and the impacts of noise on local residents.
232                                                                                    City of Corona General Plan

                                                                                       Public Health & Safety
+ Freeways and Arterial Roadways
Throughout the City of Corona, the dominant noise sources are transportation related. Two major,
region-serving freeways bisect Corona and numerous major surface streets carry vehicles throughout
the developed portions of the City. Motor vehicle noise commonly causes sustained noise levels and
often in close proximity of sensitive land uses.
The major sources of traffic noise in Corona are the Riverside Freeway (SR-91) and I-15 Freeway.
Many of the residential uses built near the freeways include some level of noise attenuation, provided
by either a sound barrier or grade separation. As highway projects are implemented on the freeways,
Caltrans policies regarding environmental protection are implemented and noise mitigation strategies
are developed as necessary to meet Caltrans and/or FHWA goals.
+ Railroad Traffic
The Burlington Northern/Santa Fe (BNSF) Railroad main line also bisects Corona. This rail line
carries heavy east-west freight train traffic, and about fifteen daily Metrolink and Amtrak passenger
trains, from Los Angeles and Orange Counties through Riverside County to points east. During any
typical 24-hour period, 75 to 90 freight trains use this line. Because freight train traffic occurs around
the clock, nighttime traffic on the railroad has the potential to be the most disruptive to the
community noise environment.
+ Aircraft
The Corona Municipal Airport is a recreational airport that experiences more than 60,000 annual
operations per year. Because the airport generally serves small aircraft and it is located in the Prado
Flood Control Basin approximately one-half mile from the nearest residential neighborhoods to the
north of Rincon Street, it is not a substantial source of noise at any sensitive land use, and noise from
the airport does not affect most of the City.
+ Stationary Sources
Stationary sources of noise include common building or home mechanical equipment, such as air
conditioners, ventilation systems, or pool pumps, and industrial facilities, such as manufacturing
plants, power plants, or processing plants. Industry in Corona and near Corona city limits includes a
variety of light manufacturing, rail and truck transportation-related businesses, some heavy
manufacturing, and, in the eastern portion of the City, surface mining operations.
+ Sensitive Land Uses
Noise-sensitive land uses are defined in the Corona Municipal Code, Section 17.84.040. Sensitive
land uses are those uses that have associated human activities that may be subject to stress or
significant interference from noise. Sensitive land uses include single family residential, multiple
family residential, churches, hospitals and similar health care institutions, convalescent homes,
libraries, and school classroom areas.
+ Noise Standards
The Corona Municipal Code establishes standards for transportation noise sources in relation to
sensitive uses. These standards are used by the City to guide project-level development to a
City of Corona General Plan                                                                              233
 Public Health & Safety
community noise environment that does not disrupt sensitive uses. New sensitive uses are prohibited
from locating in areas where aircraft noise exceeds 65 CNEL, and mitigation is required for projects
proposing to locate where roadway noise exceeds 65 CNEL.
The land use compatibility standards for community noise levels recommended in the guidelines
established by the State of California, Governor’s Office of Planning and Research. In addition, the
California Noise Insulation Standards identify an interior noise standard of 45 dBA CNEL for new
multi-family residential units.
2002 Noise Levels
Ambient noise levels were measured in the City of Corona to characterize existing daytime noise
conditions caused by various noise sources. The locations were selected to characterize conditions
caused by unique noise sources in the community (freeways, industry, the airport, and the railroad).
Refer to Figure 18(1) through Figure 18(4).
SR-91 and I-15 are the greatest source of noise within the City. Yuma Drive located east of I-15 and
Ontario Avenue located east of Rimpau Avenue also generate high levels of roadway noise. Existing
residential uses in close proximity to these freeway and roadway segments could be exposed to high
noise levels on a regular basis.
In addition to the noise levels identified above, there are currently several active surface aggregate
mines within the City. Noise is generated by heavy vehicles within the mining sites, processing plant
equipment, and transport trucks traveling to and from the mines. Most of the mines are located
directly east of I-15 and SR-91.
As with locations in the City of Corona, motor vehicles are the primary source of noise within the
SOI. Existing roadway noise levels in the Sphere of Influence Area are lower than within the City of
Corona. As there are few existing residential uses in close proximity to the roadway segments, it is
unlikely that these residents are exposed to high noise levels on a regular basis. There are currently
several active surface aggregate mines within the South and East SOI areas. The noise generated by
these mines is not known to adversely affect residential uses or other sensitive uses at the present time.
Comprehensive descriptions and maps of noise related issues in Corona are available in the Corona
General Plan Update Technical Background Report. The following noise related policies are intended to
be a comprehensive program that addresses noise control and mitigation in the planning and
development process. The underlying purpose is to minimize exposure of excessive noise sources to
the greatest number of residents and visitors of Corona as possible.

 Interpretation
      Zone A                   Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal conventional construction
        Clearly Compatible     without any special noise insulation requirements.
      Zone B                   New construction or development should be undertaken only after detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements are
        Normally Compatible    made and needed noise insulation features in the design are determined. Conventional construction, with closed windows and
                               fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice. Note that residential uses are prohibited with airport CNEL
                               greater than 65.
      Zone C                   New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or development does proceed, a
        Normally Incompatible  detailed analysis of noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features included in the design.
      Zone D                   New construction of development should generally not be undertaken.

EMERGENCY/DISASTER PREPAREDNESS
CONTEXT
Municipalities use emergency/disaster preparedness plans in order to identify planning processes,
organizations, response, and recovery policies and procedures to address a range of emergencies/
disasters including seismic, flooding, urban and wildfires, and hazardous waste. These plans specify
how preparedness and response activities and responsibilities are integrated and coordinated between
local and county jurisdictions and with other government agencies, when required.
The California Emergency Services Act requires cities and counties to manage and coordinate
emergency response and recovery activities within their jurisdictional boundaries. During disasters, the
City of Corona coordinates its operations with the Riverside Operational Area. In the event of a
disaster, the City and other involved agencies will implement the Incident Command System (ICS) at
the field-response level to standardize response procedures. At the local government level, a designated
Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is used as the central location to administer emergency
operations.
248                                                                        City of Corona General Plan

                                                                                      Public Health & Safety
The City of Corona has prepared a draft Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) that presents how the
City will respond to major and extraordinary crisis situations associated with natural and human-
induced disasters and technological incidents. The EOP is based on four phases of response:
1. Increased readiness upon receipt of a warning or observation that an emergency situation is
    imminent or likely to occur soon
2. Initial response operations to minimize adverse impacts of the emergency or disaster
3. Extended response operations to mitigate the emergency and move to recovery operations
4. Recovery operations to reconstruct damaged infrastructure and apply for federal and State
    assistance
The Plan utilizes the functions and principles of the Standardized Emergency Management System
(SEMS), which is based on the FIRESCOPE Incident Command System (ICS). Each City
department manager is responsible for creating and annually reviewing their department’s “Standard
Operating Procedures" to ensure conformity with the EOP.
The Corona Disaster Council, in accordance with City Ordinance 2-52, is responsible for ensuring
that the Plan remains current and effective. The Corona Fire Department Office of Emergency
Services is responsible for reviewing the entire Plan on an annual basis, coordinating revisions to the
Plan, and maintaining records of all revisions.
This section presents goals and policies pertaining to emergency/disaster preparedness within Corona
and the Planning Area.
