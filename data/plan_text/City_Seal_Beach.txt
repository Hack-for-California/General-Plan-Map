Future Traffic Impacts
                                 For Year 2025 traffic conditions, the roadway links in the vicin-
                                 ity of the site are projected to operate within acceptable Levels
                                 of Service, except for the following study area roadway links
                                 that are projected to operate at Level of Service F:

                                 For Year 2025 traffic conditions, the study area intersections are
                                 projected to operate at Level of Service D or better during the
                                 peak hours, except for the following study area intersections
                                 which are projected to operate at Level of Service E/F during
                                 the peak hours, without improvements:

                                 than Level of Service D (with improvements) are all located
                                 along Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1). The relatively high levels of
                                 traffic along this corridor are a direct result of increased devel-
                                 opment outside of the City of Seal Beach and the congestion
                                 along the San Diego (I-405) Freeway. The City of Seal Beach

                                 way (SR 1) as a Primary highway (4 lanes divided). As a Primary
                                 highway (4 lanes divided), there is insufficient capacity along Pa-
                                 cific Coast Highway (SR 1) to accommodate the existing as well
                                 as future traffic volumes.
Future Circulation Recommendations
                                 The following measures are recommended in the study area:
                                 1.     Amend the Orange County Master Plan of Arterial High-
                                        ways (MPAH) to delete 1st Street as a Primary (100 foot
                                        right-of-way) between Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) and
                                        Westminster Avenue.

                                    have previously been included as recommendations within
                                    recent studies conducted in the study area. The City of
                                    Seal Beach should periodically review traffic operations in
                                    the study area to assure that the traffic operations are sat-

Purpose and Scope
Statutory Requirements
                                 Government Code §65302(b) requires a Circulation Element in
                                 all city general plans, as follows:
                                       “…a circulation element consisting of the general location
                                       and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
                                       transportation routes, terminals, and other local public utili-
                                       ties and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of
                                       the plan.”
                                 The Circulation Element of the City of Seal Beach General Plan
                                 serves as the City’s primary guide for transportation planning.
                                 The Circulation Element is concerned with accommodating the
                                 transportation needs of those living, working, and visiting the
                                 City. Its objective is to articulate the City’s vision and plans for
                                 the ongoing development and maintenance of a comprehensive
                                 circulation network that will efficiently move people and goods
                                 throughout the City of Seal Beach and the surrounding region.
                                 The Circulation Element focuses on roadways and other trans-
                                 portation modes, including public transit, railroads, and bicycle
                                 paths, that provide a full range of travel options. Also included
                                 is an assessment of the City’s current roadway system and rec-
                                 ommendations for the improvements necessary to maintain ac-
                                 ceptable Levels of Service on this system throughout the Year
                                 2025.

Related Plans and Programs
                                 Several transportation plans prepared by the County of Orange
                                 focus on the regional transportation system. Strategies to handle
                                 anticipated traffic levels from future development are discussed.
                                 Plans and programs related to the Circulation Element include
                                 the following:
                                 •    County of Orange Master Plan of Highways (MPAH)
                                      The County of Orange Master Plan of Arterial Highways
                                      (MPAH) forms a part of the Orange County General Plan
                                      and designates the arterial system in the Circulation Ele-
                                      ment of the General Plan. Defined according to specific ar-
                                      terial functional classifications, the MPAH defines the in-
                                      tended future roadway system for the County. Cities within
                                      the County are expected to achieve consistency with the
                                      MPAH in individual General Plan circulation elements.
                                      The Seal Beach Circulation Element proposes no further
                                      extension to First Street as a Primary Highway and no ex-
                                      tension of Edinger Avenue. To implement this change to
                                      the MPAH, approval from the Orange County Transporta-
                                      tion Authority (OCTA) is required.
                                 •    County of Orange Congestion Management Plan (CMP)
                                      Urbanized areas such as Orange County are required to
                                      adopt a Congestion Management Plan (CMP). The goals of
                                      the CMP are to reduce traffic congestion and to provide a
                                      mechanism for coordinating land use development and
                                      transportation improvement decisions. For the most part,
                                      the Orange County CMP is a composite of local agency
                                      submittals in which each local jurisdiction develops the re-
                                      quired data in accordance with the guidelines established by
                                      the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). The
                                      OCTA compiles the data and submits the results to the
                                      Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
                                      for a finding of regional consistency. Pacific Coast High-
                                      way is the only road in Seal Beach that is a component of
                                      the Congestion Management Plan system.

                                   Also part of the County of Orange General Plan, the Mas-
                                   ter Plan of Countywide Bikeways designates various classes
                                   of bike routes throughout the County. One of the primary
                                   considerations of this plan is to provide continuity
                                   throughout the County and to provide consistency between
                                   countywide and local jurisdiction bikeway plans. The Circu-
                                   lation Element contains a bikeway plan that utilizes the
                                   countywide classification system and links to County

Existing Traffic Conditions
                                 The traffic conditions as they exist today are discussed below
                                 and illustrated on Circulation - Figure 3 through Circulation -
                                 Figure 1.
Existing Travel Lanes and Intersection Controls
                                 Circulation - Figure 3through Circulation - Figure 12 identify
                                 the existing roadway conditions for arterials within the City of
                                 Seal Beach. The number of through lanes for existing roadways,
                                 by Planning Area, are illustrated on Circulation - Figure 3
                                 through Circulation - Figure 7. The existing intersection con-
                                 trols are identified by Planning Area on Circulation - Figure
                                 8through Circulation - Figure 12.
Existing Average Daily Traffic (ADT) Volumes
                                 All tables and figures in the Circulation Element reflect informa-
                                 tion obtained by conducting a detailed traffic analysis prepared
                                 by Kunzman Associates in March 2003 for the City. Where daily
                                 traffic counts were not available and where peak hour counts
                                 were available, daily traffic counts were estimated by Kunzman
                                 Associates from the peak hour counts.
Existing Volume to Capacity Ratios
                                 Roadway capacity is generally defined as the number of vehicles
                                 that can be reasonably expected to pass over a given section of
                                 road in a given time period. Congestion, high accident rates, the
                                 quality of traffic flow (Level of Service), and environmental ac-
                                 ceptability all come into play in defining a particular roadway’s
                                 effective capacity. It is possible to identify maximum desirable
                                 volumes for typical roadway types based on the number of
                                 roadway travel lanes. These daily volumes reflect estimates of
                                 the amount of daily traffic that will result in peak hour traffic
                                 volumes equal to the maximum desirable capacity of each road-
                                 way type. In the City of Seal Beach, Level of Service D is the
                                 minimum acceptable condition that should be maintained along
                                 roadway segments.

Existing Intersection Capacity Utilization
                                 The technique used to assess the operation of an intersection is
                                 known as Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU). To calculate
                                 an ICU value, the volume of traffic using the intersection is
                                 compared with the capacity of the intersection. An ICU value is
                                 usually expressed as a percent. The percent represents that por-
                                 tion of the hour required to provide sufficient capacity to ac-
                                 commodate all intersection traffic if all approaches operate at
                                 capacity.
                                 The ICUs for the existing traffic conditions have been calcu-
                                 lated and are shown in Circulation - Table 3. Existing ICU val-
                                 ues are based upon manual morning and evening peak hour
                                 turning movement counts made for the City of Seal Beach and
                                 Kunzman Associates in January/March/June/ September/ No-
                                 vember, 2002 (see Circulation - Figure 13 through Circulation -
                                 Figure 14). Traffic count worksheets are provided in Appendix
                                 B of the Circulation Analysis.
                                 There are two peak hours in a weekday. The morning peak hour
                                 is between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., and the evening peak hour is
                                 between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. The actual peak hour within
                                 the two-hour interval is the four consecutive 15-minute periods
                                 with the highest total volume when all movements are added
                                 together. Thus, the evening peak hour at one intersection may
                                 be 4:45 p.m. to 5:45 p.m. if those four consecutive 15-minute
                                 periods have the highest combined volume.

                                 The technique used to calculate Intersection Capacity Utilization
                                 (ICU) is as follows. Lane capacity is 1,700 vehicles per lane per
                                 hour of green time for through and turn lanes. A total yellow
                                 clearance time of 5% is added. In the City of Seal Beach, Level
                                 of Service D is the minimum acceptable condition that should
                                 be maintained during the peak hours.

                                 ences. The differences between link volume to capacity ratios
                                 and peak hour ICU values is particularly pronounced when
                                 cross traffic is light. Volume to capacity ratios assume that all
                                 cross streets require 50% of the time to satisfy their demand,
                                 and assume that the subject street has 50% of the time available
                                 to it. The link volume to capacity ratios are a generalized indica-
                                 tor, while peak hour ICU actually represents what can be ex-
                                 pected in the peak hour at intersections. Of the two indicators,
                                 the peak hour ICU value and corresponding LOS is by far the

Year 2025 Traffic Conditions
                                 In this section, Year 2025 traffic conditions reflecting ultimate
                                 buildout of the existing General Plan are discussed. Circulation -
                                 Figure 1and Circulation - Figure 28 illustrate the Year 2025 traf-
                                 fic conditions.
Method of Projection
                                 The Year 2025 ADT volumes have been obtained from the
                                 subregional travel demand model currently being used for long-
                                 range planning in the City of Seal Beach. This model is com-
                                 monly referred to as the Orange County Traffic Analysis Model
                                 (OCTAM 3.1). The data source is OCP-2000 (version 020801).
                                 Year 2025 peak hour forecasts have been developed from the
                                 OCTAM using accepted procedures for model forecast refine-
                                 ment and smoothing.
                                 The ADT volumes, particularly on the regional facilities, reflect
                                 the areawide growth anticipated between now and Year 2025.
                                 The Year 2025 peak hour forecasts were refined using the daily
                                 forecasts, along with existing peak hour traffic count data col-
                                 lected at each analysis location. The traffic model zone structure
                                 is not designed to provide accurate turning movements along ar-
                                 terial roadways unless refinement and reasonableness checking
                                 is performed.
                                 The initial estimate of the Year 2025 peak hour turning move-
                                 ments has, therefore, been reviewed for reasonableness. The
                                 reasonableness checks performed include review of flow con-
                                 servation in addition to comparisons to the existing actual
                                 counted volume and the overall relationship between the fore-
                                 cast peak hour volume and daily volume on each individual in-
                                 tersection leg. Where necessary, the initial raw model estimates
                                 were adjusted to achieve flow conservation, reasonable growth,
                                 acceptable relationships between the peak hour and daily traffic
                                 volume forecasts, and reasonable diversion between parallel
                                 routes.

Year 2025 Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU)
                                 The technique used to assess the operation of an intersection is
                                 known as Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU). To calculate
                                 an ICU value, the volume of traffic using the intersection is
                                 compared with the capacity of the intersection. An ICU value is
                                 usually expressed as a percent. The percent represents that por-
                                 tion of the hour required to provide sufficient capacity to ac-
                                 commodate all intersection traffic if all approaches operate at
                                 capacity.
                                 The ICUs for the Year 2025 traffic conditions have been calcu-

Goals, Objectives, and Policies
                                 The following goals, objectives, and policies form the basis for
                                 providing a circulation system that adequately serves the devel-
                                 opment intensity anticipated in the Land Use Element. The goal
                                 for the Circulation Element expresses the importance of the cir-
                                 culation system to the quality of life and the vitality of the local
                                 economy, and sets a high standard for its performance.
General
       Goal:
                                 Provide and maintain a comprehensive circulation system that
                                 facilitates the efficient movement of people and goods through-
                                 out the City and near open space habitats for wildlife, while
                                 minimizing environmental impacts (including air, light, and
                                 noise pollution).
                                 Objective:
                                 Ensure that the circulation system is in balance with the City’s
                                 Land Use Element.
                                       Policies:
                                       Monitor and participate in applicable county, regional,
                                       state, and federal transportation plans and proposals.
                                       Maintain compliance with the County’s Congestion Man-

                                 Passenger Car Equivalent. A truck is equal to 2- or 3- Passenger
                                 Car Equivalents in that a truck requires longer to start, goes
                                 slower, and accelerates slower. Loaded trucks have a higher Pas-

                                 regard to traffic conditions.
                                 PROGRESSION: A term used to describe the progressive
                                 movement of traffic through several signalized intersections.
                                 SCREEN-LINE: An imaginary line or physical feature across
                                 which all trips are counted, normally to verify the validity of
                                 mathematical traffic models.

                                 than the other. On a daily basis, most facilities have balanced
                                 flow. During the peak hours, flow is seldom balanced in an ur-

Introduction
                                 This Element of the Seal Beach General Plan discusses the pur-
                                 pose and function of preserving archaeological and historical re-
                                 sources, describes methods for protecting these resources, and
                                 provides local policies to guide the implementation of cultural
                                 resource preservation, beyond the protections afforded by ap-
                                 plicable federal (National Environmental Policy Act), state (Cali-
                                 fornia Environmental Quality Act) and local laws.
Background
                                 Anaheim Bay, the San Gabriel estuary, and the Seal Beach area
                                 have supported several cultures over the past 10,000 years. Ar-
                                 chaeological and historical sites provide tangible evidence of
                                 Seal Beach’s cultural heritage. Knowledge of the way of life of
                                 Seal Beach’s prehistoric and historic residents enhances the
                                 quality of life of the City’s present and future inhabitants. These
                                 sites are priceless non-renewable cultural resources. They have
                                 the potential to provide vivid educational opportunities for our
                                 children and for succeeding generations. They are part of the
                                 material culture of local Native Americans and provide impor-
                                 tant “laboratories” for scientific research. Due to development
                                 of the coastal strip, few archaeological sites remain, and those
                                 that do demand our protection.
                                 Archaeological resources are defined as the material remains of
                                 an area’s prehistorical (aboriginal/Native American) or historical
                                 (European and Euro-American) human activity. “Prehistoric”
                                 sites date from the time of early human occupation to the arrival
                                 of Juan Cabrillo in 1542. “Historic” sites postdate Cabrillo and
                                 include periods of Spanish, Mexican, and American settlement.
                                 Prehistoric occupation of the Seal Beach area was associated
                                 with the Tongva (Gabrielino) Native Americans, who inhabited
                                 much of northern Orange County. The name “Gabrielino”
                                 identifies those people who came under the control of the Mis-
                                 sion at San Gabriel. The Tongva were known for high popula-
                                 tion densities, complex social organization, and highly devel-
                                 oped maritime economies. The Tongva in the area were on the
                                 extreme southern flank of extensive tribal territory that ex-
                                 tended into Ventura County to the north and San Bernardino

                                 material culture, and ceremonial/political system. In addition to
                                 the Tongva, it is also understood that the Juaneño Native
                                 Americans (the neighboring tribe to the south) also frequented
                                 the Seal Beach area.
                                 By the time the Spanish arrived, the Tongva and Juaneño belief
                                 in the great mythical chief Chin-ngich-nish and the associated
                                 toloache cult had spread to neighboring groups. As part of this
                                 religion, human remains were generally wrapped in a blanket for
                                 three days and then burned along with most of the deceased’s
                                 personal possessions. The Spanish abruptly terminated these ac-
                                 tivities, and burial in the ground became standard practice.
                                 Tongva coastal villages have been identified in Long Beach, Seal
                                 Beach, Huntington Beach, and Costa Mesa. Identified within
                                 Seal Beach, a Tongva community named Motuuchey, also
                                 known as “El Piojo [the Louse],” was located at the former
                                 Anaheim Landing area. Identified archaeological resources
                                 within the City of Seal Beach are primarily located on the Naval
                                 Weapons Station, the Hellman Ranch property, and potentially
                                 on the Boeing property.
                                 The historic settlement of the Seal Beach area began in the
                                 1780s with the assignment of a land grant. This 300,000-acre
                                 grant became a rancho known as Los Alamitos. Due to the
                                 presence of the Santa Ana River, the land was suitable for cattle
                                 grazing and agriculture.
                                 When the Rancho era ended with the end of Mexican rule after
                                 the Mexican War of 1846-1848, the land was still farmed, but
                                 many of the ranchers went bankrupt. In 1864 much of the land
                                 was purchased by Jotham Bixby, and a portion of the land was
                                 purchased by a group of German immigrants who formed an
                                 agricultural colony called Anaheim. They created a port they
                                 called Anaheim Landing from which they could ship their pro-
                                 duce to markets. This was the first port in what is today known
                                 as Orange County and eventually developed into downtown
                                 Seal Beach.
                                 In the early 1900s the area transitioned from use as a port to a
                                 resort community. In 1903 the area was subdivided and named
                                 “Bay City.” The next year, the Pacific Electric Railroad “Red
                                 Cars” arrived, connecting Bay City to Los Angeles and allowing
                                 easy access to the community. Today the Red Car Museum is
                                 located on the old Pacific Electric Right-Of-Way in a rare Pa-

                                 the beach, and a roller coaster were some of the amenities that
                                 attracted tourists. Built in 1906, the pier was the longest pier
                                 south of San Francisco. A bath house with a dancing pavilion, a
                                 store, billiards, and bowling facilities was built in 1913. In 1915,
                                 Bay City was incorporated with a population of 250, and it be-
                                 came known as Seal Beach.
                                 By the 1920s, the town was at its height as a resort community.
                                 The success prompted a flurry of construction in the area. The
                                 town continued to grow until the Great Depression. The pier
                                 was cut in half when hurricane winds hit in 1939 and was re-
                                 built.
                                 Subsequently World War II brought significant changes to the
                                 area when military facilities were placed all around Seal Beach
                                 and, ultimately, a Naval Weapons Station was built in town.
                                 With the influx of military personnel the town experienced a
                                 second major boom in construction. The town continued to ex-
                                 pand in the 1950s, including the development of Leisure World
                                 toward the end of the decade. In 1983 the pier was again bat-
                                 tered in the storms that year. It was again rebuilt and suffered
                                 fire and earthquake damage in 1992 and fire damage in 1994.
                                 Today Seal Beach is again a beach tourist destination with a
                                 population of more than 24,000. The City is continuing to build
                                 out a few undeveloped areas. Historic resources within the City
                                 of Seal Beach include the “Old City Hall” located along 8th
                                 Street, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. In
                                 addition, the State of California recognizes the historic signifi-
                                 cance of “Anaheim Landing,” an early port facility used in the
                                 late 1800s to early 1900s by Anaheim farmers to ship produce
                                 and livestock. A state historic marker regarding Anaheim Land-
                                 ing is located at Seal Beach Boulevard and Electric Avenue. Lo-
                                 cally listed historic structures include the Krenwinckle House
                                 and the Proctor House. Although not officially listed, many
                                 structures built during the history of Seal Beach contribute to
                                 the community’s identity.

Statutory Requirements
                                 The California Government Code allows the development of op-
                                 tional General Plan Elements. Section 65303(j) of the Government
                                 Code previously permitted the inclusion of “A historical preserva-
                                 tion element for the identification, establishment and protection of sites and
                                 structures of architectural, historical, archaeological or cultural significance,
                                 including significant trees ..., and other plant materials.”
                                 Government Code §65303 was subsequently amended, and cur-
                                 rently does not outline specific optional elements of a General
                                 Plan that a city may determine to utilize. The City of Seal Beach
                                 recognizes that the Cultural Resources Element is an optional
                                 element of the General Plan under the current provisions of
                                 Government Code §65303.

Related Plans and Programs
                                 There are a number of existing plans, programs, and regulations
                                 that are related to the goals and policies contained in the Cul-
                                 tural Resources Element. These plans, programs, and regula-
                                 tions are described below and have been enacted by local, state,
                                 or federal agencies.
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Guidelines
                                 The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was
                                 adopted by the state legislature in response to a public mandate
                                 for thorough environmental analysis of projects that might af-
                                 fect the environment. The provisions of state law and environ-
                                 mental review procedures are described in the CEQA Statutes
                                 and the CEQA Guidelines. Implementation of CEQA ensures
                                 that during the decision-making process for development, City
                                 officials and the general public will be able to identify and assess
                                 the environmental impacts associated with private and public
                                 development projects. CEQA requires evaluation of potential
                                 project impacts to historic, archaeological, and paleontological
                                 resources and provides guidance regarding standards to be used
                                 to determine significance of identified potential impacts.
Federal and State Mandates
                                 There are numerous federal and state mandates, legislation,
                                 guidelines, and Native American policies concerning archaeo-
                                 logical and historical resources. Some of the more significant
                                 regulations and programs include the Antiquities Act of 1906,
                                 the Historic Sites Act of 1935, the National Historic Preserva-
                                 tion Act of 1966, the National Register of Historic Places, Ar-
                                 chaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, and the Native
                                 American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990. A
                                 more extensive listing of relevant legislation, programs, and
                                 guidelines with corresponding brief descriptions is included in
                                 the General Plan Appendices (Appendix A). However, this list-
                                 ing is not intended to be exhaustive; more recent court cases
                                 may provide clearer definitions for some of the laws and guide-

Goals, Objectives, and Policies
                                 The major issue for this Element is the preservation of historic,
                                 archaeologic, and paleontologic resources within the City of Seal
                                 Beach. This section provides associated goals, objectives, and
                                 policies as presented below. Existing policies have been brought
                                 forward from previous General Plan amendments, and policies
                                 have been updated or augmented as needed.
                                 Seal Beach is located in an area that has attracted humans during
                                 prehistoric and historic times. This rich past has been incorpo-
                                 rated into the fabric of the City and provides a link to the com-
                                 munity’s heritage and history. These resources have a value that
                                 needs to be protected and enhanced to maintain the historical
                                 quality and focus of the community.
Goal 1:        Preserve and protect historical, archaeological, and
paleontological resources
                                 •      Policy 1: Balance the benefits of development with the
                                        project’s potential impacts to existing cultural resources.
                                 •      Policy 2: Identify, designate, and protect sites and build-
                                        ings of historic importance.
                                 •      Policy 3: Coordinate cultural resource programs and de-
                                        velopment project review with affected resource agencies
                                        and Native American representatives.
                                 •      Policy 4: Identify funding programs to assist private and
                                        public property owners in the preservation of buildings
                                        and sites of historic importance.
                                 •      Policy 5: Assess development proposals for potential im-
                                        pacts to significant archaeological resources pursuant
                                        §15064.5 of the California Environmental Quality Act
                                        (CEQA). Require a study conducted by a professional ar-
                                        chaeologist for all development proposals located in areas
                                        known to be sensitive for cultural resources.

                                 professional archaeologist for all development proposals located
                                 in areas known to be sensitive for cultural resources. Guidance
                                 for such studies is provided within General Plan Appendix A.
                                 The objective of the study is to determine if significant archaeo-
                                 logical resources are potentially present and if the project will
                                 significantly impact the resources. If significant impacts are
                                 identified, either require the project to be modified to avoid the
                                 impacts, or require measures to mitigate the impacts. Mitigation
                                 may involve archaeological investigation and resource recovery.

                                        be confidential when the employer or client so indicates
                                        or when such information becomes publicly known.
                                 3.2    An archaeologist shall not:
                                 (a)    Reveal confidential information, unless required to by
                                        law;

                                          Research Performance.
       Standards of Research Performance
                                 The research archaeologist has a responsibility to attempt to de-
                                 sign and conduct projects that will add to our understanding of
                                 past cultures and/or that will develop better theories, methods,
                                 or techniques for interpreting the archaeological record, while
                                 causing minimal attrition of the archaeological resource base. In
                                 the conduct of a research project, the following minimum stan-
                                 dards should be followed:
                            I.   The archaeologist has a responsibility to prepare adequately for
                                 any research project, whether or not in the field. The archaeolo-
                                 gist must:
                                 1.1      Assess the adequacy of her/his qualifications for the
                                          demands of the project, and minimize inadequacies by
                                          acquiring additional expertise, by bringing in associates
                                          with the needed qualifications, or by modifying the
                                          scope of the project;
                                 1.2      Inform himself/herself of relevant previous research;
                                 1.3      Develop a scientific plan of research which specifies the
                                          objectives of the project, takes into account previous
                                          relevant research, employs a suitable methodology, and
                                          provides for economical use of the resource base
                                          (whether such base consists of an excavation site or of
                                          specimens) consistent with the objectives of the project;
                                 1.4      Ensure the availability of adequate staff and support fa-
                                          cilities to carry the project to completion, and of ade-

Appendix A – Cultural Resources Element
                                 1.5      Comply with all legal requirements including, without
                                          limitation, obtaining all necessary governmental permits
                                          and necessary permission from landowners or other
                                          persons;
                                 1.6      Determine whether the project is likely to interfere with
                                          the program or projects of other scholars and, if there is
                                          such likelihood, initiate negotiations to minimize such
                                          interference.
                            II.  In conducting research, the archaeologist must follow her/his
                                 scientific plan of research, except to the extent that unforeseen
                                 circumstances warrant its modification.
                            III. Procedures for field survey or excavation must meet the follow-
                                 ing minimal standards:
                                 3.1      If specimens are collected, a system for identifying and
                                          recording their proveniences must be maintained;
                                 3.2      Uncollected entities, such as environmental or cultural
                                          features, depositional strata, and the like, must be fully
                                          and accurately recorded by appropriate means, and their
                                          location recorded;
                                 3.3      The methods employed in data collection must be fully
                                          and accurately described. Significant stratigraphic
                                          and/or locational relationships among artifacts, other
                                          specimens, and cultural and environmental features
                                          must also be fully and accurately recorded;
                                 3.4      All records should be intelligible to other archaeologists.
                                          If terms lacking commonly held referents are used, they
                                          should be clearly defined;
                                 3.5      Insofar as possible, the interests of other researchers
                                          should be considered. For example, upper levels of a
                                          site should be scientifically excavated and recorded
                                          whenever feasible, even if the focus of the project is on
                                          underlying levels.
                            IV.  During accessioning, analysis, and storage of specimens and re-
                                 cords in the laboratory, the archaeologist must take precautions
                                 to ensure that correlations between the specimens and the field
                                 records are maintained, so that provenience, contextual relation-
                                 ships, and the like are not confused or obscured.

                            VI.  The archaeologist has responsibility for appropriate dissemina-

                                          with the researcher's prior rights to publication and
                                          his/her other professional responsibilities;

Introduction
                                 The City of Seal Beach is part of a large, fast-growing region.
                                 Assuring adequate levels of public service and maintaining a de-
                                 sirable quality of life through regulation of growth is the only
                                 option available to the City with certain jurisdictional, fiscal, and
                                 legal limits. A Growth Management Element establishes a plan
                                 for ensuring that future growth is coordinated with the provi-
                                 sion of public services and facilities so that desirable levels of
                                 service standards and community qualities important to the citi-
                                 zens are maintained. This Element addresses growth manage-
                                 ment issues on a local level, but emphasizes the need for growth
                                 to be managed in a broader regional context. The goals, policies,
                                 and plan contained in this Element stem from considerable
                                 background research, which is summarized in the Growth Man-
                                 agement Technical Report.
Purpose
                                 The primary purpose of the Growth Management Element is to
                                 ensure that growth and development are based on the City’s
                                 ability to provide an adequate traffic circulation system pursuant
                                 to the Orange County Division, League of California Cities’
                                 County-Wide Traffic Improvement and Growth Management
                                 Plan Component. This Element guides Seal Beach’s participa-
                                 tion in inter-jurisdictional and intra-jurisdictional planning ef-
                                 forts and establishes a goal to balance jobs and housing.
                                 Statewide, the Growth Management Element is an optional
                                 element of the General Plan. However, once adopted, this Ele-
                                 ment carries the same force and effect as a required element and
                                 must be internally consistent with other elements of the General
                                 Plan. The County of Orange mandates the adoption of a
                                 Growth Management Element in order to implement Measure
                                 M goals.
Scope and Content
                                 The Growth Management Element contains policies for plan-
                                 ning and providing traffic improvements necessary for orderly
                                 growth and development. This Element presents policies and

                                 standards, developing mitigation programs, and developing
                                 phasing policies. Also presented are goals and policies related to
                                 coordinating and cooperating with other jurisdictions to manage
                                 growth, and goals and policies related to the balance between
                                 jobs and housing in the City.
                                 This Element satisfies the growth management requirement of
                                 the Revised Traffic Improvement and Growth Management
                                 Ordinance (Measure M) of Orange County, and conforms to
                                 the guidelines for Growth Management Elements as set forth in
                                 the Countywide Growth Management Program Implementation
                                 Manual prepared by the County of Orange in April 1991.
                                 Seal Beach is a largely developed community with most of its in-
                                 frastructure already in place. For this reason it is considered a
                                 “developed community” for the purposes of Measure M. As a
                                 result, this Element does not need to address certain infrastruc-
                                 ture issues, such as fire, police, and library facilities, required to
                                 be addressed by developing communities.
Consistency with Other General Plan Elements and Related
Programs
                                 A major goal of the Growth Management Element is to ensure
                                 that planning, management, and implementation of traffic im-
                                 provements and public facilities are adequate to meet the cur-
                                 rent and projected needs of the City. While this goal is a high
                                 priority, it must be achieved while maintaining internal consis-
                                 tency among the other elements of the General Plan as required
                                 by state law. Therefore, the Growth Management Element does
                                 not replace or supersede any of the other General Plan Ele-
                                 ments; instead the Element addresses, amplifies, and supports
                                 the goals and policies that are included in the other General
                                 Plan elements and establishes new goals and policies where nec-
                                 essary.
                                 The Growth Management Element is implemented through
                                 various coordinated programs developed to support and carry
                                 out its goals, objectives, and policies. In addition, this Element
                                 minimizes duplication between Measure M and Congestion
                                 Management Program (CMP) requirements (see “Related Plans
                                 and Programs” below).

Related Plans and Programs
                                 Many federal, state, regional, and Orange County plans and laws
                                 affect growth management in the City. Broadly, they include:
                                 •      The Orange County Growth Management Plan
                                 •      The Southern California Association of Governments
                                        (SCAG) Growth Management Plan
                                 •      The South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP)

                                 Of all of these measures, Measure M will have the most direct
                                 and significant impact on the City’s Growth Management Ele-
                                 ment. Each of these plans and/or systems is described below.
       Orange County Growth Management Plan Element
                                 The stated purpose of the Orange County Growth Management
                                 Plan Element is to ensure that planning, management, and im-
                                 plementation of traffic improvements and public facilities are
                                 adequate to meet the current and projected needs of Orange
                                 County. The plan sets forth goals, objectives, policies, and im-
                                 plementation programs for growth management. The goals of
                                 the plan are summarized as follows:
                                      ... to reduce traffic congestion, ensure that adequate trans-
                                      portation facilities, public facilities, equipment and services
                                      are provided for existing and future residents and to pro-
                                      tect the natural environment of Orange County.
                                 Of the seven major policies in the Plan, the following five apply
                                 to the City of Seal Beach:
                                 1.     Development Phasing: Development will be phased ac-
                                        cording to Comprehensive Phasing Plans (CPPs) adopted
                                        by the County. Phasing will be linked to roadway and
                                        public facility capacities.
                                 2.     Balanced Community Development: Development will
                                        be balanced to encourage employment of local residents in
                                        employment and employee housing, in the County gener-
                                        ally, and in individual Growth Management Areas (GMAs).

Growth Management Element
                                 3.    Traffic Level of Service: This policy requires developers to
                                       make improvements to intersections significantly impacted
                                       by development. A Level of Service “D” must be attained at
                                       affected intersections. A “significant impact” is generally de-
                                       fined in terms of increases in intersection capacity utilization
                                       and levels of service. The policy also establishes a “deficient
                                       intersections list” and establishes a developer fee program to
                                       pay for improving affected intersections on a pro-rata basis.
                                 4.    Traffic Improvement Programs: The Plan provides for
                                       the establishment of a comprehensive traffic improvement
                                       program to ensure that all new development provides neces-
                                       sary transportation facilities and intersection improvements
                                       as a condition of development approval.
                                 5.    Public Facility Plans: The Plan requires comprehensive
                                       public facility plans for fire, sheriff/police, and library ser-
                                       vices. New development shall participate on a pro-rata basis.
                                 To implement its policies, the Plan sets forth four implementa-
                                 tion programs, including:
                                 1.    Growth Management Areas (GMAs): The plan calls for
                                       the establishment of growth management areas to imple-
                                       ment the comprehensive phasing plans.
                                 2.    Facility Implementation Plans (FIPs): These plans ad-
                                       dress the financing of transportation, police/sheriff, fire, li-
                                       brary facilities, and flood control for each GMA in accor-
                                       dance with the goals, objectives, and policies of the Growth
                                       Management Plan Element.
                                 3.    County-wide Implementation of Growth Management
                                       Plan: This involves an annual evaluation of compliance with
                                       development phasing, planned roadway and/or public facil-
                                       ity development, and maintenance of service levels.
                                 4.    Traffic Improvements/Facility Development Agree-
                                       ments: This program requires that any public service or traf-
                                       fic improvements implemented through development
                                       agreements must be consistent with the overall Orange
                                       County Growth Management Plan.
                                 The Orange County Growth Management Plan Element further
                                 provides that additional implementation programs may be de-
                                 veloped as deemed necessary by the County.

       SCAG Growth Management Plan
                                 The SCAG Growth Management Plan recommends ways to re-
                                 direct the region’s growth to minimize congestion and better
                                 protect the environment. While SCAG has no authority to
                                 mandate implementation of its Growth Management Plan, some
                                 of the Plan’s principal goals (such as improved jobs/housing
                                 balance) are being implemented through the Air Quality Man-
                                 agement Plan (AQMP) under the authority of the South Coast
                                 Air Quality Management District.
       South Coast Air Quality Management Plan
                                 The South Coast Air Quality Management Plan mandates a vari-
                                 ety of measures to reduce traffic congestion and improve air
                                 quality. Each iteration of the plan is an update of the previous plan
                                 and has a 20-year horizon. The 1997 Air Quality Management Plan
                                 was adopted by the Governing Board on November 15, 1996, and
                                 represents the current policy for achieving clean air objectives. A
                                 2003 Draft Air Quality Management Plan is currently under re-
                                 view. The City is subject to all AQMD requirements for local ju-
                                 risdictions.
       Assembly Bill 471 (Proposition 111)
                                 Assembly Bill (AB) 471, as subsequently modified by Assembly
                                 Bill 1791, requires every urbanized city and county with a popu-
                                 lation of 50,000 or more to adopt a Congestion Management
                                 Plan (CMP) to reduce traffic congestion. A city or county that
                                 does not comply with the CMP requirement will lose gasoline
                                 sales tax revenues to which it would otherwise be entitled. Seal
                                 Beach completed a CMP for its 1991 submittal to Orange
                                 County, and will continue to work with the County on annual
                                 updates to the CMP.
                                 The CMP requirements include traffic level of service (LOS)
                                 standards, a trip reduction program, and a 7-year capital im-
                                 provement program for traffic and transit. Many of the AB 471
                                 requirements are the same as or similar to the requirements of
                                 Measure M (discussed immediately below). The County has at-
                                 tempted to reconcile overlapping requirements through the

       Measure M
                                 Orange County voters approved Measure M in 1990 to allocate
                                 additional funds to provide needed transportation facilities in
                                 Orange County. Measure M specifically authorized a half cent
                                 retail sales tax increase for 20 years effective April 1, 1991. The
                                 monies received from Measure M will be returned to local juris-
                                 dictions for use on local and regional transportation improve-
                                 ments and maintenance projects. The tax is estimated to raise

Planned Transportation Improvements

                                 gion continue to grow, additional demands will be placed on the

Growth Management Issues, Needs, Opportunities,
and Constraints
                                 While the City of Seal Beach has nearly reached its capacity for
                                 new development, it must be recognized as part of a large, fast-
                                 growing region. The pace of City and regional new development
                                 has begun to outstrip the ability of infrastructure to adequately
                                 support that development. The Growth Management Element
                                 addresses issues associated with rapid growth, traffic congestion,
                                 and traffic facilities.
                                 •     The County’s constant rate of growth and the impacts of
                                       growth in adjacent jurisdictions throughout Los Angeles
                                       and Orange Counties have created a necessity for a re-
                                       gional approach to transportation growth management.
                                 •     A significant portion of transportation problems in the
                                       County stems from the inadequate capacity of the freeway
                                       system to serve peak period travel demands. This lack of
                                       capacity results in poor levels of service characterized by
                                       severe congestion and low travel speeds during peak
                                       hours. The most severe local congestion occurs at the
                                       junction of the I-405 and the I-605 Freeways.
                                 •     Arterial highways are intended to handle the bulk of intra-
                                       regional traffic and complement the freeway system and
                                       local street network. As congestion increases on the free-
                                       ways, more drivers utilize the arterial system, particularly
                                       those that parallel the freeway or those arterials serving
                                       the same trip destination as the freeway. Consequently,
                                       these arterials, such as Westminster Avenue and Pacific
                                       Coast Highway are becoming increasingly congested and
                                       receive heavy traffic volumes well in excess of their de-
                                       signed capacity. This situation is of special concern on
                                       those arterials that provide access to the freeway system.
                                 •     The City’s transportation system is greatly influenced by
                                       impacts on the I-405 Freeway and State Route 1 (Pacific
                                       Coast Highway) which run through the City.
                                 •     Traffic congestion in Seal Beach is as much a regional
                                       problem as it is a local problem. The development that
                                       occurs in neighboring jurisdictions and throughout the
                                       Los Angeles/Orange County region affects the freeways
                                       and many of the major arterial streets that traverse the

Traffic Congestion
                                 Traffic congestion is a problem on local streets, as well as arte-
                                 rials and regional freeways. In particular, heavy traffic volumes
                                 in Seal Beach exist along Westminster Avenue, Pacific Coast
                                 Highway, and Seal Beach Boulevard north of the San Diego (I-
                                 405) Freeway. Traffic volumes along the I-405 corridor are also
                                 extremely heavy and cause significant slowing near the intersec-
                                 tion with the I-605 Freeway.

Inter-Jurisdictional Coordination/Cooperation
                                  Traffic congestion in Seal Beach is both a regional and local
                                  problem. The development that occurs in neighboring juris-
                                  dictions and throughout the County has effects on the freeways
                                  and many of the major arterials that traverse the City of Seal
                                  Beach. Thus, the City cannot fully address growth management
                                  issues in isolation from other jurisdictions.
        Goal 3: Cooperate with Neighboring Jurisdictions and the County of
        Orange and County of Los Angeles to Achieve Reduction in Regional
        Traffic Congestion
                                  •      Policy 3.1 - The City shall participate in inter-jurisdictional
                                        planning forums within its established growth manage-
                                        ment areas as adopted by the Regional Advisory Planning

                                        tation or other planning issues.
                                  •      Policy 3.2 - The City will continue to cooperate with the
                                        County of Orange in annually updating its Congestion
                                        Management Plan pursuant to the requirements of AB
                                        471 in order to continue to receive its share of state gaso-
                                        line sales tax revenues.
Jobs/Housing Balance
                                  One of the major causes of traffic congestion is land use pat-
                                  terns that hinder the ability of people to live and work in the
                                  same area. Long commutes can over-burden traffic infra-
                                  structure and diminish quality of life. Creating communities
                                  where people can live and work in relatively close proximity
                                  shortens commutes and encourages the use of alternative forms
                                  of transportation to and from employment.
        Goal 4: Strive to Develop and Maintain a Balance between Jobs and
        Housing in Seal Beach
                                  •      Policy 4.1 - To the extent feasible, utilize information on
                                        the jobs/housing balance in the City and region as a factor
                                        in land use decision-making.

                                 Traffic Improvement and Growth Management Ordinance.

                                 Plan.
Traffic Level of Service Goals
                                 Policy 1.1 of this Element requires developers to make neces-
                                 sary improvements to the circulation system, which are affected
                                 by their development, so as to maintain acceptable LOS at inter-
                                 sections and on roadway links under City control. Roadway ex-
                                 pansions will be planned as part of the capital improvement
                                 program and phased according to the Comprehensive Phasing
                                 Program. The LOS goals will be enforced through coordination
                                 of approval conditions and monitored annually through a Per-
                                 formance Monitoring Program.
                                 Achievement of the adopted levels of service standard and im-
                                 plementation of exacted transportation improvements shall take
                                 into consideration extraordinary transportation circumstances
                                 that may impact identified intersections and/or timing of the
                                 required improvements. An example of an extraordinary cir-
                                 cumstance would be when arterial roadways serve as substitute
                                 freeway access (thus impacting LOS performance) while plan-
                                 ning and construction of additional freeway improvements are
                                 underway.
Development Mitigation Program
                                 The City has established a Development Mitigation Program
                                 based on Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA)
                                 time tables ensuring that all new development pays its share of
                                 needed transportation improvements to the City’s roadway net-
                                 work associated with that development. Participation shall be on
                                 a pro-rata basis and will be required of all development projects
                                 except where an increased level of participation exceeding these

Comprehensive Phasing Program
                                 The City shall prepare a Comprehensive Phasing Program
                                 (CPP) based on Orange County Transportation Authority time
                                 tables. The purpose of this Program is to assure, to the extent
                                 feasible, that adequate infrastructure (roadways and utilities) is
                                 constructed as development occurs by linking the ability of the
                                 development to proceed to:
                                 •      construction of the improvement(s) by others,
                                 •      construction of the improvement(s) by the developer, or
                                 •      by the developer’s timely provision of the appropriate
                                        funding to the City so that the provision of these facilities
                                        is in balance with the demand for need.
                                 While the Comprehensive Phasing Program will provide plans
                                 for new facilities, the Performance Monitoring Program will
                                 provide annual evaluation of compliance with phasing plans in
                                 order for development to continue. The CPP shall provide rea-
                                 sonable lead time (one year from first building permit or two
                                 years from first grading permit) to design and construct specific

                                 with development phasing allocations. Under this Program,
                                 roadway and other transportation facility improvements or
                                 funding must actually be provided in order for new develop-
                                 ment to continue. If the improvements/ funding are not pro-

Introduction
                                 The purpose of the Land Use Element is to designate the
                                 proposed general distribution, general location, and extent of
                                 uses within the City and to establish population density and
                                 building intensity standards. The Land Use Element provides
                                 a guide for better decision-making by the public and private
                                 sectors to direct growth and development of the community
                                 into the type of environment desired by its residents.
                                 Pursuant to California law, the Land Use Element serves as
                                 the long-range planning guide for development in the City by
                                 identifying and analyzing the location and extent of the de-
                                 velopment to be permitted. The Land Use Element estab-
                                 lishes the character and identity of Seal Beach over the next
                                 20 years.
Background
                                 Planning is the process of establishing guides for decision-
                                 making based on objectives determined by City policies. The
                                 Land Use Element is an outline, or a guide, for decision
                                 making by public and private sectors to direct the growth of
                                 either new construction or modernization of the community
                                 into a type of environment desired by its people.
                                 Adoption of the Land Use Element is not the end of the
                                 planning process, but only the beginning. Continued study,
                                 effort, support, and the commitment of public and private
                                 funds will be required to implement the provisions and poli-
                                 cies in the General Plan. The General Plan is a statement of
                                 current policy. If conditions change to the extent that land
                                 use or other policies require a change, the General Plan
                                 should be restudied in a comprehensive manner to make
                                 sure that the changes proposed do not alter the balance be-
                                 tween people and the facilities, utilities, and services that they
                                 require. Piecemeal change without in-depth study would re-
                                 duce the value of the General Plan and defeat its purpose.
                                 The time scale for development of many of the desirable or
                                 essential features of the General Plan may change considera-
                                 bly due to unforeseen events that may surface at a later date.
                                 The significant proposals, however, should not be lost or de-
                                 leted from the General Plan unless they prove undesirable or

Statutory Requirements
                                 Section 65302(a) of the Government Code requires a Land Use
                                 Element to designate the proposed general distribution and
                                 general location and extent of the uses of the land for hous-
                                 ing, business, industry, open-space including agriculture,
                                 natural resources recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty,
                                 education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid
                                 waste disposal facilities and other categories of public and
                                 private uses of land. The Land Use Element shall include a
                                 statement of the standards of population density and build-
                                 ing intensity recommended for various areas and other terri-
                                 tory covered by the plan. The Land Use Element shall iden-
                                 tify areas covered by the plan that are subject to flooding and
                                 shall be reviewed annually with respect to those areas. For
                                 Seal Beach, areas subject to flooding are addressed in the
                                 Safety Element.
Population Density
                                 As mandated in the State of California General Plan Guide-
                                 lines, this Land Use Element provides for population density
                                 standards. The City of Seal Beach consists of 11.51 square
                                 miles of land area and 1.72 square miles of water area for a
                                 total of 13.23 square miles of City land. The City’s current
                                 population is 24,157 residents. Based upon these numbers,
                                 the population density of the City is 2,099 residents per
                                 square mile. In addition, the City currently consists of 14,267
                                 residential units, which translates into 1,240 residential units
                                 per square mile. Over the past decade, the City of Seal Beach
                                 has experienced a slight population decline from 25,098 resi-
                                 dents in the 1990 Census to 24,157 residents in the 2000
                                 Census. In addition, the implementation of the Hellman
                                 Ranch Specific Plan Project would add new single-family
                                 homes and generate new residents to the City. The Bixby As-
                                 sisted Living Project will also provide new residential units
                                 for senior assisted living and conventional apartment units
                                 for seniors, which will result in an increase of an increase in
                                 overall city population as well. As a result, the population for
                                 the City at build out is estimated to increase slightly from the
                                 present population of approximately 24,157 to 24,810.

Land Use Element
                                 Demographic characteristics of Seal Beach have remained
                                 stable over the past two decades despite the slight decrease
                                 in population in the past decade. Incorporated in 1915 pri-
                                 marily as a farming community, the City has grown to a
                                 population of 24,157 in the year 2000 while still maintaining
                                 its small-town atmosphere and community values through
                                 the enhancement and maintenance of city facilities, buildings,
                                 and infrastructure. And by designing and implementing a
                                 general plan that preserves the history of the city, while em-
                                 bracing the progress of development and time. The City has
                                 been perceived as having a small town feel with a small town
                                 like population. This concept shall be preserved and en-
                                 hanced for future prosperity of the City as suggested by the
                                 General Plan Committee.
Building Intensity
                                 As mandated in the state’s General Plan Guidelines, local
                                 general plans must contain quantifiable standards of building
                                 intensity for each land use designation. These standards
                                 should identify the most intensive use that will be allowed
                                 under each designation. While the land use designation iden-
                                 tifies the types of allowable uses, the building intensity stan-
                                 dard will identify the concentration of use. Residential build-
                                 ing intensity is defined as the number and types of residential
                                 use per acre of land. Additional building intensity analysis is
                                 provided later in this Element.
                                 “Floor to Area Ratio” (FAR) is defined as the ratio between
                                 the amounts of gross floor area permitted to be constructed
                                 on a legal building lot and the size of the lot. In computing
                                 gross floor area of the building, the gross area confined
                                 within the exterior walls of the building shall be considered
                                 as the floor area of each floor of the building.
Non-Conforming Structures and Uses
                                 There are existing land uses within the City of Seal Beach
                                 that are inconsistent with the provisions set forth in this
                                 Element. These inconsistencies fall into two categories,
                                 1) inconsistencies associated with land use, and 2) inconsis-
                                 tencies associated with intensity and density. The alterations
                                 and additions to non-conforming structures, along with the
                                 continuation of existing non-conforming land uses, are per-

Related Plans and Programs
                                 A number of related plans and programs are considered in
                                 the formulation, adoption, and implementation of local land

                                 gional in nature. Regional planning agencies such as the
                                 Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
                                 recognize that planning issues extend beyond the boundaries
                                 of individual cities. Efforts to address regional planning is-
                                 sues such as air quality, transportation, and affordable hous-
                                 ing have resulted in the adoption of regional plans. The form
                                 and distribution of development in Seal Beach are affected
                                 by regional plans. Relevant local and regional plans related to
                                 the Land Use Element are discussed briefly below.
City of Seal Beach Zoning Ordinance
                                 The City of Seal Beach has adopted a Zoning Ordinance and
                                 related zoning map. The ordinance has been updated peri-
                                 odically to incorporate land use changes. The Zoning Ordi-
                                 nance is the primary implementation tool for the Land Use
                                 Element. Together, the Zoning Ordinance and the zoning
                                 map identify specific types of land use, intensity of use, and
                                 development and performance standards applicable to spe-
                                 cific areas and parcels of land within the City.
Local Coastal Program
                                 The California Coastal Act requires all cities and counties
                                 along the California coast to prepare a Local Coastal Pro-
                                 gram (LCP). An LCP is typically comprised of two compo-
                                 nents: a Coastal Land Use Plan and Implementing Actions
                                 (such as zoning ordinances and maps and identification of
                                 sensitive coastal resource areas). Seal Beach drafted a Coastal
                                 Land Use Plan in 1983, which was adopted by the City
                                 Council at that time. The Plan was submitted to the Coastal
                                 Commission for review; however, a number of comments
                                 were sent back from the Coastal Commission to the City.
                                 The Coastal Commission never adopted the Plan.
                                 A Local Coastal Program (LCP) exists for purposes of the
                                 regulation of City territory within the Coastal Zone. The
 City of Seal Beach General Plan                                                           LU-6

Land Use Element
                                 LCP generally addresses the following topics: public access
                                 and recreation, marine and land resources, shoreline struc-
                                 tures and hazards, new development, scenic and visual re-
                                 sources, and public works. The LCP is required to conform
                                 to the policies of Chapter 3 of the Coastal Act, which sets
                                 the standards for review of the LCP governed by Public Re-
                                 sources Code §30200. Although closely related to the plans and
                                 programs contained within the General Plan, the Local
                                 Coastal Program and its components are planned as separate
                                 governing documents.

Specific Plans
                                 Seal Beach has adopted several specific plans over the years
                                 to provide more detailed guidance for specific development
                                 sites throughout the City. Specific plans contain specific land
                                 uses, site development standards, and plans for circulation
                                 and infrastructure systems. Boundary maps for each specific
                                 plan are provided at the end of this element. The following
                                 adopted specific plans are discussed in greater detail
                                 throughout the Land Use Element.

Land Use Element
                                 The northernmost portion of Seal Beach abuts the Los
                                 Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB), which conducts
                                 military aviation operations. The Los Alamitos JFTB is ad-
                                 dressed in the present AELUP for the county and identifies
                                 planning constraints due to noise levels, hazard areas, and
                                 height limits associated with local military aviation activities.
                                 The Land Use Element and the Safety Element have been
                                 drafted for compliance with the current AELUP.
Air Installation Compatibility Use Zone (AICUZ) Study
                                 The AICUZ Study for the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Train-
                                 ing Base (JFTB) was completed in June 1995. The document,
                                 required by the Department of Defense AICUZ Program, is
                                 intended to inform the public and serve as a planning guide
                                 for the Department of Defense, the United States Army, the
                                 California National Guard, and local governments. The
                                 document focuses on identifying and examining impacts on
                                 adjacent communities associated with aircraft noise and air-

                                 is to identify existing or future land uses that are or could be-
                                 come incompatible with flight operations at the JFTB.

                                 implications for the land use composition for Seal Beach.
                                 The SCAG goals are generally reflected throughout all of the
                                 General Plan elements, including the Land Use Element.
South Coast Air Quality Management Plan

                                 mandates a variety of measures to improve air quality. To
                                 comply with the AQMP, the Land Use Element organizes
                                 land uses in relation to the circulation system, promotes

California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Guidelines
                                 The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was
                                 adopted by the state legislature in response to a public man-
                                 date for thorough environmental analysis of projects that
                                 might affect the environment. The provisions of state law
                                 and environmental review procedures are described in the
                                 CEQA Statutes and the CEQA Guidelines. Implementation
                                 of CEQA ensures that during the decision-making process
                                 for development, City officials and the general public will be
                                 able to identify and assess the environmental impacts associ-

Planning Areas
                                 To better understand the City of Seal Beach, a field and sta-
                                 tistical analysis was conducted to evaluate the issues and po-
                                 tentials for the community. To facilitate this analysis and to
                                 provide strategic referencing by City staff, the City is strate-
                                 gically divided into five Planning Areas. The Planning Areas
                                 enable the City to more specifically determine and consider
                                 future development by identifying potential land use issues
                                 that exists today or may arise in the future. The following
                                 discussion describes each Planning Area and identifies issues
                                 unique to each area.
Planning Area 1 - Old Town/Surfside
                                 Planning Area 1 encompasses approximately 331 gross acres
                                 of the City. The linear area includes downtown Seal Beach,
                                 the Department of Water and Power site, Surfside, and the
                                 Sunset Marina Park. Planning Area 1 is situated entirely in
                                 the California Coastal Zone. Planning Area 1 boundaries
                                 generally include the mouth of the San Gabriel River to the
                                 west, Pacific Coast Highway to the north, the communities
                                 of Sunset Beach and Huntington Beach to the east, and the
                                 Pacific Ocean to the south (Land Use - Figure 1).
       Downtown Seal Beach/Main Street Specific Plan
                                 The focal point of downtown Seal Beach is characterized by
                                 Main Street, the traditional commercial core of the city. The
                                 Main Street area provides for a pedestrian-oriented mix of
                                 offices and businesses, surrounded by an area of mixed hous-
                                 ing types and institutions. Although it is recognized that the
                                 area will have businesses that serve residents and visitors, the
                                 goal is to prevent the visitor-serving uses from overwhelming
                                 the area at the expense of the small town character. It is also
                                 recognized that, when the weather and beach conditions are
                                 attractive, the demand for parking may exceed the supply.

Land Use Element
                                 A primary issue for the Main Street area and surrounds is to
                                 provide for a mix of land uses that remain compatible and
                                 serve local and visitor needs. After much public participa-

                                 in 1996 to provide a vision document to preserve and en-

                                 Specific Plan provides specific direction regarding allowed
                                 land uses and operations, building and design provisions, and
                                 parking standards and management, to ensure compatibility

       Pacific Electric Right-of-Way Specific Plan
                                 Situated downtown, Electric Avenue follows the abandoned
                                 Pacific Electric right-of-way, which is 100 feet wide and ap-
                                 proximately 3,600 feet long. This area is slightly over 8 acres
                                 in size and is bounded by Electric Avenue (north), Seal
                                 Beach Boulevard, Electric Avenue (south), and Marina
                                 Drive. The City has acquired the abandoned railroad Right-
                                 of-Way (ROW), and a specific plan was prepared and
                                 adopted by the City Council. The City adopted the Pacific
                                 Electric ROW Specific Plan in 1974. The plan consists of
                                 two mini-plazas, a bus stop, a senior citizen center, a public
                                 library, a “Red Car” historic museum, a shaded park bench

                                 geles Gas and Electric Company (now the Department of
                                 Water and Power), this site has an excellent view of the Long

                                 Verdes. Considering these positive factors in combination
                                 with a high land value (attributed to location and access), this
                                 site has potential for visitor-serving land uses and open space
                                 land uses. The potential for the development of a hotel use is
                                 also deemed feasible for this site.

                                 Particular attention should be given to the question of pedes-

                                 To provide a comprehensive plan for this area, in 1996 the
                                 City revised the Department of Water and Power Specific
                                 Plan, which sets forth the land use development plan and
                                 general development standards for this area. Visitor-serving
                                 uses are limited to the northerly portion of the DWP parcel
                                 with permitted uses including a 150-room (maximum) hotel
                                 with conference facilities, restaurants, and retail/service uses.
                                 The lower portion of the site is designated for open space
                                 uses such as public parks, greenbelts, bike, and nature trails,

       Surfside Colony
                                 This area is bounded by Pacific Coast Highway, Anderson
                                 Street (Sunset Beach), the Pacific Ocean, and the Naval
                                 Weapons Station (Anaheim Bay). This residential area was
                                 subdivided in the early 1900s into three blocks of small lots
                                 as a private, gated community. Originally, small beach cot-
                                 tages were built and used as summer second homes. This
                                 area contains approximately 250 low-density residential
                                 homes. In recent past, this area has experienced recycling of
                                 properties from one-story second home beach cottages to
                                 custom three-story year-round residences.
                                 Vehicular access into Surfside Colony is restricted to resi-

                                 are not sufficiently wide for simultaneous two-way traffic.
                                 The public beach access along the Surfside Colony consists
                                 of 3,000 feet (0.56 mile) stretch of sand and beach. The sand

                                 feet. Pedestrian and bicycle access to the beach is available to
                                 the public at Anderson Street. Anderson Street is a ±100-

                                 Seal Beach Boulevard. This area was subdivided in the 1950s
                                 into 5,000-square-foot lots and is developed with 970 single-
                                 family dwelling units. Some of the lots were not developed
                                 when the property was subdivided. Over a period of ap-
                                 proximately 15 years, custom homes have been built on
                                 these lots. In addition to the residential development, there is
                                 a neighborhood shopping center fronting on Pacific Coast
                                 Highway and one public intermediate school in the area. The

                                 the north of San Diego (I-405) and Garden Grove (SR 22)
                                 Freeways and is bounded to the west generally by the San
                                 Gabriel River and to the east by the Valley View Road (Land
                                 Use - Figure 4). The Planning Area is predominantly devel-
                                 oped with single-family residential, commercial, and open
                                 space/ recreational uses. PA-4 is divided into four develop-
                                 ment areas: College Park West, College Park East, Old
                                 Ranch Towne Center, and Rossmoor Center.
       College Park West
                                 College Park West provides for 306 single-family residences
                                 with nearby park amenities including Edison Park and Col-
                                 lege Estates Park. The western edge of College Park West is
                                 defined by the San Gabriel River, with only a small park lo-
                                 cated west of the river. The Edison power easement gener-
                                 ally follows the alignment of the river along the east side and
                                 provides for regional power distribution lines. The only ac-
                                 cess to the College Park West neighborhood is through the
                                 City of Long Beach by using College Park Drive. This neigh-
                                 borhood is physically and psychologically separated from the
                                 rest of the City of Seal Beach by the surrounding freeway
                                 system.
                                 Issues for this portion of Planning Area 4 include a lack of
                                 identity with the City of Seal Beach. There does appear to be
                                 a psychological separation of this district from the City,
                                 mainly created by the physical boundaries of the freeways
                                 and the river. This does not mean that this problem cannot
                                 be resolved by means other than land use planning (e.g.,
                                 community activities, newsletters, etc.).

                                 This portion of Planning Area 4 is generally bounded by Seal

Planning Area 5 - Naval Weapons Station, Wetlands & Wildlife
Refuge
       U.S. Naval Weapons Station, Seal Beach
                                 In the early 1940s, with the United States’ entry into World
                                 War II, the demand for an ammunition handling and storage
                                 facility in the Southern California Area to service the Pacific
                                 Fleet was recognized. This resulted in increased shipping out
                                 of the San Diego and San Pedro harbors. Plans for a water-
                                 side naval weapons facility at Seal Beach and Anaheim Bay
                                 were finalized in December 1943, and operations began in
                                 November 1944.
                                 During the 1950s Orange County began to experience the
                                 impacts of urban sprawl, which extended southwards from
                                 Los Angeles. The land adjacent to the station, which was
                                 predominantly agricultural use, began to be developed as
                                 residential use.
                                 Planning Area 5 consists of the bulk of the City’s landmass,
                                 with 5,256 acres owned and operated by the Department of
                                 the Navy since it was acquired in 1944 (Land Use - Figure 5).
                                 The Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station is the largest and

Land Use Element
                                 The Naval Weapons Station site has experienced pressure for
                                 use of the land assets by non-governmental and occasionally
                                 governmental agencies. These non-mission-related interests
                                 in the 5,256-acre parcel have been especially acute due to its
                                 seaside location surrounded by urbanized metropolitan areas.
                                 Over the past two decades, urbanization surrounding the na-
                                 val station has resulted in increasing land use conflicts. The
                                 naval station is surrounded by residential, commercial, indus-
                                 trial, and open space. This has resulted in the increase of po-
                                 tential safety threats and the possibility of interfering with
                                 missions due to land use incompatibility affecting the safety,
                                 security, and operational support requirements associated
                                 with the daily functions of a naval weapons station. The Seal
                                 Beach Naval Weapons Station has established strategies to
                                 maintain and ensure that the surrounding land uses outside
                                 Planning Area 5 minimize land use compatibility conflicts.
                                 This is primarily accomplished through regular communica-
                                 tion with local jurisdictions to discuss issues of mutual con-
                                 cern and implementing the Land Use Compatibility Review
                                 Checklist to provide a basis for evaluating requests for use of
                                 Navy property.
                                 The Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station consists of over 280
                                 building structures on-site with approximately 1,506,707
                                 square feet of total floor area. These structures are divided
                                 between active operational and storage uses.

                                 Harbor provides a strategic ordnance transfer facility, which
                                 is possibly the most important west coast point for supplying
                                 the United States Navy Pacific Fleet with vital ordnance. Na-
                                 val vessels and civilian recreational boats share the Anaheim
                                 Bay inner harbor. This bay is the only navigable ocean access
                                 for civilian recreational boats leaving from the adjacent
                                 Huntington Harbor Complex, the Sunset Marina Park, and
                                 local public launch facilities. This inner harbor often be-

                                 life Refuge. The low coastal wetlands consist of a complex
                                 ecological system critical to numerous bird species. More
                                 than 200 bird species have been identified in this area that
                                 serves as valuable wildlife habitat. All forms of bird species
                                 throughout the year extensively utilize the tidal channel and
                                 mudflat habitats. There are five endangered and/or threat-

       Coastal Zone Management
                                 Approximately 3,280 acres out of the 5,256-acre Planning
                                 Area 5 are situated within the California Coastal Zone
                                 Boundary. However, under the Federal Coastal Zone Man-
                                 agement Act, all federal lands within the coastal zone are ex-
                                 empted from LCPs and local government permit authority.
                                 Projects on federal lands are required to only be consistent to
                                 the maximum extent feasible with state programs. Therefore,
                                 projects located within the Naval Weapons Station site are

                                 lands within the coastal zone boundary. Federal projects
                                 within the designated coastal boundaries would require sub-

Goals, Objectives, and Policies

                                 ized by Planning Area. Existing policies have been brought
                                 forward from previous General Plan amendments, and poli-
                                 cies have been updated or augmented to address issues as
                                 identified for each Planning Area.
Features of the Community
                                 Despite an increase in regional population experienced
                                 throughout the surrounding metropolitan area, the City of
                                 Seal Beach has experienced a slight decline in population
                                 while maintaining its own identity and preserving its unique
                                 character. Seal Beach’s individual small-town identity is due
                                 to its physical separation from various centers of urban de-
                                 velopment found in surrounding cities.
                                 People have been attracted to Seal Beach primarily due to its
                                 unique geographical location, educational opportunity, attrac-
                                 tive beaches, ideal climate, and small town friendly character.
                                 A goal of the City is to maintain and promote those social
                                 and physical qualities that enhance the character of the
                                 community and the environment in which we live.
Waterfront
                                 Seal Beach’s coastal setting distinguishes it from any adjacent
                                 coastal communities. The shoreline, one of the City’s most
                                 valuable assets, shall be maintained and improved to provide
                                 maximum benefits to residents and visitors. Preservation of
                                 the ecological balance of the waterfront and the marshlands
                                 should be considered during review of any proposed devel-
                                 opments in this planning area. In addition, the City of Seal

                                 vation and the more efficient utilization of the existing pier

Parks, Recreation, and Community Beautification
                                 An important goal of the City should be to acquire and de-
                                 velop recreational facilities at strategic locations throughout
                                 the community. Because open land is rapidly being devel-
                                 oped, acquisition of park sites should be accomplished at the
                                 earliest date. Development and maintenance of these sites
                                 should follow in a relatively short period of time. The City
                                 should cooperate with other governmental agencies to pro-
                                 mote a comprehensive plan of park acquisition and devel-

                                 A master plan should be developed for street tree planting
                                 and other community beautification programs with emphasis
                                 on major arterials entering the City.
Population
                                 Seal Beach has experienced a decrease in population of 3.7%
                                 during the past decade. Despite the minor decrease in City
                                 population experienced in the 2000 U.S. Census, the City will
                                 continue to provide support for its residents, maintain its in-
                                 frastructure and provide jobs and housing balance while still
                                 maintaining its small town atmosphere.
Housing
                                 For more than half a century, Seal Beach has grown and de-
                                 veloped. As a result, neighborhood identity is visible in the
                                 types of residential structures that have been constructed
                                 within various sections of the community. It is to be a goal
                                 of the City to preserve its low- and medium-density residen-
                                 tial character while still providing a wide choice of living ac-
                                 commodations and life styles for its residents.
Commercial
                                 The City should explore available means to support, encour-
                                 age, and balance commercial development within the city.
                                 Local, state, and federal facilities should be developed and
                                 maintained within or adjacent to business areas in the City.

Public Facilities
                                  The City should anticipate and maintain public service de-

                                  community and to promote the objectives of the City.
Industry
                                  Seal Beach should encourage development of non-noxious
                                  industrial land uses, such as research and development and
                                  other light industrial uses, in areas where such activities
                                  would be compatible with existing land uses. The City does

Residential Land Use
       Introduction
                                 Residential uses take many forms, varying from single-family
                                 homes, townhouses to apartment complex. The main differ-
                                 ences between each residential land use designation correlate
                                 to how each unit is designed and at what building intensity
                                 are they permitted to be built at given a specific setback re-
                                 quirement for each specific residential land use designation.
       Low Density Residential Proposals (minimum lot area of 5,000 square
       feet per dwelling unit)
                                 This density classification allows for the typical subdivision
                                 patterns found throughout Southern California.

                                        hoods. Due to the stability and excellent quality of these
                                        residential neighborhoods, it is not expected that there
                                        will be any significant change in these areas during the
                                        lifespan of the Land Use Element.
                                 Proposed Low Density Residential
                                        No additional low-density residential use is proposed
                                        for the City. The most recent low-density residential
                                        project approved by the City is the Hellman Ranch Spe-
                                        cific Plan Project, which is currently under construction
                                        and will add several single-family residential units to the
                                        City’s housing stock.
       Medium Density Residential Proposals (minimum lot area of 2,500
       square feet per dwelling unit; minimum lot area of 2,500 square feet per
       dwelling unit in Planning Area 1 south of Pacific Coast Highway)
                                 The medium density classification allows for a number of
                                 housing types: single family housing in clusters, town house

                                     Five medium-density areas exist in the City. All existing
                                     medium density areas are very stable, with only the me-
                                     dium density coastal area experiencing any significant
                                     changes. The change in this area is primarily due to the
                                     expansion of existing older bungalows or the demolition
                                     of an existing home and replacement with a new home.
                                     The lot development pattern in this area generally re-

                                     a minimum lot area of 2,500 square feet per dwelling
                                     unit. This lot area facilitated the consolidation of lots so

                                     development is the property on the northeast corner of
                                     Marina Drive and First Street currently designated for
                                     “Oil Extraction.” This area was previously used for an
                                     oil separation facility that separated oil and seawater
                                     pumped to the on-shore facilities from an offshore oil

                                     behind to the Rossmoor Center and apartment complex
                                     located in Planning Area one of the Coastal Area and

                                     Coastal Area where constant rebuilding is going on.
                                     This rebuilding can be attributed to three main reasons:
                                     the rising cost of land, the deterioration of older struc-

                                     comprises 125 trailer spaces, a small clubhouse and

Commercial Land Use

                                 The visual problem traditionally associated with commercial
                                 development is that each establishment is often conceived
                                 and designed as though it is to exist alone or in a vacuum.
                                 Each development is often designed with only its particular
                                 economic requirements in mind, using materials and signs
                                 with no regard for adjacent developments. Even if the estab-

                                 susceptible to visual clutter due to the lack of a design crite-

                                 ment could be achieved through the application of criteria
                                 ensuring compatible materials, colors, textures, and architec-

                                 The existing commercial areas of the City vary widely in their
                                 appeal to the various sectors of the community. The Ross-

                                 serve low-density single-family neighborhoods. The Leisure
                                 World shopping area serves Leisure World residents, and the
                                 Pacific Coast Highway commercial corridor serves local resi-
                                 dents and transient shoppers. The Main Street commercial

                                 be treated differently than any of the others due to the par-

                                 for the Main Street area to establish specific uses and design

                                 were developed in conjunction with the affected property
                                 owners and adopted in 1996. Over the years, the existing
                                 standards have not encouraged the desired climate for re-

                                 tional uses should be restricted to those that seem to fit the
                                 size, scale, and intensity of the existing development pattern
                                 of the community. The intent would be to encourage the

                                 From a planning and land use standpoint, the commercial
                                 and residential mixed uses would remain, which give the area
                                 its own characteristics and flavor. The residential densities
                                 and housing types would be more compatible with the exist-

                                 This combined commercial/residential use, while retaining
                                 the land use characteristics of the area, would offer some de-

       Service Commercial Land Uses
                                 The uses in this category would consist of commercial estab-
                                 lishments selling a broad range of convenience and con-
                                 sumer goods or providing a variety of personal services. The
                                 structures involved would usually be two main types:
                                 (1) those that are located along the streets with relatively
                                 heavy pedestrian traffic along the sidewalks, with the stores
                                 usually close to the right-of-way line, and (2) those estab-
                                 lishments to which the customer travels by automobile, and
                                 where the stores may be set back from the road, possibly in a
                                 unified development, to provide parking.
                                 Existing Service Commercial Uses
                                       Existing commercial areas that are designated “Service
                                       Commercial” by zoning classification include the Pacific
                                       Coast Highway commercial corridor (excluding the
                                       commercial area at Bolsa and Pacific Coast Highway,
                                       which is designated as General Commercial), the Seal

                                       occurring in these areas, only the Seal Beach Shopping

                                       the function of service commercial. Even though, by

                                       to redevelop as service commercial related uses. There

                                 −    Walkways - Walkways can guide the activities and
                                      movements of pedestrians, direct their attention, or
                                      prevent their intrusion on certain areas. The texture
                                      of the walkways is a very immediate and personal
                                      kind of experience for the pedestrian.
                                      The materials of walkways strongly influence usabil-
                                      ity and comfort; they can be patterned, textured,
                                      and colored. Smooth materials encourage walking,
                                      while rough surfaces inhibit walking. A change of
                                      texture in paving can cause a feeling of transition
                                      from space to space. An excitement can be created
                                      for the pedestrian, whether he is a casual shopper or
                                      directed toward a destination. Pedestrian lighting
                                      needs to be created to be more in tune with pedes-
                                      trian movement rather than vehicular travel. The

       General Commercial Land Use
                                     The proposed general commercial land use category is
                                     primarily a highway-oriented commercial use for auto-

                                     repair, motels and hotels, restaurants, and other related
                                     uses.
                                 Existing General Commercial Uses
                                     Some areas are classified “General Commercial” accord-
                                     ing to the current City ordinances. These are primarily
                                     auto service stations located on major arterials. The
                                     Rossmoor Center, by current zoning classification, is
                                     considered a general use, but in actual use it is a mixture
                                     of general and service uses. Because of the great number
                                     of general commercial uses, the Rossmoor Center area
                                     should remain as a general commercial classification.
                                     Old Ranch Towne Center located along the east side of
                                     Seal Beach Boulevard north of the San Diego Freeway
                                     provides a mixture of larger anchor retail businesses
                                     with smaller community serving retail and service uses.
                                     A small general commercial site is located on the west
                                     side of Seal Beach Boulevard directly adjacent to the
                                     north of the San Diego Freeway. Existing uses include
                                     high quality corporate and professional office and res-
                                     taurant uses. A benefit derived from this development is
                                     buffering of the Rossmoor neighborhoods from the
                                     noise generated from a portion of the San Diego Free-

                                 Oil extraction use had been occurring on the Hellman prop-
                                 erties since the early 1920s and is expected to continue for at
                                 least 25 years. As part of the approvals granted by the Cali-

                                 Plan, the oil production area has been consolidated into ap-
                                 proximately 50 acres to facilitate implementation of the
                                 Hellman Ranch Specific Plan. This oil extraction area is sub-
                                 ject to a 25-year deed restriction for wetland restoration that
                                 will become effective upon the abandonment of oil extrac-

Military Land Use
                                 The function of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station is to
                                 provide the Navy and Marine Operating forces with ordi-
                                 nance weapons and ammunition.
       Existing Military Use
                                 The Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station occupies approxi-
                                 mately 5,256 acres of land located on the eastern boundary
                                 of the Seal Beach community.
       Proposed Military Use
                                 The Naval Weapons Station plans to maintain the present
                                 operation for at least the life span of the Land Use Element.
                                 The Weapons Station can be viewed as a positive element in
                                 that it provides visual open space, a relief from urban devel-
                                 opment for the community. The Naval Station also provides
                                 a definite boundary “edge” for a major portion of Seal
                                 Beach.
                                 The Naval Weapons Station also serves as a necessary buffer
                                 for the preservation of the approximately 920-acre National

Implementation
Adoption
                                 The California State Conservation Planning and Zoning Act
                                 (Title 7, Chapter 3, Article 7) sets forth the procedure for the
                                 adoption of the Land Use Element.
                                 It is stated that the General Plan shall be adopted subsequent
                                 to:
                                 1.      A minimum of one public hearing before the City
                                         Planning Commission. Notice is to be given ten days
                                         prior to said hearing. (Additional public hearings may
                                         be held if necessary.)
                                 2.      Approval of the Plan shall be by resolution of the
                                         Commission carried by the affirmative votes of not
                                         less than a majority of the total-voting members.
                                 3.      The approved General Plan shall be transmitted to the
                                         City Council.
                                 4.      A minimum of one public hearing shall be held by the
                                         City Council. Notice is to be given ten days prior to
                                         said hearing. (Additional public hearings may be held if
                                         necessary.)
                                 5.      The Council shall adopt the General Plan by resolu-
                                         tion. If any part of the General Plan is changed by the
                                         Council, said change or changes shall be referred back
                                         to the Planning Commission for a report. Said report
                                         shall be made within 40 days of the referral. The Plan-
                                         ning Commission need not hold additional public
                                         bearings on the changes.
                                 6.      The Land Use Element shall be endorsed (signed) by
                                         the legislative body to show that it has been adopted.
                                 7.      A copy of the adopted plan shall be sent to the plan-
                                         ning agency of the County.
                                 Amending the General Plan follows the same procedure as
                                 that established for adoption.

Land Use Element
Rezoning
                                 State law requires that the City zoning map and ordinance
                                 must be in conformance with the Land Use Element map.
                                 The intent of this law is to ensure that as development oc-
                                 curs it will be in conformance with both the zoning map and
                                 the Land Use Map. In the past, new development could be
                                 granted a zoning change that was possibly not in accord with
                                 the General Land Use Plan and therefore created a rather
                                 piecemeal approach to planning.
                                 Where needed, the City of Seal Beach is planning to revise
                                 the zoning map and ordinance to conform to the Land Use
                                 Element following the adoption of the Land Use Element.
       Existing Zoning Ordinance
                                 As discussed previously, the zoning ordinance will have to be
                                 reviewed to determine whether the standards and regulations
                                 are in conflict with the Land Use Element. Where conflict
                                 arises, the zoning ordinance and map should be revised to
                                 reflect the requirements of the Land Use Element. Areas in
                                 the zoning ordinance and the Land Use Element may be in
                                 general agreement, but the zoning ordinance will need to be
                                 strengthened to add support to the Land Use Element. This
                                 type of analysis can be carried out with an in depth revision
                                 of the zoning ordinance and map. This revision process
                                 should include:
                                      1.     Updated standards and development criteria.
                                      2.     Workshop sessions with elected officials and citi-
                                             zens to determine the goals to be achieved.
                                      3.     Public bearings on the proposed revisions.
       Design Review Procedure
                                 In the future, if necessary, the City can establish a Design
                                 (Architectural) Review Board to review all applications for
                                 the construction of new buildings. The goal of such a pro-
                                 gram is to improve site planning, and to generate a higher
                                 quality of appearance of structures and landscaping by the
                                 private and public sectors. This program could easily be en-
                                 acted for the Coastal Area where the higher densities require
                                 some sense of order.

 (12/03)
Land Use Element
                                 Design (Architectural) criteria may include the following:
                                       1.    Building materials will be of a character deemed
                                             compatible with a beach environment (wood,
                                             brick, etc.).
                                       2.    Roofs shall have a low pitch with no flat roofs.
                                             (Flat roofs create a boxlike appearance.)
                                       3.    Where colors are used, they will not be harsh or
                                             unharmonious.
                                 The preceding design criteria are of a general nature and
                                 should be developed for the particular community of Seal
                                 Beach, with the unique environment of the beach in mind.
                                 The design criteria would then be enforced through provi-
                                 sions in the zoning ordinance.
Capital Improvements Program
                                 One of the most important tools for implementing the Land
                                 Use Element is a program for capital improvements.
                                 A priority system should be established to determine which
                                 projects within this Land Use Element are to be specifically
                                 planned for and developed within the context of this Plan. It
                                 is then the responsibility of the City Administrator to make a
                                 final determination as to which projects will be included in
                                 the fiscal budget for submission to the City Council. For ex-
                                 ample, the development of the County Flood Basin should
                                 be developed for joint park and flood basin uses.
Specific or Precise Plans
                                 Government Code §65450, et seq. authorizes the preparation
                                 and adoption of specific plans. Section 65451 of the Govern-
                                 ment Code provides as follows:
                                       Such specific plans shall include all detailed regulations,
                                       conditions, programs and proposed legislation which
                                       shall be necessary or convenient for the systematic im-

                                       in §65302, including, but not limited to, regulations,
                                       conditions, programs and proposed legislation in regard

Redevelopment Agency
                                 California law provides a means for a city to redevelop run-
                                 down or blighted areas with or without the assistance of a
                                 federal subsidy.
                                 This procedure has been used effectively by the City of Seal
                                 Beach in setting up the Seal Beach Redevelopment Agency,
                                 and in particular, the “Riverfront Redevelopment Project.”
                                 Through this vehicle, the City has managed to acquire a ma-

Local Coastal Plan
                                 The 1976 California Coastal Act requires that each city and
                                 county within the state’s coastal zone prepare a Local Coastal
                                 Program (LCP). The LCP is defined by the Coastal Act as
                                 being the local government’s land use plan, zoning ordinance

                                 sion, primary authority for issuance of coastal development
                                 permits become the responsibility of the local government.
                                 The certified LCP then becomes binding on all private and
                                 governmental developments in the coastal zone.
                                 The heart of the Coastal Act is found in Chapter 3, Coastal
                                 Resources Planning and Management Policies. These policies
                                 constitute the standards that local plans must meet in order
                                 to be certified by the state, as well as the yardstick for evalu-
                                 ating proposed developments within the coastal zone. Key
                                 issues covered in the Local Coastal Plan include beach ac-
                                 cess, recreation, locating and planning new development, and
                                 parking. In essence, these policies are the guidelines for fu-
                                 ture growth and development in the coastal zone.
                                 The City’s LCP is a separate planning document from the
                                 General Plan. However, LCP land use policies and issues are
                                 closely coordinated with and consistent with the General
                                 Plan.

Introduction
                                 The Noise Element follows the revised state guidelines in the
                                 California Government Code §653021(g) and §46050.1 of the
                                 Health and Safety Code. The element quantifies the community
                                 noise environment in terms of noise exposure contours for
                                 near-term and long-term levels of growth and traffic activity.
                                 The information will become a guideline for the development of
                                 land use policies to achieve compatible land uses and provide
                                 baseline levels and noise source identification for local Noise
                                 Ordinance enforcement. The Noise Element is organized as fol-
                                 lows:
                                     •    2.0 Noise Environment/Issue Analysis
                                     •    3.0 Goals, Objectives, and Policies
                                     •    4.0 The Plan for Control and Management of Noise
                                     •    5.0 Glossary
Purpose
                                 The Noise Element of a General Plan is a comprehensive pro-
                                 gram for including noise control in the planning process. It is a
                                 tool for local planners to use in achieving and maintaining com-
                                 patible land use with environmental noise levels. The Noise
                                 Element identifies noise sensitive land uses and noise sources,
                                 and defines areas of noise impact for the purpose of developing
                                 programs to ensure that Seal Beach residents will be protected
                                 from excessive noise intrusion.
Authorization
                                 The State of California has mandated that each county and city
                                 prepare a Noise Element as part of its General Plan. Section
                                 65302(g) of the California Government Code requires specifically:
                                     (g) A Noise Element shall identify and appraise noise prob-
                                     lems in the community. The noise element shall recognize
                                     the guidelines established by the Office of Noise Control in
                                     the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze
                                     and quantify, to the extent practicable, as determined by the
 City of Seal Beach General Plan                                                                N-1

                                                 maintenance functions related to airport operation.
                                            •    Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to,

                                            •    Noise contours shall be shown for all sources and
                                                 stated in terms of community noise equivalent level
                                                 (CNEL) or day-night average level (LDN). The
                                                 noise contours shall be prepared on the basis of
                                                 noise monitoring or following generally accepted
                                                 noise modeling techniques for the various sources
                                                 identified above. The noise contours shall be used
                                                 as a guide for establishing a pattern of land uses in
                                                 the land use element that minimizes the exposure of
                                                 community residents to excessive noise. The Noise
                                                 Element shall include implementation measures and
                                                 possible solutions that address existing and foresee-
                                                 able noise problems, if any. The adopted noise ele-
                                                 ment shall serve as a guideline for compliance with
                                                 the state’s noise insulation standards.
                                 The State Guidelines for Preparation and Content of Noise
                                 Elements of the General Plan indicates that the Noise Element
                                 should present the noise environment in terms of noise con-
                                 tours. For those areas identified as containing noise sensitive fa-
                                 cilities, the noise environment is determined by monitoring.
Definition of Noise
                                 Sound is technically described in terms of the loudness (ampli-
                                 tude) of the sound and frequency (pitch) of the sound. The
                                 standard unit of measurement of the loudness of sound is the
 City of Seal Beach General Plan                                                                      N-2

Noise Element
                                 Decibel (dB). Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to
                                 sound at all frequencies, a special frequency-dependent rating
                                 scale has been devised to relate noise to human sensitivity. The
                                 A-weighted decibel scale (dBA) performs this compensation by
                                 discriminating against frequencies in a manner approximating
                                 the sensitivity of the human ear.
                                 Decibels are based on the logarithmic scale. The logarithmic
                                 scale compresses the wide range in sound pressure levels to a
                                 more usable range of numbers in a manner similar to the Rich-
                                 ter scale used to measure earthquakes. In terms of human re-
                                 sponse to noise, a sound 10 dBA higher than another is judged
                                 to be twice as loud; and 20 dBA higher four times louder, and
                                 so forth. Everyday sounds normally range from 30 dB (very
                                 quiet) to 100 dB (very loud). Examples of various sound levels
                                 in different environments are shown in Figure N-1.
                                 Noise has been defined as unwanted sound, and it is known to
                                 have several adverse effects on people. From these known ef-
                                 fects of noise, criteria have been established to help protect the
                                 public health and safety and prevent disruption of certain hu-
                                 man activities. These criteria are based on such known impacts
                                 of noise on people as hearing loss, speech interference, sleep in-
                                 terference, physiological responses, and annoyance. Each of
                                 these potential noise impacts on people is briefly discussed in
                                 the following narratives.
                                 •    HEARING LOSS is not a concern in community noise
                                      problems of this type. The potential for noise-induced hear-
                                      ing loss is more commonly associated with occupational
                                      noise exposures in heavy industry or very noisy work envi-
                                      ronments. Noise levels in neighborhoods, even in very
                                      noisy airport environs, are not sufficiently loud to cause
                                      hearing loss.
                                 •    SPEECH INTERFERENCE is one of the primary con-
                                      cerns in environmental noise problems. Normal conversa-
                                      tional speech is in the range of 60 to 65 dBA, and any noise
                                      in this range or louder may interfere with speech. There are
                                      specific methods of describing speech interference as a
                                      function of distance between speaker and listener and voice
                                      level.

                                      disturbance studies have identified interior noise levels that
                                      have the potential to cause sleep disturbance. Note that
                                      sleep disturbance does not necessarily mean awakening
                                      from sleep, but can refer to altering the pattern and stages
                                      of sleep.
                                 •    PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES are those measurable
                                      effects of noise on people which are realized as changes in
                                      pulse rate, blood pressure, etc. While such effects can be in-
                                      duced and observed, the extent is not known to which these
                                      physiological responses cause harm or are signs of harm.
                                 •    ANNOYANCE is the most difficult of all noise responses
                                      to describe. Annoyance is a very individual characteristic
                                      and can vary widely from person to person. What one per-
                                      son considers tolerable can be quite unbearable to another
                                      of equal hearing capability.
Background on Standards
                                 Community noise is generally not a steady state and varies with
                                 time. Under conditions of non-steady state noise, some type of
                                 statistical metric is necessary to quantify noise exposure over a
                                 long period of time. Several rating scales have been developed
                                 for describing the effects of noise on people. They are designed
                                 to account for the above known effects of noise on people.
                                 Based on these effects, the observation has been made that the
                                 potential for noise to impact people is dependent on the total
                                 acoustical energy content of the noise. A number of noise scales
                                 have been developed to account for this observation. These
                                 scales are the: Equivalent Noise Level (LEQ), the Day Night
                                 Noise Level (LDN), and the Community Noise Equivalent
                                 Level (CNEL). These scales are described in the following para-
                                 graphs.
                                 •    LEQ is the sound level corresponding to a steady-state
                                      sound level containing the same total energy as a time-
                                      varying signal over a given sample period. LEQ is the “en-

                                      ized by 10 dB. This penalty was selected to attempt to ac-
                                      count for increased sensitivity to noise during the quieter
                                      period of day where sleep is the most probable activity.
                                 •    CNEL is similar to the LDN scale except that it includes an
                                      additional 5 dBA penalty for events that occur during the
                                      evening (7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) time period. Either LDN
                                      or CNEL may be used to identify community noise impacts
                                      within the Noise Element. Examples of CNEL noise levels
                                      are presented in Figure N-2.
                                 The public reaction to different noise levels varies from com-
                                 munity to community. Extensive research has been conducted
                                 on human responses to exposure of different levels of noise.
                                 Community noise standards are derived from tradeoffs between
                                 community response surveys, such as this, and economic con-
                                 siderations for achieving these levels.

                                 as the CNEL scale. To account for intermittent noise, another
                                 method to characterize noise is the Percent Noise Level (L%).
                                 The Percent Noise Level is the level exceeded X% of the time
                                 during the measurement period.
                                 Noise ordinances are typically specified in terms of the percent
                                 noise levels. Ordinances are designed to protect people from
                                 non-transportation-related noise sources such as music, machin-

                                 in the following paragraphs, are all based upon cumulative noise
                                 criteria such as LEQ, LDN, or CNEL.
                                 In March 1974 the Environmental Protection Agency published
                                 “Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to

                                 “levels document” does not constitute a standard specification
                                 or regulation, but identifies safe levels of environmental noise
                                 exposure without consideration for economic cost for achieving
                                 these levels.
                                 The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has adopted and
                                 published noise abatement criteria for highway construction
                                 projects. The noise abatement criteria specified by the FHWA
                                 are in terms of the maximum one hour Noise Equivalent Level
                                 (LEQ). The FHWA noise abatement criterion basically estab-

Noise Environment/Issue Analysis
Key Issues
                                 1.     Transportation Noise Control - Within the City of Seal
                                        Beach are a number of transportation related noise
                                        sources, including freeways, major arterials, and collector
                                        roadways. These sources are the major contributors of
                                        noise in Seal Beach. Cost-effective strategies to reduce
                                        their influence on the community noise environment are
                                        an essential part of the Noise Element.
                                 2.     Community Noise Control for Non-Transportation
                                        Noise Sources - Residential land uses and areas identified
                                        as noise sensitive must be protected from excessive noise
                                        from non-transportation sources, including commercial
                                        and industrial operations. These impacts are most effec-
                                        tively controlled through the adoption and application of
                                        a City Noise Ordinance.
                                 3.     Noise and Land Use Planning Integration - Informa-
                                        tion relative to the existing and future noise environment

                                        use compatibility guidelines are presented, as well as
                                        guidelines for new developments.
Existing Noise Environment
                                 This section contains a detailed description of the current noise
                                 environment within the City. This description of the noise envi-
                                 ronment is based on an identification of noise sources and noise
                                 sensitive land uses, a community noise measurement survey, and
                                 noise contour maps.
                                 The predominant noise source in Seal Beach originates from
                                 motor vehicles. Several major arterial roadways pass through the
                                 City, including the San Diego Freeway (I-405), the San Gabriel
                                 River Freeway (I-605), the Garden Grove Freeway (SR 22), Pa-
                                 cific Coast Highway, and arterial roadways. In addition, noise
                                 levels within the City are affected by overflights from military

                                 aircraft. To completely assess the noise environment in the City,
                                 noise sensitive receptors must also be identified. As mandated
                                 by the state, noise sensitive receptors include, but are not limited
                                 to, residential areas, areas containing schools, hospitals, rest
                                 homes, long-term medical or mental care facilities, or any other
                                 land use areas deemed noise sensitive by the local jurisdiction.
       Noise Measurements
                                 Ten sites were selected for measurement of the noise environ-
                                 ment in Seal Beach. The measurement locations are presented in
                                 Figure N-4. Discussions with City staff and identification of ma-
                                 jor noise sources in the community provided the initial base for
                                 development of the community noise survey. The measurement
                                 locations were selected on the basis of proximity to major noise
                                 sources and noise sensitivity of the land use.
                                 The Seal Beach Noise Element measurement survey utilized a
                                 Bruel and Kjaer Model 2236 Portable Noise Monitor. This in-
                                 strument automatically calculates the Equivalent Noise Level
                                 (LEQ), maximum noise levels and percentile noise levels for any
                                 specific time period. The system was calibrated with a Bruel and
                                 Kjaer calibrator with calibration traceable to the National Bu-
                                 reau of Standards. Calibration for the calibrator is certified
                                 through the duration of the measurements by Bruel & Kjaer.
                                 This system satisfies the ANSI (American National Standards
                                 Institute) Standards 1.4 for Type 1 precision noise measurement
                                 instrumentation.
       Measurement Results
                                 The noise measurement program was conducted on Novem-
                                 ber 20, 2002 at 10 locations throughout the City. The results of

                                 1. The measurement data also identifies the primary noise
                                 source affecting the noise environment. The quantities meas-
                                 ured were the Equivalent Noise Level (LEQ).

                                    The noise measurements results indicate that the sites impacted
                                    by Pacific Coast Highway, Seal Beach Boulevard, Westminster
                                    Avenue, Lampson Avenue, and Almond (both adjacent to the
                                    freeway) experience noise levels of greater than 65 CNEL. It
                                    must be noted that these levels account for traffic noise as well
                                    as any other ambient noise in the environment. The noise levels
                                    measured are typical of urban environments. The LEQ noise
                                    levels measured are roughly equivalent to the CNEL noise levels
                                    that would occur at these same locations.
                                    At all sites traffic noise was the primary noise source. Sites D, E,
                                    G, H, I, and J all experienced noise levels greater than 65 dBA
                                    (LEQ). All of these sites are along major roadways including Pa-
                                    cific Coast Highway, Seal Beach Boulevard, Westminster Ave-
                                    nue, and the 405 Freeway. All measurements, except Site I (lo-
                                    cated at the Old Ranch Country Club), were conducted at the
                                    property line of a residence with no intervening noise barriers. If
                                    these measurements had been conducted within the property
                                    line behind a noise barrier, a 5 dB reduction would result. Sites
                                    A, B, C, and F all experienced noise levels of less than 65 dBA
                                    (LEQ). All of these sites are along secondary roadways. Secon-
                                    dary roadways generate fewer vehicles at lower speeds than the
                                    major roadways impacting Sites D, E, G, H, I, and J.

       Existing Noise Sources and Levels
                                 The noise environment in Seal Beach was determined through
                                 the employment of a comprehensive noise measurement survey
                                 of existing noise sources and incorporating these results into
                                 computer noise models to model the noise environment (it is, of
                                 course, impossible to measure future noise levels, so we must
                                 rely on computer noise models for future noise estimates).
                                 The noise environment is commonly presented graphically in
                                 terms of lines of equal noise levels, or noise contours. The fol-
                                 lowing paragraphs detail the methodology used in the measure-
                                 ment survey and computer modeling of these results into noise
                                 contours. The noise environment for Seal Beach can be de-
                                 scribed using noise contours developed for the major noise
                                 sources within the City. The major noise source impacting the
                                 City is traffic noise. Existing and future noise contour maps
                                 have been developed for the City as part of this noise element.
                                 In addition aircraft noise is addressed.
                                 The traffic data used to project these noise levels are derived
                                 from the Circulation Element for the City prepared by
                                 Kunzman Associates and from Caltrans. The traffic mixes and
                                 time distributions for the arterials are presented on the follow-
                                 ing page in Table 2. The arterial traffic mix data is based on
                                 measurement surveys in Southern California and are considered
                                 typical for arterials in this area. The freeway traffic mix data was
                                 obtained from the “2001 Annual Average Daily Truck Traffic
                                 on the California State Highway System” published by Caltrans.
                                 The traffic noise contours for existing conditions are presented
                                 in a tabular format in Table 3 and shown in Figure N-5. The 60,
                                 65, and 70 CNEL contour levels are shown on the map. These
                                 traffic noise levels were computed using the Highway Noise
                                 Model published by the Federal Highway Administration
                                 (:FHWA Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model,” FHWA-
                                 RD-77-108, December 1978). The FHWA Model uses traffic
                                 volume, vehicle mix, vehicle speed, and roadway geometry to
                                 compute the LEQ noise level. A computer code has been writ-
                                 ten that computes equivalent noise levels for each of the time
                                 periods used in CNEL. Weighting these noise levels and sum-
                                 ming them results in the CNEL for the traffic projections used.

Noise Element
                                 Based on current traffic levels, the only areas of the City that
                                 experience noise levels in excess of 65 CNEL are along Pacific
                                 Coast Highway, Seal Beach Boulevard, Westminster Avenue,
                                 and all freeways. The remaining portions of the City experience
                                 noise levels generally of 60 CNEL or less. Much of the land uses
                                 along these roadways are commercial or business uses that are
                                 generally considered insensitive to noise. However, single-family
                                 and multi-family residential uses along these roadways are con-
                                 sidered noise sensitive. In particular, the residential noise sensi-
                                 tive area can be defined as a “rear yard area” for the exterior en-
                                 vironment and a “habitable room” for the interior environment.
                                 The majority of the residential areas are protected from traffic
                                 noise by existing noise barriers. These existing noise barriers
                                 along major arterials consist of masonry block walls varying in
                                 height from approximately 5.0 to 8.0 feet. Existing noise barri-
                                 ers along freeways are significantly taller.
                                 The residential area experiencing traffic noise levels greater than
                                 65 CNEL but not protected by a noise barrier is along Pacific
                                 Coast Highway at the Surfside community north of Anderson
                                 Street. These residences consist of “side yards” or “patio areas”
                                 (a lesser defined residential exterior living area).
                                 Aircraft flyovers occur over the City several times throughout
                                 the week. The aircraft are military flight operations generated
                                 from the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base and the Long
                                 Beach Airport.
                                 The Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base aircraft flights oc-
                                 cur over residential and other noise sensitive land uses within
                                 the City. The CNEL noise contours were obtained from the
                                 1994 Air Insulation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) Study (see
                                 Figure N-5 and Figure N-6). The AICUZ document was pre-
                                 pared by the California National Guard. Residential noise-
                                 sensitive areas north of the 405 Freeway experience aircraft-
                                 generated noise levels greater than 65 CNEL.
                                 The 65 CNEL noise contour for Long Beach Airport is located
                                 approximately 3 miles outside the City of Seal Beach boundary.
                                 Therefore, aircraft noise generated from the Long Beach Air-
                                 port will not have a significant impact on residential and other
                                 noise sensitive land uses within the City. These contours were
                                 obtained from the Long Beach Airport year 2000 quarterly re-
                                 port.

       Noise Sensitive Land Uses
                                 The most noise sensitive land use in Seal Beach is residential
                                 development. It is considered especially noise sensitive because
                                 (1) considerable time is spent by individuals at home,
                                 (2) significant activities occur outdoors, and (3) sleep distur-
                                 bance is most likely to occur in a residential area. Additionally,
                                 the City of Seal Beach has a number of public and private edu-
                                 cational facilities that are considered noise sensitive. The loca-
                                 tion of residential areas, schools, and parks are shown on the
                                 General Plan. The distribution of these facilities varies from
                                 quiet residential areas to major arterial roadways. The majority
                                 of schools and parks experience noise levels below 65 CNEL.
                                 J.H. McGaugh Elementary School is impacted by Seal Beach
                                 Boulevard traffic noise of greater than 65 CNEL. Likewise, a
                                 portion of Edison Park is impacted by freeway traffic noise lev-
                                 els of greater 65 CNEL.
                                 Noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure, just as
                                 the contour lines on a topographic map are lines of equal eleva-
                                 tion. The contours shown on the maps are the 70, 65, and 60
                                 CNEL noise level for traffic noise contours. The noise contours
                                 presented should be used as a guide for land use planning. The
                                 60 CNEL contour defines the Noise Referral Zone. This is the
                                 noise level for which noise considerations should be included
                                 when making land use policy decisions. The 65 CNEL contour
                                 describes the areas for which new noise sensitive developments
                                 will be permitted only if appropriate mitigation measures are in-
                                 cluded such that the standards contained in this Element are
                                 achieved.
                                 The contours presented in this report are a graphic representa-

Future Noise Environment
       Noise Sources and Levels
                                 Future traffic noise levels have been computed using the
                                 FHWA Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model. Projected
                                 traffic volumes for arterial roadways were obtained from the
                                 Circulation Element for the City prepared by Kunzman Associ-
                                 ates. Projected traffic volumes for freeways were calculated at a
                                 10% increase in volume. Table 4 and Figure N-6 on page 21
                                 show the projected traffic noise contours to occur following
                                 buildout of the proposed general plan.
                                 Based on future traffic levels the only areas of the City that ex-
                                 perience noise levels in excess of 65 CNEL are along Pacific
                                 Coast Highway, Seal Beach Boulevard, Westminster Avenue,
                                 and all freeways. As mentioned previously, the remaining por-
                                 tions of the City experience noise levels generally of 60 CNEL
                                 or less with the exception of the areas discussed in the Existing
                                 Noise Sources and Levels Section of this element.
                                 A 3-dBA increase in noise levels is often noticeable to residents.
                                 An increase of twice the existing traffic volume (ADT) results to
                                 an increase in traffic noise levels of 3 dBA. A roadway that has
                                 3,000 ADT and goes up to 6,000 ADT will experience a CNEL
                                 increase of 3 dBA, as well as a roadway that goes from 20,000
                                 ADT to 40,000 ADT. Obviously, the roadway with 40,000 ADT
                                 will be much louder than a 6,000 ADT roadway, but residents
                                 along either roadway will perceive the noise as increasing signifi-
                                 cantly.
                                 Two areas experience an increase in noise of near or greater
                                 than 3 dB. The first area is at 1st Street between Marina Drive
                                 and Pacific Coast Highway. This area consists of single- and
                                 multi-family residences. There are sound walls at the single-
                                 family residences. These areas will experience future traffic noise
                                 levels of less than 65 CNEL. The second area is at Pacific Coast
                                 Highway at the north City limit to 1st Street. This area consists
                                 of commercial land use. These areas will experience future traf-
                                 fic noise levels of greater than 65 CNEL.

Noise Element
                                 As previously discussed, the sources of noise in Seal Beach can
                                 be divided into two basic categories: transportation sources
                                 (primarily traffic) and non-transportation sources. A local gov-
                                 ernment has little direct control of transportation noise at the
                                 source. State and federal agencies have the responsibility to con-
                                 trol the noise from the source, such as vehicle noise emission
                                 levels. The most effective method the City has to mitigate trans-
                                 portation noise is through reducing the impact of the noise onto
                                 the community (e.g., noise barriers and site design review). Miti-
                                 gation through the design and construction of a noise barrier
                                 (wall, berm, or combination wall/berm) is the most common
                                 way of alleviating traffic noise impacts.
                                 The effect of a noise barrier is critically dependent on the ge-
                                 ometry between the noise source and the receiver. A noise bar-
                                 rier effect occurs when the “line of sight” between the source
                                 and receiver is penetrated by the barrier. The greater the pene-
                                 tration, the greater the noise reduction.
       Noise/Land Use Compatibility
                                 Noise concerns should be incorporated into land use planning
                                 to reduce future noise and land use incompatibilities. This is
                                 achieved by establishing standards and criteria that specify ac-
                                 ceptable limits of noise for various land uses throughout the
                                 City. These criteria are designed to integrate noise considera-
                                 tions into land use planning to prevent noise/land use conflicts
                                 and used to assess the compatibility of proposed land uses with
                                 the noise environment (Figure N-3) on page 9.
                                 The most effective method to control community noise impacts
                                 from non-transportation noise sources is through application of
                                 the Community Noise Ordinance. The City of Seal Beach cur-
                                 rently has a noise ordinance. Continued enforcement of the or-
                                 dinance will provide noise control for noise-sensitive land uses.

Goals and Objectives
Goals
                                 A beach town should be a quiet place where one can hear the
                                 surf and the wind. Reduce the level of noise, so that it causes
                                 less human stress or health damage, is not as likely to interfere
                                 with human activities such as sleep, work, play, or thought, and
                                 allow the peaceful existence of wildlife and pets.
Objectives
                                 The identification in quantitative, numerical terms of existing
                                 and projected noise levels, noise sources, and noise-sensitive
                                 land uses in the City of Seal Beach.
                                 Establishment of appropriate criteria and guidelines for desir-
                                 able sound levels and the identification of means available to
                                 achieve those sound levels in the City of Seal Beach.
                                 Direction for an implementation program that may be used to
                                 achieve and maintain a minimal noise environment.
                                 Maintain the relatively quiet areas of Seal Beach by regulating
                                 existing and potential noise sources, especially in public open
                                 space and the designated Wildlife Refuge areas.
                                 Inform the citizenry of Seal Beach of real and potential noise
                                 hazards, both physical and psychological.
                                 The city shall encourage a long-term development pattern that
                                 minimizes noise conflicts through planning and zoning.
                                 The city shall require the construction of barriers to mitigate
                                 sound emissions where necessary and feasible to protect out-
                                 door noise sensitive land uses.
                                 The city shall require the inclusion of noise mitigation measures
                                 in the design of new roadway projects in Seal Beach.
                                 The city shall minimize potential transportation noise through
                                 proper design of street circulation, coordination of routing, and
                                 other traffic control measures.

The Plan for Control and Management of Noise
                                 In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the Noise Ele-
                                 ment, an effective implementation program developed within

                                 necessary. The underlying purpose is to reduce the number of
                                 people exposed to excessive noise and to minimize the future
                                 effect of noise in the City. The following are the actions that the
                                 City should consider implementing to control the impacts of
                                 noise in Seal Beach.

Purpose/Background
                                 The Seal Beach Open Space/Recreation/Conservation Element
                                 is an expression of the City’s goals and policies within these
                                 three topical areas. While it is not necessary for a General Plan
                                 to include a Recreation Element, the close relationship between
                                 open space and recreation lends itself to addressing the City’s
                                 goal of providing resources to the community that enhance op-
                                 portunities to experience the natural amenities and qualities of
                                 the area. Because open space, recreation and conservation are all
                                 closely related, it has been determined that these topics should
                                 be considered under a single element. The purpose of this Ele-
                                 ment is to (1) define open space and classify various types of
                                 open space uses, (2) describe those parcels or areas that are cur-
                                 rently being used for open space/recreation and conservation
                                 purposes and discuss in concept future open space needs of the
                                 community, and (3) determine methods to ensure that the pre-
                                 sent and future needs of the community are met.
                                 For purposes of this Element, open space land shall be defined as
                                 any parcel or area of land or water that is essentially unimproved
                                 or contains only minor improvements and is devoted to an open
                                 space use. Open space use shall be defined as land which is set
                                 aside for (1) outdoor recreation, (2) the preservation of natural
                                 resources, (3) managed production of resources, or (4) the safety
                                 and general welfare of the community. Open space is valued as a
                                 way to buffer neighborhoods from urban intrusions and to pre-
                                 serve areas to maintain a small beach town character.
                                 Recreation land can be categorized as land developed for the use
                                 and enjoyment of the community, either as active land (sports
                                 fields, tot lots, swimming facilities) or passive land (greenbelts,
                                 open space, public beach). Conservation land is land for the
                                 conservation, enhancement, and utilization of natural resources.
                                 The ocean attracts nature lovers and sports enthusiasts. This
                                 topic concerns itself with the management of natural resources
                                 to prevent waste, habitat loss, destruction, or neglect.
 City of Seal Beach General Plan                                                                OS-1

Statutory Requirements
                                 California Government Code §65302 requires preparation of a gen-
                                 eral plan which “. . . shall consist of a statement of development
                                 policies and shall include a diagram or diagrams and text setting
                                 forth objectives, principles, standards and plan proposals.”
                                 Government Code §65302(e) requires that an open space element
                                 be included to ensure that open space plans are implemented by
                                 cities and counties to create a permanent network of open
                                 space. Section 65302(d) states, in part: “A conservation element
                                 for the conservation, development, and utilization of natural re-
                                 sources, including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils,
                                 rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals and
                                 other natural resources” is required. The law also requires that
                                 “Every local open space plan shall contain an action program
                                 consisting of specific programs which the legislative body in-
                                 tends to pursue in implementing its open space plan.” (Gov.
                                 Code §65564)
 City of Seal Beach General Plan                                                                OS-2

Related Plans and Programs
                                 A number of programs, plans, and policies are created by state,
                                 county and local action to promote and protect the resources
                                 included in open space/recreation/conservation. Where regional
                                 policies combine with city plans and policies, a comprehensive
                                 network of open space and attendant amenities can be created.
                                 Where appropriate, relevant policies and goals are incorporated
                                 into the Element to provide for the continued maintenance and
                                 conservation of these resources.
Other General Plan Elements
                                 Two other elements of this General Plan provide support and
                                 policy for open space and natural resource management. The
                                 Land Use Element defines various uses for land throughout the
                                 city, including open space designations. The Circulation Ele-
                                 ment includes existing and planned paths and trails for bicycle
                                 and pedestrian use.
Local Coastal Program
                                 Because of its proximity to the Pacific Ocean, Seal Beach is sub-
                                 ject to a state-mandated Local Coastal Program and California
                                 Coastal Commission jurisdiction. The 1976 California Coastal
                                 Act, which provides protection for the natural and scenic re-
                                 sources of the coastal area, requires the preparation of a local
                                 coastal program for jurisdictions with land within the coastal
                                 zone. The policies defined by the Local Coastal Program (LCP)
                                 set the standards that preserve and conserve the community’s
                                 coastal influenced resources. The City of Seal Beach Local
                                 Coastal Program policies are included by reference as part of the
                                 General Plan. The LCP is to be updated every five years.
County of Orange General Plan
                                 The policies of the Recreation and Resources Elements of the
                                 Orange County General Plan will not be in conflict with this
                                 General Plan for the purposes of providing and maintaining all
                                 resources related to open space/recreation/conservation. The
                                 City will cooperate with the County to maintain consistency in
                                 planning for regional parks and trails.

Quimby Act
                                 Government Code §66477, also known as the Quimby Act, pro-
                                 vides for the dedication of parkland or the payment of in lieu
                                 fees by developers as a requirement for residential development.
                                 This section states that “… the dedication of land, or the pay-
                                 ment of fees, or both, shall not exceed the proportionate
                                 amount necessary to provide 3 acres of park area per 1,000 per-
                                 sons residing within a subdivision subject to this section, unless
                                 the amount of existing neighborhood and community park area,
                                 as calculated pursuant to this subdivision, exceeds that limit, in
                                 which case the legislative body may adopt the calculated amount
                                 as a higher standard not to exceed 5 acres per 1,000 persons re-
                                 siding within a subdivision to this section.”
Seal Beach Park Dedication Ordinance
                                 The City’s Municipal Code has established a goal of five acres of

Definitions
                                 Open space for outdoor recreation is defined as land that is set
                                 aside for neighborhood, community or regional parks, beaches,
                                 special use parks or facilities, greenbelts, and open space corri-
                                 dors. These areas provide a pleasant environment for active and
                                 passive recreational activities. Definitions of the various types of
                                 recreation/open space opportunities include the following:
Community Parks
                                 Community parks are larger than neighborhood parks and are
                                 designed to serve the needs of a broader age group. They serve
                                 the entire City and are easily accessible via arterial roads, attract-

                                 Typically, these facilities contain tennis, volleyball, handball and
                                 basketball courts, picnic areas, and sports fields for seasonal
                                 sports such as baseball and football. Community parks generally
                                 range in size from approximately 5 to 30 acres.
Neighborhood Parks
                                 Neighborhood parks are designed to meet the needs of individ-
                                 ual residential developments within the City. While providing
                                 for the recreational needs of several age groups, the neighbor-
                                 hood park is primarily designed to meet the needs of the 5- to
                                 14-year-old group. Children’s play equipment and tennis and
                                 basketball courts are among the facilities often found at
                                 neighborhood parks. Other improvements might include senior
                                 centers, youth centers, and aquatic facilities. These parks vary in
                                 size from a single lot to parcels of approximately five acres.
View Park
                                 View parks are smaller passive parks designed to take advantage
                                 of a significant view. They are often located on coastal bluffs to
                                 focus upon ocean or bay views. Most view parks are between
                                 one-half and three acres in size and serve the entire City. View
                                 parks are generally improved with landscaping, walkways, and
                                 benches.

Regional Beaches and Parks
                                 Regional beaches and parks are designated to meet the needs of
                                 residents and non-residents and usually attract a large number of
                                 people from outside the immediate area. Generally these facili-
                                 ties are over 30 acres in size and appeal to all age groups. Natu-
                                 ral surroundings and spaciousness are emphasized to a greater
                                 degree than in community parks. Regional facilities are often
                                 used for day-long outings.
                                 The shoreline of Seal Beach is considered to be of regional sig-
                                 nificance. Recreational activities are associated with the ocean,
                                 the beach, and the pier. Primary recreational activities include
                                 swimming, wading, surfing, pier and sport fishing, sunbathing,
                                 jogging, volleyball, and some non-organized games. Seal Beach
                                 contains approximately 2 miles of beachfront.
                                 It was proposed in the Master Plan of Regional Parks for Or-
                                 ange County that the area known as the Los Alamitos Basin
                                 (Hellman Ranch) become a regional park. The Hellman Ranch
                                 Specific Plan provides for passive parkland and open space. The
                                 Table of Parks and Open Space in this section provides acreage
                                 totals.
                                 Sunset Marina Park (formerly Sunset Aquatic Park) lies within
                                 the City limits of Seal Beach and is operated by the County of
                                 Orange. The Aquatic Park contains 276 boat slips, as well as dry
                                 boat storage facilities, and comprises 19.2 acres for passive rec-
                                 reation.
Special Use Parks or Facilities
                                 Special use parks or facilities are park-like places where a unique
                                 recreational activity is provided. The service areas and size of
                                 these facilities vary according to their principal use. These facili-
                                 ties generally have a neighborhood or community orientation.
                                 Playgrounds at school sites are considered to be special use fa-
                                 cilities that provide areas for recreational activities. It is esti-
                                 mated that 50% of the area of school sites is used as play-
                                 grounds or athletic fields.

Open Space/Recreation/Conservation Element
                                 Existing special use parks or facilities:
                                        1)     Zoeter Park – Coastal District (1.9 acres)
                                        2)     McGaugh Elementary School – Marina Hill (4.7

Bikeways
                                 Backbone bikeways are major throughway trails that connect to
                                 regional trails. They are primarily on major roads and serve the
                                 functional and recreational cyclist. Secondary bikeways connect
                                 to backbone trails and serve cyclists and children riding to and
                                 from school.
Pedestrian Trails
                                 Pedestrian trails include improved or unimproved walkways or
                                 sidewalks located within park, beach, greenbelt, or open space
                                 areas.
Greenbelts and Open Space Corridors
                                 Greenbelts are recognizable expanses of undeveloped land that
                                 provide an attractive open space setting and a buffer between
                                 adjacent land uses. Recreational activities in these areas are usu-
                                 ally limited to activities such as walking, picnicking, and some
                                 organized games.
                                 Channels and transmission rights-of-way offer a unique oppor-
                                 tunity for joint use of facilities. Because of their configuration,
                                 these corridors provide an excellent opportunity to incorporate
                                 as a secondary use such things as bicycle paths, equestrian trails,
                                 and hiking areas. The City should seek the cooperation of other
                                 public agencies and private utility companies to expand the uses
                                 of existing or proposed corridors under the control of these
                                 agencies or companies.

Public/Private Recreational Facilities
                                 Public/private recreational facilities may not be open to the
                                 general public but do provide open space and a service to the
                                 community that might otherwise not be provided. These facili-
                                 ties may be located within a residential development and be
                                 owned and maintained by the residents of the community, or
                                 they could consist of individually owned and operated commer-
                                 cial enterprises. Existing private recreational facilities include:
                                        1)     Leisure World Golf Course
                                        2)     Leisure World Club Houses
                                        3)     Old Ranch Country Club and Golf Course
                                        4)     Old Ranch Tennis Club (dedication to City pending)
Natural Resource Land
                                 Areas within the City have been designated for the preservation
                                 of natural resources. Natural resource areas would include land
                                 set aside for the preservation of plant and animal life, areas re-
                                 quired for ecological and other scientific study purposes, bays
                                 and estuaries and coastal beaches. Seal Beach National Wildlife
                                 Refuge habitats are typical of this category. A 100-acre portion
                                 of the Hellman Ranch Specific Plan area has been deed re-
                                 stricted for 25 years for sale at fair market value to a public

                                 and environmental education purposes. The adjacent oil produc-
                                 tion property (approximately 50 acres) has been similarly re-
                                 stricted, although the 25-year period does not commence until
                                 cessation of the oil production activities.
Land for the Production of Resources
                                 Certain parcels of land within the City are being used for agricul-
                                 tural production, principally within the Seal Beach Naval Weap-

                                 The Quimby Act, enacted in 1965, requires the dedication of
                                 parkland or payment of in-lieu fees for new development. The
                                 acreage to be dedicated is based on 5 acres per 1,000 population
                                 as specified by the City’s Municipal Code. The City of Seal
                                 Beach has not met the necessary acreage requirements because a
                                 significant portion of the City had been developed prior to the
                                 time the Act was passed. However, the City benefits from non-
                                 Quimby Act recreational amenities within its boundaries, includ-
                                 ing 80.3 acres of beaches, the 19.2-acre Sunset Marina Park,
                                 which is operated by the County, and the National Wildlife Ref-
                                 uge within the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station, each of
                                 which provides unique regional recreational opportunities. It is
                                 anticipated that completion of the Hellman Ranch project will
                                 provide an additional opportunity to meet these goals through
                                 the expansion of Gum Grove Nature Park and restoration of
                                 the wetlands areas. In addition, the DWP Specific Plan will pro-
                                 vide opportunities for open space and passive recreation along
                                 the San Gabriel River.

Issues
Open Space for Public Safety
                                 One earthquake fault is known to exist within Seal Beach. This
                                 fault is referred to as the Newport-Inglewood Fault. The fault
                                 zone is located to the north of Marina Hill and parallels the
                                 coast. Marina Hill resulted from uplifting action of the fault.
                                 The most recent movement of this fault, which caused damage
                                 in the Seal Beach area, occurred in 1952. The 1933 Long Beach
                                 Earthquake was also attributed to movement along this fault.
                                 Prior to any development adjacent to the fault zone, careful
                                 study should be undertaken to ensure the safety of such devel-
                                 opment. The question of the safety of construction adjacent to
                                 this fault is addressed in the Safety Element. Certain property in
                                 the fault zone may be retained as open space in the public inter-
                                 est. The Hellman Ranch wetlands restoration area and the Seal
                                 Beach Naval Weapons Station are traversed by this identified
                                 fault.
Funding
                                 In consideration of the preservation of open space as outlined in
                                 this Element, it is imperative that all sources of possible funding
                                 be explored. Federal and state assistance should be sought for
                                 projects under the revenue sharing program. In addition, other
                                 possible methods of financing would include allocations from
                                 the City’s general fund, general obligation bonds, assessment
                                 districts, environmental reserve tax funds, park and recreation
                                 funds for subdivision and non-subdivision developments and, in
                                 restricted areas, redevelopment agency funds.

Goals, Objectives and Policies
                                 Because undeveloped land is becoming scarce in the City, land
                                 for open space uses should be secured at the earliest possible
                                 time. As additional funds become available, these areas could be
                                 developed in accordance with this plan. It is important that land
                                 be dedicated for park space or fees be paid in lieu of dedication
                                 of land as residential development continues within the com-
                                 munity. Land dedicated for park purposes should be strategically
                                 located within any proposed development to be of greatest
                                 benefit to the future residents and to the community as a whole.
                                 The City has established a standard of five acres of local parks
                                 for each 1,000 residents. While this standard has not always
                                 been achieved, and considering the importance of open space
                                 and recreation as contributing factors to the community’s wel-
                                 fare, the City will strive to attain this standard in areas that may
                                 be developed in the future.
                                 Several concepts related to parks and open space are presented
                                 in the Land Use Element, which should be implemented if they
                                 are determined to be feasible.
                                 In an attempt to preserve open space lands, the following rec-
                                 ommendations are made:
                                        1)    The City should explore all sources of possible fed-
                                              eral, state, and county funding for open space lands,
                                              and the conversion of surplus public lands to open
                                              space.
                                        2)    The City should make every attempt to secure joint
                                              use of open space corridors and lands set aside for
                                              seasonal use by other public agencies and private
                                              utility companies.
                                        3)    Zoning should be investigated as an alternative to
                                              preservation of open space lands. An open space
                                              zoning ordinance, which is consistent with this plan,
                                              has been adopted.

Planning Areas
                                 The City has been divided into five Planning Areas for purposes
                                 of consistency and ease of reference within each of the General
                                 Plan Elements. Recreation and open space uses are discussed
                                 below by planning area as they relate to existing conditions and
                                 any future plans and goals. Exhibit OS-1 provides a map of ex-

                                 Club prior to September 24, 2004. The dedication of the Old
                                 Ranch Tennis Club facility, approximately 6.74 acres, would be
                                 for an additional public recreational facility for the community.
                                 The City plans to accept the Old Ranch Tennis Club before the

                                 being finalized.
Planning Area 5 - Seal Beach U. S. Naval Weapons Station/Wildlife
Refuge
                                 This entire Planning Area consists of the U.S. Naval Weapons
                                 Station. The Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge is located at
                                 the base of Anaheim Bay and within the Naval Weapons Station
                                 property. The refuge contains approximately 920 acres and pro-
                                 vides a home for a number of species of fish and fowl, including
                                 several endangered species of birds. The marshlands serve as a
                                 nesting place for birds on their migrations and a spawning area

                                 Currently, commercial agricultural activities are restricted to the

Water
                                 The City of Seal Beach is included within the Orange County
                                 Water District. The District is responsible for replenishing the
                                 ground water basin, which serves an area from the base of the
                                 Santa Ana Mountains to the ocean. Colorado River water is per-
                                 colated into the underground aquifers at settling basins located
                                 at the higher elevations at the base of the mountains. Pressure is
                                 created due to grade differential, which causes the underground
                                 water to be carried generally in a southwesterly direction. The
                                 groundwater is extracted from wells located throughout the Dis-
                                 trict.
                                 Each year the Board of Directors for the Water District deter-
                                 mines a ratio of groundwater to imported water that will best
                                 serve the management needs of the District. Because of de-
                                 mands on the groundwater basin, approximately 60,000 acre feet
                                 of Colorado River water are percolated into the basin annually.
                                 Orange County Water District obtains this water through Met-
                                 ropolitan Water District.
                                 In the past, the City has experienced some salt-water intrusion
                                 into the underground basin. Intrusion of salt water has occurred
                                 in an area beneath the San Gabriel River channel. As a result,
                                 barrier wells have been drilled that inject fresh water into those
                                 areas, which are referred to as “gaps.” The boost in water pres-
                                 sure created by the injection wells prevents salt-water intrusion

                                 are located on the west side of the San Gabriel River, along

                                 Seal Beach operates three domestic fresh water wells and peri-
                                 odically imports additional water through the Metropolitan Wa-
                                 ter District. The domestic wells supply water to all districts on a
                                 routine basis. Approximately 25% of Seal Beach’s water is pur-
                                 chased from the Metropolitan Water District in order to guaran-
                                 tee availability of emergency supplies when the well water supply
                                 is short due to maintenance or breakdown. The City purchased
                                 the Surfside Colony water system from the City of Huntington
                                 Beach and has incorporated it into the citywide system.
                                 The City currently has two reservoirs with a total storage capac-
                                 ity of 7 million gallons. A 4-million-gallon reservoir is located on
                                 Beverly Manor Road adjoining the San Diego freeway, and a 3-
                                 million-gallon reservoir is situated on the Naval Weapons Sta-
                                 tion adjacent to Marina Hill. On an average, 3.6 million gallons
                                 of water is issued each day within the community. Daily con-
                                 sumption varies between summer and winter usage. Even with
                                 the limited growth available to the City at this point, the City
                                 should give serious consideration to constructing a third reser-
                                 voir. With the expanded storage capacity, the City would reduce
                                 the risk of a water shortage in an emergency situation.
Water Quality
                                 Within the city limits of Seal Beach is the mouth of the San
                                 Gabriel River which drains an area of approximately 700 square
                                 miles within Los Angeles and Orange Counties, the Pacific
                                 oceanfront, and various wetland areas that are subject to various
                                 sources of pollution within the community. To protect public
                                 safety, as well as these natural resources, the water quality should
                                 be monitored and protected.
                                 Goals and objectives include:
                                 •      Coordinate water quality, supply, and conservation pro-
                                        grams with the responsible water agencies.
                                 •      Encourage the production and use of recycled water.
                                 •      Conserve and protect watershed areas.

                                 Flood control measures have been implemented throughout the
                                 community. Major drainage channels within the City drain into
                                 the San Gabriel River, Anaheim Bay, and Huntington Harbor.
                                 The Orange County Flood Control District and the City are re-
                                 sponsible for the flood control improvements within the com-

                                 There are two flood control-retarding basins within the City. A
                                 38-acre basin is located south of Westminster Avenue and west
                                 of Boeing’s Seal Beach facility. This basin may be suitable for
                                 dual usage. These uses would consist of a floodwater retarding
                                 basin during the winter and a regional park during the drier por-

                                 In the future, the City should consider increasing the capacity of

                                 At the County level, the Orange County Flood Control District
                                 has developed a number of conservation techniques. These
                                 measures include the use of importing aqueducts, additional res-

Beach Erosion
                                 Historically, the stability of the shoreline was dependent upon
                                 the delicate natural balance between the erosive forces of the
                                 wind, the surf, and the tide and the replenishment of beach-
                                 building materials brought down the Los Angeles and San
                                 Gabriel Rivers. Replenishment sands from rivers have been tra-
                                 ditionally transported southeastward by the littoral (shoreline)
                                 currents. When the federal offshore breakwater, the First Street
                                 jetty, and the breakwaters at Anaheim Bay were constructed, the
                                 littoral currents in the general area were partially blocked and al-
                                 tered.
                                 The Seal Beach shoreline erosion problem consists of three ar-
                                 eas:
                                         1)    The west beach is the area between the San Gabriel
                                               River and the pier.
                                         2)    The east beach extends from the pier to the west
                                               jetty of Anaheim Bay.
                                         3)    Anaheim Bay and Surfside beaches are considered
                                               together and extend from Anaheim Bay to Ander-
                                               son Street.
                                 The jetties and the federal breakwater were built in the 1940s.
                                 The construction of these public improvements changed the lit-
                                 toral currents, affecting the east and west beaches. Instead of
                                 transporting material in a southeasterly direction, the shoreline
                                 currents were reversed and flowed in a northwesterly direction.

                                 of sand are lost each year from the east beach. This sand is car-
                                 ried away through the Navy harbor and west breakwater and
                                 around the end of the groin to the west beach. In addition, the
                                 San Gabriel River adds sand to the west beach. Because of the
                                 changes in the shoreline currents, this sand collects as a delta at
                                 the mouth of the river.
                                 Because the littoral currents have been altered, the problem of
                                 beach erosion will continue indefinitely. While the Corps of En-
                                 gineers replenishes sand at Surfside, the City must assume full
                                 responsibility for redistribution of sand from the west to the
                                 east beach. The City should continue to seek assistance from
                                 state and federal agencies in order that the City might be re-
                                 lieved of a portion of the burden and expense of maintaining
                                 this facility of regional significance.
                                 Artificial means must be used in order to replenish sand to the
                                 east beach. Since 1970, an average of 100,000 cubic yards of
                                 sand have been redistributed on a five-year cycle from the west
                                 beach to the east beach. However, history has shown that a five-
                                 year project of sand replacement may not be adequate due to the
                                 multiple offshore storms that can occur during that timeframe.
                                 The City has a continuing redistribution program during the
                                 winter months to provide protection from flooding due to high
                                 tides.
                                 Due to changes in littoral currents, the beach at Surfside erodes
                                 at a rate of about 70 lineal feet per year. In 2001, the U. S. Army
                                 Corps of Engineers replenished the Surfside and Sunset Beach
                                 beaches with 2.2 million cubic yards of sand pumped from Ana-
                                 heim Bay. This project was designed to fulfill the replenishment
                                 needs of these beaches until 2006.

                                 tion between the Coastal District and Surfside Colony. The Bay
                                 was first used as a commercial harbor in the 1860s. Cargo was
                                 shipped inland to the Santa Ana valley. Anaheim Bay served the
                                 interior of Orange County for 15 years. In the mid-1870s rail
                                 lines were extended into Orange County, and the commercial
                                 activity at the Bay declined.
                                 In the 1920s, the strand at Anaheim Bay took on a residential
                                 character. In the early 1940s the federal government purchased

                                 Beach Naval Weapons Station. The configuration of the bay was
                                 modified to accommodate the Navy’s needs, and in 1944 two
                                 jetties were constructed into the ocean to form a harbor en-
                                 trance. A 1000’-long wharf was constructed to service naval ves-

                                 The Weapons Station handles approximately 80 military ships
                                 per year, down from a high of approximately 600 ships per year.
                                 Anaheim Bay also provides a channel entrance to Sunset Marina
                                 Park and Huntington Harbor. Currently, there are approxi-
                                 mately 276 boat slips in Sunset Marina Harbor. It is anticipated
                                 that harbor expansion will be limited because of the possible
                                 adverse effects on the National Wildlife Refuge located on the
                                 Weapons Station. In addition to limiting the number of boat
                                 slips, the configuration of the park facility was altered to lessen
                                 its impact on the marshlands to the west.
                                 Anaheim Bay links the salt marshlands with the ocean. The Bay
                                 provides access to the marshlands for fish and because of tidal
                                 fluctuations, circulates water throughout the marsh.
Wildlife Refuge
                                 In 1972, the United States Congress established the Seal Beach
                                 National Wildlife Refuge on the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Sta-
                                 tion. The refuge contains 920 acres of marshland and 560 acres
                                 outside the slough area, which were restored to their natural
                                 condition. The Wildlife Refuge has an international designation
                                 under the Ramsar Convention as a “Wetlands of International
                                 Importance,” as well as an “International Important Birding
                                 Area” under the International Migratory Bird Treaty, and is a
                                 Federal Marine Protected Area.
                                 More than 200 species of birds are found within the boundaries
                                 of the refuge during the course of a year. The marshland is pri-
                                 marily used as a roosting area for birds. During peak migration
                                 in December over 10,000 birds use the marshlands. Five species
                                 of birds that are currently on the state and/or federal lists of en-
                                 dangered species habituate the marshlands. These endangered

                                 relies on available Navy and non-Navy resources, as well as
                                 close coordination with resource agencies and the public. This
                                 will allow seamless management across jurisdictions for the
                                 benefit of healthy and sustainable land use, habitat conservation

                                 will be accomplished by employing an ecosystem management

Rivers
                                 The San Gabriel River is located on the western boundary of the
                                 City. The river, which originates in Los Angeles County, empties
                                 into the ocean at Seal Beach. The river transports sands that aid
                                 in the replenishment of beach sands. Sand transport has been
                                 severely reduced due to upstream damming for water conserva-
                                 tion and flood protection purposes. In addition, the river pro-
                                 vides an outlet for flood control basins and channels within the
                                 City.
                                 The river is also a major source of ocean contamination imme-

Soils
                                 Within the City of Seal Beach, soils are generally considered
                                 good for agricultural purposes. Prior to the rapid urban devel-
                                 opment in western Orange County, much of the land was used
                                 for growing crops.
                                 Today, the greatest majority of the land is developed with the
                                 exception of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station. The Navy
                                 leases 2,000 acres of land for truck farming. The soils on the
                                 Station are fertile and subject to few limitations with a low risk
                                 of damage when cultivated. As long as farming does not inter-
                                 fere with the primary mission of the Weapons Station, crops will
                                 continue to be grown as a secondary use of the land.
Forests
                                 The Gum Grove Nature Park is an urban forest in west Orange
                                 County. Its first human inhabitants were the Tongva Indians,
                                 who used this area as a viewpoint over the surrounding wet-
                                 lands. In the early 1900s, Hellman Ranch employees planted
                                 blue and red gum eucalyptus trees that were used for cooking
                                 and heating. Since then, the second and third growth forest of
                                 approximately 500 trees has become a natural resource area that
                                 is now used for passive recreation. The Gum Grove Nature
                                 Park will be dedicated to the City as part of the development
                                 outlined in the Hellman Ranch Specific Plan.
                                 The Gum Grove Nature Park houses a variety of wildlife such
                                 as skunks, opossums, ground squirrels, toads, salamanders, tree
                                 frogs, and coyotes native to this area. In the fall and winter
                                 months, Monarch butterflies cover a cluster of trees during their
                                 migratory stopovers. This ecosystem, including seasonal ponds,
                                 supports great blue herons, snowy egrets, great egrets, and at
                                 least two birds of prey (the American kestrel and the red tailed
                                 hawk). Over 50 other bird species are known to be inhabitants
                                 or visitors in this area.
                                 The Gum Grove Nature Park Group, formed by local citizens,
                                 is establishing a management and conservation program in co-
                                 operation with the California Department of Forestry and the
                                 City of Seal Beach. The vision for the entire Gum Grove Nature
                                 Park is a two-phase transformation from a neglected habitat to
                                 one that will support an increasing number of insect, bird, ani-
                                 mal, and plant species that have long been native to this area.
                                 Phase One is to plant the five acres being added to the park with
 City of Seal Beach General Plan                                                              OS-29

                                 native plant and tree species only. Phase Two, occurring over
                                 many years, will be native species replacement as disease contin-
                                 ues to claim the non-native eucalyptus. These efforts and ongo-

                                 tural remembrance of the original Tongva Indian residents.
                                 The Gum Grove Nature Park is the central component of a
                                 wildlife corridor that connects eastward with the Seal Beach Na-
                                 tional Wildlife Refuge located on the Seal Beach Naval Weapons
                                 Station and westward with the Hellman Wetlands, which are
                                 designated for future restoration. The two-phase Gum Grove
                                 Plan, in conjunction with future Hellman Wetlands restoration,
                                 will provide a management and conservation program that will
                                 bring back to life a severely degraded corridor. Planting of na-
                                 tive grasses, plants, and tree species will provide for the habitat
                                 and foraging needs of birds and animals that live and migrate
                                 through this region.
Minerals
                                 One oil extraction site is maintained within the tidelands area of
                                 Seal Beach. This site is known as Esther Island. Oil extraction
                                 operations are also conducted along the Newport-Inglewood
                                 Fault on the Hellman Ranch property and on an oil lease site in
                                 the National Wildlife Refuge on the Seal Beach Weapons Sta-

                                 Currently, it appears that the oil fields within the City bounda-
                                 ries will continue in operation. If oil extraction activities are
                                 proposed under the City’s jurisdiction, existing ordinances
                                 would regulate the operations to ensure compatibility with other
                                 types of surrounding land uses.

Wetlands
                                 A 100-acre portion of the Hellman Ranch Specific Plan area has
                                 been deed restricted for 25 years for sale at fair market value to
                                 a public agency for the purposes of wetlands restoration, open
                                 space, and environmental education purposes. The adjacent oil
                                 production property (approximately 50 acres) has been similarly
                                 restricted, although the 25-year deed-restricted time period does
                                 not commence until cessation of the oil production activities.
                                 It is the intent and goal of the City to address future uses for
                                 these areas and cooperate with the property owner, state, local,
                                 and private agencies, as well as the community, to provide the
                                 means to accomplish this goal.

Introduction
Purpose and Background
                                 The Seismic Safety - Safety Element was originally adopted on
                                 July 14, 1975. As the result of subsequent changes in the re-
                                 quirements regarding General Plan Elements, the City decided
                                 on August 11, 1997 to rename this Element (i.e., “Safety Ele-
                                 ment”) and to expand its scope to cover storm drainage, shore-
                                 line protection, and the use, transport, and disposal of
                                 hazardous materials.
                                 The Safety Element is organized into six topics and an imple-
                                 mentation chapter. Following the introduction, Topics 1
                                 through 6 discuss separate safety issues as they relate to the City
                                 of Seal Beach. Following the discussion in each topic are poli-
                                 cies to deal with the identified issues. The Implementation sec-
                                 tion of the Element indicates which City Department has
                                 primary responsibility for implementing each policy, how it will
                                 be funded, and the scheduled timing for implementation.
                                 The major topics discussed in the Safety Element are:
                                 •    Emergency Planning/Response
                                 •    Hazardous Materials
                                 •    Geologic Hazards
                                 •    Fire Hazards
                                 •    Flood Hazards
                                 •    Shoreline Protection
                                 •    Implementation
Statutory Requirements
                                 In 1971, the California State Legislature required that all cities
                                 and counties adopt Seismic and Safety Elements as part of their
                                 General Plans. The basic objective of the Safety Element is to
                                 reduce loss of life, injury, damage to property, and economic
                                 and social dislocation resulting from future natural and man-
                                 made hazards. To achieve this objective, the Safety Element is
                                 utilized as the major tool for identifying hazards that should be
                                 considered before making land use decisions. Mapping is re-
                                 quired of known seismic and other geologic hazards (such as
                                 landslide areas), and issues such as emergency evacuation routes
                                 and water supply for fire fighting must be addressed.

Safety Element
                                 Government Code §65302(g) requires a Safety Element that is de-
                                 veloped for the protection of the community from any unrea-
                                 sonable risks associated with the effects of seismically induced
                                 surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure, tsunami, seiche,
                                 and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and land-

                                 flooding and wildland and urban fires. A Safety Element shall
                                 also address evacuation routes, peak load water supply require-
                                 ments, and minimum road widths and clearances required
                                 around structures, as those items relate to identified fire and

                                 The potential for a major calamity increases with the continuing
                                 urbanization of previously unpopulated areas and with the ad-
                                 vent of industrial processes that utilize hazardous materials. The
                                 impacts of earthquake, fire, and flood are magnified as more and
                                 more high-risk land is urbanized. Because of their unknown or
                                 unexpected nature, many emergencies require quick and decisive
                                 action. Because disasters are dynamic and we continually learn
                                 through experience, emergency response and planning should
                                 also be dynamic and continually maintained and updated. Sev-
                                 eral disasters in Seal Beach and in other communities in Califor-
                                 nia have taught us a great deal about disaster response.
                                 The City of Seal Beach adopted an Emergency Operations Plan
                                 in June 1996. This Plan details the City’s specific responsibilities
                                 before, during, and after any emergency. This Plan is consistent
                                 with the State Emergency Services Plan, which describes the re-
                                 sponse of all levels of government and certain private sector or-
                                 ganizations to natural, man-made, or war-caused emergencies
                                 that threaten life, property, and the resources of California. Sec-
                                 tion 8568 of the California Emergency Services Act provides a
                                 basis for the City’s emergency management programs by requir-
                                 ing cities to carry out the provisions of the State Emergency
                                 Services Plan. The City’s Plan is an extension of the state plan.
                                 The City’s plan describes how the City will respond in the event
                                 of, but not limited to, a state of war or act of terrorism emer-
                                 gency, natural emergency situations (earthquakes, fires, floods,
                                 storms and tsunamis), and man-made emergency situations (pol-
                                 lution spills, civil disturbances, aircraft accidents, industrial acci-
                                 dents, explosions and radiological incidents). Emergencies that
                                 are preceded by a recognized buildup period allow for advance
                                 warning to those impacted areas and population groups. Timely
                                 warning and information broadcasts are important to citizens’
                                 ability to help themselves, and for their evacuation. Emergencies
                                 generally occur without advance warning, and therefore require
                                 prompt mobilization and commitment of the emergency organi-
                                 zation after the onset of the emergency.
                                 During or following local emergencies, the City is the first
                                 agency involved. If the emergency is so large that the City’s re-
                                 sources are inadequate or exhausted, assistance will be requested
                                 of, and provided by, nearby jurisdictions through mutual aid
                                 agreements. Neighborhood groups can assist to the City by
                                 conducting first aid and search and rescue operations in times of

                                 the disaster task, the County requests assistance from the state.
                                 The Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (OES) coordi-
                                 nates regional emergency response and disaster assistance. The
                                 state may also request aid from the federal government in the
                                 form of a Presidential Disaster Declaration. The Federal Emer-
                                 gency Management Agency (FEMA) then provides disaster as-
                                 sistance, temporary housing assistance, and recovery funds after
                                 a Presidential Disaster Declaration.
                                 The City’s Emergency Services Plan lists three temporary seats
                                 of government in the event City Hall is not available. These lo-
                                 cations are the Seal Beach Police Department, the Seal Beach
                                 Public Works Department, and Fire Station #48 on Beverly
                                 Manor Road. Due to the close proximity of all of these alternate
                                 locations, none of these facilities are likely to be available in a
                                 major catastrophe such as an earthquake. The locations of alter-
                                 nate seats of government and emergency facilities have not been
                                 evaluated as to their effectiveness in terms of location and re-
                                 sponse capabilities.
                                 Mobility of the community to accomplish evacuation and the
                                 deployment of emergency personnel during any disaster is es-
                                 sential. A variety of emergency response challenges exist within
                                 the City of Seal Beach. The City is located in an area subject to
                                 strong earthquake impacts and flooding impacts. In addition, the
                                 Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base is located to the north
                                 of the City boundary, and flight operations from the Training
                                 Base generally take off over the City of Seal Beach, resulting in a
                                 potential for aircraft emergency responses, particularly in the
                                 case of an aircraft accident (refer to Figure S-1). The large ma-
                                 jority of flight operations at the Training Base are helicopter op-
                                 erations, which do not result in a major exposure to the general

                                 guidelines that describe the ultimate heights of structures under
                                 the “imaginary surfaces” and would be used for determining if a
                                 proposed structure is an “obstruction” (refer to Figure S-2-

                                 All developments within the City will be subject to the FAR Part
                                 77 Notice Requirements. The sponsor of any project that re-

                                 to the Executive Director of the Airport Land Use Commission.
                                 The City will incorporate the findings of the Airport Land Use
                                 Commission and the FAA into its decision-making process as it
                                 pertains to individual projects.
                                 It is the City’s responsibility to develop evacuation plans that
                                 readily and effectively remove residents from hazardous areas to
                                 locations of greater safety. The mandate of the City to protect
                                 public health, safety, and welfare requires the City to ensure that
                                 disaster planning within each neighborhood meets both the
                                 City’s and neighborhood’s interpretation of acceptable risk. In
                                 issues of overriding safety concerns, the City’s mandate requires
                                 affirmative action to maximize public safety.
                                 A discussion of emergency response and evacuation must focus
                                 on three levels of preparedness: the household, the neighbor-
                                 hood, and the community at large. Specific policy decisions and
                                 public actions must be taken at each of these levels to assure an
                                 acceptable level of risk for the City’s residents.
Household Emergency Planning
                                 Household emergency planning refers to actions that are taken
                                 by private citizens to increase their own level of disaster prepar-
                                 edness. Emergency response at this level generally requires the
                                 dispatch of specific vehicles to serve specialized functions.
                                 The highest probability of an evacuation occurs from individual
                                 households. Isolated occurrences arise due to structural fires or
                                 localized flooding, as experienced in the 1983 storms and again
                                 in January 1995. Evacuation at the household level generally
                                 does not require public agency assistance, except to deal with
                                 the cause of the evacuation and medical care. Problems associ-

                                 aster incident itself.
                                 Families need to increase their general preparedness for the
                                 most likely natural disasters that could occur in their particular
                                 location. Many specific steps can be taken on the part of a
                                 homeowner to gain some autonomy and safety in the case of a
                                 natural disaster. Adequate supplies, training, and education
                                 about the effects of likely disasters and available support systems
                                 help in this regard. The City can support these individual house-
                                 hold efforts with various services, such as the periodic distribu-
                                 tion of emergency planning packets that provide up-to-date
                                 emergency planning information and response guidelines.
Neighborhood Emergency Planning
                                 Neighborhood emergency planning requires the neighborhood
                                 and the community to determine an acceptable level of risk and
                                 the resulting public actions to elevate disaster preparedness to
                                 that level. Evacuation planning refers to the removal of people
                                 from areas of extreme hazards to areas of public safety.
                                 As a result of historic development patterns and constraints im-
                                 posed by local topography, the City is divided into geographic
                                 neighborhoods. These neighborhoods are an integral compo-
                                 nent of emergency response planning. Emergency planning
                                 should incorporate the resources of the individuals within these
                                 neighborhoods and recognize the constraints each neighbor-
                                 hood embodies.
                                 A citizen response model could be incorporated into the City’s
                                 Emergency Operations Plan that utilizes a neighborhood coor-
                                 dinate system of planning and response. This plan could also in-
                                 corporate a communication component for information
                                 coordination and emergency resources allocation. It might be
                                 possible to designate individual neighborhood communication
                                 sites and establish emergency local radio broadcasts. Neighbor-
                                 hood planning could build upon the Neighborhood Watch pro-
                                 gram. This program has been a victim of funding priorities, but
                                 as a response to the requirement of the Emergency Plan to
                                 promote neighborhood autonomy, it could be re-invigorated
                                 and supported by City staff. For instance, a periodic newsletter
                                 could be established to help keep the neighborhoods informed
                                 of the most recent advances in emergency response and coordi-

Community Emergency Planning
                                 Community level emergency planning includes the development
                                 of an emergency plan to be initiated in the event of a citywide
                                 evacuation. The Emergency Operations Plan anticipates this
                                 type of concern, and includes provisions for emergency housing,
                                 transportation, clothing, food, and medical aid. As neighbor-
                                 hood evacuation planning addresses evacuation routes from
                                 various neighborhoods, comprehensive citywide emergency
                                 planning includes the development of a supportive infrastruc-

                                 In the event of a community-wide disaster, more than one
                                 evacuation center could need to be established within the City.
                                 The scale of such a disaster would preclude individual evacua-

                                 mass evacuation. It is doubtful that any roadway could accom-
                                 modate vehicular evacuation on a community-wide scale.
                                 Citizens relocated to evacuation centers within the community
                                 would need to remain in those locations rather than add to the
                                 expected confusion on congested roadways. It is not anticipated
                                 that any new roadways serving the community would be needed
                                 for evacuation. In the case of a community-wide disaster, the
                                 City would need to have coordinated plans with local military
                                 organizations for the airlift of supplies and for evacuation of
                                 residents requiring medical care beyond the capability of the
                                 community’s resources.
                                 The City of Seal Beach is fortunate to have the Seal Beach Naval
                                 Weapons Station within its corporate boundaries. The Naval

                                 emergency response activities, and can also serve as an evacua-

                                 designated in the Emergency Operations Plan, with procedures
                                 for obtaining and disseminating accurate information set forth
                                 in the Plan.
                                 In the event of an emergency, whether a natural disaster or a

Access Issues
                                 In Seal Beach, the College Park West community is accessed by
                                 only one entry point, which creates potentially undesirable ac-
                                 cess in the event of a disaster. The College Park East, Leisure
                                 World, and Surfside communities have only two access points,
                                 adjacent respectively to Lampson Avenue, Seal Beach Boule-
                                 vard, and Pacific Coast Highway, which could result in access
                                 difficulties in a major earthquake or flooding situation (refer to
                                 Figure S-3 - Impaired Road Access Map).
                                 In addition to these neighborhoods, many of the City’s major
                                 roadways are susceptible to circulation restrictions and geologic
                                 or hydrologic hazards that could result in their closure during
                                 critical periods. The number of access routes to any neighbor-
                                 hood is less significant than their circulation capacities (e.g.,
                                 parking, travel-way width) and their susceptibility to closure by
                                 hazards (e.g., bridge damage, flooding).
                                 Some of the neighborhoods, such as College Park East, College
                                 Park West, and Leisure World, are not subject to major envi-
                                 ronmental constraints like an identified fault or floodway.
                                 Roadways that provide access to these neighborhoods cannot
                                 always remain open, because under even minor adverse condi-
                                 tions such as a downed tree or electrical line, these areas may
                                 become inaccessible.
                                 The City could undertake a comprehensive emergency access
                                 evaluation and upgrade program in which each public and pri-
                                 vate road/trail is evaluated in terms of providing emergency ve-
                                 hicle access and identifying access problems. The goal of this
                                 evaluation and upgrade program would be to upgrade the ac-
                                 cess-deficient areas by retrofitting the substandard roads/routes
                                 in an appropriate manner, based on the results of this evalua-
                                 tion. In addition, an emergency circulation system could be des-
                                 ignated for evacuation and response.
                                 The emergency circulation road/route system could be main-
                                 tained at high priority levels of policy and financial considera-
                                 tion. For instance, the public utility companies could be
                                 consulted and encouraged to prioritize the undergrounding of
                                 their utility lines along these routes. Tree maintenance could be
                                 emphasized on public right-of way and private property along
                                 these routes. City maintenance of these roads or emergency
                                 routes could receive funding priority.

Safety Element
                                 As discussed above, the most severely access-restricted
                                 neighborhoods are College Park West, College Park East, Lei-
                                 sure World, and Surfside. These neighborhoods are single-access
                                 or dual-access neighborhoods and are subject to environmental
                                 constraints that could restrict access.
                                 College Park West
                                      College Park West is recognized as an area subject to mul-
                                      tiple hazards. The major hazard that could minimize access
                                      is bridge collapse due to an earthquake. The neighbor-
                                      hood’s isolation, proximity to open space areas, topog-
                                      raphic conditions, and wind patterns make it susceptible to
                                      a wildfire during a Santa Ana wind condition. As a result of
                                      these identified hazards, College Park Drive could become
                                      impassable. In that event, emergency vehicles would be un-
                                      able to obtain ingress, and vehicular egress of the residents
                                      would not be possible.
                                      The fire hazard potential exists in College Park West due to
                                      the threat of structural fire spread during a Santa Ana wind
                                      condition. This type of fire can trigger an evacuation re-
                                      sponse, particularly during a Santa Ana wind condition.
                                      It is imperative to residents’ safety that alternative routes of
                                      evacuation be established in the College Park West area.
                                      Any route located too close to the existing roadway could
                                      quickly succumb to the same hazard that forced closure of
                                      the existing roadway. The location of College Park West
                                      adjacent to the San Gabriel River and the I-405/I-
                                      605/Seventh Street interchange make the construction of
                                      an evacuation route in this area appear to be aesthetically
                                      and economically unsound.
                                      The City needs to continue to investigate and implement an
                                      emergency access route that will meet the safety needs of
                                      this neighborhood and will be consistent with community
                                      economic and environmental goals. An emergency access
                                      connection should be investigated utilizing the San Gabriel
                                      River levees.

                                     Pacific Coast Highway at Anderson Street or alternate ac-

                                     of evacuation routes in these areas appear to be aestheti-
                                     cally and economically unsound.
                                     The City needs to continue to investigate and implement an
                                     alternate emergency access route system that will meet the
                                     safety needs of these neighborhoods and will be consistent
                                     with community economic and environmental goals. The

                                     however, would involve significant construction due to ex-

Underground Conversion of Overhead Utilities
                                 Overhead utility lines are known hazards that can be mitigated
                                 by relocating them underground. Downed power lines can re-
                                 strict and delay emergency response vehicles and evacuation.
                                 Heavy winds can cause tree branches to knock down power
                                 lines, creating a safety hazard, and power poles and utility boxes
                                 are hazards in road rights-of way.
                                 Surfside has recently completed a comprehensive utility under-
                                 ground conversion program, and there are no overhead utility
                                 services present in Surfside at this time. This program was com-
                                 pleted through a resident-approved assessment district.

Topic 2: Hazardous Materials
                                 There are many definitions and descriptive names being used for
                                 the term hazardous materials, each of which depends on the nature
                                 of the material. For the purposes of this topic, the definition in
                                 §25501(k) of the Health and Safety Code will be utilized:
                                        Any material that, because of its quantity, concentration, or
                                        physical or chemical characteristics, poses a significant pre-
                                        sent or potential hazard to human health and safety or to
                                        the environment if released into the work place or the envi-
                                        ronment. Hazardous materials include, but are not limited
                                        to hazardous substances, hazardous waste, and any material
                                        which a handler or the administering agency has a reason-
                                        able basis for believing that it would be injurious to the
                                        health and safety of persons or harmful to the environment
                                        if released into the work place or the environment.
                                 Hazardous materials are manufactured, transported, stored,
                                 used, and disposed of on a regular basis. Although hazardous
                                 materials incidents can happen almost anywhere, certain areas
                                 are at higher risk. Areas near roadways, railways, pipelines, air-
                                 ways, and waterways that are frequently used for transporting
                                 hazardous materials and areas near industrial facilities that use,
                                 store, or dispose of such materials have an increased risk. The
                                 primary transportation routes of hazardous materials in Orange
                                 County near the City of Seal Beach are the I-405 and I-605
                                 freeways. Some transportation of hazardous materials occurs on
                                 Pacific Coast Highway and Seal Beach Boulevard within the
                                 City. The City does not have direct authority to regulate the

                                 Statistically, the greatest danger to petroleum products lines and
                                 natural gas lines is an accidental dig-in due to road maintenance
                                 and utility or traffic signal systems repairs, renovations, and new

                                 manner, the City will be able to isolate graphically those areas
                                 where these facilities would be in danger of failure during a
                                 seismic event or other emergency and then develop a planned

                                 The airspace around the City of Seal Beach is among the busiest
                                 in the nation. Hazardous materials may be transported by air
                                 over Seal Beach or to destinations at John Wayne Airport, Long
                                 Beach Airport, and Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base.
                                 Finally, because Seal Beach is a coastal city, it is exposed to oil
                                 tanker traffic as well as other ships carrying hazardous materials,
                                 particularly Navy ships utilizing the Seal Beach Naval Weapons

                                 Because of the distance of the major hazardous materials trans-
                                 portation routes to the residential areas of Seal Beach, the threat
                                 of a significant hazardous materials emergency is minimal. Pre-

                                 will largely affect the potential magnitude of hazardous materials
                                 incidents. Wind direction and velocity, ambient air and ground
                                 temperature, and precipitation and humidity will affect the
                                 spread of gases, vapors, mists, and the dusts of hazardous mate-

                                 liquids.
                                 The most likely hazardous materials exposure is use of hazard-

                                 As a storage facility for naval ordnance, the Seal Beach Naval
                                 Weapons Station is a source of hazardous materials. As such,
                                 the Navy has developed weapons handling procedures to safe-

                                 Another possible source of a hazardous material is a sewage spill
                                 or a mixing of sewage, industrial waste or pollutant discharges
                                 with storm drainage waters. This is naturally not acceptable, but
                                 operational maintenance and system capacities must support the

Topic 3: Geologic Hazards
Seismic Hazards Mapping Act
                                 Prompted by damaging earthquakes in northern and southern
                                 California, in 1990 the state legislature passed the Seismic Haz-
                                 ards Mapping Act. The purpose of this Act is to protect public
                                 safety from the effects of strong ground shaking, liquefaction,
                                 landslides and other ground failures, and other hazards caused
                                 by earthquakes. The State Geologist is mandated to prepare
                                 “Seismic Hazard Maps” that delineate the following seismic
                                 hazard zones:
                                 •    Amplified shaking hazard zones,
                                 •    Liquefaction hazard zones, and
                                 •    Earthquake-induced landslide hazard zones.
                                 The seismic hazards maps are 7½o California Geological Survey
                                 Quadrangles (Scale 1-24,000). The seismic hazards maps for the
                                 Seal Beach area were released on March 25, 1999. The map
                                 shows areas where liquefaction or landslide movement is known
                                 to have occurred and areas where the potential exists for lique-

Geology
       Regional Setting
                                 Southern California is composed of several tectonic plates that
                                 move relative to each other. The primary zone of contact be-
                                 tween these plates is the San Andreas Fault zone, lying about 60
                                 miles north/northeast of the City of Seal Beach. The area west
                                 of the San Andreas Fault is known as the Pacific Plate, which is
                                 moving north relative to the North American Plate on the east
                                 side of the fault. Each large plate is composed of smaller plates,
                                 moving relative to each other. The relative movements and col-
                                 lisions of these plates have created structures and geomorphic
                                 features with various orientations.
                                 The City of Seal Beach is in the Los Angeles coastal plain in the
                                 Peninsular Ranges of southern California, made up of hills and
                                 ranges with intervening, long, and narrow valleys that trend

        Topography
                                 The majority of the City is located within an alluvial plain that
                                 extends southward from the convergence of Coyote Creek and
                                 the San Gabriel River. The two channels drain from the north-
                                 east and north, respectively, and the combined flow reaches the
                                 sea at Alamitos Gap. Landing Hill, located within Seal Beach,
                                 and Alamitos Heights in Long Beach and Bolsa Chica Mesa in
                                 Huntington Beach, consisting of uplifted blocks within the
                                 Newport-Inglewood Fault zone, are the major topographic fea-
                                 tures within and near the City. Elevations within the City vary
                                 from approximately sea level along the Pacific Ocean to 60 feet
                                 at Landing Hill. The Landing Hill area is part of the Newport-
                                 Inglewood Fault System.
Faulting and Seismicity
        Seismic Measurement
                                 Earthquakes are measured two different ways – the Richter scale
                                 (magnitude of energy released) and the Modified Mercalli scale
                                 (intensity of movement or affects of shaking).
                                 The Richter scale is a well known, but often misunderstood, sys-
                                 tem used primarily by seismologists to evaluate and compare the
                                 energy of individual quakes according to an absolute and objec-
                                 tive scale. The magnitude of energy released is calculated from
                                 the instrumental record made by the event on a calibrated seis-
                                 mograph. Seismographs record a zigzag trace that shows the
                                 varying amplitude of ground oscillations beneath the instrument.

                                 Magnitude is expressed in whole numbers and decimal fractions.
                                 Because of the logarithmic basis of the scale, each whole num-
                                 ber increase in magnitude corresponds to the release of about 30
                                 times more energy than the amount associated with the preced-
                                 ing whole number value. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake
                                 with a magnitude 8.3 generated 1 million times more energy
                                 than the 4.3 magnitude earthquake that occurred in Laguna
                                 Beach in 1969. Furthermore, the Richter magnitude does not
                                 give any indication of the actual damage caused by the quake.
                                 Other factors must be considered: distance to the epicenter and
                                 its focal depth, as well as geological conditions at the location of
                                 damage. Even with these data, the Richter magnitude is more
                                 meaningful and useful to the scientist than the layman.
                                 The Modified Mercalli scale is subjective and related not to the
                                 energy released, but to people’s perception of the quake and the
                                 damage done, as determined by field surveys. This scale is more
                                 significant to the public, since its steps are delineated by cracked
                                 plaster, fallen buildings, ground failure, and citizens’ panic,
                                 rather than energy relationships measured by instruments. The
                                 Modified Mercalli Scale provides a description of the effect of
                                 the different levels of earthquake intensity with the correspond-

                                 one of the most active seismic regions in the United States.
                                 Each year, low and moderate intensity earthquakes occur within
                                 or near the region. Southern California is likely to experience, on
                                 average, one earthquake of M 7.0 and ten earthquakes of M 6.0
                                 over a period of ten years. There are several active and poten-

Table S-1 - Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale
The first scale to reflect earthquake intensities was developed by de Rossi of Italy and Forel of Switzerland in the
I880s. This scale, with values from I to X, was used for about two decades. A need for a more refined scale
increased with the advancement of the science of seismology, and in 1902 the Italian seismologist, Mercalli,
devised a new scale of a I to XII range. The Mercalli Scale was modified in 1931 by American seismologists
Harry O. Wood and Frank Neuman to take into account modern structural features:
I       (2) Not felt except by a very few under especially favorable circumstances
II      (2) Felt only by a few persons at rest, especially on upper floors of buildings. Delicately suspended
               objects may swing.
III     (3) Felt quite noticeably indoors, especially on upper floors of buildings, but many people do not
               recognize it as an earthquake. Vibration like a passing truck. Duration estimated.
IV      (4) During the day felt indoors by many, outdoors by few. At night some awakened. Dishes, windows,
               doors disturbed; walls make cracking sound. Sensation like heavy truck striking building. Standing
               motor cars rocked noticeably.
V       (4) Felt by nearly everyone, many awakened. Some dishes, windows, etc., broken. A few instances of
               cracked plaster; unstable objects overturned. Disturbances of trees, poles, and other tall objects
               sometimes noticed. Pendulum clocks may stop.
VI      (5) Felt by all, many frightened and run outdoors. Some heavy furniture moved; a few instances of fallen
               plaster or damaged chimneys. Damage slight.
VII (5-6) Everybody runs outdoors. Damage negligible in building of good design and construction; slight to
               moderate in well-built ordinary structures; considerable in poorly-built or badly designed structures;
               some chimneys broken. Noticed by persons driving motor cars.
VIII (6) Damage slight in specially designed structures; considerable in ordinary substantial buildings, with
               partial collapse; great in poorly built structures. Panel walls thrown out of frame structures. Fall of
               chimneys, factory stacks, columns, monuments, walls. Heavy furniture overturned. Sand and mud
               ejected in small amounts. Changes in well water. Persons driving motor cars disturbed.
IX      (7) Damage considerable in specially designed structures; well designed frame structures thrown out of
               plumb; great in substantial buildings, with partial collapse. Buildings shifted off foundations. Ground
               cracked conspicuously. Underground pipes broken.
X       (7-8+) Some well-built wooden structures destroyed; most masonry and frame structures destroyed with
               foundation; ground badly cracked. Rails bent. Landslides considerable from river banks and steep
               slopes. Shifted sand and mud. Water splashed (slopped) over banks.
XI      (8+) Few, if any, (masonry) structures remain standing. Bridges destroyed. Broad fissures in ground.
               Underground pipelines completely out of service. Earth slumps and land slips in soft ground. Rails
               bent greatly.
XII (8+) Damage total. Practically all works of construction are damaged greatly or destroyed. Waves seen on
               ground surface. Lines of sight and level are distorted. Objects are thrown upward into the air.

        Regional Seismic Conditions
                                 Southern California is located in a seismically active area. There
                                 have been many earthquakes throughout recorded history; some
                                 have been large. The 1933 Long Beach quake was the most
                                 powerful and closest shock to hit Seal Beach in living memory,
                                 and the 1994 Northridge quake was the most recent powerful
                                 shock. Both of these were felt widely across the Los Angeles ba-
                                 sin and caused considerable damage. In October, 1969, a quake
                                 occurred that was felt predominantly in Laguna Beach and
                                 South Laguna. By way of comparison, the three quakes listed
                                 above had the following Richter magnitudes: 1933 Long Beach -
                                 6.3; 1994 Northridge - 6.8; 1969 Laguna Beach - 4.3. The re-
                                 spective Mercalli magnitudes as perceived in Seal Beach were
                                 VI, V, and III.
                                 Table S-2 shows that among the 10 active faults and fault zones
                                 identified within 100 km of the City of Seal Beach, 3 faults are
                                 expected to generate earthquakes of significance. These are the
                                 Newport-Inglewood, the Whittier-Elsinore and the Palos
                                 Verdes Fault zones. Despite MCE values of M7.5 and larger, the
                                 San Andreas, Raymond, San Fernando-Sierra Madre, and San
                                 Jacinto systems are of secondary consideration because of their
                                 large distances from the City. With expected accelerations below
                                 0.4 g, damage from ground shaking generated along the Whit-
                                 tier-Elsinore Fault and the offshore Palos Verdes Fault could be
                                 reduced effectively by complying with ordinary California Uni-
                                 form Building Code requirements for Seismic Zone 4. However,
                                 the proximity of the northwestern tip of the Newport-
                                 Inglewood northern (upper) branch, calls for extremely detailed
                                 site-specific geotechnical investigations in areas impacted by the
                                 Newport-Inglewood Fault. These earth-engineering studies
                                 would better and more accurately estimate the reaction of the

        Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone
                                 This zone (see Figure S-5), made up of several faults and frac-
                                 tures, extends southeast through the Los Angeles Basin. The
                                 north branch of the Newport-Inglewood Fault (distinctly differ-
                                 ent from the fault zone) is made up of up to 3 segments; thus,
                                 the accurate location of individual fault traces is likely to be un-
                                 certain. The fault is at least 10 miles long, and its Holocene ac-
                                 tivity is revealed by characteristic offset stratigraphy and
                                 groundwater cut-offs in young Quaternary alluvium. The activity
                                 of this fault was proven by the 1933 Long Beach M6.2 earth-
                                 quake. The Seal Beach Fault, a segment of the Newport-
                                 Inglewood Fault zone, is located within the City and generally
                                 parallels the coastline, extending from Long Beach generally
                                 through the Hellman Ranch property and the Seal Beach Naval
                                 Weapons Station, southerly through Huntington Beach and
                                 along the coast to Newport Beach. Exploration wells have iden-
                                 tified the Seal Beach Fault at a depth of over 4,000 feet. The
                                 Seal Beach Fault is considered potentially active and is included
                                 in the Earthquake Fault Zones established under the Alquist-

                                 The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was passed in
                                 1972 to mitigate the hazard of surface faulting to structures for
                                 human occupancy. The main purpose of the Act is to prevent
                                 the construction of buildings used for occupancy by humans on
                                 the surface trace of active faults.
                                 Under the Act, the State Geologist has established regulatory
                                 zones on the surface traces of active faults and is distributing
                                 maps of these zones to all affected cities, counties, and state
                                 agencies. The zones are referred to as “Earthquake Fault
                                 Zones” (formerly called “Special Study Zones”) and provide the
                                 municipality or jurisdiction with a tool to plan and control new
                                 or renewed construction within the fault zones.
                                 Before a proposed project can begin, a geotechnical investiga-

                                  bounds the northern edge of the Santa Ana Mountains. The
                                  Glen Ivy North and Glen Ivy South Faults are the two Elsinore
                                  system members that could most likely affect the City, and are
                                  20 to 25 miles away. The north branch, at least 17 miles in
                                  length, shows Holocene activity through offset stratigraphy and
                                  characteristic physiographic features. Moreover, this fault is be-
                                  lieved to be the originator of the M6 earthquake of 1910 in the
                                  area. The Whittier Fault, 16 miles away from the City, offsets
                                  Holocene stratigraphy near the Santa Ana River. It is believed
                                  that the 1987 Whittier-Narrows M5.9 earthquake occurred along
                                  concealed thrust segments of this fault, located 6 to 10 miles be-
                                  low the earth surface. For a given earthquake magnitude, a
                                  thrust faulting mechanism may generate the highest peak accel-
                                  eration when compared with other mechanisms, and thus may
                                  cause damage in excess of that anticipated.
        Palos Verdes Fault
                                  This fault separates the Palos Verdes hills from the Los Angeles
                                  basin. The fault has an active offshore component crossing the
                                  San Pedro shelf, and is located 15 miles away from the City.
        Potentially Active Faults
                                  Potentially active faults – i.e., those that show evidence of dis-
                                  placement during the last 2 million years, but not during the last
                                  11,000 years – are represented in the general area of the City by
                                  the Camarillo-Simi-Santa Susana, Indian Hill-San Jose, Eagle
                                  Rock-San Rafael, and Mission Hills fault systems. Because their

        Seismicity
                                 The expected ground motion characteristics of earthquakes at a
                                 given location depend on the distance of the source of the
                                 earthquake to the site, the characteristics of the generating fault
                                 (intensity of the earthquake and duration of shaking), and the
                                 site-specific geologic and geotechnical conditions. All other
                                 conditions being equal, the severity of groundshaking increases
                                 with proximity to the epicenter of the earthquake. Assuming
                                 equal distance to the epicenter and equal seismic energy output,
                                 the least amount of damage would occur on a site underlain by
                                 bedrock at a shallow depth. A site underlain by thick alluvium
                                 would experience considerably more damage because of the
                                 soil’s tendency to permanently deform to a greater degree than
                                 the bedrock. The intensity of groundshaking (maximum hori-
                                 zontal ground acceleration) is measured relative to the accelera-
                                 tion caused by gravity (g). California Uniform Building Code
                                 standard engineering designs for Seismic Zone 4 can be applied
                                 to accelerations less than 0.4g. Special designs are necessary for
                                 values above 0.4g.
                                 The most likely source of strong earthquake shaking within the
                                 general area would be a major earthquake (up to M8.25) on the
                                 San Andreas Fault, 58 miles to the north-northeast. This active
                                 fault is believed to have a recurrence interval of 100 to 200
                                 years. Although the San Andreas Fault is expected to generate
                                 strong earthquakes, because of the great distance between this
                                 fault and the City, the average peak acceleration is expected to
                                 be within the 0.4 g bound as indicated in Table S-2. The New-
                                 port-Inglewood fault zone, located within the City and desig-
                                 nated the Seal Beach Fault, is likely to generate 0.5g or higher
                                 ground accelerations.
                                 The greatest hazard from ground-shaking is the effect on the
                                 structures and the occupants of the structures. The manner in
                                 which structures respond to earth movements is dependent
                                 upon the type of construction, the underlying geology, and the
                                 magnitude of and distance from the earthquake.

                                             Statewide seismic design standards for new construction were
                                             not included in building codes until 1933, after the Long Beach
                                             earthquake. Although seismic design standards have improved
                                             over the years, they are minimum standards and will not make
                                             buildings completely resistant to damage from earthquakes.
                                             Seismic design standards are only meant to increase structural
                                             stability, reduce damage, and minimize loss of life.
                                             Generally, certain types of construction withstand ground
                                             movement better than others. Wood frame, single-story residen-
                                             tial structures are the most stable during an earthquake. Struc-

                                             susceptible to damage. Unreinforced masonry construction was
                                             prevalent during the late 1800s to early 1900s for commercial
                                             structures. There are no unreinforced masonry buildings in Seal

                                 The local geology affects the intensity of earthquake shockwaves
                                 as they pass through the area. All of Seal Beach is located on
                                 thick alluvial sediments. Severe damage to structures can result
                                 where tall structures are built over thick, soft, water-saturated
                                 soils. The presence of a high water table can make damage
                                 worse. Areas of thick surficial soils on hillsides may also be sus-
                                 ceptible to increased shaking. Geologic conditions vary so
                                 markedly that each individual site must be evaluated to deter-
                                 mine the seismic standards necessary for construction.
                                 Some facilities warrant special seismic standards because of their
                                 occupancy and/or their function. Schools, hospitals, and facili-
                                 ties necessary for emergency operations fall into this category.
                                 Other facilities, such as utility lines, warrant special attention to
                                 siting and seismic design standards. The Uniform Building Code
                                 addresses these facilities under the classification of “essential fa-

                                 ocean. The primary impact on natural gas facilities would be
                                 fires, which could be expected due to broken gas mains and ser-
                                 vice connections in the areas of high liquefaction potential. Fires
                                 can be very difficult to deal with when there are damaged road-

Geologic Hazards
                                 Geologic hazards affecting the City area are direct, construction-
                                 related effects and indirect effects that occur only during earth-
                                 quakes. Table S-3 presents five construction-related effects and
                                 two indirect, earthquake-induced impacts. Other generally rec-
                                 ognized impacts are simply not expected within the majority of
                                 the City for various reasons. Tsunamis would only affect the
                                 shoreline along the Pacific Ocean and at Anaheim Bay. Similarly,
                                 the potential impact on mineral resources exists only on the
                                 Hellman Ranch property and the Seal Beach Naval Weapons
                                 Station, as those are the only mineral production areas within
                                 the City. Landsliding, either as a direct impact or as an earth-
                                 quake-induced event, would only occur in close proximity to
                                 Landing Hill, due to the practically flat site topography of the
                                 remainder of the City.
                                 Because the most hazardous impacts are those related to, and
                                 triggered by, seismic events, detailed presentations on “Ground-

         Groundshaking during Moderate to Strong Earthquakes
                                         Groundshaking is the movement of the earth during an earth-
                                         quake. This type of deformation does not necessarily cause
                                         permanent ground displacement, but improperly designed struc-
                                         tures can be damaged by groundshaking, with considerable
                                         property losses and possible endangerment of human life.
                                         At present there are several ways of estimating shaking magni-
                                         tude at a particular site. Seismic intensities or peak horizontal
                                         acceleration and velocity can be calculated. Such calculations
                                         provide an estimate of the shaking potential that is essential for
                                         design and building codes.
                                         Because the Los Angeles Basin is an earthquake-prone area, it is
                                         not possible to plan and construct buildings that are completely
                                         risk-free in the region. Strong ground movements are unavoid-

                                 earthquake. The major geologic data on which the assessment is
                                 based include the thickness of Holocene and Quaternary depos-
                                 its, the depth to cemented alluvium, and the depth to the crystal-
                                 line basement. It is generally accepted that the thicker the

                                 base, the stronger the ground response to any given seismic
                                 event.
                                 The necessary earth-engineering data are the textural characteris-

                                 lated in unconsolidated Holocene sediments), the stronger the
                                 groundshaking. The sediment wetness at the time the earth-
                                 quake occurs amplifies the potential for earthquake induced
                                 damage. However, such an effect is not unquestionably sup-
                                 ported by all specialists in the field. Information on sediment
                                 wetness is presented in publications as a parameter that ex-

        Liquefaction
                                 During strong earthquakes, unconsolidated and water-saturated
                                 sediments may experience bulk densification leading to an in-
                                 stantaneous rise in sediment pore-water pressure. During this
                                 extremely short period, the load within the soil mass is carried
                                 by the water, and the soil acquires the mechanical consistency of
                                 a suspension; for a short, but critical period, the soil becomes
                                 fluid. This process of consistency change from solid to fluid is
                                 called liquefaction.
                                 When a soil beneath a structure liquefies, the structure loses its
                                 integrity with extremely dangerous consequences. Although liq-

                                 Because liquefaction is a particular expression of groundshaking,
                                 the potential of which was previously indicated to be a function
                                 of site geology and earth-engineering characteristics, the lique-
                                 faction potential is also assessed based on geologic and site-
                                 specific geotechnical data. The geologic data that determine the
                                 liquefaction opportunity (distinctly different from potential) are
                                 mainly earthquake related; they are the existence of active faults,
                                 their characteristic (average) strain if known, and the recurrence
                                 of large earthquakes on such faults. The earthquake magnitude
                                 is an all-important geologic parameter when assessing liquefac-
                                 tion potential because it is strongly correlated with shaking am-
                                 plitude and duration, both of which have been found to trigger
                                 liquefaction in susceptible soils. This element of susceptibility,
                                 discussed in the next paragraphs, combined with the liquefac-
                                 tion opportunity previously mentioned, leads to the estimation
                                 of the liquefaction potential at any particular site.
                                 Liquefaction susceptibility is based on both geologic and geo-
                                 technical data. The geologic data refer to the age of the sediment
                                 and the depositional process leading to sediment formation.
                                 Thus, river-channels and flood-plains are considered most sus-
                                 ceptible to liquefaction, while alluvial fans have a lower suscep-
                                 tibility. From the standpoint of sediment age it is also accepted
                                 that, in the Los Angeles area, latest Holocene (deposited in the
                                 last 1,000 years), Holocene (deposited within the last 11,000
                                 years), and late-middle Pleistocene (deposits formed in the last 1
                                 million years), are associated with distinctly different suscepti-
                                 bilities to liquefaction: the young Holocene is characterized by a
                                 very high and the Pleistocene by a minimal susceptibility to liq-
                                 uefaction. The sediment deposition period is important because
                                 aging leads to at least a partial cementation of the earth matrix
                                 and thus an increase in the geologic consolidation. Generally,
                                 the older the sediment, the higher the likelihood that the sedi-
                                 ment is consolidated, or even over-consolidated, which implies
                                 that soils are of high strength and are therefore not liquefiable.

Safety Element
                                 Another important element that has appreciable impact on the
                                 susceptibility to liquefaction is the hydrologic condition of the
                                 site, namely the existence of, and the depth to, a body of
                                 groundwater. This is significant because the liquefaction event
                                 can take place only in water-saturated soil. Thus, it is accepted
                                 that groundwater shallower than 30 feet corresponds to condi-
                                 tions of high and very high susceptibilities, while deeper water
                                 represents low and very low susceptibilities.
                                 The geotechnical characteristics that dramatically influence liq-
                                 uefaction behavior are the particle-size characteristics, gradation,
                                 confining pressure, and relative density of the deposit. The par-
                                 ticle shape, the general fabric, and the principal stress ratio in
                                 the earth mass are potentially important characteristics. Unlike
                                 general geologic characteristics, geotechnical investigation lead-
                                 ing to detailed soil engineering characterization must be done on
                                 a site-specific basis. The liquefaction risk can only be mitigated
                                 through designs based on meticulous geotechnical site investiga-

                                 of a liquefaction event (refer to Figure S-6).
Landslides
                                 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defines a
                                 landslide as:
                                       “Downward and outward movement of slope forming ma-
                                       terials composed of natural rock, soils, artificial fills, or
                                       combinations of these materials. The moving mass may be
                                       preceded by any of three principal types of movement: fal-
                                       ling, sliding, or flowing or by their combinations.”
                                 Although the term landslide is generally assumed to mean any
                                 slide of rock or soil down a hill, the term actually encompasses a
                                 number of different types of earth movements. Lateral shifts of
                                 level ground or rotational movement of land triggered by heavy
                                 saturation, liquefaction, or earthquakes are also classified as
                                 landslides. An ancient landslide can lie dormant for years with
                                 imperceptible creep and gradual consolidation and settlement.

                                 Gradually the shear strength of the old slide mass is overcome
                                 and reactivation occurs as a slow or rapid movement.
                                 The occurrence of landslides is a part of the continuous, natural
                                 process of the downhill movement of soil, rock, and rock de-
                                 bris. The speed at which this earth material moves down slope
                                 can range from imperceptible creep of soil to sudden mass
                                 movements of an entire hillside. The size of a landslide can
                                 range from several square feet in area to several square miles.
                                 Slide thickness may range from less than a foot to several hun-
                                 dred feet. It is important to remember that the complex ar-
                                 rangement of earth and rock units sometimes results in one
                                 piece of land having a sound and stable geological foundation
                                 while another piece immediately adjacent, perhaps on the same
                                 lot, may be entirely different and potentially unstable. It is there-
                                 fore necessary to study each development proposal individually.
        Landslide Hazard Reduction
                                 Damage due to landslides can be reduced through avoidance,
                                 removal, or permanent stabilization. The first step is to recog-
                                 nize the existence of an ancient landslide or the probability of a
                                 future landslide. This is accomplished through detailed geologic
                                 mapping, trenching, drilling, and photo interpretation of surface
                                 geologic conditions. Ancient landslides located in undisturbed
                                 and undeveloped areas are the easiest to detect through the use
                                 of photo interpretation. Detection in developed areas may be
                                 much more difficult because the characteristic features of land-
                                 slides’ lobe-like forms and track-like hollows are often obscured.
                                 Probable future slides can often be anticipated in areas where
                                 other landsliding has already taken place. Hillsides covered with
                                 deep soils or that are heavily saturated with groundwater may be
                                 potential landslide areas. Additionally, landslide possibilities are
                                 greatly increased where the bedrock and hill slope directions
                                 tend to be the same.
                                 In order to determine the precise origin of the topographic
                                 form, it is necessary to conduct supplementary subsurface ex-
                                 plorations. Once the configuration of a potentially active land-
                                 slide is known by subsurface investigation, the threshold values
                                 of failure can be calculated. A value of 1.0 represents equilib-
                                 rium, where the forces resisting failure or movement equal those
                                 forces that cause failure. A value below 1.0 would indicate where
                                 a geological failure (i.e., landslide) is expected to occur. The pre-
                                 sent minimum accepted level of safety value is 1.5, which means
                                 that the geological feature is 50% stronger than equilibrium or
                                 the forces promoting failure.

                                 1)     Leaving hazardous areas undeveloped.
                                 2)     Removing unstable slope material.

                                        root systems.

                                 absolutely definitive because extreme events, such as unusually
                                 heavy precipitation or severe seismic events, are not predictable.
                                 Within Seal Beach there are few areas where landsliding would
                                 be a concern. The steep slope areas adjacent to Landing Hill
                                 would be the primary areas of concern. The State Division of

                                 Seiches are stationary oscillations of enclosed or partly enclosed

                                 be inundated by a tsunami. The chance of this occurring appears
                                 to be low based on existing data; but if an earthquake happened
                                 along the Newport-Inglewood fault, a tsunami of a much higher

                                     construction standards for new essential facilities.
                                 3M. Evaluate the long-term risks and their associated costs
                                     versus the costs of relocation when major improvements
                                     to existing essential facilities are proposed and the facilities
                                     are located in known hazardous areas. Relocate the facility

Topic 4: Fire Hazards
                                 California experiences large, destructive wildland fires almost
                                 every year. In October and early November of 1993, 26 major
                                 fires burned more than 200,000 acres in Southern California.
                                 The potential for a severe wildfire to occur is increased when
                                 dense vegetation growth and large accumulations of dead plant
                                 material are present. Weather conditions and steep terrain also
                                 increase the hazardous wildfire potential; however, these condi-
                                 tions do not cause wildfires. Human error, arson, high-voltage
                                 lines, vehicles, and lightning are the primary causes of wildfires.
                                 Moreover, an expanding population seeking living space and
                                 recreation in the fire hazardous wildland contributes to the
                                 problem. The City of Seal Beach, typifying the more urban con-
                                 ditions throughout the State, does not face a serious threat of
                                 wildland fires.
                                 Structural fires, which typically involve only a single structure,
                                 are the most common fires that are battled routinely by local fire
                                 departments. Some of the common causes of structural fires are
                                 arson, electrical problems, combustibles too close to heat
                                 sources, unattended cooking, and misuse of smoking materials.
                                 The combination of building materials, density, fire flow, hy-
                                 drant location, response time of emergency equipment and
                                 natural conditions can exacerbate potential structural fire disas-
                                 ters.
Orange County Fire Authority
                                 The Orange County Fire Authority contracts with the City to
                                 provide needed fire, emergency medical and rescue services. The
                                 Fire Authority also works with the City’s Planning Department
                                 and developers on construction projects that impact fire protec-

Fire Hazard Severity Classification System
                                 There are three levels of fire hazard zones within wildland of
                                 Orange County. These zones are adapted from a fire hazard se-
                                 verity classification system for California wildland developed by
                                 the State of California Department of Forestry. These classes are
                                 moderate, high and extreme fire hazard. This classification util-

                                 this category. Most of these have been altered by man’s actions:
                                 urban development, cattle grazing, fuel breaks, etc. Medium fu-
                                 els include brush and other perennial shrubs less than six feet in
                                 height with a crown density of 20 percent or more. This com-
                                 prises a very small area in Seal Beach, primarily at the Hellman
                                 Ranch property. Heavy fuels are the heavier brush species,
                                 woodland types and timber types over six feet in height with a
                                 crown density of 20 percent or more. In Seal Beach these areas
                                 are predominantly defined by stands of Eucalyptus globulus
                                 (Blue Gum) located on the Bixby Old Ranch Golf Course and at
                                 Gum Grove Park.
                                 Fire Weather includes three classes. Each class is related to the
                                 frequency of critical fire weather days occurring in each of the
                                 State’s Fire Danger Rating Areas over an eight to ten year period
                                 (Fire Danger Rating Areas are wildland geographical areas hav-
                                 ing similar climate.). The Low Class (Class 1), includes all those
                                 Fire Danger Rating Areas which have experienced fire weather
                                 in the very high or extreme ranges on an annual average of less
                                 than one day; the High Class (Class 2), has an annual average of
                                 1 to 9.5 days; and the Extreme Class (Class 3), has an annual av-
                                 erage of more than 9.5 days. Each United States Geological Sur-
                                 vey topographic map in the State is keyed to one of the Fire
                                 Danger Rating Areas and assigned that area’s critical fire weather
                                 frequency classification. Based on the above methodology, Seal
                                 Beach has been classified as a Class 1 Fire Danger Area.
                                 Slope is divided into four classes as part of the Fire Hazard Se-
                                 verity Classification Scale. The following classes are based on
                                 the slope: 0-9.9 percent, 10 to 19.9 percent, 20 to 39.9 percent
                                 and over 40 percent. Slope is recognized as having an effect on
                                 fire behavior similar to the effect of wind (i.e., an increase in
                                 slope produces an increase in the rate of fire spread). The sys-
                                 tem therefore assigns values to slope, which modify the various
                                 fire danger indices accordingly. Seal Beach falls within the 0-9.9
                                 percent classification.
                                 Each class of fuel loading, fire weather, and slope is assigned a
                                 severity factor value. The values are multiplied in a matrix to

Wildland Fire Hazard Potential
                                 Several factors affect the hazard potential one can expect from a
                                 wildland fire in any given area. These factors include topogra-
                                 phy, vegetation, climate, development patterns, access, and fire
                                 fighting capabilities to the area. All of the factors combined to
                                 contribute to the devastating wildfire in Laguna Beach on Octo-
                                 ber 27, 1993, which engulfed 16,682 acres, destroyed 366 homes
                                 (286 homes within the City limits) and damaged 642 homes.
Topography
                                 The topography of Seal Beach can best be described as being
                                 flat with a single high elevation point of Landing Hill. This to-
                                 pographical condition has not much effect on wildland fire be-
                                 havior and on the ability of fire fighters and their equipment to
                                 take action to suppress those fires. This topography also allows
                                 for a dispersal of air flow, thereby not creating extremely erratic
                                 winds.
Vegetation
                                 Along with the local topography, marine influences play a sig-
                                 nificant role in shaping the fire hazard potential for the area.
                                 The topography and soils encountered within the City of Seal
                                 Beach, along with climatic conditions, predominantly influenced
                                 by the Pacific Ocean, and the urbanization of the City, have
                                 contributed to the plant environment found in Seal Beach. The
                                 urbanization of the area, with the exception of the Seal Beach
                                 Naval Weapons Station, has eliminated most native plant re-
                                 gimes within the community. The general vegetative characteris-
                                 tic of the City of Seal Beach is of typical urban landscaping, with
                                 primary ground cover being devoted to decorative grass and
                                 landscape species.

Safety Element
                                 Gum Grove Park is an urban forest area of approximately 14.9
                                 acres located north of Pacific Coast Highway and west of Seal
                                 Beach Boulevard. The primary vegetative species of the park is
                                 eucalyptus trees, which were introduced in the 1920s.
Climate
                                 Climate is the single most important contributing factor to the
                                 fire problem. The Santa Ana winds are a phenomenon caused
                                 by very dry and warm air originating from high-pressure systems
                                 over California, Utah, and Nevada. Winds can reach 70+ miles
                                 per hour and have a humidity of near zero. Precipitation (its an-
                                 nual total, seasonal distribution, and storm intensity) has further
                                 effects on the moisture content of dead and living vegetation
                                 and hence has important effects on fire ignition and behavior
                                 potential. Precipitation in Orange County averages between 9
                                 and 15 inches per year and generally falls during the period from
                                 November to April. Most of the large fires occur during the fall,
                                 following abnormally wet winters.
                                 The wind is a separate factor once a large brushfire has begun. It
                                 drives the fire before it, increasing the rate of spread downwind
                                 in proportion to its velocity. Passing through and beyond the
                                 fire, it then becomes a super-heated current of air that can move
                                 downhill rapidly and uphill many times faster, especially when
                                 funneled by the shape of gullies and canyons. Where the wind
                                 and topography combine to direct such an effect, the heat can
                                 be so intense that temperatures may reach 2,400 to 2,600 de-
                                 grees. A strong wind can also carry burning debris, igniting
                                 many spot fires, oftentimes from one-half mile to a mile down-
                                 wind.
                                 If enough area is ablaze simultaneously, the updraft from rising
                                 heat can generate a vortex or tornado that can lift up and propel
                                 firebrands over a wide area outside the original fire, which can
                                 then rapidly expand. The updraft can generate an unbalanced
                                 condition on uneven terrain, which presses the flames against any
                                 nearby steep slopes, igniting them. Therefore, even in the ab-
                                 sence of any prevailing wind, the fire can generate fire whirls
                                 that may move uphill with great rapidity. Auto-generation ef-
                                 fects can arise because of the fire itself, if it is sufficiently large.
                                 These are usually referred to collectively as a firestorm.

Development Patterns
                                 Development patterns can have considerable effect on fire igni-
                                 tion and rate of spread. This is especially true in the open space
                                 interface areas where the presence of man near highly flamma-
                                 ble brush creates a critical situation.
                                 Building design and material, small lots, and the resulting prox-
                                 imity of adjacent structures compound the potential impacts of
                                 structural fire. When these combine with the threats of brush
                                 fires, fire hazards reach critical concerns. The Surfside and the
                                 Seal Beach Trailer Park neighborhoods have been identified as
                                 having critical development patterns with respect to fire. The
                                 development patterns of these two areas of the City affect the
                                 potential for fire hazard; high-intensity development, small set-
                                 backs, and narrow roads all work to reduce the effectiveness of
                                 fire fighting efforts. In addition, small setbacks and flammable
                                 building materials, especially within close proximity to similar
                                 structures, tend to increase the propensity for fire and accelerate
                                 its spread. In recognition of these issues, the City of Seal Beach
                                 has required the provision of automatic sprinkler systems in all
                                 new residential development in Surfside and in all new two-story
                                 cabanas in the Seal Beach Trailer Park for many years.
                                 The most significant factor determining overall fire risk is hu-
                                 man proximity. The human element is often responsible for the
                                 ignition of major structural fires, as evidenced by the abundance
                                 and frequency of fires in the vicinity of residential neighbor-
                                 hoods. Unsupervised children, wood burning fireplaces, in-
                                 creased recreational use of the wildlands (off-road vehicles), and
                                 arson all contribute to the largest single source of fires – man.
Access
                                 Any discussion of access must simultaneously be concerned
                                 with egress, as well as ingress. Chapter 21 of the Seal Beach
                                 Municipal Code “Subdivisions” sets forth standards for roadway
                                 development. As a result of early lifestyles and concomitant de-
                                 velopmental patterns, numerous neighborhoods are currently
                                 served by roads that do not meet current design standards.
                                 Upgrading these roads to conformity is not, in certain areas, fea-
                                 sible or desirable. For the purposes of hazard identification, the
                                 Fire Authority has established a minimum unobstructed road-
                                 way width of 20 feet.

                                 For a variety of reasons, streets that fail to meet fire department
                                 minimum requirements for access can restrict emergency mobil-
                                 ity in the neighborhoods they serve. Among other reasons for
                                 road width inadequacy are subdivisions approved in the early
                                 1900s, when roadways were by nature much narrower than cur-
                                 rent standards, lack of available off-street parking, and insuffi-
                                 cient fire department turn-arounds. Due to the lot depths in the
                                 Old Town portion of the City, the Fire Authority would be able
                                 to access a restricted access area from an adjoining street. Situa-
                                 tions are untenable where personnel and equipment may be
                                 trapped or unable to reach the fire or flee from its path. The
                                 City Council will direct the Fire Authority to identify those areas
                                 with only a single access to and from the community, and to as-
                                 sist in developing alternative access points. By providing a sec-
                                 ond access roadway, movement of fire apparatus can be
                                 deployed as evacuation is taking place. Deployment of fire fight-
                                 ing equipment is critical to successful fire defense of any com-

                                 A four-year average (1997-2001) reveals that the Fire Authority
                                 responded to approximately 200 calls per year. Of theses 200
                                 calls, 77 were actual structure fires and the balance were vehicle
                                 and other types of fires.
Local Programs and Legislation
                                 As experienced by the City of Seal Beach in the January 1995
                                 floods, the Mutual Aid system works very well. However, miti-
                                 gation measures must be implemented to ensure that the vulner-
                                 ability to structural fires is reduced. The success of increasing
                                 public safety regarding fire hazards relies on systematically fight-

                                 These programs include systematic amendments to the building
                                 codes and fire codes, developing guidelines for the placement
                                 and location of fire hydrants, developing landscape guidelines,
                                 defensible space management on a city-wide basis, and analyzing

Planning and Maintenance of Outdoor Areas Adjacent to Homes
                                 While fuel modification deals with the treatment of the ur-
                                 ban/wildlands interface, the concept of defensible space applies
                                 to all areas of the City. Creation of defensible space means the
                                 arrangement of access on the property for ease of fire fighting
                                 and maintenance of properties to minimize buildup of fuel that
                                 could ignite and cause fire to spread to the home.
                                 Better access for fire fighting should include the following:
                                 •   providing safe walkways around all sides of the house; and
                                     keeping side yards unobstructed and free of flammable
                                     stored items.
                                 Maintenance for fire safety should include the following:
                                 •   thinning of planting to remove dead wood and to reduce
                                     build-up of branches and foliage;
                                 •   removal of dried leaves and grasses, dead limbs and twigs;
                                     and chipping, composting and mulching planting areas
                                     where feasible;
                                 •   spacing and pruning of trees and shrubs to avoid continuous
                                     canopies and “fuel ladders” from ground to canopy;
                                 •   removal of plants growing up under eaves;
                                 •   pruning of tree branches and shrubs within ten feet of a
                                     chimney;
                                 •   removal of leaves, pine needles and debris from roofs and
                                     rain gutters;
                                 •   removal of combustible stored material and debris from
                                     around and under the house and decks; and
                                 •   stacking of firewood as far away from the home as possible.
                                 When planning the landscape of a home, access for fire fighting
                                 should be considered in the design. Maintenance considerations
                                 outlined above should be considered in the choice and place-
                                 ment of plantings. When located adjacent to a natural vegetation
                                 area, construction of combustible structures – fences, decks, and
                                 gazebos – should be minimized. Wood decks with open areas
                                 underneath should be enclosed to reduce potential for ignition
                                 from fires below.

Planting and Fire-wise Plant Choices
                                 While much has been written and suggested regarding fire-
                                 resistant or fire-retardant plantings, the 1993 Laguna Beach fires
                                 demonstrated that any plant will burn. However, reasonable
                                 planting selections combined with sound arrangement and spac-
                                 ing and good maintenance can improve the chance that a struc-
                                 ture will survive a wildlands/fire-storm fire. Lists of suggested
                                 and not-recommended plants for the wildlands interface zone
                                 have been prepared by many public agencies, including the Or-
                                 ange County Task Force, County of Los Angeles Fire Depart-
                                 ment, and the City of Oakland, as well as by the garden
                                 publications. The County of Orange “Report of the Wild-
                                 land/Urban Interface Task Force,” July 1994, also includes a
                                 recommended plant list for fuel modification zones. A compari-
                                 son of these often conflicting lists reveals certain criteria for fire-
                                 wise planting as follows:
                                 •    Low fuel volume;
                                 •    High moisture content;
                                 •    High salt content;
                                 •    Low aromatic oil content;
                                 •    Low heat value;
                                 •    Minimal production of dry litter; and
                                 •    Suited to the site and climatic conditions so that plants will
                                      be healthy.
                                 Consistently “not recommended” plants include conifers (pines,
                                 cypress, cedar, and junipers). Also “not recommended” are aca-
                                 cia, bougainvillea, and ornamental grasses. Eucalyptus is “not
                                 recommended” on many lists because of the high aromatic oil
                                 content and the tendency of some species to produce high
                                 amounts of dry litter. The use of “not recommended” plants
                                 should be avoided adjacent to natural vegetation areas.
                                 Because of eucalyptus’s importance in the landscape of Seal
                                 Beach, it is important to look at this genus in more detail. There
                                 are over 700 species of eucalyptus, and they vary greatly in their
                                 size, fuel volume and litter production. An unmaintained blue
                                 gum, for example, has a great deal more flammable material in
                                 its shedding bark, leaf litter, and branches than a lemon gum.
                                 Many of the lemon gums survived the 1993 Laguna Beach fire
                                 with some charred trunks and loss of foliage. The County of
                                 Orange “Report of the Wildland/Urban Interface Task Force”
                                 did not single out or condemn eucalyptus. It emphasized irriga-

Weed Abatement
                                 The City of Seal Beach has had a weed abatement program for
                                 over 30 years. Property owners are notified when property they
                                 own is determined to be a weed nuisance. They then have the
                                 option of either abating this problem themselves or having the
                                 City do it and bill them for services rendered. In recent years the
                                 City has had this work performed through contract services.
                                 This program addresses only weed abatement and generally does
                                 not address native plant material that may be growing adjacent
                                 to an urbanized area.
Water System
                                 Approximately 75 percent of the water used in the City is local
                                 groundwater, with the additional 25 percent provided by the
                                 Metropolitan Water District (MWD). The City currently has
                                 three wells with a total pumping capacity of 11.2 million gallons
                                 of water per day (mgd). However, delivery capacity is limited to
                                 5 mgd by the capacity of the City’s reservoirs. The sources of
                                 MWD’s water include northern California and the Colorado
                                 River. The City currently has an average daily water demand of
                                 2.5 mgd and a maximum daily demand of 4.1 mgd.
                                 The amount of water required for extinguishing a single struc-
                                 ture fire can be calculated by using a complex formula that takes
                                 into account the building type, building construction materials,
                                 building area, material types stored inside the building, and the
                                 surrounding terrain. A fire similar in nature to the October 1993
                                 Laguna Beach firestorm would tax the water supply and delivery
                                 system substantially beyond its design capability. In order to
                                 maximize the fire safety system within the City, the City should

                                 state, water systems have considerable built-in capacity for de-
                                 taining storm waters that would otherwise surge too rapidly
                                 downstream and into estuarine basins. Hydrologists emphasize
                                 that, along natural watercourses, flooding is a routine process.
                                 Flooding in an urban setting can also be viewed as a natural haz-
                                 ard.
                                 Virtually all stages of the natural hydrologic cycle, including
                                 flooding, have been significantly altered by human intervention.
                                 Changes in land use have profound effects on runoff and ero-
                                 sion on the land surface. As vegetation is removed and soil is
                                 exposed during construction, erosion rates may increase signifi-
                                 cantly. The creation of impermeable surfaces that accompany
                                 urbanization increases and concentrates runoff, leading to a
                                 greater incidence of flooding.
                                 A flood may be defined as a temporary rise in stream flow that
                                 results in water overtopping its banks and inundating areas adja-
                                 cent to the channel not normally covered with water. The low-
                                 land area adjacent to the stream that is subject to periodic
                                 inundation by floodwater is known as the floodplain.
                                 The magnitude of a flood is measured in terms of its peak dis-
                                 charge, which is the maximum volume of water (in cubic feet
                                 per second) passing a point along the channel. Floods, however,
                                 are usually referred to in terms of their frequency of occurrence.
                                 For example, the 100 year flood is a flood magnitude which has
                                 a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
                                 There is a certain element of risk involved using this type of des-
                                 ignation because the prediction of a flood of a particular magni-
                                 tude is based on probability and an element of chance is
                                 involved. According to statistical averages, a 25-year flood
                                 should occur on the average once every 25 years. However, two
                                 25-year floods could conceivably occur in any one year. For
                                 planning purposes the flood magnitude most often used in de-
                                 lineating floodplain boundaries is the 100-year flood. This flood
                                 is also referred to as the intermediate regional or baseflood.

                                 The average annual rainfall is 13 inches. Over 90% of this rain-
                                 fall occurs between late October and early April.
                                 Flooding is a direct response to the amount, distribution, and in-
                                 tensity of precipitation. Most flooding damage is brought by
                                 sudden deluges of already soaked ground, or in the case of the
                                 coastal areas of the city, the combination of a storm surge with a
                                 high tide. Storms that combine high total rainfall, long duration,
                                 and high daily maxima, as in the 1995 storm, are the most de-
                                 structive. Heavy runoff and accelerated erosion are associated
                                 with this type of short period torrential rain, as well as with
                                 storms of longer duration and greater totals.
                                 Historically, floods causing significant damage occurred in Seal
                                 Beach in 1937, 1938, 1941, 1966, 1969, 1978, 1983 and 1995.
                                 Flood potential exists in the form of temporary floods related to
                                 winter rains and wave run-up. Most of the flood activity is iso-
                                 lated along the various drainage channels within the City or the
                                 immediate coastal area. Most flood conditions in Seal Beach are
                                 short lived in nature due to the limited size of the available wa-
                                 tershed and the presence of drainage improvements. Damage
                                 resulting from flooding in Seal Beach is more inundative than
                                 erosive in nature.
                                 In general, three separate and distinct types of inundation are
                                 known to exist in Seal Beach. Flood inundation hazards are
                                 those associated with major atmospheric events that result in in-
                                 undation of developed areas, due to overflow of nearby stream
                                 courses, or inadequacies in local storm drain facilities. Facility
                                 inundation hazards are those associated with downstream inun-
                                 dation that would occur given a major structural failure in a
                                 nearby impoundment. Such failures would most likely be caused
                                 by geologic phenomena including seismic events and slope in-
                                 stability. The third inundation hazard is storm surge run-up that
                                 may occur during a high tide.
                                 Sections of Seal Beach are subject to flooding due to wave run-up.
                                 This type of flooding is typically caused by large swells produced
                                 by storms at sea occurring at high tide. Wave run-up was espe-

                                 the Seal Beach Pier and the Navy Jetty, and at Surfside, in 1984.
                                 The water and debris left by the waves caused no damage to the
                                 commercial area; however, damage to the interior of homes near
                                 the beach area was substantial.

                                 of flooding. Urbanization often leads to a greater percentage of
                                 impervious surfaces, which increases the total volume of storm
                                 runoff by decreasing the amount of water that infiltrates into the
                                 ground. Development can also result in placing artificial fill and
                                 other objects in the floodplain.
                                 To protect development from the impacts of flooding, stream
                                 channels are often channelized (e.g., straightened, lined) to move
                                 the water off the land more efficiently. However, when water
                                 emerges from the improved section of stream channel, it is of-
                                 ten delivered to the unchannelized downstream section at rates
                                 and velocities that the natural section of stream is not capable of
                                 carrying. Piecemeal channelization efforts often exacerbate the
                                 flooding potential downstream. Therefore, it is important that
                                 flood hazard reduction operations be comprehensive, well
                                 planned programs.
Local Setting
                                 A “Master Plan of Drainage” was prepared for the City of Seal
                                 Beach in February 1999. This document identified the local
                                 network of existing flood control facilities and the condition and
                                 capacity of each one. The existing data was then combined with
                                 the estimated contributions from future anticipated land use to
                                 determine the total storm runoff for the City. The document
                                 then outlined a prioritized list of system improvements and a
                                 basis for establishing funding mechanisms. To continue to be
                                 effective, the Plan should be periodically updated to reflect new
                                 hydrologic modeling techniques, revised rainfall runoff data,
                                 changed land use and development patterns, and current costs.
                                 The effects of storm water runoff in the City of Seal Beach are
                                 typical of problems in inland areas, where run off from several
                                 tributary areas combines to inundate low-elevation areas, for the
                                 non-coastal areas of the City. River, stream, and drainage chan-
                                 nel channelization involves straightening the natural meanders,
                                 clearing the banks and widening and deepening the channel. It is
                                 undertaken to assist in flood control and to increase developable
                                 land. Channelization lowers the level of the river or stream and
                                 the riparian water table, increases the rate of surface run off, in-
                                 creases the stream flow rate, enhances bank and bottom erosion,
                                 and transports a heavier sediment load than the unchannelized
                                 stream. Channelization also affects the beach replenishment
                                 process which is discussed in Topic 6, Shoreline Protection.

                                 The San Gabriel River is a major watercourse adjacent to west-
                                 erly boundary of the City. The headwaters commence in the San
                                 Gabriel Mountains, approximately 30 miles from the outlet into
                                 the Pacific Ocean, adjacent to the City of Seal Beach. The drain-

                                 Development in the floodplain of the San Gabriel River ranges
                                 from sparse at the headwaters in the mountains to dense along
                                 portions of the river channel located on the alluvial plains. The

Flood Protection Measures
                                 As part of the National Flood Insurance Program, a report was
                                 prepared which delineated flood-prone areas in Seal Beach. The
                                 generation of this report and accompanying maps help illustrate
                                 where development has been permitted into the flood zones,
                                 creating a potentially hazardous condition during 100-year
                                 storms (see Figure S-7).
                                 A majority of the City’s storm drain infrastructure, unless oth-
                                 erwise noted, is designed for the 25-year flood. This design
                                 standard reflects the standards in use during the time of the
                                 construction of the major storm drain systems within the City. It
                                 would, therefore, be inadequate for the more recent, and gener-

                                 The major storm drain facility located within the City is the Los
                                 Alamitos Retarding Basin, owned and operated by the County
                                 of Orange. This facility is located south of Westminster Avenue,
                                 west of Seal Beach Boulevard and adjacent to the Haynes Cool-
                                 ing Channel. The Retarding Basin serves a drainage area of ap-
                                 proximately 5,420 acres, generally located east of the San
                                 Gabriel River and Coyote Creek Channel, south of Carbon

                                 Westminster Avenue. The drainage area includes portions of
                                 Seal Beach, Los Alamitos, Cypress, and the unincorporated area
                                 of Rossmoor. The Retarding Basin was built in 1958 by the Or-

                                 ways to improve the system to provide for increased storm
                                 drainage protection to the drainage basin. As future plans are fi-
                                 nalized, the City will review this discussion as part of its bi-
                                 annual review of the Safety Element.
                                 Of the numerous other drainage facilities throughout the City of
                                 Seal Beach, most drain areas are of insignificant size or have the
                                 capacity to pass the 25-year storm. The concept of 100- year
                                 protection remains desirable, but may not be achievable in the
                                 foreseeable future due to financial factors. Therefore, the con-
                                 cept of providing reasonable level of drainage control to meet
                                 the 10-, 25-, or 50-year design frequency should be considered
                                 while waiting for the ultimate, 100-year design to be designed
                                 and funded. Drainage structures that do not meet the standards
                                 of the 25-year storm and/or drain areas of sufficient size will be
                                 noted in drainage studies.
                                 In 1995 the City of Seal Beach revised and updated its “Flood-

Water Quality Control
                                 In 1990 the City, along with the County of Orange, the Orange
                                 County Flood Control District, and the other Cities of Orange
                                 County (as Co-Permitees), were issued a National Pollutant Dis-
                                 charge Elimination System (NPDES) Stormwater Permit as part
                                 of the implementation of the Federal Clean Water Act, by the
                                 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through the State of
                                 California and the State Water Resources Control Board. The
                                 permit is renewed, generally speaking, every five years. The First
                                 Term Permit expired early in 1996 and was replaced by the Sec-
                                 ond Term Permit. The current permit, the Third Term Permit,
                                 subsequently replaced the Second Term Permit in September
                                 2001.
                                 The NPDES Permit established two major requirements: 1) an
                                 effective prohibition of non-stormwater pollutant discharges
                                 into the storm drainage system; and 2) implementation of water
                                 quality Best Management Practices (BMPs) through the devel-
                                 opment and adoption of a Drainage Area Management Plan
                                 (DAMP). The BMPs are intended to reduce the amount of ero-
                                 sion sediment discharging into the stormwater drainage system
                                 to the “maximum extent practicable” (MEP).
                                 Central to an effective prohibition of non-stormwater discharges
                                 is the enactment by local jurisdictions of ordinances preventing
                                 such discharges. On April 24, 1995, the City of Seal Beach
                                 adopted a “Storm Water Management Program” ordinance. The
                                 Storm Water Management Program Ordinance is intended to
                                 prevent industrial waste pollution, as well as other non-
                                 stormwater pollutant discharges, and all new development will
                                 be required to comply with the water quality management tech-
                                 niques as outlined by the Best Management Practices of the
                                 DAMP. Furthermore, in an ongoing effort to protect and en-
                                 hance coastal waters, the City developed a “Storm Water Quality
                                 Management Plan” in July 2001.
                                 On January 18, 2002, the Santa Ana RWQCB adopted the Or-
                                 ange County Municipal NPDES Storm Water Permit for the
                                 northern portion of Orange County (the San Diego RWQCB ju-
                                 risdiction covers the remaining portion of Orange County). The
                                 new permit updates water quality standards for new develop-
                                 ment, and these standards have been incorporated and applied
                                 to this project. These updated standards include numerical sizing
                                 criteria for water quality treatment and proper monitoring and
                                 maintenance of storm water facilities. Numerical sizing criteria

Topic 6: Shoreline Protection
                                 The California coastline has been eroding for thousands of
                                 years. Erosion did not present economic or safety issues as long
                                 as the coastal areas were left undeveloped or were used for agri-
                                 culture or low-intensity recreation. The desire for magnificent
                                 ocean views and convenient beach access has induced many
                                 people to build at the ocean’s edge, even in high-risk locations.
                                 For such dwellings, each severe winter storm is a potential disas-
                                 ter. Coastal erosion is likely to continue or even to accelerate in
                                 the future.
                                 Damage from storms and erosion are episodic in nature. The
                                 winter storm of 1982-83 resulted in substantial losses to Orange
                                 County beaches, including the Seal Beach area. With continued
                                 coastal community growth and development, property values
                                 continue to increase. Costs from damage due to major storms
                                 could be greater each year as coastal land is increasingly up-
                                 graded and developed. Owners of oceanfront properties be-
                                 come more concerned with protecting their investment from
                                 storm erosion and structural damage. During and after severe
                                 storms, many oceanfront property owners attempt to construct
                                 protective devices that do not consider the complex interrela-
                                 tionships of the land and sea.
                                 Beach retreat is a natural process. When considered over a long
                                 period of time, the sea cliffs and beaches are retreating. This re-
                                 treat is episodic, infrequent, site-specific, directly related to wave
                                 climate and rainfall, and highly impacted by urbanization. The
                                 protection, preservation, and restoration of sandy beaches and
                                 the desire of private property owners to protect their invest-
                                 ments are closely interrelated. The value and enjoyment of
                                 oceanfront property depends, to a great degree, upon the exis-
                                 tence of a sandy beach. As sandy beach widths are reduced, an
                                 increase in the amount of wave attack on beachfront property
                                 and the base of the existing sea cliff occurs.
                                 Sand management is the act of controlling the littoral sediment
                                 resource, to the extent possible, to benefit the recreational and
                                 protective functions of a beach. It requires that changes in beach
                                 width be anticipated before they occur. Only then can enlight-
                                 ened decisions be made and cost-effective methods be imple-

The Effects of Man
                                 Since the early 1900s, man has permanently altered the natural
                                 cycle by developing the coastal lands and harbors. The major
                                 sources of sediment no longer provide the necessary quantities
                                 of sediment to keep the natural cycle in balance. Under natural

                                 ties fail and spot erosion occurs.
                                 The construction of other man-made devices such as breakwa-
                                 ters, jetties, groins, and revetments has interrupted the littoral
                                 transport of sediment. Breakwaters are structures that are con-
                                 structed offshore to dissipate wave action to permit safe har-
                                 bors. Since wave action is reduced within the protected harbor,
                                 littoral transport is effectively reduced to an insignificant level.
                                 Jetties are constructed to permit clear channels for river flood
                                 control purposes and to keep harbor entrances clear of sedi-
                                 ment. Sand that is transported by littoral current is trapped up-
                                 drift of the jetty. Without an adequate system to bypass the jetty,
                                 the opposite downdrift jetty experiences erosion. Groins are
                                 structures that are usually built perpendicular to the beach. They
                                 are constructed to form small cells or compartments that are
                                 filled with sand. The small distance between the groins limits the
                                 erosion and traps the sand. All of these structures alter wave
                                 patterns by reflecting and diffracting waves so that the adjacent
                                 shorelines will be modified and will seek new equilibrium
                                 shapes.
                                 In 1933, two parallel jetties were constructed along with a chan-
                                 nel for the San Gabriel River to prevent flooding and enable the
                                 development of the Southern California Edison and Los Ange-

                                 which require cooling intakes and outfalls. The easterly jetty was
                                 built at 725’ long and the westerly jetty was built at 375’ long
                                 and was later extended to the 725’ length. By 1940, an additional
                                 800’ jetty was built to separate the river from the Alamitos Bay.
                                 Over the years the Alamitos Bay jetties were extended to 3,400’
                                 to provide for a navigational access to the Long Beach Marina.
                                 These improvements further impeded the littoral transport of
                                 sand to the south.

                                 During that same time period, the Navy constructed the Naval
                                 Weapon Station (1945-47). Included in that project were two
                                 (3,000’ and 3,400’) rubble mound arrowhead jetties to form a
                                 safe harbor at Anaheim Bay for the loading of armament for
                                 Navy vessels. These structures further interrupted nature’s proc-
                                 ess of sediment transport.
                                 The construction of the Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors
                                 created more than eight miles of breakwaters by 1949. The
                                 breakwater effectively prevents littoral transport of sediments
                                 from the northerly cell and the bluffs at San Pedro from reach-
                                 ing beaches in Long Beach, Seal Beach, and downdrift beaches.
                                 The beaches behind the breakwater have minor wave action and
                                 are relatively stable, but the beach and water quality have suf-
                                 fered.
                                 In the 1950s, concern over the continuing erosion problem be-
                                 tween the San Gabriel River jetty and the Anaheim Bay jetty
                                 caused a groin to be constructed adjacent to the Seal Beach Pier.
                                 The existing concrete sheet pile groin was constructed in 1959
                                 by the Army Corps of Engineers. The groin was constructed to
                                 extend 750 feet into the ocean, and each cell (now named West
                                 and East Beaches) was filled with sand. The groin was proposed
                                 as “the solution” to the shoreline erosion problem that had been
                                 caused by the construction of the jetties and breakwaters. It was
                                 thought that with the construction of the groin, the beach would
                                 remain relatively stable. However, replenishment and backpass
                                 (sand transfer) projects are required to maintain both beaches.
                                 The combined effects of these various structures produce
                                 unique problems along the shoreline in Seal Beach. The East
                                 Beach has water quality problems. This has been attributed to
                                 three conditions: the absence of a littoral current at its north-
                                 western edge due to the breakwater; the trash that flows out of
                                 the San Gabriel River and Alamitos Bay (Long Beach Marina);
                                 and the position of the groin at the pier, which reflects the pre-
                                 vailing westerly waves into a counterclockwise current similar to
                                 an eddy. The West Beach experiences severe erosion due to a
                                 northwesterly longshore current that is generated by waves that
                                 are reflected by the jetty at the entrance to Anaheim Bay. The
                                 Surfside Beach downdrift of the Anaheim Bay jetty has histori-
                                 cally experienced severe erosion adjacent to the jetty, which of-
                                 ten jeopardizes the beach front residences. The fear of loss
                                 prompted the Surfside community to construct a rock revet-

                                 The non-structural solutions to shoreline erosion include replen-
                                 ishment and backpassing. Replenishment places beach sand on
                                 the shoreline from inland supplies or dredged from offshore
                                 bars. Sand replenishment can be very successful in mitigating
                                 shoreline erosion. In general, any solution to a coastal problem
                                 that closely imitates the natural process will have a greater
                                 chance of success than solutions that attempt to overwhelm or
                                 counteract the process. The placement of sand in the appropri-
                                 ate quantities can mitigate a man-made obstruction to littoral
                                 sand transport. Backpassing is a technique where sand is moved
                                 from one area to another adjacent or nearby area in the cell. The
                                 net sum gain in the sand budget within the cell is zero since the
                                 shoreline will seek its dynamic equilibrium. The temporary
                                 movement of sand can be beneficial in temporary protection
                                 during the winter storm season.
                                 Beach sand replenishment has been the predominant method of
                                 maintaining the shorelines in Seal Beach. Since 1945, 16,237,000
                                 cubic yards of sand was placed on the beach at Surfside. This
                                 beach nourishment occurred with the understanding that the
                                 Surfside Beach would serve as a feeder beach to the beaches to
                                 the south. Recently, new data has indicated that the sand does
                                 not entirely reach the beaches at the southern end of the cell as
                                 anticipated. The Corps of Engineers has recently designated the
                                 West Newport Beach as an additional feeder beach. Between
                                 1954 and 1988, approximately 2,055,000 cubic yards of sand was
                                 replenished on the East and West Beaches. In addition to the
                                 replenishment, approximately 250,000 cubic yards of sand was
                                 backpassed to combat shoreline erosion. Based on today’s costs
                                 to dredge sand at $4 to $6 per cubic yard, for trucking in sand at
                                 $10 to $15 per cubic yard and to backpass sand at $2 to $3 per
                                 yard, one can speculate that several millions have been spent
                                 and will continue to be spent to maintain the shoreline within
                                 the Seal Beach and Huntington subcells.
Local Conditions

                                 Beach replenishment is an active management response to an
                                 imbalance in the sediment budget of a coastal compartment.
                                 Beach or sand replenishment could be an aesthetically attractive
                                 and economic alternative to the construction of hard shoreline
                                 protection devices. Beaches are very effective in dissipating
                                 wave energy. It is important to understand that sand replenish-

                                 primary focus of the City. The development of a database could
                                 help to prepare for a long-range planning effort.
                                 Knowledge of the natural and actual rates of shoreline erosion is
                                 important for planning purposes. Comprehensive studies of
                                 rates of erosion by oceanographers and marine geologists have
                                 not been done during past decades. The City of Seal Beach is
                                 participating in a five-year study of the Orange County Coast.
                                 The cost is shared by the federal government, Orange County,
                                 and five coastal cities, including Seal Beach. The study began in

Implementation
                                 The policies of the Safety Element of the General Plan establish
                                 the actions and requirements necessary to direct safety-related
                                 decisions in the City. It is recognized that the implementation of
                                 the policies in this document may already be underway or may
                                 evolve dependent upon City staffing levels, economic condi-
                                 tions, and manmade or natural physical events. The time-frame
                                 objectives delineated in this section are goals for actions to be
                                 accomplished over the next several years. This section also iden-
                                 tifies actions that need to be undertaken on an ongoing basis.
                                 The time-frames are based on a snapshot of the community val-
                                 ues, politics, and conditions at a particular moment in time.
                                 Since these factors are continually in flux, the City must con-
                                 tinually monitor the relevance of the Safety Element policies and
                                 their implementation progress, so that the main goal of protect-
                                 ing the public’s health and safety over time is maintained and
                                 improved. The City Council recognizes this charge and will bi-
                                 annually review the safety objectives achieved during the preced-
                                 ing time period, and will set new safety objectives for the next
                                 bi-annual time period, based upon changing conditions, new in-
                                 formation and revised City policies and priorities.
                                 Many of the implementation actions will require additional staff-
                                 ing and/or additional funding for their successful and timely
                                 completion. Funding constraints beyond the City’s control may
                                 make it difficult or impossible to allocate funds for the necessary
                                 staff, equipment, or consulting services necessary to complete
                                 some of the items. It is recognized that the necessary staff,
                                 equipment, and consultants are dependent upon an annual ap-
                                 propriation by the City Council as part of the annual budget
                                 process and review and prioritization of safety objectives. It is
                                 also recognized that the implementation measures identified in
                                 this Safety Element will realize substantial cost benefits in the
                                 preparation for disasters and their avoidance or impacts.
                                 Some of the implementation measures require capital improve-
                                 ment projects to be constructed. These projects may require a

                                 shall be minimized to the greatest extent possible. However, it is
                                 also likely that some of these projects, such as emergency access
                                 improvements, may prevent the literal consistency with all of the
                                 pertinent General Plan and environmental protection policies,

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                          I. Introduction
I.      INTRODUCTION
A.      Purpose of the Housing Element
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the supply and affordability
of housing. Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive,
long-term General Plan for the physical development of the city or county. The Housing
Element is one of the seven mandated elements of the General Plan. Housing Element
law, first enacted in 1969, mandates that local governments plan to meet the existing
and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community. The law
recognizes that, in order for the private market to adequately address housing needs,
local governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide
opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development. As a result, housing
policy in California rests largely upon the effective implementation of local General Plans
and, in particular, local Housing Elements. Housing Element law also requires the
California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to review local
housing elements and to report its written findings to local governments with respect to
the Housing Element’s conformance with state law.
As mandated by state law, the planning period for this Housing Element extends from
2013 to 2021. This Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on the following
major goals:
      •      Facilitate the development of a variety of housing types for all income levels
             to meet the existing and future needs of residents;
      •      Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of low- and
             moderate-income households;
      •      Address and where appropriate and legally possible remove governmental
             constraints to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing;
      •      Maintain and enhance the existing quality of residential neighborhoods in Seal
             Beach;
      •      Promote equal housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, color,
             national origin, ancestry, religion, sex, marital status, or familial status.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
      •      An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends
             (Chapter II);
      •      An evaluation of land, financial, and administrative resources available to
             address the City’s housing goals (Chapter III);
      •      A review of potential constraints, both governmental and non-governmental,
             to meeting the City’s housing needs (Chapter IV); and
      •      A Housing Action Plan for the 2013-2021 planning period, including housing
             goals, policies and programs (Chapter V).
                                                 I-1                                 October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                I. Introduction
      •      A review of the City’s accomplishments and progress in implementing the
             previous Housing Element is provided in Appendix A.
B.      Data Sources and Methods
In preparing the Housing Element various data sources are utilized. The decennial Census
and the American Community Survey (ACS) provide the basis for population and
household characteristics. Some population and housing unit data are also prepared by
the California State Department of Finance (DOF). Employment data is available from
the California Employment Development Department (EDD). Housing market information
is drawn from both public agencies and private research organizations. City records also
provide data regarding some issues such as units at risk of conversion and housing
construction and demolition activity in the Coastal Zone.
C.      Public Participation
Section 65583(c)(5) of the Government Code states that "The local government shall
make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all the economic segments of the
community in the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe
this effort." Public participation played an important role in the formulation and
refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies and in the development of a Land
Use Plan which determines the extent and density of future residential development in
the community.
City residents and interested stakeholders had many opportunities to participate in the
Housing Element update process. In addition to meetings with the Planning Commission
and City Council, the Ad Hoc General Plan/LCP Advisory Committee provided direction
to City staff in the preparation of the Housing Element. Meeting notices were posted on
the City’s website, and notification was posted on the public notice board outside of
City Hall at least 72 hours in advance of the meetings. Additionally, notice of the public
hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council were published in the local
newspaper. Copies of the draft Element were made available for review at City Hall and
were posted on the City website, and notices were sent directly to agencies that serve
the City’s special needs populations. These service providers included organizations that
represent the interests of low- and moderate-income households and persons with
special needs. Please see Appendix C for more information regarding the public
involvement process.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this
Housing Element update.

D.      Consistency with Other Elements of the General Plan
The Elements that comprise the Seal Beach General Plan are required to be internally
consistent. Together these Elements provide the framework for development of facilities,
services and land uses necessary to address the needs and desires of the City residents.
The City will ensure consistency between the various General Plan elements and ensure
policy direction introduced in one element is reflected in other plan elements. For
example, residential development capacities established in the Land Use Element and
constraints to development identified in the Safety/Noise Element are incorporated into
the Housing Element. This Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements
and is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the Plan. As the General Plan
is amended from time to time, the City will review the Housing Element for internal
consistency, and make any necessary revisions.
SB 1087 of 2005 requires cities to provide a copy of their Housing Elements to local water
and sewer providers, and also requires that these agencies provide priority hookups for
developments with lower-income housing. The Housing Element will be provided to these
agencies immediately upon adoption.
Government Code Section 65302 requires that the Land Use Element be reviewed
annually for consistency with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and
state Department of Water Resources (DWR) flood hazard maps, and that amendments
to the Safety and Conservation Elements that are required to address flood hazard issues
be adopted upon the first amendment to the Housing Element after January 1, 2009.

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                    II. Housing Needs Assessment
II.      HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
Meeting the various housing needs of residents is an important goal for Seal Beach. The
first step to achieving this goal is understanding the housing needs in the community. This
chapter will explore the various demographic and housing characteristics in the City in
order to determine the nature and extent of the housing needs and lay the groundwork
for policies and programs to address those needs.
The Housing Needs Assessment utilizes the most recent data from the U.S. Census,
California Department of Finance (DOF), California Employment Development Depart-
ment (EDD), Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) and other relevant
sources. Supplemental data was obtained through field surveys or from private sources.
A.       Community Context
Seal Beach encompasses 11.4 square miles in northwestern Orange County south of
Long Beach (in Los Angeles County) and north of Huntington Beach (see Figure II-1).
Incorporated in 1915 primarily as a farming community, the City has grown while still
maintaining its small town atmosphere. The population of the City remained relatively
stable from 1915 to 1944 with little more than 1,000 residents. However in 1944 the U S
Navy acquired half of the City to construct the Naval Weapons Station bringing new
residents to Seal Beach. The population increased to more than 7,000 persons in 1954
with the development of the Marina Hill subdivision. In 1962, Leisure World retirement
community was established with an estimated 9,000 senior residents. In 1966, a large
housing tract referred to as College Park East was developed and added an additional
5,000 homeowners. Today, the population stands at an estimated 24,354 residents.
The demographic characteristics of Seal Beach have remained relatively stable over the
past three decades. With the presence of Leisure World and many condominium
developments catering to retired persons the City has a large number of elderly
households. The City’s prime beachfront location appeals to the affluent, both working
and retired. Property values in Seal Beach increased as the City has become increasingly
built out. Newcomers to the City who can afford high housing costs tend to be those of
upper incomes or retired persons with substantial assets. However the City also has long-
time residents who purchased their homes many years ago when real estate was still
affordable. Many of these long-time residents may have difficulty in maintaining their
homes.
The housing stock in Seal Beach consists of a mix of single-family and multi-family units
with one mobile home park. Though a majority of the housing units are more than 40
years of age, housing is generally in good condition with the exception of some older
beach areas and some units in the mobile home park.

B.      Population Characteristics
        1.     Population Growth Trends
The population of Seal Beach has been stable for the past two decades. According to
the U.S. Census, the city lost population between 1990 and 2000, while virtually no
change occurred between 2000 and 2012. During this same time period, Orange County
continued to grow, with an increase of about 18% during the 1990s and 7% during 2000-
2012 (see Table II-1).

        2.     Age
Housing needs are influenced by the age characteristics of the population. Different age
groups require different accommodations based on lifestyle, family type, income level,
and housing preference. Table II-2 shows the city’s estimated population by age group.
Compared to the county as a whole, Seal Beach has a significantly lower proportion of
children and young adults and a much larger proportion of seniors. It is noteworthy that
about 38% of Seal Beach residents were age 65 or over compared to just 12% for the
county as a whole.
                                                                     II-3                                October 14, 2013

        3.     Race and Ethnicity
The racial and ethnic composition of the city differs from the county as a whole in that a
significantly lower proportion of city residents are Hispanic/Latino or racial minorities.
About 10% of city residents are Hispanic as compared to 34% for the county as a whole.
Asians, at 9%, represent the largest non-Hispanic minority (Table II-3).

C.       Household Characteristics
         1.     Household Composition and Size
Household characteristics are important indicators of the type and size of housing
needed in a city. The Census defines a “household” as all persons occupying a housing
unit, which may include single persons living alone, families related through marriage or
blood, or unrelated persons sharing a single unit. Persons in group quarters such as
dormitories, military barracks, prisons, retirement or convalescent homes, or other group
living situations are included in population totals, but are not considered households.
Table II-4 provides a comparison of households by type for the city and Orange County
as a whole, as reported in the 2010 Census. Family households comprised approximately
46% of all households in the city, significantly fewer than the county with 71%. Nearly half
of all households in Seal Beach consisted of a single person living alone, compared to
only 21% of county households. The high percentage of single-person households in Seal
Beach is not surprising considering the large number of elderly residents.

        2.         Housing Tenure
Housing tenure (owner vs. renter) is an important indicator of the housing market.
Communities need an adequate supply of units available both for rent and for sale in
order to accommodate a range of households with varying income, family size and
composition, and lifestyle. Table II-5 shows that three-quarters of housing units in Seal
Beach are owner-occupied compared to 59% for the county as a whole.

        3.         Overcrowding
Overcrowding is often closely related to household income and the cost of housing. The
U.S. Census Bureau considers a household to be overcrowded when there is more than
one person per room, excluding bathrooms and kitchens, with severe overcrowding
when there are more than 1.5 occupants per room. Table II-6 summarizes overcrowding
for the City of Seal Beach compared to Orange County as a whole.

The incidence of overcrowding is very low in Seal Beach, with just over 2% of rental units
and almost no owner-occupied units reporting overcrowding. None reported severe
overcrowding.
The relatively high cost of housing in Seal Beach and throughout the region is considered
to be the primary cause of overcrowding. Several programs in the Housing Action Plan
(Chapter V) designed to address housing affordability will also help to alleviate
overcrowding. These programs include 1a (Provision of Adequate Sites), 1c (Second
Units), 2b (Affordable Housing Resources), 2d (Preserve the Existing Affordable Housing
Stock), 3a (Section 8 Rental Assistance), 3d (SRO Housing), and 5c (Housing Information
and Referral).
        4.       Overpayment
According to state housing policy, overpaying occurs when housing costs exceed 30% of
gross household income. Table II-7 displays recent estimates for overpayment by Seal
Beach households. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), about 30% of all lower-income renter households and about 81% of
all lower-income owner households in Seal Beach were overpaying for housing. For
households of all income levels, 27% of renters and 42% of owners were overpaying.
Although homeowners enjoy income and property tax deductions and other benefits
that help to compensate for high housing costs, lower-income homeowners may need to
defer maintenance or repairs due to limited funds, which can lead to deterioration. For
lower-income renters, severe cost burden can require families to double up resulting in
overcrowding and related problems.

The relatively high cost of housing in Seal Beach and throughout the region is the primary
cause of overpayment. Several programs in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V)
designed to address housing affordability will also help to address this issue. These
programs include 1a (Provision of Adequate Sites), 1c (Second Units), 2b (Affordable
Housing Resources), 2d (Preserve the Existing Affordable Housing Stock), 3a (Section 8
Rental Assistance), 3d (SRO Housing), and 5c (Housing Information and Referral).
Extremely Low Income Households
State law requires quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of
extremely-low-income (ELI) households. Extremely-low-income is defined as households
with income less than 30% of area median income. The area median income for Orange
County in 2012 was reported as $85,300 1. For extremely-low-income households in
Orange County, this results in an income of $28,900 or less for a four-person household,
when adjusted for high housing costs. Households with extremely-low-income have a
variety of housing situations and needs.
       Existing Needs
As noted in the previous section, it is estimated that approximately 855 extremely-low
income households resided in Seal Beach (Table II-7). HUD reported that 79% of
extremely-low-income renter households were overpaying, while 100% of extremely-low-
income owners were overpaying.

      Projected Needs
The projected housing need for extremely-low-income households is assumed to be 50%
of the very-low-income regional housing need of one unit. As a result, the City has a
projected need for one extremely-low-income unit for the current planning period. The
resources and programs to address this need are the same as for low-income housing in
general and are discussed throughout the Housing Element, including Chapter V, the
Housing Action Plan. Because the needs of extremely-low-income households overlap
extensively with other special needs groups, further analysis and resources for extremely
low income households can be found in Chapter IV, Constraints, Section A.1.d. (Special
Needs Housing).
D.      Employment
Employment is an important factor affecting housing needs within a community. The jobs
available in each employment sector and the wages for these jobs affect the type and
size of housing residents can afford.
        1.     Current Employment
Current employment and projected job growth have a significant influence on housing
needs during this planning period. Table II-8 shows that about 47% of Seal Beach
residents age 16+ were in the labor force, compared to 67% for Orange County as a
whole. The lower labor force participation rate in the city is attributable to the large
population of retired residents.

 Industry detail may not add up to totals due to independent rounding
 (A) Self-Employed persons work for profit or fees in their own business, profession, trade, or farm. Only the unincorporated self-employed are included in this
 category. The estimated and projected employment numbers include all workers who are primarily self-employed and wage and salary workers who hold a
 secondary job as a self-employed worker.
 (B) Unpaid family workers are those persons who work without pay for 15 or more hours per week on a farm or in a business operated by a member of the
 household to whom they are related by birth or marriage.
 (C) Private Household Workers are employed as domestic workers whose primary activities are to maintain the household.
 Industry employment is based on the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program.

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                         II. Housing Needs Assessment
        3.     Jobs-Housing Balance
A regional balance of jobs to housing helps to provide opportunities for people to live
near their workplace, and reduce long-distance commuting. When the number of jobs
significantly exceeds the housing supply, housing markets may become overheated,
requiring households to pay a larger percentage of their income for housing. The current
jobs-housing objective within the SCAG region is one new housing unit for every 1.5 jobs.2
According to recent Census data, there were approximately 11,565 jobs in Seal Beach,
or about 0.8 jobs per housing unit, substantially lower than the regional objective.
E.      Housing Stock Characteristics
This section presents an evaluation of the characteristics of the community’s housing
stock and helps in identifying and prioritizing needs. The factors evaluated include the
number and type of housing units, recent growth trends, age and condition, tenure,
vacancy, housing costs, affordability, and assisted affordable units at-risk of loss due to
conversion to market-rate. A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile
home, or group of rooms, occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for
occupancy as separate living quarters.
        1.     Housing Type and Growth Trends
The largest component of the housing stock in Seal Beach is comprised of multi-family
units in large (5+) complexes, with 44% of total units in 2010. Single-family detached
homes made up about one-third of all units. Table II-11 provides a breakdown of the
housing stock by type along with growth trends for the city compared to Orange County
as a whole for the period 2000-2010. During this time period, the city added 279 housing
units, an average of about 28 units per year. This represented just 2% growth in the
housing stock compared to 7% for the entire county, which reflects the lack of vacant
developable land in Seal Beach.

        2.         Housing Age and Conditions
Housing age is often an important indicator of housing condition. Housing units built prior
to 1978 before stringent limits on the amount of lead in paint were imposed may have
interior or exterior building components coated with lead-based paint. Housing units built
before 1970 are the most likely to need rehabilitation and to have lead-based paint in
deteriorated condition. Lead-based paint becomes hazardous to children under age six
and to pregnant women when it peels off walls or is pulverized by windows and doors
opening and closing.
Table II-12 shows the age distribution of the housing stock in Seal Beach compared to
Orange County as a whole.
This table shows that about three-quarters of all housing units in Seal Beach were
constructed prior to 1970. Even though the majority of homes are more than 40 years old,
housing conditions are generally good to excellent, and very few homes are in need of
any significant repair. The City’s Code Enforcement activities focus on maintaining a high
quality of life for residents and visitors. Most enforcement activities are complaint-driven,
although ongoing monitoring occurs in the Seal Beach Shores Trailer Park. It is estimated
that approximately 10 mobile homes in the park are in need of some form of
rehabilitation. Programs 2d and 4a in the Housing Action Plan are intended to address
these needs.

         3.      Vacancy Rates
According to the U.S. Census Bureau 3, the vacancy rate in Seal Beach during the 2006-
2010 period averaged 1.4% for owner-occupied units and 6.7% for rental units. A rental
vacancy rate of 5% is considered typical for a healthy housing market. Since many rental
units in beach communities are used for short-term vacation use, a higher than normal
vacancy rate is not considered unusual.
         4.      Housing Cost
a.       Housing Affordability Criteria
State law establishes five income categories for purposes of housing programs based on
the area (i.e., county) median income (“AMI”): extremely-low (30% or less of AMI), very-
low (31-50% of AMI), low (51-80% of AMI), moderate (81-120% of AMI) and above
moderate (over 120% of AMI). Housing affordability is based on the relationship between
household income and housing expenses. Each year the California Department of
Housing and Community Development publishes income guidelines for these income
categories. Housing is generally considered “affordable” if the monthly payment is no
more than 30% of a household’s gross income. In some areas (such as Orange County),
these income limits may be increased to adjust for high housing costs.
Table II-13 shows affordable rent levels and estimated affordable purchase prices for
housing in Orange County for 2012 by income category. Based on state-adopted
standards, the maximum affordable monthly rent (including utilities) for extremely-low-
income households is $723, while the maximum affordable rent for very-low-income
households is $1,204. The maximum affordable rent for low-income households is $1,926,
while the maximum for moderate-income households is $2,559. All figures are based on a
family of four, and affordable housing costs are adjusted for smaller or larger households.

Affordable purchase prices are more difficult to determine due to variations in mortgage
interest rates and qualifying procedures, down payments, special tax assessments,
homeowner association fees, property insurance rates, etc. With this caveat, the
affordable home purchase prices by income category shown in Table II-13 have been
estimated based on typical conditions. Affordable purchase prices for the lowest income
categories have not been estimated due to the high housing costs in beach
communities.

b.      For-Sale Housing
Existing housing resale price statistics for the third quarter of 2012 reported a median
single-family detached price of $700,000 and a median condo price of $215,000. Based
on the estimated affordable purchase prices shown in Table II-14 , these statistics confirm
that the typical single-family detached house in Seal Beach is not affordable to low- or
moderate-income households. However, with interest rates at historic lows, many resale
condos may be within the moderate- or even the low-income range. This is likely
attributable to the large number of modestly-sized condos located in the Leisure World
retirement community.
c.      Rental Housing
A recent survey of rental housing in Seal Beach found listings offered from $795 to over
$4,000 per month, with most units in the $1,200 to $2,500 range. When market rents are
compared to the amounts low-income households can afford to pay (Table II-14 ), it is
clear that lower-income households have a difficult time finding suitable housing without
overpaying. However, at the moderate-income levels, households are much more likely
to find affordable rentals.
                                                                       II-15                                   October 14, 2013

F.      Special Needs
Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding decent, affordable housing due to
special circumstances. Such circumstances may be related to one’s employment and
income, family characteristics, disability, or other conditions. As a result, some Seal Beach
residents may experience a higher prevalence of overpayment, overcrowding, or other
housing problems.
State Housing Element law defines “special needs” groups to include persons with
disabilities (including developmental disabilities), the elderly, large households, female-
headed households with children, homeless people, and farm workers. Many households
within these special needs groups also fall within the extremely-low-income category. This
section contains a discussion of the housing needs facing each of these groups.
        1.      Persons with Disabilities
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a disabled person as having a physical
or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Disabled
persons may have special housing needs as a result of their disability. Problems may
include low income, high health care costs, dependency on supportive services, or a
need for special building accommodations such as access ramps or elevators.
Table II-17 shows disability data for Seal Beach residents in 2000 4. As would be expected,
the highest rates of disabilities were reported by those aged 65 and over. Housing
opportunities for those with disabilities can be improved through housing assistance
programs and universal design features such as widened doorways, ramps, lowered
countertops, single-level units and ground floor units.
  The Census Bureau has not published detailed data regarding disabilities since the 2000 Census.

Developmentally Disabled
As defined by federal law, “developmental disability” means a severe, chronic disability
of an individual that:
      •      Is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or combination of mental
             and physical impairments;
      •      Is manifested before the individual attains age 22;
      •      Is likely to continue indefinitely;
      •      Results in substantial functional limitations in three or more of the following
             areas of major life activity: a) self-care; b) receptive and expressive language;
             c) learning; d) mobility; e) self-direction; f) capacity for independent living; or
             g) economic self-sufficiency;
      •      Reflects the individual’s need for a combination and sequence of special,
             interdisciplinary, or generic services, individualized supports, or other forms of
             assistance that are of lifelong or extended duration and are individually
             planned and coordinated.
The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the U.S.
Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an accepted estimate of the percentage
of the population that can be defined as developmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. Many
                                                                  II-17                                               October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                           II. Housing Needs Assessment
developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group
living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals
may require an institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is the transition from the person’s
living situation as a child to an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-
based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and
their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental
centers, and two community-based facilities. The Regional Center of Orange County
(RCOC) is one of 21 regional centers in the State of California that provides point of entry
to services for people with developmental disabilities. The RCOC is a private, non-profit
community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services
to individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.
Any resident of Orange County who has a developmental disability that originated
before age 18 is eligible for services. Services are offered to people with developmental
disabilities based on Individual Program Plans and may include: Adult day programs;
advocacy; assessment/consultation; behavior management programs; diagnosis and
evaluation; independent living services; infant development programs; information and
referrals; mobility training; prenatal diagnosis; residential care; respite care; physical and
occupational therapy; transportation; consumer, family vendor training; and vocational
training. RCOC also coordinates the state-mandated Early Start program, which provides
services for children under age three who have or are at substantial risk of having a
developmental disability. According to the RCOC February 2010 Facts and Statistics
data, the RCOC served more than 16,700 individuals. Of those individuals, a total of 61
individuals resided in Seal Beach in 2012. 5
The mission of the Dayle McIntosh Center is to advance the empowerment, equality,
integration and full participation of people with disabilities in the community. The Center
is not a residential program, but instead promotes the full integration of disabled persons
into the community. Dayle McIntosh Center is a consumer-driven organization serving all
disabilities. Its staff and board are composed of over 50% of people with disabilities. Its
two offices service over 500,000 people in Orange County and surrounding areas with
disabilities. The main office in Garden Grove is located in close proximity to Seal Beach.
In addition, City housing programs that respond to the needs of this population include
1d (Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing) and 3a (Section 8 Rental
Assistance).
         2.      Elderly
The ACS reported 65% owner-occupied households but only 18% of renter-occupied
households in Seal Beach where the householder was 65 or older (Table II-15 ). The
unusually high number of senior households in Seal Beach is in large part attributable to

the presence of the Leisure World community. Many elderly persons are dependent on
fixed incomes and/or have a disability. Elderly homeowners may be physically unable to
maintain their homes or cope with living alone. The housing needs of this group can be
addressed through smaller units, second units on lots with existing homes, shared living
arrangements, congregate housing and housing assistance programs.
The following programs described in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V) help to address
the housing needs of the elderly: 1a (Provision of Adequate Sites), 1c (Second Units), 2b
(Affordable Housing Resources), 2d (Preserve the Existing Affordable Housing Stock), 3a
(Section 8 Rental Assistance), 3c (Affordability Covenants on City or Redevelopment
Agency-Assisted Housing), 3d (SRO Housing), 4a (Owner-Occupied Home
Improvements), 5b (Removal of Architectural Barriers), and 5c (Housing Information and
Referral).

        3.     Large Households
Household size is an indicator of need for large units. Large households are defined as
those with five or more members. Census data showed that nearly half of all owner-
occupied households in Seal Beach were comprised of a single person, while only 3% of
owner households had five or more persons. About 4% of renter households had five or
more members (Table II-16 ). This distribution indicates that the need for large units with
three or more bedrooms is significantly less than for smaller units.

While large households are far less prevalent in Seal Beach than in some other cities, the
following programs described in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V) help to address
these needs: 1a (Provision of Adequate Sites), 2b (Affordable Housing Resources), 2d
(Preserve the Existing Affordable Housing Stock), 3a (Section 8 Rental Assistance), and 5c
(Housing Information and Referral).
        4.         Female-Headed Households
Recent Census Bureau estimates reported that more than half of both renter and owner
households were “non-families” (i.e., single persons living alone or unrelated persons).
About 4% of owner households and 8% of renter households were families headed by a
female (Table II-17 ).

         5.     Farm Workers
Farm workers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary income is from seasonal
agricultural work. Historically, Orange County’s economy was linked to agriculture. While
there are still active farming areas on the Irvine Ranch and in some other cities, shifts in
the local economy to production and service-oriented sectors have significantly
curtailed agricultural production within the county. Today, Orange County is a mostly
developed urban/suburban region with a strong local economy. Although the county is
increasingly capturing major employers in Southern California, this growth is not tied to an
agricultural base.
Recent Census estimates reported about 4,900 persons employed in agricultural
occupations in Orange County. Only 16 Seal Beach residents reported Farming, Fishing
and Forestry as their occupation. As a result, there is not a significant need for farmworker
housing in Seal Beach.
         6.     Homeless Persons
Throughout the country, homelessness has become an increasing problem. Factors
contributing to the rise in homelessness include: the general lack of housing affordable to
low and moderate income persons; increases in the number of persons whose incomes
fall below the poverty level; reductions in public subsidy to the poor; and the de-
institutionalization of the mentally ill.
The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42, U.S.C. 1130, et seq. 1994) defines a
"homeless" person as an individual who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime
residence, or an individual whose primary nighttime residence is:
       a.   A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide
            temporary living accommodations;
       b.   An institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
            be institutionalized;
       c.   A public or private place not designed for, or ordinarily used as, regular
            sleeping accommodations for human beings.
The McKinney-Vento Act (§725(2); 42 U.S.C. 11435(2)) defines a person “at-risk” of
becoming homeless as an individual who faces imminent eviction (within a week) from a
private dwelling or institution and who has no subsequent residence or resources to
obtain housing. People are also at risk of homelessness when they experience a sudden
drop in income, a rise in housing costs, and/or they do not have the skills necessary to
manage their limited resources. According to the National Coalition for the Homelessness
(NCH), most individuals at risk of homelessness are on a fixed income or are marginally
employed and have few ties to family and friends.
The County of Orange Housing and Community Services Department undertakes an
annual estimate of the County’s homeless population as part of its application for
homeless assistance grant funds to HUD. The most recent Point-in-Time survey, conducted
in January 2011, estimated that there were approximately 6,939 homeless persons at the
                                             II-21                              October 14, 2013

time of the survey, of which 2,667 were sheltered and 4,272 were unsheltered 6. While the
2011 survey did not estimate the total homeless population by jurisdiction, the survey did
ask respondents where they lived just prior to becoming homeless. Of the 610 survey
respondents, 2 persons (0.3%) reported Seal Beach as their last city of residence.
The Seal Beach Police Department indicated that the long-term homeless population
within Seal Beach on any given night is believed to be approximately 10 individuals 7. The
2010 Census reported no homeless persons in Seal Beach.
One emergency and transitional housing facility, Interval House, is located in Seal Beach.
Interval House operates three stages of housing for victims of domestic violence. The first
stage emergency shelter offers up to 45 days for 32 persons. The second stage program
has a capacity of 19 beds for up to 18 months of stay. The third stage transitional housing
has a capacity of 5 beds for up to 24 months of stay.
In addition, the City complies with the requirements of Senate Bill 2, which requires that a
zone be designated where emergency shelters may be established “by-right” and that
transitional and supportive housing be permitted subject only to the same regulations as
other residential uses of the same type in the same zone (see Program 1d).
G.       Assisted Housing at Risk of Conversion
In 2000 the Seal Beach Redevelopment Agency helped to secure financing to allow
conversion of the Seal Beach Shores Trailer Park to affordable tenant ownership. The
Agency secured a $6.75 million low-interest loan and a $985,000 bridge loan for the
project. The park includes 100 units (25 very-low and 75 low). None of these units are at
risk during the current period.
One other affordable housing project – Country Villa Seal Beach – is located in the city.
According to the California Housing Partnership, this 90-unit project is assisted through
Sections 232 and 223(f). Covenants are not scheduled to expire until 2035 and therefore
the project is not at risk during this planning period. Country Villa is a group quarters living
arrangement.
H.       Housing Constructed, Demolished or Converted within the
         Coastal Zone
California Government Code §65588(d) requires that the Housing Element update take
into account any low- or moderate-income housing provided or required in the Coastal
Zone pursuant to Section 65590 (the Mello Act 8). State law requires that jurisdictions
monitor the following:
       •      The number of new housing units approved for construction within the Coastal
              Zone (after January 1, 1982);

In order to receive a demolition or a conversion permit, the request must comply with the
Mello Act. The City examines any Coastal Zone development that entails the demolition
or conversion of residential units that are not categorically exempt from the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). A property that is determined to be a public nuisance
or is an owner-occupied, single-family dwelling, is not examined in accordance with the
Mello Act. All other types of projects are evaluated. Program 4c in the Housing Action
Plan (Chapter V) responds to the requirements of state law on this issue.
I.      Future Housing Needs
        1.       Overview of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
The Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is a key tool for local governments to
plan for anticipated growth. The RHNA quantifies the anticipated need for housing within
each jurisdiction for the projection period from January 2014 to October 2021.
Communities then determine how they will address this need through the process of
updating the Housing Elements of their General Plans.
                                                              II-23                                  October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                          II. Housing Needs Assessment
The current RHNA was adopted by the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) in October 2012. The future need for housing is determined primarily by the
forecasted growth in households in a community. Each new household, created by a
child moving out of a parent's home, by a family moving to a community for
employment, and so forth, creates the need for a housing unit. The housing need for new
households is then adjusted to maintain a desirable level of vacancy to promote housing
choice and mobility. An adjustment is also made to account for units expected to be lost
due to demolition, natural disaster, or conversion to non-housing uses. The sum of these
factors – household growth, vacancy need, and replacement need – determines the
construction need for a community. Total housing need is then distributed among four
income categories on the basis of the county’s income distribution, with adjustments to
avoid an over-concentration of lower-income households in any community.
         2.      2014-2021 Seal Beach Growth Needs
The total housing growth need for the City of Seal Beach during the 2014-2021 planning
period is 2 units. This total is distributed by income category as shown in Table II-23. While
not explicitly addressed in the RHNA, state law 9 now requires the Housing Element to
estimate the future needs of extremely-low-income households. As provided by state
law, the extremely-low-income need is estimated to be 50% of the very-low category, or
1 unit during this planning period.

III.    RESOURCES AND OPPORTUNITIES
A variety of resources are available for the development, rehabilitation, and preservation
of housing in Seal Beach. This chapter provides an overview of the land resources and
adequate sites to address the City’s regional housing need allocation, and describes the
financial and administrative resources available to support the provision of affordable
housing. Additionally, the chapter discusses opportunities for energy conservation which
can lower utility costs and increase housing affordability.
A.      Land Resources
Section 65583(a)(3) of the Government Code requires Housing Elements to contain an
“inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites
having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and
public facilities and services to these sites.” The analysis of potential development sites is
contained in Appendix B. The analysis demonstrates that there are adequate sites with
appropriate zoning to accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation of 1 very-low-income
unit and 1 low-income unit for the current planning period.
B.      Financial and Administrative Resources
        1.      State and Federal Resources
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) - Federal funding for housing
programs is provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The
CDBG program is flexible in that funds can be used for a wide range of activities
including acquisition and or disposition of real estate, public facilities and improvements,
relocation, rehabilitation and construction of housing, home ownership assistance, and
clearing activities. The CDBG program provides formula funding to larger cities and
counties, while smaller jurisdictions with less than 50,000 population generally compete
for funding under the Urban County Consolidated Plan administered by the County of
Orange. In FY 2010-11 the City received a $200,000 grant from the County, which was
used for restroom accessibility improvements in the Leisure World community.
Section 8 Rental Assistance – The City of Seal Beach works cooperatively with the
Orange County Housing Authority (OCHA), which administers the Section 8 Voucher
Program. The Housing Assistance Payments Program assists low income, elderly and
disabled households by paying the difference between 30% of an eligible household's
income and the actual cost of renting a unit. The City facilitates use of the Section 8
program within its jurisdiction by encouraging apartment owners to list available rental units
with the County Housing Authority for potential occupancy by tenants receiving Section 8
certificates. The most recent information from OCHA indicated that there were 10 Seal
Beach residents using Section 8 vouchers.
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program - The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program
was created by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to provide an alternate method of funding
low-and moderate-income housing. Each state receives a tax credit, based upon
                                               III-1                             October 14, 2013

population, toward funding housing that meets program guidelines. The tax credits are
then used to leverage private capital into new construction or acquisition and
rehabilitation of affordable housing. Limitations on projects funded under the Tax Credit
programs include minimum requirements that a certain percentage of units remain rent-
restricted, based upon median income, for a term of 15 years.
         2.     Local Resources
On February 1, 2012 the Seal Beach Redevelopment Agency was dissolved as a result of
the state legislature’s approval of AB 26 and the California Supreme Court’s action
upholding that law. On February 1, 2012 the City became the Successor Agency to the
Redevelopment Agency. The Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule includes
funding to continue rent subsidies for the Seal Beach Trailer Park.
C.       Energy Conservation Opportunities
State of California Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential
Buildings were established in 1978 in response to a legislative mandate to reduce
California's energy consumption. The standards are codified in Title 24 of the California
Code of Regulations and are updated periodically to allow consideration and possible
incorporation of new energy efficiency technologies and methods.
Title 24 sets forth mandatory energy standards and requires the adoption of an “energy
budget” for all new residential buildings and additions to residential buildings. Separate
requirements are adopted for “low-rise” residential construction (i.e., no more than 3
stories) and non-residential buildings, which includes hotels, motels, and multi-family
residential buildings with four or more habitable stories. The standards specify energy
saving design for lighting, walls, ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and
cooling equipment and systems, gas cooling devices, conservation standards and the
use of non-depleting energy sources, such as solar energy or wind power. The home
building industry must comply with these standards while localities are responsible for
enforcing the energy conservation regulations through the plan check and building
inspection processes.
Examples of techniques for reducing residential energy use include the following:
       •     Glazing – Glazing on south facing exterior walls allows for winter sunrays to
             warm the structure. Reducing glazing and regulating sunlight penetration on
             the west side of the unit prevents afternoon sunrays from overheating the unit.
       •     Landscaping – Strategically placed vegetation reduces the amount of direct
             sunlight on the windows. The incorporation of deciduous trees in the
             landscaping plans along the southern exposure of units reduces summer
             sunrays, while allowing penetration of winter sunrays to warm the units.
       •     Building Design – The implementation of roof overhangs above southerly
             facing windows shield the structure from solar rays during the summer months.
                                               III-2                            October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                   III. Resources and Opportunities
      •      Cooling/Heating Systems – The use of attic ventilation systems reduces attic
             temperatures during the summer months. Solar heating systems for swimming
             pool facilities saves on energy costs. Natural gas is conserved with the use of
             flow restrictors on all hot water faucets and showerheads.
      •      Weatherizing Techniques – Weatherization techniques such as insulation,
             caulking, and weather stripping can reduce energy use for air-conditioning up
             to 55% and for heating as much as 40%. Weatherization measures seal a
             dwelling unit to guard against heat gain in the summer and prevent heat loss
             in the winter.
      •      Efficient Use of Appliances – Appliances can be used in ways that increase
             their energy efficiency. Unnecessary appliances can be eliminated. Proper
             maintenance and use of stove, oven, clothes dryer, washer, dishwasher, and
             refrigerator can also reduce energy consumption. New appliance purchases
             can be made on the basis of efficiency ratings.
      •      Solar Installations – On July 13, 2009, the City Council adopted a
             comprehensive fee schedule (Resolution 5898). The resolution waived all fees
             for standard residential solar installations.
In addition to these techniques for reducing energy use in dwellings, the City supports
broader “smart growth” efforts to encourage compact development and public
transportation. For example, Program 1a in the Housing Action Plan (Chapter V) includes
a commitment to process a zoning amendment to facilitate new high-density multi-
family residential development on underutilized land in proximity to commercial and
employment opportunities and bus transit. Such development contributes to a reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions through lower energy use and vehicle trips (see also
Programs 6a and 6b).

        1.     Land Use Plans and Regulations
a.      General Plan
Each city and county in California must prepare a comprehensive, long-term General
Plan to guide its future. The land use element of the General Plan establishes the basic
land uses and density of development within the various areas of the city. Under state
law, the General Plan elements must be internally consistent and the city’s zoning must
be consistent with the General Plan. Thus, the land use plan must provide suitable
locations and densities to implement the policies of the Housing Element.
The Land Use Element of the Seal Beach General Plan sets forth the City’s policies for
guiding local development. These policies, together with the zoning regulations, establish
the amount and distribution of land to be allocated for different uses within the city. The
Land Use Element provides three different densities of residential land uses displayed in
Table IV-1. The Land Use Element identifies 1,471 acres for residential uses representing 20
percent of the total acreage in the city and nearly 64 percent of the acreage
designated for non-military uses.

b.         Zoning Designations and Development Standards
The Seal Beach Zoning Code was comprehensively updated in 2010. The Zoning Code
provides three residential zones: Residential Low Density (RLD), Residential Medium
Density (RMD) and Residential High Density (RHD). The Limited Commercial/Residential
Medium Density district also allows exclusive residential or mixed-use development. The
relationship between General Plan land use categories and zoning districts is shown in
Table IV-2.

Allowable Residential Uses
There are seven base zoning districts in the city that permit residential use, ranging in
allowable density from 9 units/acre in the RLD-9 district to 46 units/acre in the RHD-46
district (Table IV-2). Allowable uses include single-family detached houses in the RLD-9
and RLD-15 districts, to multi-family residential condominiums and apartments with base
densities from 20 to 46 units/acre in the RHD-20, RHD-33 and RHD-46 districts. As shown in
Table IV-3, most residential uses are permitted by-right, without discretionary review or
design review. Exceptions include large group homes, and some types of residential care
facilities, which require approval of a use permit by the Planning Commission. The Limited
Commercial/Residential Medium Density (L-C/RMD) district allows commercial use,
exclusive residential use, or commercial/residential mixed use.

Development Standards
Development standards vary by zone and are described below. During the Zoning Code
update process, development standards were reviewed to ensure that they do not
prevent projects from achieving densities at the upper end of the allowable density
range.
Residential Districts. The zoning district suffix indicates the allowable base density. One
house per lot, plus a second unit, is permitted in the RLD district. In the RMD and RHD
districts, multi-family housing is allowed with density determined by the parcel size and
the required square footage of lot area per unit. For example, in the RHD-20 district, the
allowable base density is 20 units/acre, which requires at least 2,178 square feet of lot
area per unit 10. Additional density is possible through density bonus provisions (Chapter
11.4.55 of the Municipal Code).
Other development standards regulate building height, lot size, unit sizes, setbacks, off-
street parking, lot coverage, building separation and landscaping (Table IV-4).
   One acre contains 43,560 square feet of land. At a ratio of 2,178 square feet of lot area per unit, 20 units
10
    per acre would be permitted (2,178 x 20 = 43,560).
                                                                              IV-3                                                     October 14, 2013

Limited Commercial/Residential Medium Density (L-C/RMD) District. The allowable base
density for exclusively residential projects in the L-C/RMD district is one unit per 2,500
square feet of lot area (17.4 units/acre) and projects must comply with the development
standards of the RHD-20 district. Mixed-use projects allow second floor residential use with
a base density of one unit per 2,000 square feet of lot area (21.8 units/acre). For narrow
lots (<37.5 feet) there is a 30-foot height limit, while wider lots are allowed a height of 25
feet/2 stories on the front half of the lot and 35 feet/3 stories on the rear half of the lot.
Additional height may be allowed at specific locations designated in design guidelines,
planned unit developments, or specific plans, or pursuant to density bonus regulations.
Development standards for the L-C/RMD district are shown in Table IV-5.
Two additional types of zoning districts, the Planned Development (PD) Overlay District
and Specific Plans, allow residential development through discretionary actions.

Planned Development (PD) Overlay District
The purpose of the Planned Development Overlay District (–PD) is to provide for detailed
review of development that warrants special review and deviations from underlying
development standards. This overlay district is also intended to provide opportunities for
creative development approaches that will achieve superior design solutions to that
which would be possible if the project were built in full compliance with the required
standards of the base district, and will not cause a significant adverse impact on
residences to the side, rear, or directly across a street with respect to solar access,
privacy and compatibility. Currently there is only one area of the city within a PD overlay
– Leisure World.
The land use and density requirements within a –PD Planned Development Overlay
District shall be those of the underlying base district. An application for a Planned
Development and any amendment to the Plan shall be processed in accordance with
the procedure for conditional use permits.
The City Council may approve a Planned Development Plan that deviates from the
minimum lot area, yard requirements, building heights, and other physical development
standards defined in the base district, while ensuring compliance with the land use and
density requirements of the base district. Physical development standards may be
modified if the Planned Development Plan includes examples of superior community
design, environmental preservation and/or public benefit amenities.
Prior to submitting an application for a Planned Development Plan an applicant
proposing a project over one acre in gross area or that includes publicly-owned land is
required to schedule a pre-application study session with the Planning Commission to
discuss the general acceptability of the project proposal, issues that need to be
addressed, and the need, if any, for any interagency coordination. This preliminary
consultation helps to streamline the development review process by identifying issues
early in the planning process.
Findings for Approval. The City shall approve a PD Overlay District Zoning Map
Amendment and Planned Development Plan only if all of the following findings are
made:
        A.     The project meets all of the findings required for a conditional use permit
        pursuant to Section 11.5.20.020: Required Findings and the finding that the
        approved plan is consistent with the purposes of the district where it is located
        and conforms in all significant respects with the General Plan and any specific
        plan.
        B.     Development within the PD Overlay District is demonstratively superior to
        the development that could occur under the standards applicable to the
        underlying base district and will achieve superior community design,
        environmental preservation, and/or substantial public benefit. In making this
        determination, the following factors shall be considered:
            1. Appropriateness of the use(s) at the proposed location.
            2. The mix of uses, housing types, and housing price levels.
                                             IV-11                           October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                    IV. Constraints
            3. Provision of units affordable to persons and families of low and moderate
               income or to lower income households.
            4. Provision of infrastructure improvements.
            5. Provision of open space.
            6. Compatibility of uses within the development area.
            7. Quality of design, and adequacy of light and air to the interior spaces of
               the buildings.
            8. Overall contribution to the enhancement of neighborhood character and
               the environment of Seal Beach in the long term.
            9. Creativity in design and use of land.
Because the PD overlay district creates additional options for projects within the overlay,
it does not pose a constraint to residential development.
Specific Plans
Chapter 11.3.25 of the Zoning Code allows the adoption of specific plans pursuant to
state law. Only the Hellman Ranch specific plan allows residential use, and is fully
developed.
Effects of Zoning Regulations on the Provision of Low- and Moderate Income Housing
Zoning regulations have a considerable effect on the development of low- and
moderate-income housing. In urban areas, and particularly coastal jurisdictions, high
land costs can make affordable housing infeasible without large public subsidies.
In 2004 state law was amended (AB 2348) to identify “default densities” that are
considered suitable for lower-income housing. For small metropolitan jurisdictions with less
than 25,000 population such as Seal Beach, the default density is 20 units/acre. All of the
Residential High Density (RHD) zoning districts allow densities of 20 units/acre or more.
Development standards in the RHD districts allow projects to be built at or near the
maximum densities. Height limits are 25 feet in the RHD-20 district and 35 feet in the RHD-
33 and RHD-46 districts, which allow 2- and 3-story structures, respectively. Other
development standards such as setbacks and lot coverage are typical for the allowable
densities. These regulations help to facilitate the production of low- and moderate-
income housing.
During the 2010 comprehensive Development Code update process architects and
builders indicated that development standards do not pose any significant constraints to
achieving maximum allowable densities. However, nearly all residentially-zoned land is
developed, and there is limited capacity for additional housing on these properties. As
discussed in Chapter III, the greatest potential for additional residential development is
within underutilized commercial areas.
                                              IV-12                            October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                        IV. Constraints
Local Coastal Program
Seal Beach does not currently have an approved Local Coastal Program (LCP). As a
result, all projects located within the portion of the city that is within the Coastal Zone are
subject to review by the California Coastal Commission. This additional requirement
represents an impediment to housing development within the Coastal Zone. To address
this issue, the City is currently working on the preparation of an LCP. An Ad Hoc General
Plan/LCP Committee has been established to provide guidance to staff in this effort.
Program 3e in Chapter V describes the City’s efforts toward the completion of the LCP
during the current planning period.
c.       Special Needs Housing
Persons with special needs include those in residential care facilities, persons with
disabilities, the elderly, persons needing emergency shelter, transitional or supportive
living arrangements, and single room occupancy units. The City’s provisions for these
housing types are discussed below. Many of these households also fall into the extremely-
low-income category.
Definition of “Family”
The Municipal Code defines “family” as “1 or more persons living together as a single
nonprofit housekeeping unit and sharing common living, sleeping, cooking and eating
facilities. Members of a “family” need not be related by blood but are distinguished from
a group occupying a hotel, club, fraternity or sorority house.” This definition is consistent
with current law.
Group Homes
The Municipal Code defines Group Home as:
         “A dwelling unit licensed or supervised by any Federal, State, or local
         health/welfare agency which provides 24-hour non-medical care of unrelated
         persons who are in need of personal services, supervision, or assistance essential
         for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual in a
         family-like environment. Includes: children’s homes; orphanages; rehabilitation
         centers; self-help group homes. Convalescent homes, nursing homes and similar
         facilities providing medical care are included under the definition of Medical
         Services - Extended Care.”
Group homes are permitted in the RHD district subject to approval of a Minor Use Permit
by the Planning Commission. There are no separation requirements for group homes.
Residential Care Facilities
The Municipal Code allows facilities that are licensed by the State of California to
provide permanent living accommodations and 24-hour primarily non-medical care and
supervision for persons in need of personal services, supervision, protection, or assistance
for sustaining the activities of daily living. Living accommodations are shared living
                                                  IV-13                            October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                         IV. Constraints
quarters with or without separate kitchen or bathroom facilities for each room or unit. This
classification includes facilities that are operated for profit as well as those operated by
public or not-for-profit institutions, including hospices, nursing homes, convalescent
facilities, and group homes for minors, persons with disabilities, and people in recovery
from alcohol or drug additions. This category excludes transitional housing and
community social service facilities. (§ 11.4.85.020.N)
Three types of residential care facilities are recognized in the Code:
         1. Residential Care, General. A residential care facility providing 24-hour non-
             medical care for more than 6 persons in a single unit in need of personal
             services, supervision, protection, or assistance essential for sustaining the
             activities of daily living. This classification includes only those facilities licensed
             for residential care by the State of California.
             These facilities are conditionally permitted in the PO, (Professional Office), SC
             (Service Commercial) and GC (General Commercial) districts.
         2. Residential Care, Limited. A residential care facility providing 24-hour non-
             medical care for 6 or fewer persons in a single unit, in need of personal
             services, supervision, protection, or assistance essential for sustaining the
             activities of daily living. This classification includes only those facilities licensed
             for residential care by the State of California. Under state law, a state-licensed
             residential care facility with 6 or fewer persons is considered a residential use
             and is permitted subject to the same regulations as other residential uses of the
             same type in the same zone. This classification includes residential care
             facilities restricted to persons 60 years of age or older if there are 6 or fewer
             residents. Six or fewer persons does not include the licensee or members of the
             licensee’s family or persons employed as facility staff.
             Under the current Municipal Code, these facilities are permitted by-right in all
             zones where single-family uses are permitted, in conformance with state law,
             and are conditionally permitted in the PO, SC and GC districts..
         3. Residential Care, Senior. A housing arrangement chosen voluntarily by the
             resident, the resident's guardian, conservator or other responsible person;
             where residents are 60 years of age or older and where varying levels of care
             and supervision are provided as agreed to at the time of admission or as
             determined necessary at subsequent times of reappraisal. Any younger
             residents must have needs compatible with other residents, as provided in
             Health & Safety Code §1569.316 or a successor statute. This classification
             includes continuing care retirement communities and lifecare communities
             licensed for residential care by the State of California. These facilities are
             conditionally permitted in the PO, SC and GC districts.
             The Special Use provisions of the Municipal Code recognize the following
             specific types of Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly (RCFE) projects:
                  Assisted Living Facility: a residential building or buildings that also provide
                 housing, personal and health care, as permitted by the Department of
                                                  IV-14                             October 14, 2013

                Social Services, designed to respond to the daily, individual needs of the
                residents. Assisted Living Facilities may include kitchenettes (small
                refrigerator, sink, microwave oven) within individual rooms. Assisted Living
                Facilities are required to be licensed by the California Department of Social
                Services, and do not include skilled nursing services.
                Life Care Facility: sometimes called “Continuing Care Retirement
                Communities”, or “Senior Continuum of Care Complex”, these facilities
                provide a wide range of care and supervision, and also provide health
                care (skilled nursing) so that residents can receive medical care without
                leaving the facility. Residents can expect to remain, even if they become
                physically incapacitated later in life. Life Care Facilities require multiple
                licensing from the State Department of Social Services, the State
                Department of Health Services, and the State Department of Insurance.
Development Standards for Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities in a residential district must maintain a minimum distance of 300
feet from another such facility. Facilities in all districts must comply with development
standards for landscaping, walls, traffic level of service, passenger loading, and delivery
hours. (§11.4.05.105) These regulations are consistent with state law and do not pose a
significant constraint to their development.
Reasonable Accommodation for Persons with Disabilities
State law requires that local housing elements “shall remove constraints to, and provide
reasonable accommodations for housing designed for, intended for occupancy by, or
with supportive services for, persons with disabilities.” (Government Code §65583(c)(3)).
Chapter 11.5.30 of the Seal Beach Municipal Code (Reasonable Accommodations)
provides standards and procedures for ensuring compliance with state law. The
ordinance includes the following provisions:
    •   Application procedures, including the accommodation requested and the basis
        for the request.
    •   No fee is charged for a Reasonable Accommodation application.
    •   Concurrent processing may be requested by an applicant when another
        discretionary permit is also required.
    •   Decision by the Planning Commission subject to the notice, review, approval, and
        appeal procedures prescribed for a conditional use permit.
    •   Required findings for approval as follows:
        1. The requested accommodation is requested by or on the behalf of one or
            more individuals with a disability protected under the fair housing laws.
        2. The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more
            individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.

        3. The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or
            administrative burden on the City as “undue financial or administrative
            burden” is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.
        4. The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in
            the nature of the City’s zoning program, as “fundamental alteration” is defined
            in fair housing laws and interpretive case law.
        5. The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case,
            result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or substantial
            physical damage to the property of others.
These provisions are consistent with federal and state law and do not pose a constraint
to reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities.
Emergency Shelters
California Health and Safety Code (§50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing
with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six
months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be denied
emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.”
In 2013, the Boeing Specific Plan was amended to permit emergency shelters by-right
subject to the following development standards:
    •   Maximum of 25 beds
    •   Minimum separation of 300 feet between emergency shelters
Sites within this specific plan are located within walking distance of services and
employment centers and are served by public transportation. This specific plan
encompasses approximately 107 acres of land, which includes two underutilized parking
lots in two parcels of approximately 16 and 12 acres that are suitable for shelters. These
emergency shelter regulations are consistent with SB 2 and do not pose a constraint to
the establishment of such facilities.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
Transitional/supportive housing is normally temporary housing (generally six months to two
years) for an individual or family who is transitioning to permanent housing. This type of
housing can take several forms, including group housing or multi-family units, and often
includes a supportive services component to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills
in support of independent living.
In 2013 the Municipal Code was amended to clarify that transitional/supportive housing
is a residential use subject to the same standards and requirements as other residential
uses of the same type in the same zone, in conformance with SB 2.

        Single Room Occupancy
Single-room-occupancy (SRO) facilities are small studio-type units intended for one or
two persons. SROs can provide an affordable housing option for small households with
very low or extremely low incomes. In 2013 the Zoning Ordinance was amended to allow
SROs subject to a conditional use permit in the RHD zone.
d.      Off-Street Parking Requirements
Regulations for Off-Street Parking and Loading are provided in Chapter 11.4.20 of the
Municipal Code. The City’s parking requirements for residential uses vary by residential
type. Single-family dwellings require two garage parking spaces per unit with up to 5
bedrooms, three spaces for homes with 6 bedrooms, plus one additional space for each
bedroom over 6. In Surfside and in the RLD-9 and RHD-20 districts, the required number of
spaces may be reduced by one space if suitable driveway parking is available. Multi-
family dwellings require two covered parking spaces plus one uncovered guest spaces
for each seven units. A reduction in required parking can be approved through the CUP
process (Section 11.4.20.020.B). The parking requirements are summarized in Table IV-6.
In order to enhance the development feasibility of small apartments, the Municipal
Code was amended in 2013 to reduce the required off-street parking for studio and one-
bedroom apartments to one space when the units are reserved for low- or moderate-
income households.

e.       Second Units
Second units are regulated by §11.4.05.115 of the Municipal Code, which is intended to
comply with state law governing second units (Government Code §65852.150 and
§65852.2) or any successor statutes. Second units that comply with applicable standards
are approved ministerially without discretionary review or public hearing.
Second Dwelling Units may be established on any lot in the RLD-9, RLD-15 district, and in
the RMD and RHD zones, excluding Old Town, where a primary single-unit dwelling has
been previously established or is proposed to be established in conjunction with
construction of a second unit. Only one Second Dwelling Unit is permitted per primary
single-unit dwelling on the same lot. A legal single-unit dwelling (the “Primary Dwelling
Unit”) must exist on the lot or must be constructed on the lot in conjunction with the
construction of the Second Dwelling Unit. A Second Dwelling Unit shall provide
independent living facilities for one or more persons and include permanent provisions
for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation.
The maximum and minimum floor areas of a Second Dwelling Unit are set forth in Table
IV-7 and range from a minimum of 150 square feet to a maximum of 800 square feet or
30% of the primary unit. Program 1c in the Housing Action Plan addresses the issue of
second units in conformance with state law.

                           Source: Seal Beach Zoning Ordinance, Table 11.4.05.115.E
Second Dwelling Units must comply with the same height, setback, lot size, lot coverage,
and other applicable zoning requirements as apply to the Primary Dwelling Unit. A
Second Dwelling Unit must have an outdoor entrance separate from the primary
dwelling. In order to maintain the single-unit residential character of the street, the
entrance to the Second Dwelling Unit must be located so that it is not visible from the
public right-of-way. A minimum of one covered parking space is required for each
Second Dwelling Unit. No Second Dwelling Unit is allowed unless the primary dwelling is
also in compliance with all applicable parking requirements of this Zoning Code. Either
the primary unit or the Second Dwelling Unit must be occupied by the property owner,
and the Second Dwelling Unit may not be sold separately from the Primary Dwelling Unit.
Second Dwelling Units serve to augment resources for senior housing, or other low- and
moderate-income segments of the population. The City’s regulations are consistent with
                                                          IV-18                          October 14, 2013

state law and serve to facilitate this type of housing. No Second Dwelling Unit permits
have been requested in recent years.
f.      Density Bonus
Under current State density bonus law (SB 1818 of 2004), cities and counties must provide
a density increase up to 35% over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density
under the Municipal Code and the Land Use Element of the General Plan (or bonuses of
equivalent financial value) when builders agree to construct housing developments with
units affordable to low- or moderate-income households. Chapter 11.4.55 of the
Municipal Code (“Affordable Housing Bonus”) sets forth regulations and procedures for
providing density bonus or other incentives in compliance with state law (Government
Code §65915 et seq.). Where conflict occurs between the provisions of Municipal Code
and State law, the State law provisions shall govern. No requests for density bonus have
been sought in recent years. Program 2a in the Housing Action Plan addresses the issue
of density bonus in conformance with state law.
g.      Mobile Homes/Manufactured Housing
The manufacturing of homes in a factory is typically less costly than the construction of
individual homes on site thereby lowering overall housing costs. State law precludes local
governments from prohibiting the installation of mobile homes on permanent
foundations on single-family lots. It also declares a mobile home park to be a permitted
land use on any land planned and zoned for residential use, and prohibits requiring the
average density in a new mobile home park to be less than that permitted by the
Municipal Code. A city or county may, however, require use permits for mobile home
parks.
Regulations governing manufactured housing are provided in §11.4.05.075 of the
Municipal Code and in state regulations (Title 25, California Code of Regulations). A
manufactured home shall constitute a permitted use in all residential districts, provided
that any such manufactured home is certified under the standards set forth in the
National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1976 (42 USC
5401 et. seq.), as amended at the time of any application for placement of such
manufactured home. The City’s development standards for mobile homes do not
present an unreasonable constraint to this type of development.
Mobile home parks are regulated under the Residential High Density (RHD) provisions of
the Code. There is one mobile home park in Seal Beach (Seal Beach Shores Trailer Park).
In 2000 the Redevelopment Agency issued bonds to allow for LINC Housing, a 501(c)(3)
non-profit agency to acquire and manage the park. In 2009 the ownership of the park
was transferred to Seal Beach Shores, Inc, a resident-owned 501(c)(3) non-profit entity.
The City recognizes this mobile home park for its contribution to affordable housing. As
noted in Chapter III, the Redevelopment Agency has provided rental assistance and
rehabilitation loans and grants to residents of the Seal Beach Shores Trailer Park in order
to maintain this important supply of affordable housing in the city. Programs 2d, 3c and
4a support continued affordability and rehabilitation activities in this park.

h.      Condominium Conversions
The conversion of apartments to condominiums is regulated by Chapter 11.4.80 of the
Municipal Code for all areas of Seal Beach except Leisure World. Key requirements that
must be satisfied are summarized as follows:
    •   Approval of a Conditional Use Permit and a subdivision map.
    •   Each building as of the date of conversion shall comply with all applicable
        requirements of the Municipal Code, and the goals and policies of the General
        Plan, except where the building is nonconforming in compliance with Chapter
        11.4.40: Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Lots.
    •   Condominium conversions shall observe the following standards for density.
               RMD-18 District: 2,500 sq. ft. of land per dwelling unit.
               RHD-20 District: 2,178 sq. ft. of land per dwelling unit.
               RHD-33 District: 1,350 sq. ft. of land per dwelling unit.
               RHD-46 District: 960 sq. ft. of land per dwelling unit.
    •   Separate space heating, water heating, and metering/shutoff valves for water,
        gas, and electricity for each unit.
    •   All common attic areas over individual dwelling units shall be separated by sound-
        rated assemblies and access to each attic space shall be provided in compliance
        with the California Building Code.
    •   Tenant's Right to Purchase. As provided in Government Code 66427.1.D., any
        present tenant of any unit shall be given a nontransferable right of first refusal to
        purchase the unit occupied at a price no greater than the price offered to the
        general public. The right of first refusal shall extend for at least 90 days from the
        date of issuance of the subdivision public report or commencement of sales,
        whichever date is later.
    •   Each non-purchasing tenant not in default under the obligations of the rental
        agreement or lease under which he occupies his unit shall have not less than 180
        days from the date of receipt of notification from the owner of his intent to
        convert, or from the filing date of the final subdivision map, whichever date is
        later, to find substitute housing and to relocate. Once notice of intent to convert is
        served to a tenant, any existing long-term lease agreement may be rescinded by
        the tenant without penalty. Notification of such termination shall be submitted in
        writing to the landlord 30 days prior to the termination of the lease.
    •   From the date of approval of the Tentative Map until the date of conversion, no
        tenant's rent shall be increased more frequently than once every 6 months, and at
        a rate not greater than 50% of the rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index (all
        items, Los Angeles-Long Beach), on an annualized basis, for the same period. This
        limitation shall not apply if rent increases are provided for in leases or contracts in
        existence prior to the filing date of the Tentative Map.
                                                  IV-20                         October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                                     IV. Constraints
    •   The subdivider shall provide moving expenses of 2.0 times the monthly rent, but in
        no case less than $3,000.00, to any tenant who relocates from the building to be
        converted after approval of the condominium conversion by the City, except
        when the tenant has given notice of his intent to move prior to receipt of
        notification from the subdivider of his intent to convert.
When a condo conversion is permitted, the increase in the supply of less expensive for-
sale units helps to compensate for the loss of rental units. No requests for condo
conversions have been filed in recent years. Program 4b calls for the continuation of the
City’s condo conversion ordinance.
i.      Building Codes and Enforcement
State law prohibits the imposition of building standards that are not necessitated by local
geographic, climatic or topographic conditions and requires that local governments
making changes or modifications in building standards must report such changes to the
Department of Housing and Community Development and file an expressed finding that
the change is needed.
The City's building codes are based upon the 2010 California Building, Plumbing,
Mechanical, Electrical and Fire Codes. Local amendments to the state code have been
adopted to require fire sprinklers for some residential construction.
        2.     Development Processing Procedures
a.      Residential Permit Processing
State Planning and Zoning Law provides permit processing requirements for residential
development. Within the framework of state requirements, the City has structured its
development review process to minimize the time required to obtain permits while
ensuring that projects receive an appropriate level of review.
Table 11.5.05.025, Review Authority, identifies the City official or body responsible for
reviewing and making decisions on each type of application, land use permit, and other
entitlements required by the Zoning Code. Three levels of review are identified: the
Community Development Director, Planning Commission and City Council. The typical
planning approvals and their respective level of review are as shown in Table IV-8.

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                  IV. Constraints
As described previously in Table IV-3, all conventional residential uses, including multi-
family apartments, are permitted by-right with no discretionary review. These uses only
require review of project plans by the Community Development Director to ensure
conformance with applicable regulations and development standards. No public
hearing is required. The typical time required to process these approvals is 30 days.
Required findings for a Director’s development permit approval are as follows:
        1. The proposed use and structure conform with the provisions of the Zoning Code;
        2. The proposed use and structure are compatible with uses and structures in the
        immediate neighborhood;
        3. The plans provide protection to adjacent structures from noise, vibration and
        other undesirable environmental factors;
        4. Proposed lighting is directed inward and downward to reflect light away from
        adjoining properties;
        5. The following are designed to avoid traffic congestion, protect pedestrian and
        vehicular safety and welfare and eliminate any adverse effect on surrounding
        property:
               a. Structures and improvements;
               b. Vehicular ingress and egress and internal circulation;
               c. Setbacks;
               d. Height of buildings;
               e. Walls; and
               f. Landscaping.
A Minor Use Permit (MUP) is required for Group Housing in the RHD district. A MUP is
reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission. The typical time required to
process a Minor Use Permit is 45 days.
A Conditional Use Permit (CUP) is required for Senior Citizen Housing in the RHD district. A
CUP is reviewed and approved by the Planning Commission. The typical time required to
process a CUP is 45 days.
A MUP or CUP shall only be granted if the reviewing body finds, based upon evidence
presented at the hearing, that the proposal conforms to all of the following criteria as
well as to any other special findings required for approval of use permits in specific
zoning districts:
        1. The proposal is consistent with the General Plan and with any other applicable
        plan adopted by the City Council;
        2. The proposed use is allowed within the applicable zoning district with use permit
        approval and complies with all other applicable provisions of the Municipal Code;
        3. The site is physically adequate for the type, density and intensity of use being
        proposed, including provision of services, and the absence of physical constraints;
                                             IV-22                           October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                   IV. Constraints
        4. The location, size, design, and operating characteristics of the proposed use will
        be compatible with and will not adversely affect uses and properties in the
        surrounding neighborhood; and
        5. The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the proposed use at the
        location proposed will not be detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of
        persons residing or working in the vicinity of the proposed use.
There are no design review requirements in the city.
b.      Environmental Review
Environmental review is required for all developments meeting the definition of “projects”
under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Seal Beach has a number of
environmental and development constraints due to its sensitive environmental resources
and coastal location. Because of these environmental constraints, larger residential
projects have typically required the preparation of Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs).
Under state law, an EIR is required for any development that has the potential of creating
significant impacts that cannot be mitigated, which is typical of large projects. Some
residential projects are either Categorically Exempt or require only an Initial Study and
Negative Declaration. A Negative Declaration typically takes four to six weeks to prepare,
depending on complexity of the project and required technical studies, followed by a
state-mandated public review period. Categorically Exempt developments require a
minimal amount of time. As a result, environmental review does not pose a significant
constraint to housing development in the city.
        3.      Development Fees and Improvement Requirements
State law limits fees charged for development permit processing to the reasonable cost
of providing the service for which the fee is charged. Various fees and assessments are
charged by the City and other public agencies to cover the costs of processing permit
applications and providing services and facilities such as schools, parks and infra-
structure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro rata share system, based on
the magnitude of the project's impact or on the extent of the benefit that will be derived.
Development fees will vary from project to project depending on the specific
characteristics. Table IV-9 summarizes the development fees for typical single-family and
multi-family projects.

The City periodically evaluates the actual cost of processing the development permits
when revising its fee schedule. The current fee schedule is based on a fee study
completed in 2012.
After the passage of Proposition 13 and its limitation on local governments’ property tax
revenues, cities and counties have faced increasing difficulty in providing public services
and facilities to serve their residents. One of the main consequences of Proposition 13 has
been the shift in funding of new infrastructure from general tax revenues to development
impact fees and improvement requirements on land developers. The City requires
developers to provide on-site and off-site improvements necessary to serve their projects.
Such improvements may include water, sewer and other utility extensions, street
construction and traffic control device installation that are reasonably related to the
project. Dedication of land or in-lieu fees may also be required of a project for rights-of-
                                                                    IV-24                                               October 14, 2013

way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and school sites, consistent with the Subdivision
Map Act.
A typical local street requires a 60-foot right-of-way, with two 12-foot travel lanes. The
City’s road standards are typical for cities in Orange County and do not act as a
constraint to housing development. Table IV-10 illustrates the City’s road improvement
standards.

The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public improve-
ments including streets and other public works projects to facilitate the continued build-
out of the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction of public
improvements is coordinated with private development.
Although development fees and improvement requirements increase the cost of
housing, cities have little choice in establishing such requirements due to the limitations
on property taxes and other revenue sources needed to fund public improvements.
B.      Non-Governmental Constraints
        1.      Environmental Constraints
Environmental constraints include physical features such as steep slopes, fault zones,
floodplains, sensitive biological habitat, and agricultural lands. In many cases,
development of these areas is constrained by state and federal laws (e.g., FEMA
floodplain regulations, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and the
state Fish and Game Code and Alquist-Priolo Act).
The most noteworthy environmental constraints in Seal Beach are seismicity and soil
stability related to a shallow groundwater. The Newport-Inglewood fault runs through the
city. Since the city’s topography is relatively gentle, steep slopes and landslides are not a
major concern.
The City’s land use plans have been designed to protect sensitive areas from
development, and also to protect public safety by avoiding development in hazardous
areas. While these policies constrain residential development to some extent, they are
necessary to support other public policies. In Southern California, nearly all development
                                                               IV-25                               October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                                   IV. Constraints
projects face potential community-wide environmental constraints such as traffic, noise
and air quality impacts, in addition to site-specific constraints. None of the sites identified
in the land inventory (Appendix B) have site-specific environmental constraints that
would preclude the assumed level of development.
        2.      Infrastructure Constraints
Seal Beach is almost completely “built out” and necessary infrastructure such as water,
wastewater and drainage systems are in place. The amount of new development
projected to occur during the planning period is relatively small, and there are no known
limitations that would preclude the anticipated level of development.
The City’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a schedule of public
improvements including streets and other public works projects to facilitate the
continued build-out of the City’s General Plan. The CIP helps to ensure that construction
of public improvements is coordinated with development.
        3.      Land Costs
Land represents one of the most significant components of the cost of new housing.
Land values fluctuate with market conditions, and the recent downturn in the housing
market has affected land values. Changes in land prices reflect the cyclical nature of
the residential real estate market. The high price of land throughout Orange County
poses a significant challenge to the development of lower-income housing, although it is
unclear to what extent the current downturn will affect long-term land prices. Density
affects development feasibility by determining the land cost per unit. As discussed in the
Governmental Constraints section of this chapter, allowable multi-family residential
densities in Seal Beach are sufficient to facilitate development of affordable housing.
        4.      Construction Costs
Construction cost is affected by the price of materials, labor, development standards
and general market conditions. The City has no influence over materials and labor costs,
and the building codes and development standards in Seal Beach are not substantially
different than most other cities in Orange County. In recent years, construction costs for
materials and labor have increased at a slightly higher pace than the general rate of
inflation according to the Construction Industry Research Board.
        5.      Cost and Availability of Financing
The crisis in the mortgage industry during the past few years will affect the availability and
cost of real estate loans, although the long-term effects are unpredictable. It is clear that
one of the primary factors contributing to real estate recession was the lending policies
of “sub-prime” mortgage brokers who approved loans for borrowers without sufficient
equity and ability to repay the loans. As a result of these practices, there has been a
significant rise in foreclosure rates, and changes in mortgage underwriting standards is

likely to have greater impacts on low-income families than other segments of the
community.
C.      Fair Housing
Under state law, it is illegal for real estate lending institutions to discriminate against entire
neighborhoods in lending practices because of the physical or economic conditions in
the area (“redlining”). In monitoring new construction sales, re-sales of existing homes,
and permits for remodeling, it would not appear that redlining is practiced in any area of
the city.
State law also prohibits discrimination in the development process or in real property
transactions, and it is the City’s policy to uphold the law in this regard. The City also
provides financial support to the Orange County Fair Housing Council through its CDBG
program and is an active participant in fair housing activities (see Program 5a in Chapter
V – Housing Action Plan).

V.      HOUSING ACTION PLAN
This chapter of the Housing Element sets forth the City’s goals, policies and programs to
address the previously identified existing, future and special housing needs of Seal Beach
residents. Quantified housing objectives that the City anticipates achieving over the next
five years are also included. This Housing Strategy represents a continuing evolving effort
on the part of the City to facilitate the provision of housing for all economic segments of
the population, to improve the quality of existing housing, and to maintain the condition
and affordability of the existing housing stock. Table V-1 identifies the City’s quantified
housing objectives over the 2013-2021 period while Table V-2 provides a summary of the
housing programs specifying the objectives, time frame for implementation, source of
funding, and responsible agencies.
A.      Housing Goals, Policies and Programs
A sound basis for any plan of action is a set of well-defined goals and policies to express
the desires and aspirations of the community. The City has established the following
housing goals:
    •   Facilitate the development of a variety of housing types for all income levels to
        meet the existing and future needs of residents.
    •   Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of low- and
        moderate-income households.
    •   Address, and where appropriate and legally possible, remove governmental
        constraints to the maintenance, improvement and development of housing.
    •   Maintain and enhance the quality of existing residential neighborhoods.
    •   Promote equal housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, color,
        national origin, ancestry, religion, sex, marital status, or familial status.
    •   Encourage more efficient energy use in residential developments.
Goal 1:         Facilitate the development of a variety of housing types for all income
                levels to meet the existing and future needs of residents
Policy 1a:      Provide adequate sites for a variety of housing types through the Land Use
                Element of the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance, while ensuring that
                environmental and infrastructure constraints are addressed.
Policy 1b:      Where appropriate, encourage the redesignation of vacant and
                underutilized non-residential land to residential uses with appropriate
                densities to facilitate the development of a variety of housing types to
                address the housing needs of all economic segments of the population.
Policy 1c:      Encourage the infilling of vacant residential land.

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                            V. Housing Action Plan
Policy 1d:     Encourage the recycling of underutilized residential land, where such
               recycling is consistent with established land use plans.
Policy 1e:     Provide compatibility of residential uses with surrounding uses through the
               separation of incompatible uses, construction of adequate buffers, and
               other land use controls.
Policy 1f:     Improve all residential environments through the provision of adequate
               public facilities and services, including streets and parks, as well as water,
               sewer, and drainage systems.
Policy 1g:     Provide for adequate, freely accessible open space within reasonable
               distances of all community residents.
Program 1a: Provision of Adequate Sites for New Construction through the General Plan
               and Zoning Ordinance
               The Land Use Element of the Seal Beach General Plan designates land
               within the city for a variety of residential types and densities ranging from 9
               to 46 units per acre. The land use designations are implemented through
               the Zoning Ordinance. While the City is a fully urbanized community with
               little vacant land remaining, adequate sites are available to
               accommodate the City’s assigned fair share of future residential growth of
               2 housing units during the planning period.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               1.     In order to enhance the feasibility of affordable housing
               development, the City will offer incentives and concessions such as
               expedited processing, administrative assistance with applications for
               funding assistance, and modified development standards.
               2.     The City will report its progress in implementing this program to HCD
               on an annual basis, pursuant to Government Code §65400.
               3.     The City shall comply with the “no net loss” provisions of Government
               Code §65863 through the implementation of an ongoing project-by-
               project evaluation process to ensure that adequate sites are available to
               accommodate the City’s RHNA share throughout the planning period. The
               City shall not reduce the allowable density of any site in its residential land
               inventory, nor approve a development project at a lower density than
               assumed in the land inventory, unless both of the following findings are
               made:
                      a)       The reduction is consistent with the adopted General Plan,
                      including the Housing Element; and
                                                V-2                              October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                              V. Housing Action Plan
                       b)     The remaining sites identified in the Housing Element are
                       adequate to accommodate the City’s share of regional housing
                       need pursuant to Government Code §65584.
               If a reduction in residential density for any parcel would result in the
               remaining sites in the Housing Element land inventory not being adequate
               to accommodate the City’s share of the regional housing need pursuant to
               Sec. 65584, the City may reduce the density on that parcel if it identifies
               sufficient additional, adequate and available sites with an equal or greater
               residential density so that there is no net loss of residential unit capacity.
Program 1b: Land Use Compatibility
               A goal of the City is to create and maintain desirable living areas for
               residents by physically separating or otherwise protecting residential
               neighborhoods from incompatible uses. This program will be implemented
               through the review of proposed amendments to the General Plan and
               zoning regulations, and through the review of discretionary permit
               applications.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to use zoning and other land use controls to ensure the
                   compatibility of residential areas with surrounding uses.
Program 1c: Second Units
               The City permits the construction of second units on existing residential lots
               consistent with state law. Second units provide for alternative housing
               arrangements for single, elderly, and other households, many of which may
               have very-low or extremely-low incomes.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to allow for the development of second units consistent with
                   state law and the Municipal Code.
Program 1d: Emergency Shelters and Transitional/Supportive Housing
               Senate Bill 2 of 2007 strengthened planning requirements for emergency
               shelters and transitional/supportive housing. The Municipal Code is in
               compliance with SB 2, including specific regulations and development
               standards that apply to emergency shelters, and clarification that
               transitional/supportive housing is a residential use subject to the same
               standards as other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The
               City will continue to implement the requirements of state law by facilitating
               the provision of emergency shelters and transitional/supportive housing.

               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to facilitate the provision of emergency shelters and
                   transitional/supportive housing consistent with state law.
Program 1e: Innovative Land Use and Construction Techniques
               Construction and land costs represent the most important factors in
               determining the cost of housing in a community. Innovative land use
               techniques such as small lot, planned unit developments and mixed use, as
               well as innovative construction techniques including manufactured or
               factory built housing can help reduce the cost of housing.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to encourage the use of innovative land use techniques and
                   construction methods to minimize housing costs provided that basic
                   health, safety, and aesthetic considerations are not compromised.
                   Encourage the use of planned unit developments, mixed use, and
                   alternative construction methods. The City will provide flexibility in
                   development standards and siting requirements to minimize
                   development costs.
Program 1f:    Provision of Adequate Public Facilities and Services
               New residential developments bring new residents to the City, placing an
               increased demand on public facilities and services. To adequately serve its
               existing and future residents, the City must ensure that new residential
               developments are provided with adequate public facilities and services.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to utilize environmental and other development review
                   procedures to ensure that all new residential developments are
                   provided with adequate public facilities and services.
Goal 2:        Assist in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of low-
               and moderate-income households
Policy 2a:      Expand housing opportunities for households with special needs, such as
                the elderly, disabled, large households, female-headed households, and
                the homeless.

Policy 2b:      Provide incentives for and otherwise encourage the development of new
                affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households, including
                extremely-low-income persons.
Policy 2c:      Investigate and pursue programs and funding sources designed to
                expand housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households,
                including the elderly and disabled.
Policy 2d:      Direct the construction of low- and moderate-income housing to sites that
                are:
               •   located with convenient access to schools, parks, public transportation,
                   shopping facilities, and employment opportunities;
               •   adequately served by public utilities;
               •   adequately served by police and fire protection;
               •   compatible with surrounding existing and planned land uses;
               •   minimally impacted by noise, flooding, or other environmental
                   constraints; and
               •   outside of areas of concentrated lower-income households.
Program 2a: Density Bonus
               The Seal Beach Zoning Ordinance contains density bonus policies that are
               consistent with State density bonus law. Density bonuses and other
               incentives can help to facilitate the production of low- and moderate-
               income housing by providing incentives that reduce development costs.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to promote the use of density bonuses among potential
                   residential developers
Program 2b: Affordable Housing Resources
               The City will facilitate the development of quality affordable housing
               through a variety of actions, including pursuing additional funding sources
               and partnering with private and non-profit housing developers.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Maintain a list of non-profit housing developers active in Orange
                   County.
                                              V-5                            October 14, 2013

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                           V. Housing Action Plan
               •   Contact qualified non-profit housing developers to explore
                   opportunities for affordable housing development annually, or
                   whenever development opportunities arise.
               •   Explore a variety of funding resources, such as Multi-Family Housing
                   Program (MHP) funds and Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC).
                   Periodically consult with the State Department of Housing and
                   Community Development HCD for current and new funding availability.
               •   Provide interested developers with an inventory of residential sites
                   available for development.
               •   Prioritize assistance for extremely-low-income (ELI) units and projects
                   such as single room occupancy (SRO) and supportive housing
                   commensurate with the City’s regional housing need of 1 ELI unit during
                   the current planning period.
Program 2c: Land Write Downs and Assistance with Off-Site Improvements
               Land costs and requirements for off-site improvements are important
               factors in determining the cost of housing. To facilitate development of
               housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households the City may
               subsidize the cost of land and off-site improvements when feasible. This
               program will be implemented through discussions with project proponents
               during the development review process.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Consider subsidizing the cost of land and off-site improvements for
                   affordable housing development on a project-specific basis when
                   feasible.
Goal 3:        Address, and where appropriate and legally possible, remove
               governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and
               development of housing.
Policy 3a:     Assist City residents in securing decent safe and affordable housing.
Policy 3b:     Conserve the affordability of housing units assisted with public funds
               through affordability covenants or resale controls.
Policy 3c:     Investigate and pursue programs and funding sources designed to
               maintain and/or improve the affordability of existing housing units to low-
               and moderate-income households.
Program 3a: Section 8 Rental Assistance

City of Seal Beach 2013-2021 Housing Element                           V. Housing Action Plan
               The Section 8 rental assistance program extends rental subsidies to very-
               low-income (50% MFI) families and elderly who spend more than 50% of
               their income on rent, live in substandard housing, or have been displaced.
               The subsidy represents the difference between 30% of the monthly income
               and the allowable rent determined by the Section 8 program. Most Section
               8 subsidies are issued in the form of vouchers which permit tenants to
               locate their own housing and rent units beyond the housing payment
               standards in an area provided the tenants pay the extra rent increment.
               Seal Beach participates in the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program through
               the Housing Authority of Orange County.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to cooperate with the Orange County Housing Authority in
                   providing Section 8 rental assistance to very-low-income households
               •   Assist the County Housing Authority in promoting the Section 8 program
                   to both property owners and eligible renters by publicizing the program
                   on the City’s website, the City newsletter, local libraries, and within
                   Leisure World.
Program 3b: Mortgage Credit Certificates
               The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) program is a federal program that
               allows qualified first-time homebuyers to take an annual credit against
               federal income taxes of up to 15 percent of the annual interest paid on the
               applicant’s mortgage. This enables homebuyers to have more income
               available to qualify for a mortgage loan and make the monthly mortgage
               payments. The value of the MCC must be taken into consideration by the
               mortgage lender in underwriting the loan and may be used to adjust the
               borrower s federal income tax withholding. The MCC program has
               covenant restrictions to ensure the affordability of the participating homes
               for a period of 15 years.
               The MCC program is administered through the County of Orange. Each
               participating city pays a small fee to help offset the cost of administration.
               MCCs are awarded on a first-come/first-served basis.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue participation in the MCC program and contact the County
                   annually to determine current program status. Distribute program
                   information at City libraries and on the City website. The number of
                   households assisted with this program will depend on market conditions
                   and program availability.

Program 3c: Maintenance of Affordability Covenants on City or Agency-Assisted
               Housing
               The City and Redevelopment Agency previously used CDBG and
               redevelopment set-aside funds to assist in the development and
               preservation of affordable housing. To ensure the long-term preservation of
               Seal Beach Shores Trailer Park as an important affordable housing resource,
               the City worked with LINC Housing, a non-profit housing organization, to
               pursue tenant ownership of the park. The City was awarded a $20,000
               Technical Assistance Grant by the State Department of Housing and
               Community Development (HCD) to facilitate conversion of the park to
               tenant ownership. Through the issuance of a revenue bond by the
               Redevelopment Agency and subsequent loan to LINC Housing, conversion
               of the park to tenant ownership was completed in 2000, and affordability
               covenants were recorded on these units. The Agency has been providing
               ongoing rental assistance to offset the monthly rent increase necessary to
               repay the bond. The Successor Agency to the Seal Beach Redevelopment
               Agency has listed such rental assistance to qualified residents of the Seal
               Beach Shores Trailer Park as one of its enforceable obligations with the
               intention of continuing that assistance.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to monitor the affordability of any very-low, low-, and
                   moderate-income housing units assisted with public funds.
Program 3d: Local Coastal Program
               The City does not currently have a certified LCP. As a result, all
               developments within the Coastal Zone are subject to review by the
               California Coastal Commission, in addition to the required City approvals.
               The City Council has appointed an Ad Hoc General Plan/LCP Committee
               to provide direction in the preparation of an LCP. During 2013/2014 City
               staff will work with the Ad Hoc Committee to prepare and submit a draft
               LCP to the California Coastal Commission for review and certification.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Prepare and obtain Coastal Commission certification of a Local Coastal
                   Program.
Goal 4:        Maintain and enhance the existing quality of residential neighborhoods in
               Seal Beach.

                the improvement of residential property.
Policy 4d:      Encourage the continued affordability of housing units rehabilitated with
                public funds.
Policy 4e:      Discourage the conversion of existing apartment units to condominiums
                where such conversion will diminish the supply of housing affordable to
                low- and moderate-income households.
Policy 4f:      Promote the conservation and rehabilitation of older neighborhoods,
                preventing the encroachment of incompatible commercial or industrial
                uses into established neighborhoods.
Policy 4g:      Assist all residents, wherever possible, in securing decent safe and
                adequate housing.
Policy 4h:      Promote a safe, healthful, aesthetically pleasing environment that
                strengthens individual and family life.
Policy 4i:      Preserve and enhance viable residential neighborhoods and strengthen
                neighborhood identity.
Policy 4j:      Upgrade and improve community facilities and municipal services in
                keeping with community needs.
Policy 4k:      Encourage the use of innovative land use techniques and construction
                methods to minimize housing costs without compromising basic health,
                safety, and aesthetic conditions.
Policy 4l:      Periodically reexamine local building and zoning codes for possible
                amendments to reduce construction costs without sacrificing basic health
                and safety considerations.
Program 4a: Condominium Conversion
               As a means to preserve the affordable housing stock the Condominium
               Conversion Ordinance regulates the procedures for the conversion of
               existing apartment complexes to condominium ownerships.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to enforce the Condominium Conversion Ordinance
                                             V-9                          October 14, 2013

Program 4b: Replacement Housing in Local Coastal Zone
               The Coastal and Surfside Planning Areas of the city are located within the
               Coastal Zone. State law requires that affordable low- and moderate-
               income housing units demolished within the coastal zone be replaced, if
               feasible.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to review development projects on a case-by-case basis to
                   ensure that replacement low- and moderate-income housing is
                   provided if feasible.
Program 4c: Housing Conditions Monitoring
               Overall, the housing stock in Seal Beach is well-maintained. However, the
               beach area contains scattered housing units with deferred maintenance
               issues. The City has targeted the beach area for housing condition
               monitoring. Periodically, the City’s code enforcement and building officials
               survey the area to identify properties requiring maintenance and upkeep. If
               significant problems are found to exist, the City will seek funding assistance
               for rehabilitation grants or loans to property owners from the County of
               Orange CDBG Small City Urban County program.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to conduct annual surveys of the targeted beach area to
                   identify housing units with deferred maintenance issues and mail
                   brochures about the City’s rehabilitation programs to owners of the
                   identified units. Apply for funding assistance annually from the Urban
                   County program if rehabilitation needs are identified.
Program 4d: Zoning and Building Codes Enforcement
               Enforcement of building and zoning codes is important to maintaining and
               improving the quality of housing and neighborhoods in a community. The
               City contracts for code compliance services 20 hours per week.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to enforce the City’s zoning and building codes through
                   contract code compliance services.
               •   Provide information about assistance programs to property owners with
                   violations.

                households of all sizes.
Program 5a: Fair Housing Services
               The City enforces the Fair Housing Act within its jurisdiction. To achieve fair
               housing goals, the City participates in Orange County’s contract with the
               Fair Housing Council of Orange County (FHCOC) to provide fair housing
               and tenant landlord counseling services. FHCOC is contracted to perform
               fair housing audits and to investigate fair housing complaints.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •   Continue to provide fair housing and tenant landlord counseling

               CDBG funds are utilized to remove architectural barriers, such as restroom
               facilities in Leisure World.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •    Continue to utilize the Home Improvement Program to remove
                    architectural barriers and encourage participation by elderly and
                    disabled residents.

Goal 6:        Encourage more efficient energy use in residential developments.
Policy 6a:      Promote energy conservation through “green building” techniques that
                reduce water consumption, improve energy efficiency and lessen a
                building’s overall environmental impact.
Policy 6b:      Promote “smart growth” principles by encouraging compact
                development in locations that provide opportunities for reduced vehicle
                trips.
Program 6a: Green Building Techniques
               “Green buildings” are structures that are designed, renovated, re-used or
               operated in a manner that enhances resource efficiency and sustainability.
               These structures reduce water consumption, improve energy efficiency and
               lessen a building’s overall environmental impact. The City’s Development
               Services Department will distribute a Green Building Tips handout for both
               homeowners and builders, and the City will offer a fee reduction program
               for remodels that include energy conservation features.
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •    Distribute a Green Building Tips handout at City Hall and on the City
                    website.
               •    Continue to offer reduced fees for residential remodeling projects that
                    include energy conservation features.
Program 6b: Promote Smart Growth
               The City will continue to promote “smart growth” principles by encouraging
               compact development commensurate with the City’s regional housing
               need in locations that provide opportunities for reduced vehicle trips (see
               also Program 1a).
               2013-2021 Objectives:
               •    Seek to incorporate smart growth principles in future land use and
                    zoning amendments.

                      Evaluation of the Prior Housing Element
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that jurisdictions evaluate the
effectiveness of the existing Housing Element, the appropriateness of goals, objectives
and policies, and the progress in implementing programs for the previous planning
period. This appendix contains a review of the housing goals, policies, and programs of
the previous housing element, and evaluates the degree to which these programs have
been implemented during the previous planning period. This analysis also includes an
assessment of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies. The findings from this
evaluation have been instrumental in determining the City’s 2013-2021 housing
programs.
Table A-1 summarizes the programs contained in the previous Housing Element along
with the source of funding, program objectives, accomplishments, and implications for
future policies and actions.
Table A-2 summarizes the goals and policies contained in the previous Housing Element
along with an assessment of their appropriateness for the new planning period.
Table A-3 presents the City’s progress in meeting the quantified objectives from the
previous Housing Element.

                            are made:
                            a) The reduction is consistent with the
                            adopted General Plan, including the Housing
                            Element; and
                            b) The remaining sites identified in the
                            Housing Element are adequate to
                            accommodate the City’s share of regional

                            §65584.
                            If a reduction in residential density for any
                            parcel would result in the remaining sites in
                            the Housing Element land inventory not being
                            adequate to accommodate the City’s share of
                            the regional housing need pursuant to Sec.
                            65584, the City may reduce the density on
                            that parcel if it identifies sufficient additional,
                            adequate and available sites with an equal or
                            greater residential density so that there is no

                                  Residential Land Inventory
This appendix provides additional detail regarding the land inventory analysis of potential
affordable housing development during the current RHNA projection period (2014-2021).
ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING AFFORDABILITY
State law 11 establishes a “default density” of 20 units per acre that is suitable for lower-
income housing in small metropolitan cities such as Seal Beach. The land inventory
analysis is based on this affordability assumption.
POTENTIAL SITES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
Seal Beach is nearly built-out with only a few parcels of vacant developable land
remaining. This section describes three sites with potential for residential development
during the 2013-2021 planning period. These sites provide adequate capacity to
accommodate the City’s RHNA allocation of 1 very-low-income unit and 1 low-income
unit.
•     1011 Seal Beach Blvd. (Accurate Storage). This approximately 4-acre site (Figure B-1)
      is located immediately south of the Boeing Integrated Defense Systems property. It
      was formerly occupied by a metal fabricator and is currently used for vehicle and
      boat storage. The site is bordered by office, commercial and light industrial uses to
      the north and west, by the City Police Station across Adolfo Lopez Drive to the south,
      and by Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station across Seal Beach Boulevard to the east
      and has good access to employment and transit routes. Pursuant to the Program 1a
      in the 4th cycle Housing Element, in 2013 this property was rezoned to Residential High
      Density-20, and is suitable for lower-income multi-family development. There are no
      known environmental constraints on this property, and the site has good access to
      employment and transit routes.
•     DWP Specific Plan. This 10-acre property (Figure B-2) was formerly developed with
      an electrical generating station, which was decommissioned in 1966. The site is
      currently vacant. In 2012 the land use designation for the property was amended to
      allow a 32-lot single-family subdivision on the northern portion of the site, and is
      assigned to the above-moderate income category. The project is currently under
      consideration by the California Coastal Commission.
•     Seal Beach Blvd./Pacific Coast Highway. This 0.25-acre parcel is developed with an
      older commercial building currently occupied by a liquor/convenience store. It has
      a General Plan designation of Limited Commercial and is zoned Limited
      Commercial/Residential Medium Density. This zoning designation allows residential
      use at up to 20 units/acre, which is considered suitable for lower-income housing.
      Due to the age and marginal condition of the structure, it is assumed that the entire
      site would be redeveloped with a new residential or mixed-use project. Because of
      its small size, this parcel has been listed in the moderate income site inventory.

                            Public Participation Summary
Section 65583(c)(5) of the Government Code states that "The local government shall
make diligent effort to achieve public participation of all the economic segments of the
community in the development of the housing element, and the program shall describe
this effort." Public participation played an important role in the formulation and
refinement of the City’s housing goals and policies and in the development of a Land
Use Plan which determines the extent and density of future residential development in
the community.
City residents and other interested stakeholders had many opportunities to recommend
strategies, review, and comment on the Housing Element update. Service providers and
interested parties that were included in the distribution of public notices are shown in
Table C-1. Table C-2 provides a summary of public comments along with responses that
are reflected in this Housing Element.
The following is a list of opportunities for public involvement in the preparation of this
