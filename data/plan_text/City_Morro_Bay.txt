                                                  HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
 1. INTRODUCTION
 The Housing Element is one of the seven State-mandated elements of the City’s General Plan. The
 Housing Element is updated every five years to identify recent demographic and employment trends
 that may affect existing and future housing demand and supply. The Housing Element serves as a
 tool to identify and provide for the housing needs of the community. The Housing Element
 addresses the City’s ability to meet the regional housing needs as determined by the State of
 California. The City has developed a set of objectives and specific policies and programs for the
 production of housing to meet the needs of all Morro Bay citizens.
 A Housing Element is required by California law to establish policies and programs that will support
 the provision of an adequate housing supply for citizens of all income levels. The intent of state law
 is to ensure that all jurisdictions in the state provide adequate housing to all members of the
 community. While the State reviews the Housing Element to ensure compliance with housing law,
 each jurisdiction must identify its particular issues to successfully address its housing needs.
 This document provides a detailed assessment of the existing housing stock in Morro Bay, including
 data on housing types, physical condition, cost, and availability. The report also examines special
 housing needs populations such as the elderly, persons with disabilities, farmworkers, and the
 homeless. It also identifies opportunities for energy conservation when housing is constructed or
 remodeled. The report assesses the effectiveness of past housing programs. The availability and
 capacity of land and public services for housing development are examined along with factors that
 may constrain the production of affordable housing
 An understanding of existing housing conditions in the city is necessary as a basis for new Housing
 Element policies to guide the use and development of housing that will be adequate and affordable.
 In addition to this focused information, throughout the document, comparisons to San Luis Obispo
 County demographics and statistics will be used to identify possible issues or pertinent relationships.
 This assessment is representative of the larger area and informative of the trends the entire county is
 experiencing, helping to gain a better understanding of the city in a regional context.
 State law is more specific about the content of the Housing Element than any other portion of the
 General Plan. That specificity is reflected in the detailed demographics and other data contained
 herein. The Housing Element is also the only part of the General Plan that is subject to mandatory
 deadlines for periodic updates. Except for the Local Coastal Plan, it is the only element that is
 subject to review and “certification” by the State.
 CONTENT OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
 The Housing Element contains the following information as required by state law:
    Analysis of population and employment trends and documentation of projections and a
     quantification of the locality’s existing and projected housing needs for all income levels.
CITY OF MORRO BAY                                                                                 JUNE 2014

         HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
     Analysis of any special housing needs populations, such as those with disabilities, the elderly,
      large families, farmworkers, homeless persons, and single-parent households.
     Analysis and documentation of household characteristics including level of payment compared
      to ability to pay, and housing characteristics including the extent of overcrowding and an
      estimate of housing stock conditions.
     Analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints on the maintenance, improvement, or
      development of housing for all income levels. These constraints include land use controls,
      building codes and their enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of
      developers, and local processing and permit procedures.
     Analysis of potential and actual non-governmental constraints on the maintenance,
      improvement, or development of housing for all income levels, including the availability of
      financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction.
     Site-specific inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant and
      underutilized sites, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning, public facilities, and City
      services to these sites.
     Analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential development.
     Analysis of the existing and projected needs including the locality’s share of the regional housing
      need in accordance with Government Code Section 65584.
  DATA SOURCES
  The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) developed a data
  packet for jurisdictions in San Luis Obispo County that contains much of the information required
  for the Housing Needs Assessment of this Housing Element and is the primary source of data for
  this document. Where additional information is required, the US Census, which is completed every
  10 years, is the preferred data source, as it provides the most reliable and in-depth data for
  demographic characteristics of a locality. This report uses the 2010 US Census for current
  information and the 2000 US Census to assess changes since the year 2000. The California
  Department of Finance (DOF) is another source of data that is more current than the Census.
  However, the DOF does not provide the depth of information that can be found in the 2010 US
  Census. Whenever possible, the San Luis Obispo County data packet, DOF data, and other local
  sources were used in the Housing Needs Assessment in order to provide the most current profile of
  the community.
  The 2010 US Census did not collect information in several categories that are required for the
  Housing Needs Assessment. Where this is the case, historical DOF data is used. Where DOF data is
  not available, information from the 2000 US Census is retained. In cases where this is not feasible or

                                                  HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
 useful, this assessment references US Census Bureau American Community Survey (ACS) data. The
 ACS provides estimates of numerous housing-related indictors based on samples averaged over a
 five-year period. Whereas the US Census provides complete counts of various demographic
 indicators, the ACS provides estimates based on statistically significant samples. Due to the small
 size of the sample taken in Morro Bay, the estimates reported by the ACS have large margins of
 error. Where ACS data is used, the numbers should not be interpreted as absolute fact, but rather as
 a tool to illustrate general proportion or scale.
 Information on available sites and services for housing comes from numerous public agencies.
 Information on constraints on housing production and past and current housing efforts in Morro
 Bay comes from City staff, other public agencies, and some private sources.
 GENERAL PLAN/LOCAL COASTAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
 The City’s Land Use Element and Local Coastal Plan currently designate the sites noted in this
 Housing Element for residential purposes at densities consistent with the goals of providing housing
 to households within the full range of incomes. The policies in this Housing Element will guide that
 process, ensuring internal consistency among the elements. Due to the passage of Assembly Bill
 (AB) 162 relating to flood protection in 2007, the City may be required to amend the Safety and
 Conservation elements of the General Plan. If amendments are needed, the Housing Element will
 be amended to be consistent with the Safety and Conservation elements.
 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
 State law requires that “the local government shall make a diligent effort to achieve public
 participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of the housing
 element . . .” (Government Code Section 65583).
 In order to satisfy this requirement, the City conducted a series of community meetings and public
 hearings to receive community input concerning Morro Bay’s housing goals, policies, and programs.
 (Descriptions of these meetings are listed below.) In addition, the Housing Element was posted on
 the City’s website during the element’s 60-day public review period to ensure it was available to all
 community members.
 The public workshop on March 12, 2014 was noticed in the newspaper as well as on the City’s
 website. In an effort to reach all segments of the community, the City mailed public hearing notices
 and the Notice of Availability (NOA) to the agencies and groups listed below. Additionally, all
 public meeting and hearing were broadcast on the City’s governmental access channel. Recordings
 of meetings were broadcast at several times after the initial meeting for those who weren’t available
 to watch live.

  Public Workshop, March 12, 2014
  The City held a public workshop with the Planning Commission to solicit input from city residents
  on March 12, 2014. The format for this meeting was a presentation with an overview of the 5th cycle
  Housing Element update process and solicited input from the Planning Commissioners and meeting
  attendees on housing needs in Morro Bay.
  The following is a listing of the comments received from public input:
     There are many older residents and they can be picky. This can make younger people and
      families feel unwelcome.
     Let people know about housing opportunities in the city
     More young people would contribute to the vitality of the city.
     The rehabilitation program that the City used to administer didn’t work for many households
      because they didn’t have equity in their home and that was needed to qualify for the program.
     Challenging for employers to recruit and retain the workforce they need.
     Economic Vitality Corporation’s Building and Designing Cluster put out countywide workforce
      housing survey. The purpose was to hear from employers and employees about housing needs
      and preferences.
     87 percent of employers say workforce housing is needed.
     88 percent of employees said it was very difficult to find housing.

                                                     4

                                                HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   City should define workforce housing. Suggest using the County’s definition of 120 to 160
    percent of area median income (AMI).
   Infrastructure costs are a significant constraint to building housing affordable to the workforce
    categories. City could pursue options for infrastructure financing.
    The following is a list of the comments received from the Planning Commission:
   Seems Morro Bay fell short on accommodating the units the City committed to in the previous
    Housing Element. It would be good to know what the results were.
   The city definitely needs housing. We have homeless and older folks that need additional care.
   There would be of a demographic shift looking back 20 or more years as opposed to 2000 to
    2010.
   The indices on the percentages of people in the various age groups in the city didn’t change in
    those 10 years, but the people involved and replacement populations have changed quite a bit.
   As a demographically stable community, how do we find the resources to be able to push along
    or get some of these programs to completion, especially with the state cutting back?
   Morro Bay’s demographics are atypical. Any indication why that’s the case and why that
    continues to be the case? If one of the main factors that keeps Morro Bay’s population older is
    retirement, then housing needs are different than in other places.
   The price of land here puts the city out of affordability range.
   Do we get credit for granny or secondary units?
   There are many interesting issues that have led Morro Bay to where it is today; the fishing
    collapse and power plant changes removed middle-income family incomes. On the other hand,
    there is the significant group of retirees.
   The amount of agriculture in the Morro Creek area is changing drastically. There is more land in
    irrigation. Are there migrant farmworker issues that we need to address?
   It should also be noted that because of Morro Bay’s hotels and tourist-serving amenities, our
    10,000-person resident population is on a relatively small footprint.
CITY OF MORRO BAY                                                                            JUNE 2014

         HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
    It seems like one of the groups that we aren’t reaching is the young families. Although numbers
     stayed constant from 2000 to 2010, we’re not seeing kids up and down streets like they used to.
     How can the problem be addressed? Can telecommuting or other options be employed to make
     Morro Bay more attractive to that type of population?
    Should consider what the community wants looking forward for, instead of just looking back.
    Consider city broadband ordinance for telecommuting. Would that be a goal that could be in the
     Housing Element?
    There is little opportunity for young families to purchase for-sale housing.
    According to the 2009 Housing Element, 83 percent of housing stock is 25 years or older, and
     more of it is 50 years or older. How do we address that in the Housing Element? How do we
     allow for upgrades/remodeling? The City has had a rehabilitation program in the past; there
     have also been some countywide efforts.
    Can we start to look at where existing zoning precludes housing? One area only allows houses by
     themselves, other areas allow multi-family. It would be helpful to allow residential uses on upper
     floors in the Embarcadero area. It could make that area livelier at night and provide options for
     renters.
    The idea of transitional and emergency shelters is good. The City should support it. People who
     are in need don’t necessarily have mobility. The City doesn’t need a large facility, but it is a need
     in our community. We see homeless people on the street. Resources for people in crisis need to
     be in the community and not elsewhere.
    All of these issues are related. How we look at zoning inhibits certain groups/makes things
     economically viable. The city doesn’t have many parcels. We have to be creative to make things
     work. To accommodate more housing and more types of housing, the City either needs to
     increase density or find other opportunities where residential uses aren’t currently allowed.
    The City should also look at the needs of recruited businesses.
    Addressing workforce housing would address a lot of the topics that have been brought up.
    Rehabilitation is a great idea. It fits well into the greenhouse gas reduction program that the City
     has talked about. On the other hand, older houses are often the most affordable. It is important
     not to reduce affordable housing stock due to rehabilitation efforts.

 Stakeholder Roundtable Discussion, March 18, 2014
 The City held a roundtable discussion with stakeholders on March 18, 2014. Over 30 housing
 stakeholders were invited to attend via email. The format for this meeting was a small informal
 group discussion with a set of questions to elicit discussion. Five stakeholders, one City staff person
 and two members of the consultant team attended the meeting. The five attendees included real
 estate agents, a for-profit developer, a representative of People’s Self-Help Housing (PSHH), a
 nonprofit affordable housing developer; and a Morro Bay resident. The following input was received
 from the stakeholders:
    Most seniors live independently as long as they can.
    Many of the remaining vacant residential lots have significant environmental constraints
     including slopes and being located in or partially in environmentally sensitive habitat (ESH)
     areas.
    People’s Self-Help Housing builds affordable sweat equity ownership affordable rental housing
     on the Central Coast.
          o They usually require a local funding match of approximately 20 percent.
          o Many of their projects are funded through tax credit financing.
          o Funds from a community’s inclusionary housing in-lieu fee fund can be used towards the
              20 percent match.
          o PSHH looks for opportunities to build on surplus land owned by local jurisdictions as
              the up front costs for the land can be much less under this scenario.
          o The recently passed Farm Bill did not alter Morro Bay’s USDA status in terms of the
              opportunity to pursue USDA funding and Morro Bay remains in the rural category.
    It is important to keep lenders informed of funding opportunities. For example the County’s
     first-time homebuyer program.
    Parking exceptions can be granted in Morro Bay.
    Compact development and infill should be promoted in Morro Bay

  Online Survey
  The City prepared and hosted an online survey on its website. The survey was designed to be
  accessible to stakeholders and members of the general public and was available between March 18,
  2014, and April 1, 2014. The survey was advertised to the general public via the City’s website and
  distributed to key stakeholders via e-mail.
  Thirty one Morro Bay residents completed the survey, providing feedback on the availability of
  housing, factors that influence housing decisions, and the perceived level of importance of special
  needs groups in the City. Approximately 90 percent of survey participants own their own home
  (compared with the city’s 53 percent homeownership rate, see Table 11), which suggests that
  responses may be skewed to reflect the views of homeowners. The survey results are presented here
  for informational purposes and provide the best available information about the respondents’
  housing related opinions.
  Over 60 percent of participants reported that renting and purchasing safe, decent, and affordable
  housing in Morro Bay is either somewhat difficult or very difficult for the average person or family.
  Nearly 75 percent of respondents identified land and construction costs as severe constraints to
  accessing quality housing. Other constraints include insufficient income, which was identified as a
  severe constraint by 67 percent of respondents, and development fees, which were identified as a
  severe constraint by 40 percent of respondents.
  As illustrated in Figure 1, respondents identified seniors and lower-income families as the highest
  priority special needs groups in the City. The City’s current housing may become more accessible to
  these special needs groups through Housing Element policies such as Policy H-18 (Senior Housing),
  Policy H-6.a (General Affordability), and Policy H-5 (Housing Costs). Respondents also identified
  single-parent households, the homeless, disabled persons, and persons with developmental
  disabilities as general priorities.

 Public Hearing, April 15, 2014
 The City presented the public review draft Housing Element at the Planning Commission meeting
 on April 15, 2014. The Planning Commission recommended that the draft be amended to include
 seven additional programs and submitted to HCD for review. The additional programs are listed
 below.
        Program H-1.4 call for the City to inventory vacant and underutilized lots in and adjacent to
         the downtown business district and identify areas to consider for rezoning to high density
         residential or mixed use and modify the City’s zoning map as appropriate.
        Program H-1.5 states that the City will consider establishing minimum densities in the R-3,
         R-4 and MCR zoning districts.
        Program H-1.6 calls for the City to explore the option of expanding the number of
         liveaboard slips in the City.
        Program H-6.6 calls for the City to consider amending the Community Housing Ordinance
         to require that housing units developed under the ordinance be restricted for those with
         moderate or lower incomes.
CITY OF MORRO BAY                                                                              JUNE 2014

         HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
        Program H-22.4 states that the City will consider adopting an ordinance requiring active or
         passive solar features or other renewable energy generating systems in all new residential
         construction.
        Program H-22.5 directs the City to consider establishing a rotating fund providing low-
         interest loans for energy upgrades.
        Program H-22.6 call on the City to consider adopting an ordinance that requires as a
         condition of approval for a permit to expand or modify a residential dwelling, that the entire
         residence be brought into compliance with Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.
  Everyone on the mailing list received notice of these meetings to encourage participation in the
  hearings and to provide input on the draft Housing Element. No members of the public provided
  comments.
  Planning Commission Hearing, June 17, 2014
  Commission Comment
        Concerned regarding growth caps in water, should gray water be mandatory?
        Confused about overpayment, does this mean that working class and adults later in life need
         more housing options?
        Should the 2500 square foot housing rule be in the Housing Element?
        Morro Bay did not meet previous low-income requirements because of developers backing
         out.
        Very concerned about water supply. What is the current update on desalinization plant? If
         we can’t pump in the Chorro Basin and the Morro Basin may be contaminated, isn’t our
         water supply worse than this document makes it sound? Would like more clarity on water
         supply sources for development.
        Why is there a reduction in the amount of water each household uses?
        New construction actually increases water efficiency. We don’t want to see reduction of
         development due to water.
        If we can make new development require solar, can we require gray water and rainwater
         collection in new development? Would like program H-22.4 to state “Consider requiring
         solar, gray water systems, and rain water collection systems in new development.”
JUNE 2014                                                                      CITY OF MORRO BAY

                                              HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
       Worried about program H-22.6 which requires homes to come into to compliance before
        receiving permit for home renovation. Worried that this will increase illegal development?
        Can the language be changed? It is too expensive to ask people to bring the whole house
        into compliance when making minor modifications? Would like to change the program to
        state “significantly remodel or modify residential home.”
       Supportive of conservation and rehabilitation of affordable housing while preserving
        community character. Should also look beyond square footage to see if a project adds value
        to community character.
       All new program language (recommended Planning Commission programs) is very soft,
        would want City Council to have right to amend language.
       The document states that plant has adequate capacity to accommodate daily sewage flow to
        year 2014 with population estimates. The plant is currently operating under waiver so saying
        plant has capacity is a misleading assumption. This section needs more clarity and must
        include a discussion of the planned new water treatment plant to reflect where the City is
        currently.
 City Council Hearing, June 24, 2014
 Public Comment
       Quite a few commenters were concerned about neighborhood compatibility and would like
        it addressed in the Housing Element
             o Both in terms of housing upgrades and new construction.
             o The Housing Element is the heart and soul of how we define our community in
                 Morro Bay
             o Need definitive standards in the building code (commenter may mean Zoning
                 Ordinance) regarding neighborhood compatibility (commenter referenced the
                 project on Ridgeway).
             o There is a lot of existing information to pull from and build on from the 2007
                 workshop on neighborhood compatibility
             o Glad the City is working on this issue
             o Need to include neighborhood compatibility in the new General Plan. Lots of time
                 and money was spent on the project on Ridgeway. Several commenters noted that
                 antipathy between neighbors has been created due to that project.
CITY OF MORRO BAY                                                                           JUNE 2014

       HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
            o Make neighborhood compatibility rules clear
            o City staff response: The City will start on the neighborhood compatibility ordinance once the new
                Planning Manager starts in July
       Water supply description in the draft Housing Element is too optimistic. The Regional
        Water Quality Control Board has directed Morro Bay to start testing for sewage in the
        Morro Basin aquifer.
       What happened to the “Big House” ordinance?
            o City staff response: it was an urgency ordinance and it expired in 2009 and was not renewed.
       Program H-1.6 calling for the City to explore the possibility of expanding the number of
        liveaboards in the City could be a big problem due to sewage. This program should be more
        defined and liveaboards should be defined.
            o City staff response: Liveaboards are already defined by the City in Muni Code 15.40. They are not
                the same as houseboats and must be navigable, used 4+ days to live on.
                        Since early 1990s the rule has been a maximum of 10 percent of total boats in the harbor
                         for liveaboards which is currently set at 50 by City and State Lands Commission.
                        There are currently between 25 and 30 liveaboard slips in use.
                        Generally, there aren’t strong historic trends towards the liveaboard demand increasing
                         dramatically
  Council Comment
       Clarify language regarding Mixed Commercial (MCR) zoning on page 44 to clarify it allows
        50 percent residential and 50 percent commercial. Are these changes considered substantive
        to HCD?
            o PMC response: Language will be clarified. Yes, the changes are considered substantive to HCD.
       Could workforce housing be defined in the Housing Element?
            o PMC response: Yes
       Regarding changing the terminology to “significant remodel” in Program H-22.6 – is that
        term defined?
            o City staff response: Yes, it is defined in City code.

                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
       Is it okay to remove the liveaboards program? (Program H-1.6).
             o PMC response: It would be fine from an HCD perspective
             o Staff response/note: Coastal Commission has received the draft Housing Element and has not
                 commented.
       Would like to remove Program H-1.6
       Would it be okay to add a workforce housing program?
             o Would it be a useful effort?
             o Will it take away from the needs of other income groups/special needs groups?
             o PMC response: It wouldn’t have to take away from others
             o Staff response: could be a useful effort, wouldn’t need to take away from other groups
       One Council member attended workforce housing summit on May 28th with the Housing
        Trust Fund.
       The Council is participating on two boards related to homelessness issues
             o SLO Housing Trust Fund Commission
             o SLO County Housing Oversight Commission
 Other Input Received
 The City received a comment letter from the Homeless Services Oversight Council (HSOC) on
 March 11, 2014. The letter included information about the homeless needs in San Luis Obispo
 County and formal recommendations for the Morro Bay Housing Element update. The following
 needs and statistics were mentioned:
   San Luis Obispo County’s has a severe need for extremely low, very low and low income rental
    housing. Overpayment is a serious issue for these income categories.
    San Luis Obispo County has a higher rate of homelessness than San Francisco, New York City
    and Los Angeles County.
   90 percent of the homeless population in San Luis Obispo is unsheltered which is the fourth
    highest percentage of unsheltered homeless of the 415 areas surveyed.

          HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
  The following specific recommendations were provided:
     Adjust development impact fees to be lower for smaller units and higher for larger units.
     Allow and encourage SROs (studio apartments as small as 150 square feet), boarding houses and
      rooming houses and rooming houses in all areas that allow multi-family housing.
     Allow and encourage manufactured homes and park models to be used as second units.
     Consider floor area ratios, rather than number of dwelling units, when setting density limits for
      affordable housing.
     Allow more and larger group homes and residential care facilities to be built and operated in all
      zones where residential uses are allowed.
     Encourage more apartments by allowing higher densities, removing barriers that limit achieving
      maximum densities and streamlining the approval process.
  A resident of North Morro Bay and realtor provided comments via phone. The resident stated that
  the vacant properties zoned R-4 should be used or encouraged to be used for affordable housing.
  They also referenced a City owned lot at the corner of San Jacinto and Coral.
  Response to Input Received
  All comments received as a result of the City’s efforts to encourage public participation in
  development of the 2014–2019 Housing Element have been taken into consideration and, where
  appropriate, additional analysis, programs and policies have been incorporated into the Housing
  Element. The remainder of the comments received were reviewed and no changes were made either
  due to limited City resources to include additional programs, the comment addressed an issue that is
  not within the City’s purview or the scope of the Housing Element, or because they were already
  sufficiently addressed in the Draft Housing Element. In response to input received on the April
  Draft Housing Element submitted to HCD, revisions were made to the draft Housing Element as
  described below. Note that page numbers referenced are pages in the April Draft.
         A sentence was added to page 41 noting that the City participates on the boards of the SLO
          County Housing Trust Fund Commission and the SLO County Homeless Services
          Oversight Council (HSOC).
         Language on page 44 was clarified regarding Mixed Commercial (MCR) zoning to explain
          that it allows 50 percent residential and 50 percent commercial development. Related edits

        Additional information was added to pages 51 and 52 about water supply in the City and
         City efforts to secure long-term supply as well as additional information about plans for the
         City’s wastewater reclamation plant.
        Text was added on page 62 to explain the water equivalency allocation (WEU) process and
         to conclude that the growth management ordinance is not a constraint to residential
         development.
        Program H-1.6 related to liveaboards in the City was removed because the City has not
         exceeded its existing liveaboard capacity and pursuing expansion of that capacity is not seen
         as needed at this time.
        Policy H-4 was revised to include workforce housing.
        Program H-4.3 was added to implement City efforts to address workforce housing needs.
        Program H-13.1 was revised to strengthen the City’s commitment to working on
         neighborhood compatibility standards.
        Program H-22.4 was revised to include gray water systems or rainwater collection as
         additional options to satisfy program requirements.
        Program H-22.6 was revised to replace the terms “expansion or modification” with the more
         specifically defined terms “significant remodel or addition.”
        The status of implementation of Previous Housing Element Program H-17.2 was updated
         on page 101 as it has changed since submittal of the Draft Housing Element.
 COASTAL ZONE REQUIREMENT
 Communities located within coastal zones are required to review coastal zone affordable housing
 obligations including the preservation of existing occupied units affordable to low- or moderate-
 income households and where feasible include low- and moderate-income housing in new
 developments.
     To assist a locality’s determination of whether the affordable housing stock in the coastal zone is
     being protected and provided as required by Section 65590, the element must contain data on
     the new construction, demolition, conversion, and replacement of housing units for low- and
     moderate-income households within the coastal zone, including the following:
 1. The number of new housing units approved for construction within the coastal zone (after
     January 1982).

       be provided in new housing developments either within or within 3 miles of the coastal zone.
  3. The number of existing residential dwelling units occupied by low- and moderate-income
       households required either within or within 3 miles of the coastal zone that have been
       authorized to be demolished or converted.
  4. The number of residential dwelling units for low- and moderate-income persons and families
       that have been required for replacement (of those units being demolished or converted) within
       or within 3 miles of the coastal zone, and designate the location of the replacement units in the
       housing element review for coastal zones.
  The entirety of the city’s housing stock is located within three miles of its coastal zone and includes
  a total of 126 affordable housing units; all of these units were constructed after 1982. These units
  provide housing for low- and moderate-income households. No units have been demolished and
  therefore none have needed replacement. Table 1 presents coastal zone affordable housing
  documentation.

 2. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
 The Housing Needs Assessment is the section of the Housing Element that presents the
 characteristics of the city’s population and housing stock as a means of better understanding the
 nature and extent of unmet housing needs.
 POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
 The type and amount of housing needed in a community is largely determined by population growth
 and demographic characteristics such as age, household size, occupation, and income.
 Population Trends
 According to the DOF, the population of Morro Bay decreased slightly from 10,350 in 2000 to
 10,234 in 2010 (Table 2). The DOF estimated the city’s 2013 population to be 10,317 persons,
 which represents an annual growth rate of less than 1 percent since 2010. The city’s growth rate is
 consistent with other coastal communities in the county; Grover Beach and Pismo Beach each had
 stagnant or declining populations from 2000 to 2013.

         HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
  The San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG) published a Long Range Socio-
  Economic Projections Report in August 2011, updating the 2009 projections. Population,
  households, and jobs were projected through 2040 for low, mid, and high scenarios. Table 3 reports
  the “mid” growth scenario of a 13 percent increase in population from 10,073 residents in 2000 to
  11,831 residents in 2040.

  Age Characteristics
  Each age group has distinct lifestyles, family type and size, income levels, and housing preferences.
  As people move through each stage of life, housing needs and preferences also change. As a result,
  evaluating the age characteristics and trends of a community is important in determining existing and
  future housing needs. Table 4 provides the age characteristics of Morro Bay’s residents according to
  the 2000 and 2010 US Census. There was little change between 2000 and 2010, with the exception
  of a small decrease in persons ages 25–44 and an increase in persons ages 45–64. Despite these
  changes, the population in Morro Bay remains older than in most cities; over 50 percent of residents
  are 45 years old or older.

 The age of householder is another way to measure age in the city. As shown in Table 5, owner-
 occupied households tend to have older householders, while renter-occupied households tend to
 have younger householders.

  Employment
  Employment has an important impact on housing needs. Different jobs and associated income
  levels determine the type and size of housing a household can afford. Employment growth in the
  region typically increases housing demand.
  The California Employment Development Department (EDD) estimates that as of January 2014,
  5,500 Morro Bay residents were in the labor force, with 4.9 percent unemployment, compared to a
  countywide unemployment rate of 6.2 percent.

        The EDD produces an Occupational Employment and Wage Data spreadsheet by metropolitan
        statistical area (MSA) yearly. Table 7 shows employment projections from 2010 through 2020 as
        related to job growth for the San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles Metropolitan Statistical Area. During the
        next seven years, the San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles MSA expects new employment to be
        concentrated in a variety of occupations. When comparing these annual incomes to the median
        income in 2014 for a family of four ($77,000), only two occupational groups are above this median
        income (electrical power-line installers and repairers and software developers).

  Commute
  Commute distance is an important factor in housing availability and affordability and is also an
  indicator of jobs/housing balance. Communities with extended commute distances generally have a
  poor jobs/housing balance, while those with short average commutes tend to have a strong
  jobs/housing balance. The burden of the additional costs associated with extended commuting
  disproportionately affects lower-income households who must spend a larger portion of their overall
  income on fuel. This in turn affects a household’s ability to occupy decent housing without being
  overburdened by cost. Table 8 indicates that the vast majority of Morro Bay residents travel less
  than 30 minutes from home to work. This figure indicates that many of the jobs are within 20 miles
  of the city and that there is a strong jobs/housing balance, meaning that the available jobs are within
  relatively close distance to the employees’ places of residence.

 Overcrowding
 The US Census Bureau defines overcrowding as occurring when a housing unit is occupied by more
 than the equivalent of one person per room (not including kitchens and bathrooms). A typical home
 might have three bedrooms, a living room, and a dining room, for a total of five rooms. If more
 than five people were living in the home, it would be considered by the Census Bureau to be
 overcrowded. Because some households require less “space” per person, there is some question on
 whether units with slightly more than one person per room really have an overcrowding problem. In
 most cases, units with more than 1.01 persons per room are overcrowded. Units with more than
 1.50 persons per room are considered highly overcrowded and should be recognized as a significant
 housing problem.
 Morro Bay has a low incidence of overcrowding. Less than 4 percent of all the occupied housing in
 the city contains more than one person per room. A total of 84 units are considered to be highly
 overcrowded, having more than 1.50 persons per room. Of these, 10 are owner-occupied units and
 74 are renter-occupied units. Table 10 shows the persons per room for homeowners and renters in
 Morro Bay.

 HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
 The existing housing stock in Morro Bay can be described by a number of characteristics, including
 the number of units, type (single-family, mobile home, apartment, etc.), their tenure (owner-
 occupied vs. rental), the number of people living in the unit (household size), and unit size. Later
 sections of this chapter discuss cost and the physical condition of homes in the city.
 Number of Housing Units
 The 2000 Census reported a total of 6,286 housing units in the City of Morro Bay, and the
 California Department of Finance reported a total of 6,356 housing units in 2013. Table 13 shows
 the percentage increase in the number of housing units in Morro Bay between 2000 and 2013.

  Vacant Units
  A vacancy rate measures the overall housing availability in a community and is often a good
  indicator of how efficiently for-sale and rental housing units are meeting the current demand for
  housing. A vacancy rate of 5 percent for rental housing and 2 percent for ownership housing is
  generally considered healthy and suggests that there is a balance between the demand and supply of
  housing. A lower vacancy rate may indicate that households are having difficulty in finding housing
  that is affordable, leading to overcrowding or households having to pay more than they can afford.
  According to the 2007–2011 ACS Five-Year Estimates, there were a total of 1,476 vacant units
  recorded in Morro Bay. The vacancy rate for the city was 20 percent in 2000 and slightly higher in
  2011 at 23 percent. With the exception of Pismo Beach and Grover Beach, this rate is substantially
  higher than many other cities in the county, primarily because of the large number of vacation
  homes in Morro Bay. As noted in Table 14, there were a total of 1,476 vacant units recorded in
  Morro Bay in 2011. Of this total, 154 were for rent, 88 were for sale, and 1,125 were for seasonal,
  recreational, or occasional uses.

 Type of Housing Unit
 Table 15 shows the different types of housing units in Morro Bay by the number of units in the
 structure. In Morro Bay, 72 percent of the housing units are single-family detached homes, while
 attached single-family homes provide another 6 percent of the housing stock. Multi-family units
 constitute 15 percent and mobile homes make up 8 percent of the housing stock in the city.

 Age of Housing Stock
 An indication of the quality of the housing stock is its general age. Typically housing over 30 years
 old is likely to have rehabilitation needs that may include plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work,
 and other repairs. Table 16 displays the age of Morro Bay’s housing stock as of 2008. Note that 2008
 data is retained because only ACS data with large margins of error is currently available; since this
 data has not been vetted by HCD, the slightly dated but more accurate US Census and HCD
 numbers below are preferred. Among these units, approximately 18 percent of the housing units in
 Morro Bay have been built since 1990 and approximately 46 percent, almost one-half of the housing
 stock, is more than about 40 years old.

  Housing Conditions
  As of May 2009, according to the City’s building inspector, approximately 20 to 25 percent of the
  housing stock was in need of rehabilitation. In 2004, City staff conducted a house-by-house survey
  (100 percent of housing units) in four identified Target Income Census Block Groups (TIG) (see
  Figure 2).
JUNE 2014                                                                       CITY OF MORRO BAY

  Using the survey and point rating system prescribed by HCD, each unit was catalogued by condition
  of the roof, siding, foundation, windows, and electrical components. The figures were tabulated to
  establish a total score and identify each structure as sound, needs minor repair, needs moderate
  repair, needs substantial repair, or is dilapidated. Table 17 outlines the criteria used to determine the
  condition of the homes. Table 18 shows the breakdown of homes in each TIG area surveyed. Of
  the 1,502 homes surveyed, 403 were deemed to be in sound condition, 25 were dilapidated, and
  1,074 were in need of some degree of repair. The survey did not differentiate between owner-
  occupied and renter-occupied properties.
  Mobile homes were also evaluated by City staff in 2004. That survey found that a lesser percentage
  of these residences were categorized in the “Excellent” and “Sound 1” ratings, but that in general,
  approximately one-quarter of the mobile homes were in need of major rehabilitation or replacement.
  In 2014, City staff confirmed that the assessment in this section was still current. The rehabilitation
  need in the city has not changed significantly since 2009 though conditions will deteriorate over time
  as housing stock ages. During the previous 2009–2014 planning period, approximately 10 code
  enforcement cases related to substandard housing were opened. All cases have since been resolved.

   Sound                  Units that appear structurally sound and well maintained.
   Minor Repair           Units that appear structurally sound but show signs of deferred
                          maintenance or upkeep. The house may need a roof replacement or new
                          windows and a paint job.
   Moderate Repair        Involves repair or replacement of more than one rated system. This
                          category varies widely and may include, for example, a unit that needs
                          replacement of the roof, electrical system, windows and doors.
   Substantial            Replacement of several major systems, including complete or major
   Repair                 foundation work, replacement or repair of exterior siding, reconstruction
                          of the roof system and complete re-plumbing.
   Dilapidated            All the rated systems need repair and making those repairs to bring the
                          structure into compliance with the current Uniform Building Code would
                          not be cost-effective.

  HOUSEHOLD INCOME
  For the purpose of evaluating housing affordability, housing need, and eligibility for housing
  assistance, income levels are defined by guidelines adopted each year by the California Department
  of Housing and Community Development. For San Luis Obispo County, the applicable median
  income for a family of four in 2014 is $77,000.
  HCD has defined the following income categories for San Luis Obispo County, based on the
  median income for a household of four persons:
      Extremely low income: 30 percent and below ($0 to $22,600)
      Very low income: 31 to 50 percent of median income ($22,601 to $37,700)
      Low income: 51 to 80 percent of median income ($37,701 to $60,300)
      Moderate income: 81 to 120 percent of median income ($60,301 to $92,400)
      Above moderate income: 120 percent or more of median income ($92,401 or more)
  Table 19 shows the maximum annual income level for each income group adjusted for household
  size for San Luis Obispo County. The maximum annual income data is then used to calculate the
  maximum affordable housing payments for different households (varying by income level) and their
  eligibility for federal housing assistance.

 HOUSING COSTS AND AFFORDABILITY
 The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems faced by lower- and
 moderate-income households in a community. If housing costs are high relative to household
 income, correspondingly the incidence of housing cost burden and overcrowding will be high. This
 section summarizes the cost and affordability of housing to Morro Bay residents.
 Sales Cost
 According to DataQuick, the median home sale price in Morro Bay was $429,500 in 2013, an
 increase of approximately 14 percent from the 2012 median of $376,000. Median prices in Morro
 Bay tend to be in the middle to low range when compared to other San Luis Obispo communities,
 and are just above the county average. Table 21 shows median home sales prices in Morro Bay and
 nearby communities for 2012 and 2013. Assuming a 5.75 percent interest rate and 10 percent down
 payment, a family of four would need to make approximately $115,000 to afford a $376,000 house.
 A median priced home in Morro Bay is only affordable to families with “above moderate” income
 levels.

  Rental Housing Cost
  Examining the rental housing market is a direct means to identifying rental price information. Rents
  are ultimately determined by the interaction of supply and demand within the housing market. The
  two most significant factors contributing to rental prices are location and amenities. Morro Bay’s
  close proximity to the ocean makes it a high-demand location in which to reside, causing rental costs
  to increase as the demand increases. Table 22 provides samples of “typical” rental housing in the
  Morro Bay area as identified through a point-in-time survey conducted in March 2014.

  Although the monthly cost of rental housing is important, most landlords require the first and last
  month rental payment plus a security deposit prior to moving in. Many landlords require a minimum
  monthly income of up to three times the monthly rent. There may also be requirements for deposits
  to connect to services such as water and electricity and possibly extra charges for additional people
  or pets. Due to these factors, often the actual cost of moving into a rental unit is a greater burden.

 According to the 2014 HCD income limits (Table 23), a very low-income household of four could
 afford up to $943 a month for rent. If this household lived in a three-bedroom unit in Morro Bay,
 according to the rental survey, this household would be paying between $1,900 and $2,150. A
 household earning 50 percent of the area median income would need to allocate nearly 60 percent of
 their gross income to be able to afford the rent for the least expensive three-bedroom unit in Morro
 Bay. This indicates a need for more affordable housing for households in the extremely low-, very
 low-, and low-income ranges in the city.
 Housing Affordability by Income Level
 Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of renting or owning a home with the
 maximum affordable housing cost to households at different income levels. The area median income
 provides a benchmark for estimating the affordability of housing and the ability of newcomers to
 move into the community. Taken together, this information can generally demonstrate who can
 afford what size and type of housing and indicate the type of households most likely to experience
 overcrowding or a burden on housing cost.
 In evaluating affordability, the maximum affordable price refers to the maximum amount that could
 be afforded by households in the upper range of their respective income category. Households in
 the lower end of each category can afford less in comparison. The maximum affordable home and
 rental prices for residents of San Luis Obispo County are shown in Table 23. The affordability of
 the county’s housing stock for each income group is discussed below. HCD has identified the 2014
 county area median income to be $77,000 for a family of four.
 Table 23 shows the maximum rents and sales prices, respectively, that are affordable to extremely
 low-, very low-, low-, moderate-, and above moderate-income households. Affordability is based on
 the following assumptions: a household spending 30 percent or less of their total household income
 for shelter; the maximum household income levels established by the US Department of Housing
 and Urban Development (HUD) and HCD; and maximum affordable sales prices based on 10
 percent down with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage at a 5.75 percent annual interest rate.

 Overpayment
 Overpayment compares the total shelter cost for a household to the ability of that household to pay.
 Specifically, overpayment is defined as monthly shelter costs in excess of 30 percent of a
 household’s income. Shelter cost is defined as the monthly owner costs (mortgages, deed of trust,
 contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property and taxes, insurance on the property, and
 utilities) or the gross rent (contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities).
 Table 24 shows to what extent occupied housing units (households) are overpaying for housing cost
 by their income category and whether or not they were overpaying. As of 2011, 43 percent of all
 households were overpaying based on their income categories. More than half of these overpaying
 households are in the low-, very low-, or extremely low–income category.

 The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) was developed by HUD to assist
 jurisdictions in writing their consolidated plans. According to this data (Table 25), there were 395
 owner households and 770 renter households earning less than 50 percent of the median family
 income (MFI) in the city in 2010. Approximately 76 percent of these lower-income renter-occupied
 households were identified as having at least one of four housing problems (which include
 incomplete kitchen facilities, incomplete plumbing facilities, more than one person per room, and a

  occupied households experienced at least one of those four housing problems. It is important to
  note that, similar to ACS data, the CHAS dataset uses small samples and is subject to large margins

  SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
  Certain groups have greater difficulty in finding acceptable, affordable housing due to special
  circumstances relating to employment and income, household characteristics, and disabilities, among
  others. These “special needs” groups include seniors, persons with disabilities, large households,
  single-parent households (female-headed households with children, in particular), homeless persons,
  and agricultural workers. This section discusses the housing needs facing each group, as well as
  programs and services available to address the housing needs.
  Persons with Disabilities
  Table 26 shows the 2000 Census information regarding non-institutionalized people in Morro Bay
  who have disabilities that either prevent them from working or make self-care or mobility difficult.
  Generally, disabled persons constitute 10 percent of any given population; in Morro Bay, the
  percentage is slightly higher at 20 percent (2,162 persons). Since there is no DOF, 2010 US Census,
  or reliable ACS data, 2000 US Census information is used for this analysis.

 There are two major housing problems facing disabled persons: (1) the need for housing that meets
 particular physical needs (wheelchair accessible, etc.) and (2) monetary needs. Because of limited job
 opportunities for the handicapped and disabled, their incomes are often below the median income.

 The disabled or handicapped residents of Morro Bay have varying housing needs depending on the
 nature and severity of the disability. Physically disabled persons generally require modifications to
 their housing units such as wheelchair ramps, elevators or lifts, wide doorways, accessible cabinets,
 and modified fixtures and appliances. If the disability prevents the person from operating a vehicle,
CITY OF MORRO BAY                                                                              JUNE 2014

  then proximity to services and access to public transportation are important. Severely physically
  disabled persons may also require nursing or care facilities.
  If the physical disability prevents the individual from working or limits income, the cost of housing
  and needed modification can be significant. Because physical handicaps vary, this group rarely
  congregates toward a single service organization and makes estimating the number of individuals
  and specific needs difficult.
  The physical modification of housing is not generally necessary to accommodate mentally disabled
  persons, but they will generally require special services and monetary support. Since jobs and
  incomes are often limited for such individuals, affordable housing is important. Many mentally
  disabled persons would prefer to live independently, but because of monetary circumstances they are
  forced to live with other family members or with roommates. This may cause additional stress and
  problems. In some instances, the need for a resident assistant to help deal with crisis or challenging
  situations may also create special housing demands. This would suggest that there is a need for some
  apartment or condominium complexes which are reserved exclusively for persons requiring extra
  assistance in dealing with their daily routines. Many mentally handicapped persons are unable to
  drive, so access to public transportation is also important.
  Disabled elderly often fall into one or both of the above categories. Many elderly have some minor
  physical handicap. For instance, climbing stairs may be difficult, especially when carrying groceries
  or other bulky items. Other elderly persons may have difficulty cooking, cleaning, performing daily
  chores, or remembering to take medication. Congregate care facilities and retirement homes help
  meet the needs of many of these individuals.
  Persons with Developmental Disabilities
  Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires the City to include the needs of individuals with a developmental
  disability within the community in the special housing needs analysis. According to Section 4512 of
  the Welfare and Institutions Code, a “developmental disability” means a disability that originates
  before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and
  constitutes a substantial disability for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral
  palsy, epilepsy, and autism.
  Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently in a conventional housing
  environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment where
  supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
  environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
  disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
  disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
  independence as an adult.
  The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
  services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental disabilities and their families through
  a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based

 point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities. The center is a private,
 nonprofit community agency that contracts with local businesses to offer a wide range of services to
 individuals with developmental disabilities and their families. Table 28 provides information about
 Morro Bay’s population of developmentally disabled persons; Table 29 provides information about

 A number of housing types are appropriate for people living with a development disability: rent-
 subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary housing, Section 8
 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of
 housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of
 group living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are important in
 serving this special needs group. Incorporating “barrier-free” design in all new multi-family housing
 (as required by California and federal fair housing laws) is especially important to provide the widest
 range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be given to the
 affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
 In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with developmental disabilities, the City will
 implement programs to coordinate housing activities and outreach with the Tri-Counties Regional
 Center and encourage housing providers to designate a portion of new affordable housing
 developments for persons with disabilities, especially persons with developmental disabilities, and
 pursue funding sources designated for persons with special needs and disabilities. Program H-19.1
 is proposed to specifically address the needs of the developmentally disabled.

  Elderly
  Analysis of the housing needs of the elderly is important for three reasons: (1) many elderly have
  fixed, limited incomes, (2) many elderly persons are “over-housed” (living alone in a three- or four-
  bedroom house), and (3) because some elderly have mobility and health problems, these needs can
  create special housing requirements.

 Farmworkers
 The ACS 2007–2011 Five-Year Estimates identified 96 residents of Morro Bay employed in
 agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, or mining operations. Because of Morro Bay’s role as a
 significant commercial fishing center, this information is not surprising. This number, however,
 probably underestimates migrant farmworkers who move with the seasons according to the
 availability of work. There are still several large tracts of productive agricultural land within and near
 the Morro Bay city limits that periodically employ such workers. It is not clear where migrant
 workers live while employed in the Morro Bay area.
 According to information provided by the Employment Development Department for the San Luis
 Obispo-Paso Robles Metropolitan Statistical Area, there were 3,600 people employed within the
 agriculture industry in January 2014, a decrease of 100 people since January 2013.
 Large Households
 Large families present special housing needs if they cannot find affordable and adequate housing
 units. The result may be overcrowding. As identified in Table 12 above, 113 households
 (approximately 2 percent of all households) in Morro Bay were occupied by five or more persons
 (considered a large household) of which 39 were owner-occupied households and 74 were renter-
 occupied households. This proportion is substantially lower than in the county as a whole and is
 very low when compared to other cities and counties. Thus, housing for large families does not
 appear to be a significant need in Morro Bay.
 Female-Headed Households
 Female-headed single-parent households experience numerous housing problems, including
 affordability (the individuals are often on public assistance), overcrowding (the individuals often
 cannot afford units large enough to accommodate their families), insufficient housing choices, and
 discrimination. The City of Morro Bay recognizes these problems and has included policies and
 programs in this document to address affordability, overcrowding, and discrimination for all
 segments of the population.
 Table 32 illustrates the number of family households that are headed by a female with no husband
 present. Female-headed households with no husband present account for 14 percent of all
 households in the city. The table also reports the presence of children in female-headed households,
 as well as poverty indicators for female-headed households. Female-headed householders with their
 own children make up approximately five percent of all householders in the city (as shown in the
 table below) and 37 percent of the female-headed householders.

  Homeless
  According to HUD’s 2012 Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Programs (as provided by the
  HCD SLO County Housing Element Update Data Profile), the County of San Luis Obispo has
  approximately 2,057 homeless persons (Table 33). Of these homeless persons, approximately 343
  are in families with at least one child. The homeless population is mostly unsheltered, with only 8
  percent of the 2,057 identified as sheltered. The Community Action Partnership of San Luis Obispo
  County (CAPSLO) provided 2013 estimates of the Maxine Lewis Memorial Shelter and Prado Day
  center population by home community. At these two shelters, approximately 54 people call Morro
  Bay home.

 Regional services for the homeless include Chorro Creek Ranch, which serves the South County
 area that includes Morro Bay and provides a range of services such as emergency shelter, counseling
 services, and rental assistance. The Estero Bay Alliance for Care is an all-volunteer network of
 organizations and individuals dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for local homeless and in-
 need citizens through outreach, education, and liaison with appropriate agencies and organizations.
 The CAPSLO emergency shelter and services center, located near the intersection of Broad Street
 and Orcutt Road in San Luis Obispo, provides emergency shelter, on-site information and referral
 services, and assistance in finding permanent housing. The People’s Kitchen, the Salvation Army
 Homeless Outreach program, the Senior Nutrition program, which provides meals to seniors over
 the age of 60 up to five times a week, and other programs offered by local churches are also
 available. The City also participates with two county wide boards, the SLO County Housing Trust
 Fund Commission and the SLO County Homeless Services Oversight Council (HSOC).The City of
 San Luis Obispo is centrally located and it is appropriate that services for homeless individuals be
 located there. San Luis Obispo is the county seat; many governmental social services can be received
 there. Additional service providers include the El Camino Homeless Coalition in Atascadero, Loaves
 and Fishes in Paso Robles, the 5 Cities Coalition in Arroyo Grande, and Transitional Food and
 Shelter in the North County.
 To further assist with providing homelessness services, Morro Bay’s City Council has approved a
 temporary fee waiver for a local group serving a free weekly meal at the city’s Veterans Memorial
 Building. The decision covers an estimated $2,000 in city rental fees for the building through June
 30, 2014.
 Assisted Units
 As shown in Table 35, Morro Bay contains four assisted housing developments owned by People’s
 Self-Help Housing (PSHH) that provide 95 affordable housing units. The City has utilized various
 funding sources to provide affordable housing to residents, including Section 8, Section 202, Section
 515, and tax credits. PSHH is currently in negotiations with the tax credit investors for both
 Oceanside Gardens and Sequoia Street Apartments to facilitate maintaining their role as general
 partner. PSHH is also currently applying to HUD for approving a plan to refinance Ocean View
 Manor using tax credit syndication and a renewed HUD contract, through which PSHH plans to
 rehabilitate and continue to operate the property as affordable. If these negotiations are successful
 the length of the deed restriction would be extended on this property. These three properties
 continue to operate as affordable, and PSHH communicated that they do not plan to experience any
 interruption in offering affordable rents to the tenants.
 The Housing Authority of San Luis Obispo (HASLO) reported that as of March 2014, the City of
 Morro Bay had 79 Section 8 vouchers being used in the city. HASLO also reported that due to too
 much interest, the waitlist for Section 8 vouchers has been closed since 2010.

  At-Risk Units
  California housing element law requires all jurisdictions to include a study of all low-income housing
  units which may at some future time be lost to the affordable inventory by the expiration of some
  type of affordability restrictions. The law requires that the analysis and study cover a 10-year period
  beginning at the start of the Housing Element planning period, so June 30, 2014 through June 30,
  2024.
  At-risk units are subsidized low-income housing projects that may be convertible to market-rate
  units as they are nearing the end of their subsidized contract. Such units are deemed “at risk” of
  being lost as affordable housing. Currently there are not any subsidized housing units considered at
  risk of converting to market-rate units within 10 years of the beginning of this Housing Element
  planning period. However, Program H-15.1 states that the City will maintain a list of all dwellings
  within the city that are subsidized by government funding or low-income housing developed
  through local regulations or incentives and that the City will contact all property owners and ask
  them to provide at least two years’ notice prior to the conversion of any units for lower-income
  households to market-rate units.

 3. ADEQUATE SITES INVENTORY
 The San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG) is responsible for developing the
 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), which assigns a share of the region’s future housing
 need to each jurisdiction in the region. State law requires jurisdictions to demonstrate that “adequate
 sites” will be made available over the planning period (2014–2019) to facilitate and encourage a
 sufficient level of new housing production. Jurisdictions must also demonstrate that appropriate
 zoning and development standards, as well as services and facilities, will be in place to facilitate and
 encourage housing. The Housing Element must inventory land suitable for residential development,
 including vacant and underutilized sites, and analyzes the relationship of zoning and public facilities
 and services to these sites.
 In complying with the adequate site requirement, jurisdictions can take credit for the number of new
 units built during the planning period of 2014–2019 toward the RHNA. This includes new housing
 units either built or issued a certificate of occupancy since January 1, 2014.
 Regional Housing Needs Allocation
 An important component of the Housing Element is the identification of sites for future housing
 development and evaluation of the adequacy of these sites in fulfilling Morro Bay’s share of the
 Regional Housing Needs Allocation, as determined by SLOCOG. The intent of the RHNA is to
 ensure that local jurisdictions address their fair share of the housing needs for the entire region.
 Additionally, a major goal of the RHNA is to ensure that every community provides an opportunity
 for a mix of affordable housing to all economic segments of its population. The RHNA
 jurisdictional allocations are made to ensure that adequate sites and zoning are provided to address
 existing and anticipated housing demands during the planning period and that market forces are not
 inhibited in addressing the housing needs for all facets of a particular community. Table 36 provides
 the RHNA target for the planning period 2014 to 2019.

          HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
  Based on the above projections, the City of Morro Bay will need to allow for 63 housing units
  affordable to lower-income households to comply with the City’s regional allocation targets for
  these income levels. In addition, the City will allow for 27 housing units available to moderate-
  income households. A total of 155 new housing units have been allocated by HCD for the City of
  Morro Bay from 2014 through 2019.
  As of March 2014, there have not been any housing units constructed, but six single-family units
  have been approved. As a result, the City will need an additional 149 housing units to meet Morro
  Bay’s 2014–2019 RHNA. However, the City currently has the vacant land capacity to accommodate
  all of the RHNA need. See Table 38 for a complete list of available sites to meet the City’s 2014–
  2019 RHNA.
  Land Availability
  This section provides the inventory of vacant land that is available in Morro Bay for both multi-
  family and single-family residential development. Table 38 provides the number of acres, zoning,
  unit potential, and availability of infrastructure for all vacant acreage not earmarked for pending
  projects in Morro Bay. All sites listed in Table 38 have no known constraints related to
  infrastructure or environmental conditions.
  Realistic Capacity
  The zoning districts and General Plan land use designations are shown for each site and are used to
  determine the realistic unit capacity of each site. Realistic capacity was determined by multiplying the
  number of acres by the maximum density for the site, and then 80 percent of that result was used as
  the final realistic unit number to account for site and regulatory constraints. The capacity for the 10
  mixed-use sites included in the inventory was determined by taking 80 percent of the total site
  acreage, multiplying the acreage by the maximum density for the site, and then taking 80 percent of
  that number to determine the realistic unit number.
  The Mixed Commercial/Residential (MCR) zoned sites require a ratio of fifty percent commercial
  and fifty percent residential development. However, a conservative approach is taken to realistic
  capacity on the sites zoned MCD/R-4 in the land inventory and 80 percent of the allowed density
  on 50 percent of the site was use to estimate realistic units. In limited cases the City Council may
  make findings to approve a greater percentage of residential development in this zone. The City
  approved an affordable project at Main at Bonita, which proposed 23 units be developed on 1.14
  acres in the Mixed Commercial/Residential (MCR)/Multi-family Residential-Hotel-Professional
  (R-4) district. This project was developed with 100 percent residential units at 20 units to the acre.
  Small Sites
  A majority of the vacant parcels that allow up to 27 units per acre are less than a half acre in size,
  and it can be difficult to build multi-family, lower-income housing on smaller sites. However, recent
  trends show that multi-family housing development is occurring on sites of less than one-half acre.
JUNE 2014                                                                          CITY OF MORRO BAY

                                                   HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
 For the high-density sites listed in Table 38, each of the site groups 4–6, 21-22, 24-25, and 28-30,
 contiguous. Of the total units the City assumes can be developed on high-density land (260 units),
 86 units or 33 percent or the units are being accommodated on sites that have potential for lot
 consolidation into larger sites more feasible for development of affordable housing. To help
 facilitate the development of affordable housing on smaller lots, the City has included Program
 H-1.2 to assist in the consolidation of small lots.
 Table 37 compares the City of Morro Bay’s RHNA to the site inventory capacity. Including the
 credit of six building permits and the site inventory capacity, the City has a surplus of 151 units
 available to extremely low-, very low-, low, and moderate-income households, and 300 units
 available to above moderate-income households, a total surplus of 451 units. Table 38 provides the
 characteristics of the available sites for the development of single-family homes and multi-family
 units, and Figure 3, the Land Inventory Map, shows the location of each site.

   INFRASTRUCTURE
   Water
   The City’s Annual Water Report, dated 2013, reports that the City relies on three sources of water:
   groundwater pumped from the Chorro and Morro basins, the reverse osmosis/desalinization plant,
   and the primary source since 1997, the State Water Project, to meet its current and future needs. The
   historic statewide drought of 2014 has stressed these water sources. For example, on January 31,
   2014, San Luis Obispo County staff informed the State Water Project subcontractors that the
   allocation for 2014 is at 0 percent, and only stored water is available to meet delivery requests, the
   delivery amount was subsequently increased to a five percent delivery, by DWR. The City of Morro
   Bay has approximately 3,073 acre-feet of water stored in San Luis Reservoir. Prolonged severe
   drought conditions could constrain development, although the constraint would not be specific to
   Morro Bay.
   The water production trend has actually decreased as population increased over the past 20 years
   because of an aggressive water conservation program enacted by the City. In 1985, the City initiated
   a retrofit program that requires all new development to replace old water fixtures such as toilets and
   sinks with newer models that use less water. The program required that for every gallon of water
   needed by new development, two gallons must be saved through retrofitting. The City Council
   terminated the mandatory program in 2001 and replaced it with a voluntary rebate program that
   promotes water conservation by reimbursing owners for purchasing water-saving fixtures. The
   retrofit program has resulted in a decrease in the average consumption to about 117 gallons per
   person per day. This use rate is quite low compared to San Luis Obispo County as a whole.
   The City of Morro Bay updated its Water Management Plan, which identifies resources and
   establishes priorities for long-term water supply, and obtained certification from the California
   Coastal Commission. In December 2008, the City Council reviewed the conditions of the
   community’s long-term potable water supply and as a result approved the Water Management Plan
   Status Report. This report looked at “any changes in climatic, hydrological, technological, or political
   conditions that could affect the City’s long-term water supply whether negatively or positively.” It
   was determined that there is adequate water for the buildout of the city under the current General
   Plan. The City has sufficient rights to water supply from a variety of sources to meet its buildout
   goals, including the State Water Project, local groundwater sources, and the City's desalinization
   plant. There are times, such as when State Water Project water delivery is restricted, that the City
   has operational difficulty meeting its short term water demands and requires water conservation and
   other means such as building limitations in order to bridge these temporary water shortages. At their
   May 13, 2014 meeting the City did modify the Water Allocations by adopting Resolution No.32-14,
   which requires either a two to one offset for new water allocations or the payment of an in-lieu fee.
   Additionally, while the City does have sufficient legal rights to the groundwater in the Morro and
   Chorro aquifers, the water quality has been severely degraded by nitrate contamination from
   primarily upstream agricultural operations. The City is currently working with the Regional Water
   Quality Control Board to determine if there are any other potential sources that significantly

  contribute to the Nitrate pollution. In order to use the high nitrate groundwater treatment by
  reverse osmosis or blending is required. Furthermore, while the City’s desalinization plant is
  permitted, the City is working the California Coastal Commission to permit the salt water feed wells
  and the plant’s outfall which had its five year permit expire in the late 1999. From 2003 to 2013,
  water production has decreased from 1,421 acre-feet to 1, 271 acre-feet. The City is committed to
  providing affordable and sustainable water to Morro Bay, and the Water Management Plan outlined
  steps to be taken to ensure the acquisition of such resources. Of the 13 measures required by the
  plan, six represented specific projects to be completed (such as permit acquisition) and seven are
  ongoing tasks (such as implementation of conservation programs). Since the adoption of the plan,
  the six projects have been completed and the seven programs successfully implemented to fulfill the
  plan’s goals.
  To comply with Senate Bill 1087, the City will immediately forward its adopted Housing Element to
  its water and wastewater providers so they can grant priority for service allocations to proposed
  developments that include units affordable to lower-income households.
  Sewer
  The City of Morro Bay currently jointly owns and operates the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
  with the unincorporated community of Cayucos. According to the Wastewater Treatment Plant
  Master Plan (2007), the WTTP is rated for an average dry weather flow of 2.06 million gallons per
  day (mgd), a peak seasonal dry weather flow of 2.36 mgd, and a peak hour flow of 6.6 mgd. During
  the development of the facilities master plan for the proposed upgrade project that was previously
  under consideration it was determined that the flows were overestimated and therefore the average
  daily flow was reduced to approximately 1.6 mgd, but still was to be designed with a peak wet
  weather capacity of 8.1 mgd. Should the community of Cayucos and the City of Morro Bay
  continue to rely on the same facility, these will be the flows that the new facility is designed to treat.
  Otherwise Morro Bay will operate a facility designed to treat the flows contributed by the
  incorporated City.
  According to the annual daily flow average over five years, Morro Bay contributes approximately 75
  percent of the flow, while Cayucos accounts for the remainder. The plant has adequate capacity
  through the year 2021 based on population estimates outlined in the Facility Master Plan Report and
  therefore currently has capacity to meet the regional housing need. The plant currently treats
  approximately 1 million gallons per day. The City is currently proposing to relocate and upgrade its
  WWTP to a water reclamation facility (WRF). With this upgrade there is the potential to add
  additional (recycled) water into the City’s water supply portfolio, either in the form of offsetting use
  of potable water for irrigation with reclaimed water, ground water recharge or perhaps direct potable
  reuse of water once there has been a change in the regulatory environment and public perception.
  The WRF is expected to be online and operating in late 2019.

   4. CONSTRAINTS
   Various interrelated factors can constrain the ability of the private and public sectors to provide
   adequate housing and meet the housing needs for all economic segments of the community. These
   factors can be divided into two categories: (1) governmental and (2) non-governmental constraints.
   Governmental constraints consist of land use controls, development standards, processing fees,
   development impact fees, code enforcement, site improvement costs, development permit and
   approval processing, and provision for a variety of housing. Non-governmental constraints consist
   of land availability, the environment, vacancy rates, land cost, construction costs, and availability of
   financing.
   GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
   Governmental constraints include local land use controls, on- and off-site development standards,
   building and housing codes, permit processing times, permit processing fees, residential
   development fees, and delays in permit processing that can cause increases in financing cost.
   Local Land Use Controls
   The city’s location in the coastal zone has resulted in unique land and use regulations. The California
   Coastal Act attempts to balance landowners’ rights to develop against the public’s right to enjoy the
   coastline. In some areas of Morro Bay, height restrictions have been enacted to protect public views
   and large setback requirements have been established to protect bluff areas near the beach.
   Generally the minimum parcel size, allowed density, setback requirements, and height limits for
   residential uses are not unusually strict and therefore are not considered a constraint to the
   development of affordable housing.
   General Plan Designations
   To provide for a wide range of existing land uses and to guide future development, the City has
   established a series of land use classifications or categories. These classifications describe the type
   and intensity of various land uses that make up the city’s fabric and are the basis for the zoning
   districts established in the Municipal Code. The land use classifications represent the integration of
   the Land Use Element of the General Plan and the Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan.
   Residential Land Uses
   The City has five residential land use categories that provide for a wide range of densities. The
   purpose is to ensure that residential land is developed to a density suitable to its location and
   physical characteristics.

  Density ranges are as follows:
     Limited Density: up to 2 units per acre
     Low Density: up to 4 units per acre
     Low-Medium Density: 4 to 7 units per acre
     Medium Density: 7 to 15 units per acre
     High Density: 15 to 27 units per acre
  Zoning Ordinance
  The Zoning Ordinance provisions allow development on a wide variety of lot sizes in the city and
  do not constrain the development of affordable units. Table 39 describes the zoning districts that
  allow residential uses in the city.

  Development Standards
  Development standards within the city should not pose any constraints to the development of
  affordable housing. Minimum lot area required per unit decreases with the higher-density zoning
  districts and will provide opportunities for lower-income housing. Morro Bay has established special
  standards to accommodate for smaller lots formed before the city’s incorporation. Morro Bay’s
  Zoning Ordinance poses no extraordinary constraints on any form of residential development. The
  City can demonstrate that its development standards are not a constraint to the development of
  housing based on a few recent multi-family projects, in which four of the five projects have an
  affordable component to them:
     A 21-unit rental senior affordable housing project at 555 Main Street was approved by the City
      Council in 2010 in the C-1/R-4 (Mixed Use Commercial) district. The project will provide very
      low- and low-income units. The density will be 53 units per acre based on two different density
      bonuses granted.
     A project at 600 Morro Bay Boulevard was developed on 0.39 acres and contained 16 units (13
      residential and 3 commercial units). This project was developed in the Central Business (C-1)
      district, which allows mixed-use or solely development. Since there was an affordable
      component to this project, the City was flexible with development standards. This project was
      built at 41 units per acre. The project included one affordable (moderate) unit.
     A project at Main at Bonita contains 23 units to be developed on 1.14 acres in the Mixed
      Commercial Residential (MCR)/Multi-family Residential-Hotel-Professional (R-4) district. This
      project also has an affordable component, showing that the developers are able to meet
      sufficient densities to develop affordable units. This project was developed with 100 percent
      residential units at 20 units to the acre.
     A project at Main and South developed in the Duplex Residential (R-2) zone was developed on
      3 acres and contained 30 units. The density was 10 units per acre. Three affordable units were
      provided offsite on Sunset.
     A project built at 476 Rockview Street contained two units and was built on 0.11 acres in the
      Multi-Family Residential-Hotel-Professional (R-4) district, resulting in a density of 17.4 units per
      acre.
  In conclusion, after evaluating the projects that have been approved/proposed in Morro Bay, the
  City’s development standards do not pose a constraint to development or affordable development.

   The greatest constraint to development in Morro Bay is the cost of land, which is market driven.
   The City of Morro Bay has attempted to adopt development standards that provide modest control
   over development as well as providing opportunities for projects to reduce standards via planned
   developments, compact development, or variable density projects. By providing flexibility in the
   development standards, the City allows greater opportunities for projects to achieve maximum
   density yet still provides for development projects to meet the City’s overall adopted goals. The City
   provides incentives for projects that meet maximum densities.
   The City’s height limitation is primarily utilized to control the size and bulk of single-family units. As
   stated above, single-family units are the bulk of the residential units constructed. A trend developed
   in recent years where larger and taller single-family homes were proposed, which would have
   resulted in units that were not consistent with existing neighborhoods. To address this issue, the City
   adopted an emergency ordinance (Ordinance No. 543), requiring that any single-family unit
   proposed over 2,500 square feet in size would require a conditional use permit. However the City
   does not utilize the height limit in an attempt to restrict projects from achieving maximum density.
   Multi-family structures as well as mixed-use structures utilizing the City’s planned development
   permitting process can request that the height standard be modified. This development standard is
   specifically identified in the Zoning Ordinance as being eligible to be waived.
   Although the City does not see the current development standards as a constraint to the
   development of housing, to ensure that multi-family projects are able to meet maximum densities
   and generally to ensure that development standards do not constrain the development of multi-
   family housing, the City has included Program H-1.3 which states that the City will continue to
   allow flexibility in development standards such as height, parking, and setbacks for multi-family
   projects.
   Parking Standards
   The City requires off-street parking for all new housing projects. These parking regulations do not
   impact the ability to construct housing. In order to reduce development costs for low-income
   projects, reductions in parking standards are allowed. Parking reductions may include allowing
   tandem parking, paying an in-lieu fee, and shared parking between commercial and residential uses.
   Further standards reductions are permitted for senior housing and housing for the disabled to
   promote these types of housing. Therefore, parking standards tend to encourage the construction of
   low-income and elderly housing by reducing the development costs and land area necessary to
   construct off-street parking.

     Notes: Properties adjacent to bluffs and ESH zones are subject to additional height and setback requirements. The standards in this table present the
     most strict requirements for each category for each zone; however, some of the standards may be lower depending on certain property characteristics
     including lot size, building size, and proximity to other zoning designations. For a complete description of residential zoning criteria, see Title 17
     (Zoning) of the Morro Bay Municipal Code.

   Planned Development Overlay Zone
   The purpose of the Planned Development (PD) overlay zone is to provide detailed and substantial
   analysis of development on parcels which, because of location, size, or public ownership, warrant
   special review. This overlay zone is also intended to allow the modification of or exemption from
   the development standards of the primary zone that would otherwise apply if such action would
   result in better design or other public benefit.
   The requirements and procedures apply to all properties that have, in addition to a primary or base
   zone district, the Planned Development (PD) overlay zone, unless otherwise provided in the Zoning
   Ordinance.
   Below are the permitted uses subject to the granting of a conditional use permit for a conceptual
   and/or a precise plan of development:
      Any principal or conditional use which is allowed by the primary zoning district is a permitted
       use.
      Community housing projects as defined in Chapter 17.49 of the Zoning Ordinance may be
       permitted in PD overlay residential zones. The provisions of that chapter also apply to the
       review of such PD overlay zone projects.
   The standards for development within a PD overlay zone are those of the base zoning district,
   provided, however, that standards may be modified by the Planning Commission or City Council as
   they relate to building heights, yard requirements, and minimum lot area for dwelling units in the
   density range provided that any specific design criteria of the General Plan and coastal Land Use
   Plan, applicable to the property, is not exceeded. For those areas of the city that are covered by the
   Waterfront Master Plan, all new development projects requiring discretionary permits (conditional
   use permits, etc.) must be consistent with the design guidelines contained in Chapter 5 of the
   Waterfront Master Plan. Modifications of standards will only be approved upon a finding that
   greater than normal public benefits may be achieved by such deviations. Such benefits may include,
   but are not limited to, improved or innovative site and architectural design, greater public or private
   usable open space and provisions of housing for the elderly or low/moderate-income families,
   provision of extraordinary public access, and provision for protecting ESH areas, but in all cases
   these provisions must meet the coastal land use policies.
   New development and uses may be permitted only if found to be consistent with the applicable
   policies of the Morro Bay General Plan and Local Coastal Program.
   A concept plan must be submitted and approved pursuant to Chapter 17.40 of the Zoning
   Ordinance prior to submittal of any new development, new use or change in use, or subdivisions of
   a series of two or more commonly held contiguous parcels of land, on property within a PD overlay
   zone which is publicly owned, including tidelands, or in its gross or aggregate area exceeds 1 acre.

   Concept Plan Approval. In addition to the review provisions of Chapter 17.60 of the Zoning
   Ordinance describing the processing of conditional use permits, concept plans for PD overlay zone
   properties must receive final approval from the City Council at a duly noticed public hearing. The
   Planning Commission first reviews the concept plan by conducting a public hearing. If the
   commission consideration is to approve the plan, it reports such findings and recommendation to
   the City Council. If the commission determines to deny the plan, it need not be forwarded to the
   council, and the commission decision is final unless appealed.
   Precise Plans Required. Upon approval by the City Council of a concept plan, or where no
   conceptual approval is required, a precise plan of development must be submitted to the Planning
   Commission showing the details of property improvement and uses or activities to be conducted on
   the site and any subdivision proposals. Precise plans are processed in accordance with procedures
   for a conditional use permit as contained in Chapter 17.60 of the Zoning Ordinance.
   Precise Plan Content. Plans are to be prepared containing all the general information required of
   concept plans, which has been further developed to a precise level of detail. Any data or calculations
   necessary to evaluate the precise plan proposal must accompany such plans. A precise plan is
   required to contain the following minimum information:
      Total Development Plan. The total development plan showing the precise dimensions and
       locations of proposed structures, buildings, streets, parking, yards, pathways, open spaces, and
       other public or private facilities.

  Precise Plan Approval. The Planning Commission, in granting a conditional use permit for PD
  overlay zone precise plans, must make the findings required by Section 17.60.030 of the Zoning
  Ordinance and further find that precise plans are in substantial conformance with any conceptual
  plan approval granted by the City Council.
  Growth Management
  In 1984, the City adopted a growth management ordinance (Ordinance No. 266) to allow fair
  distribution of scarce water resources and protect the city’s small-town character and surrounding
  open space. Ordinance No. 266 mandates that building permits will be limited to a number
  permitting an annual increase in population that would achieve the 12,200-person goal by the year
  2000. No further residential building will be permitted after a population of 12,200 has been reached
  unless an increase has been approved by a majority vote at a regular or special election. The City has
  not yet reached a population of 12,200. As noted in Section 2. Housing Needs Assessment, the
  City’s population in 2013 was 10,317. Annually, the City Council allocates a number of “water
  equivalency units” (WEUs), some for single-family and some for multifamily development. The
  annual number is the maximum number of permits (residential and commercial) that may be
  approved. The annual number has varied over time but has never been reached or exceeded during a
  single year, even during the years of greatest growth (2005-2007). The number of WEUs available
  per year is based on water availability. Partially in response to the current drought, the number of
  WEUs allocated for 2014 is 50, a relatively low number compared to overall trends since adoption
  of the ordinance. The City Council has the authority to roll over unused WEUs to the subsequent
  year. If the number of WEUs allocated annually from 2014 to 2019 is conservatively estimated as 50,
  which would allow the approval of a maximum of 250 residential units during the planning period,
  more than enough to accommodate the City’s RHNA of 155 units.
  Density Bonus
  On March 11, 2014, the Morro Bay City Council adopted Ordinance No. 584, which amends the
  revoked Zoning Ordinance Chapter 17.50 (Affordable Housing, Density Bonuses and Incentives)
  and replaced it in its entirety with density bonus provisions that are consistent with current state law.
  Key provisions of the new density bonus regulations include:
     New construction of five or more units may receive a density bonus provided they satisfy one or
      more of the following criteria:
           o At least 10 percent of the units are designated for low-income households.
           o At least 5 percent of the units are designated for very low-income households.
           o At least 10 percent of the units are designated for moderate-income households,
               provided that all units in the development are offered to the public for purchase.
JUNE 2014                                                                         CITY OF MORRO BAY

                                                 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
         o 100 percent of the units are designated for senior citizens as defined in Section 51.3 and
            51.12 of the Civil Code or mobile home park that limits residency based on age
            requirements for housing for older persons pursuant to Government Code Section
            798.76 or 799.5.
         o Donation of land to the City consisting of at least 1 acre, or of sufficient developable
            acreage and zoning classification to permit construction of at least 40 units, and not less
            than 10 percent of the residential units in the proposed development, that are affordable
            to very low-income households
    The density bonus will be calculated as follows:
         o A 20 percent density bonus, increasing by an additional 1.5 percent for each additional 1
            percent increase in low-income units above the initial 10 percent threshold.
         o A 20 percent density bonus, increasing by an additional 2.5 percent for each additional 1
            percent increase in very low-income units above the initial 5 percent threshold.
         o A 20 percent density bonus for senior citizen housing developments.
         o A 5 percent density bonus, increasing by an additional 1 percent for each additional 1
            percent increase in moderate-income units above the initial 10 percent threshold.
         o When an applicant proposes to construct a housing development that is eligible for a
            density bonus and includes a child-care facility that will be located on the premises of, or
            adjacent to, the housing development, the City will grant either an additional density
            bonus that is an amount of square feet of residential space that is equal to or greater than
            the square footage of the child-care facility or an additional concession or incentive that
            contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child-care
            facility.
         o The maximum density bonus is 35 percent when a project provides either 11 percent
            very low-income units, 20 percent low-income units, or 40 percent moderate-income
            units. All density bonus calculations resulting in fractional units are rounded up to the
            next whole number of housing units.
    Upon request of a developer eligible to receive a density bonus, the City will grant the following
     parking standards, inclusive of handicapped and guest parking, for the entire project:
         o Zero- to one-bedroom units – 1 on-site parking space per unit
         o Two-bedroom units or more – 2 on-site parking spaces per unit

     The City may also provide other incentives for the development of affordable housing including
      reduced site development standards, deferred or waived fees, direct financial aid, and other
      regulatory developer incentives.
     Where affordable housing units have been provided per the requirements of Chapter 17.50, the
      developer must ensure both the continued availability of affordable units for a minimum of 30
      years and project phasing, including timing of completion, and rental or sale of affordable
      housing units is required to occur concurrently with nonrestricted units.
  Provisions for a Variety of Housing
  Housing element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made available
  through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various
  types of housing for all economic segments of the population. This includes single-family housing,
  multi-family housing, manufactured housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, and transitional
  housing, among others. Table 41 summarizes those housing types.

   Notes:
   1. Permitted only when affordable to low- and/or moderate-income families.
   2. Residential care facilities serving 6 or fewer persons are permitted in all residential districts by right,
   larger group homes of more than 6 and up to 12 persons requires a minor use permit, and facilities serving
   more than 12 persons require a conditional use permit.
   Emergency Shelters
   The California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as “housing
   with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or
   less by a homeless person. No individual or households may be denied emergency shelter because of
   an inability to pay.”
   Legislation (Senate Bill 2 (Cedillo, 2007)) requires jurisdictions to allow emergency shelters and
   supportive and transitional housing without a conditional use permit. The City’s Zoning Ordinance
   currently allows emergency shelters pursuant to a conditional use permit. The City must identify a

  zone(s) where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit
  or other discretionary permit. The zone or zones identified must have land available to
  accommodate an emergency shelter.
  On March 11, 2014, the Morro Bay City Council adopted Ordinance No. 584, which amends the
  Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters by right in the Central Business (C-1) district. The
  C-1 district is close to services (shopping and public services) and transit stops. Within this zone, the
  City has identified 3 acres on two parcels of land located next to each other that will allow adequate
  capacity for the provision of an emergency shelter.
  Supportive and Transitional Housing
  Supportive housing is defined by Section 50675.14 of the Health and Safety Code as housing with
  linked on-site or off-site services with no limit on the length of stay and that is occupied by a target
  population as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 53260 (i.e., low-income person with mental
  disabilities, AIDS, substance abuse or chronic health conditions, or persons whose disabilities
  originated before the age of 18). Services linked to supportive housing usually focuses on retaining
  housing, living and working in the community, and/or health improvement.
  Transitional housing is defined in Health and Safety Code Section 50675.2 as rental housing for
  stays of at least six months but where the units are recirculated to another program recipient after a
  set period. It may be designated for a homeless individual or family transitioning to permanent
  housing. This housing can take many structural forms such as group housing and multi-family units
  and may include supportive services to allow individuals to gain necessary life skills in support of
  independent living.
  Pursuant to Senate Bill (SB) 2, transitional and supportive housing types are required to be treated as
  residential uses and subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same
  type in the same zone. On March 11, 2014, the Morro Bay City Council adopted Ordinance No.
  584, which amends the Zoning Ordinance to add the current definition of transitional housing and
  supportive housing, as stated in this document, and lists these as permitted uses in all zoning
  districts allowing residential uses.
  Extremely Low-Income Households
  Extremely low-income households typically comprise persons with special housing needs, including
  but not limited to persons experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, persons with
  substance abuse problems, and farmworkers. Assembly Bill 2634 (Lieber, 2006) requires the
  quantification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs of extremely low-income
  households. Housing elements must also identify zoning to encourage and facilitate supportive
  housing and single-room occupancy units (SROs).
  On March 11, 2014, the Morro Bay City Council adopted Ordinance No. 584, which amends the
  Zoning Ordinance to explicitly define and allow single-room occupancy units in the Central
JUNE 2014                                                                         CITY OF MORRO BAY

   Business (C-1) and Mixed Commercial/Residential (MCR) districts. In addition, Program H-3.1
   states that the City will continue to work with the private sector, nonprofit agencies, and to secure
   funds through state and federal programs for development of new lower-income housing and
   rehabilitation of existing lower-income households. As funding becomes available, the City will
   prioritize a portion of the funds to encourage the development of housing for extremely low-income
   households.
   Housing for Farmworkers
   On March 11, 2014, the Morro Bay City Council adopted Ordinance No. 584, which amends the
   Zoning Ordinance to remove constraints to housing for farmworkers. The Zoning Ordinance now
   defines “employee housing” as housing that includes but is not limited to farmworker housing.
   Employee housing for six or fewer workers will be deemed to be a single-family structure with a
   residential land use and will be treated the same as a single-family dwelling of the same type in the
   same zone. The permitted occupancy in employee housing in a zone allowing agricultural uses will
   include agricultural employees who do not work on the property where the employee housing is
   located, and may consist of no more than 36 beds in a group quarters or 12 units or spaces designed
   for use by a single family or household on land zoned for agricultural uses. Such employee housing
   is considered to be an activity that in no way differs from an agricultural use. Ordinance No. 584
   also amended Chapter 17.24 of the Zoning Ordinance to allow employee housing with a maximum
   of 36 beds in a group quarters or 12 units or spaces in the Agricultural (AG) and Suburban
   Residential (R-A) districts.
   Housing for Persons with Disabilities
   Housing for Disabled Persons
   Housing element law requires localities to include the following in the preparation and adoption of
   the housing element: (1) an analysis of potential and actual constraints on housing for persons with
   disabilities; (2) demonstration of efforts to remove governmental constraints; and (3) inclusion of
   various programs or a means of reasonable accommodations for housing designed for persons with
   disabilities. As part of the Housing Element process, the City analyzed its Land Use and Zoning
   Ordinance, permitting process (conditional use permit process and variance), development
   standards, and building codes to identify potential constraints for the development of housing.
   Where impediments are found, the Objectives, Policies, and Programs section of the Housing
   Element proposes specific actions and implementation schedules to remove such impediments. The
   following section summarizes findings from the constraint analysis and proposed programs.
   Zoning and Land Use
   State and federal housing laws encourage an inclusive living environment, where persons of all walks
   of life have the opportunity to find housing suited to their needs. The Zoning Ordinance allows a
   range of housing types and prices for special needs groups, and allows foster homes and rest homes
   pursuant to a conditional use permit. The Zoning Ordinance does not have geographical

  spacing/siting requirements for nursing homes, shelters, or foster care homes. Although these
  classifications allow special needs housing, the City currently provides housing opportunity for
  disabled persons. The City complies with state laws under the Community Care Facilities Act.
  Residential care facilities serving 6 or fewer persons are permitted in all residential districts by right,
  larger group homes of more than 6 and up to 12 persons require a minor use permit, and facilities
  serving more than 12 persons require a conditional use permit. To further comply with SB 520, the
  City defines family as one or more persons occupying premises and living as a single housekeeping
  unit who not need be related by blood as distinguished from a group occupying a hotel, club, or
  fraternity or sorority house.
  Building Codes and Development Standards
  The City enforces Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, which are regulations on access
  and adaptability of buildings to accommodate persons with disabilities. The City inspects plans to
  ensure compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. The City’s building code
  requires new residential construction to comply with the ADA, which requires design standards for
  “qualified” buildings consisting of three or more units. These requirements include the
  incorporation of (1) adaptive design features for the interior of the unit; (2) accessible public use and
  common use portions; and (3) sufficiently wider doors to allow wheelchair access. Currently, Morro
  Bay uses the 2010 edition of the California Building Code (updated every three years). The City has
  not adopted unique restrictions for disabled housing, such as minimum distances between housing
  for persons with disabilities, or other regulations that could constrain the development,
  maintenance, or alteration of housing for disabled persons. The City does not require new housing
  projects to incorporate universal design standards, which are beyond the standards required by state
  and federal law. In addition, the Zoning Ordinance does not have occupancy limitations, which are
  preempted by state law. The Zoning Ordinance also does not define a family in a way that would
  limit the number of persons per household or limit the relationship of the household members. The
  Zoning Ordinance does not specify the types of development standards for special needs housing or
  unique performance standards. However, convalescent homes and senior housing are allowed a
  reduced parking requirement of only one space for every three beds plus employee parking and half
  a space for seniors, respectively.
  Permitting Procedures
  To rehabilitate housing for disabled access, requests for modifications (e.g., ramps up to 30 inches in
  height) do not require a building permit and are processed over the counter. However, Section
  17.48.120 of the Morro Bay Municipal Code states that open, uncovered, raised porches, landing
  places, or outside stairways may project not closer than 3 feet to any side or rear lot line, and not
  exceeding 5 feet into any required front or street yard. City staff and the City Council have
  administratively allowed ramps to allow persons with disabilities access to housing. The City
  accommodates such requests by expediting the processing time for issuing a permit so a private
  homeowner can build a ramp. Many requests are reasonable and can be handled administratively
  over the counter; the City may wish to modify this code to exempt housing for persons with
  disabilities. The City utilizes a standard conditional use permit process (approval by the Planning

   Commission) to ensure that facilities are sited and operated in a manner compatible with
   surrounding land uses.
   Building and Housing Codes
   The Morro Bay Building Code is based on the California Building Code (CBC), which determines
   the minimum residential construction requirements for all of California. The CBC ensures safe
   housing and is not considered a significant constraint to housing production.
   Like most cities, Morro Bay responds to code enforcement problems largely on a complaint basis.
   The usual process is to conduct a field investigation after a complaint has been submitted. If the
   complaint is found to be valid, the seriousness of the problem is assessed. The more serious the
   violation, the more urgent the City’s action. The City encourages voluntary compliance through
   letters and phone calls and/or site visits. If compliance cannot be attained in this manner, the City
   may take more aggressive action through the legal process.
   The City’s philosophy has been to mitigate serious health or safety problems, but to allow the
   property owners reasonable time and flexibility to comply. The City seeks to balance the need to
   ensure safe housing against the potential loss of affordable housing that might result from overly
   strict enforcement. There is no indication that code enforcement actions have unnecessarily
   restricted the use of older buildings or inhibited rehabilitation.
   Permit Processing Times
   While permit processing times in Morro Bay do not appear excessive, this element does include a
   policy stating the City’s intent to expedite the processing of all development proposals that include
   affordable housing. Program H-6.5 states that the City will continue to expedite the permit
   processing procedure as an additional incentive for the development of affordable housing.
   Assuming a full planning staff of two planners, coastal development permits and use permits would
   take between 2 to 3 months for both single- and multi-family projects, including notice periods for
   coastal development permits. One method to reduce this time significantly is to combine the 10-day
   notice of intent to issue a permit with the 10-day appeal period. Environmental review or CEQA
   review can add months to the timeframe. This part of the process is out of the City's control. Also,
   because of the City's coastal location, there are many sites within proximity to environmentally
   sensitive habitat that will require CEQA review that can add additional time to the process outside
   of the City’s control.
   2014 processing times were not excessive and don’t significantly impact the cost of construction or
   the ability to build. Table 42 provides a summary of typical processing times by household type.

  Development Review
  The following is a description of the development review process for single- and multi-family
  developments in Morro Bay. Because the entire city is within the coastal zone, no proposals for
  construction of a new single-family or multi-family unit can be ministerial.
  First it must be determined whether the project is within the City’s or the Coastal Commission’s
  jurisdiction and whether it is within the California Coastal Commission appeal jurisdiction.
  New Residences
  East of Main Street
  Administrative coastal permits will be required for construction of all new single- or multi-family
  residences until the City obtains the approval of the Coastal Commission to exempt the area east of
  Main Street to the Local Coastal Program Urban/Rural Boundary except those areas within a
  Coastal Commission appeal jurisdiction, an ESH overlay zone, or on properties of 10 percent of
  greater slopes from the requirement of obtaining a coastal development permit for the purpose of
  construction of new, one-story single-family residences and two-story residences when the second
  floor is less than 40 percent of the lot area. The Public Services Director is authorized to take
  whatever steps are necessary to obtain Coastal Commission approval.
  West of Main Street
      Outside appeal jurisdiction
       Administrative coastal permits are required for properties located west of Main Street and not
       within the appeal jurisdiction or ESH zone.
      Within appeal jurisdiction
JUNE 2014                                                                       CITY OF MORRO BAY

       Regular coastal permits are required for properties located west of Main Street and within the
       appeal jurisdiction or ESH zone.
   Administrative Coastal Development Permits
   Developments and/or uses requiring an administrative coastal development permit
   The Public Services Director may process as an administrative permit any coastal development
   permit application specifically for the following developments and/or uses and provided that the
   development and/or use is not located in the coastal development permit appeal area.
      Improvements to any existing structure including minor additions to existing commercial,
       industrial, or multi-family structures that do not result in an intensification of use or require a
       conditional use permit, or add any additional units or create any environmental impacts and
       which do not require a subdivision map.
      Any single-family dwelling.
      Development of four dwelling units or less on a residential lot that is not located within the
       coastal appeal jurisdiction and/or ESH overlay zone and that does not require demolition of
       more than two units or a conditional use permit.
   Outside the Coastal Appeal Jurisdiction
   A final decision on an application for a coastal development permit for projects outside the coastal
   development permit appeal area becomes effective after the City’s 10-day appeal period has expired
   unless an appeal of the Public Services Director and/or Planning Commission’s decision is filed, or
   the notice of final action is inadequate as described under Section17.58.080.B of the Zoning
   Ordinance.
   Within The Coastal Appeal Jurisdiction
   A final decision on an application for a coastal development permit for projects in the coastal
   development permit appeal area is effective after the appeal period of 10 working days to the Coastal
   Commission has expired unless either of the following occur:
      An appeal is filed; or
      Notice of final City action does not meet the requirements set forth in Section 17.58.080.B of
       the Zoning Ordinance.
   The effective date of the City’s action may be suspended if either of the above circumstances occurs.

  City Permits for Development within the Coastal Commission Permit Jurisdiction
  The City will not issue a building permit where a coastal development permit from the Coastal
  Commission is required until:
     The applicant has provided the City with a copy of the approved coastal development permit
      and, if applicable, signed plans by the Coastal Commission; and
     The applicant ensures the building plans that the City intends to approve are consistent with the
      plans signed off by the Coastal Commission staff or reflect any plan changes described in written
      form; or
     The applicant provides the City with written verification from the Coastal Commission that a
      coastal development permit is not required.
  In addition to these requirements, a conditional use permit is required for any addition that adds
  more than 25 percent to an existing nonconforming single-family home, or where the site is located
  within a PD overlay area or where a property is subject to bluff development standards.
  Residential Development Fees
  The City collects various fees from applicants to cover the costs of processing permits, including
  fees for planning approvals, subdivision map act approvals, environmental review, public works and
  plan check services, and building permits. In addition to these service fees associated with
  development processing, the City and the regional transportation agency charge several impact fees
  to offset the future impact of development on regional traffic and circulation, parks, and libraries.
  For a detailed list of all fees, see Appendix A. The City’s Green Building Incentive Program
  provides eligible projects with building and plan check fee rebates (see the Energy Conservation
  Opportunities section of the Housing Element).
  As a means of assessing the cost that fees contribute to development in Morro Bay, the City has
  calculated the total fees associated with development of a single-family and multi-family
  development. As indicated in Table 43, development fees for a 1,500-square-foot residential project
  run approximately $25,000 per unit, and development fees for a multi-family project are
  approximately $29,000 per unit for the same unit square footage. The fees for a single-family unit
  make up about five percent of the total construction costs, and for a multifamily unit fees constitute
  eight percent of total construction costs. These fees are consistent with other cities in San Luis
  Obispo County and do not represent a significant financial constraint to new housing development.

    Trulia.com for Morro Bay on March 27, 2014.
   Site Improvements
   Site improvement costs include the cost of providing access to the site, clearing the site, and grading
   the pad area. In the case of a subdivision, such costs may also include major improvements such as
   building roads and installing sewer, water, and other utilities. As with land costs, several variables
   affect costs, including site topography and proximity to established roads, sewers, and water lines.
   Engineering and other technical assistance costs are usually included with site improvements, as
   these services are required to ensure that development is constructed according to established codes
   and standards.
   The City requires that curbs, gutters, and sidewalks be placed along the frontage of every multi-
   family lot (R-3 or above) on which new construction or significant alteration is done. These
   improvements may be required for single-family lots under specific circumstances. These and other
   site improvement costs are typical of all cities in California and do not impose a significant
   constraint on the development of housing in Morro Bay. The City does not impose any unusual
   requirements as conditions of approval for new development. City regulations are intended to
   generally encourage high-quality private development and new construction. Traffic fees are
   calculated by square footage: single-family (including garage square footage) is $1.86 per square foot
   and multi-family (does not include garage square footage) is $2.90 per square foot.

  Inclusionary Housing Program
  On March 11, 2014, the Morro Bay City Council adopted Ordinance No. 584, which revoked
  Chapter 17.50 (Affordable Housing, Density Bonuses and Incentives) of the Municipal Code and
  replaced it in its entirety with inclusionary housing provisions that are consistent with current state
  law. Provisions in the new section include:
     All new residential developments of five or more for-sale units must provide a minimum of one
      inclusionary unit or 10 percent of the total number of units, whichever is greater, to be
      affordable to families with incomes in the very low-, low-, or moderate-income ranges,
      depending on the needs of the City at the time of approval.
     The City requires the developer to provide affordable housing on-site where feasible. If the City
      determines that this is not feasible based on a detailed economic analysis prepared by a City-
      contracted consultant at the cost of the applicant, the City requires the developer to provide
      such housing at another location in Morro Bay. If the City determines that it is not feasible for
      the developer to provide such affordable housing off-site, the developer is required to pay a fee
      in lieu of providing such housing
     Fees accepted for affordable housing are used by the City to construct or assist in the
      construction of housing for rent or sale to very low-, low-, and moderate-income families or to
      purchase land for the purpose of affordable housing or to assist very low-, low-, and moderate-
      income families to afford adequate housing or for other measures to provide housing for low-
      and moderate-income families.
  NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
  Non-governmental constraints consist of land costs, the environment, vacancy rates, construction
  costs, and availability of financing.
  Land Costs
  Land costs vary substantially based on a number of factors. The main determinants to land value are
  location and zoning, though the size of a parcel will also affect price. Land that is conveniently
  located in a desirable area zoned for residential uses will likely be more valuable and more expensive
  than a remote piece of land zoned for agricultural uses.
  Based on DataQuick, the median home sale price in Morro Bay was approximately $429,500 in
  2013. Of this cost, more than half could be attributed to the land cost. Land costs present a
  significant constraint to the production of affordable housing in the city.
JUNE 2014                                                                         CITY OF MORRO BAY
                                                    78

                                                     HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   The price of land in Morro Bay varies considerably depending on a number of factors, including
   location and availability of City services. The city’s location adjacent to the ocean makes Morro Bay
   an extremely desirable place to live. This creates a large demand for land which, when coupled with
   voter-imposed growth controls, can significantly increase the cost of developable land.
   In 2014, according to a land cost survey done by PMC, undeveloped residential lots ranged from
   $249,000 to $1,750,000. There were a total of 15 vacant lots for sale as of March 2014.
   Construction Costs
   Construction costs are those incurred in actually constructing a dwelling unit. As with other land
   development costs, construction costs vary. Important determinants of construction costs include
   the amenities built into the unit, materials used, the prevailing labor rate, and the difficulty of
   building on the site. In Morro Bay, expansive soils may necessitate more extensive footings for
   houses, which can increase construction costs. Multiple-family residences such as apartments can
   generally be constructed for slightly less than single-family residences. According to Building-
   cost.net, a housing construction cost resource that calculates the total estimated cost of building a
   new home (land costs not included), single-family home construction costs in 2014 were estimated
   at approximately $105 per square foot for average quality construction.
   The estimated total construction cost of a 1,500-square-foot home with four walls, an attached
   garage, central heating and air, and average building materials was $169,695.
   The only recent multi-family units constructed in the city have been high-end units and therefore
   may not reflect the true cost of developing units for lower-income residents. However, units were
   constructed in Grover Beach in 2013 that better reflect that cost. Although Grover Beach land costs
   may be different from those in Morro Bay, given the proximity of the cities, construction costs are
   comparable. The four-unit building constructed in Grover Beach has a building value of $372,573,
   or $93,143 per unit.
   Availability of Financing
   The cost of borrowing money to finance the construction of housing or to purchase a house affects
   the amount of affordably priced housing in Morro Bay. Fluctuating interest rates can eliminate many
   potential homebuyers from the housing market or render a housing project that could have been
   developed at lower interest rates infeasible. When interest rates decline, sales increase. The reverse
   has been true when interest rates increase. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic growth
   in alternative mortgage products, including graduated mortgages and variable rate mortgages. These
   types of loans allow homeowners to take advantage of lower initial interest rates and to qualify for
   larger home loans. However, variable rate mortgages are not ideal for low- and moderate-income
   households that live on tight budgets. In addition, the availability of variable rate mortgages has
   declined in the last few years due to greater regulation of housing lending markets. Variable rate
   mortgages may allow lower-income households to enter into homeownership, but there is a definite
   risk of monthly housing costs rising above the financial means of that household. Therefore, the
CITY OF MORRO BAY                                                                                    JUNE 2014

  fixed interest rate mortgage remains the preferred type of loan, especially during periods of low,
  stable interest rates. Table 44 illustrates interest rates as of March 2014. The table presents both the
  interest rate and the annual percentage rate (APR) for different types of home loans. The interest
  rate is the percentage of an amount of money which is paid for its use for a specified time, and the
  APR is the yearly percentage rate that expresses the total finance charge on a loan over its entire
  term. The APR includes the interest rate, fees, points, and mortgage insurance and is therefore a
  more complete measure of a loan’s cost than the interest rate alone. However, the loan’s interest
  rate, not its APR, is used to calculate the monthly principal and interest payment.

   5. ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
   This section describes opportunities for conserving energy in existing homes as well as in new
   residential construction. The factors affecting energy use, conservation programs currently available
   in Morro Bay, and examples of effective programs used by other jurisdictions are discussed.
   Factors Affecting Energy Use
   The factors that affect residential energy use must be understood in order to identify opportunities
   for conservation. One such factor is the size of the population. At any given time, the larger the
   population, the more electricity is consumed. But over time, new conservation mandates and
   technological advances decrease the per capita consumption of energy. This means that the total
   energy use increases at a slower rate than population. The price of energy also has a significant
   effect; the more expensive it becomes, the more incentive people have to conserve.
   The local climate has a large effect on residential energy use. In general, Morro Bay has a mild
   climate typical of many coastal communities. Summers are warm with early morning fog, and
   winters are only moderately cold. Prolonged periods of cold weather cause increased energy use for
   space and water heating. This situation is particularly true if homes are not well insulated.
   The efficiency of household appliances also affects energy use. Older appliances may not operate as
   efficiently as when they were new, and many older appliances were built when energy conservation
   was not considered important. Significant energy-efficient design advances have been made in
   refrigerators, stoves, and furnaces.
   Existing Conservation Programs
   The following energy conservation programs are implemented in Morro Bay:
       The California State Building Standards Code (specifically Title 24) requires that all new
        residential development comply with several energy conservation standards. The standards
        require ceiling, wall, and concrete slab insulation, vapor barriers, weatherstripping on doors and
        windows, closeable doors on fireplaces, no continuous burning gas pilot lights, insulated heating
        and cooling ducts, water heater insulation blankets, swimming pool covers and timers, certified
        energy-efficient appliances, etc. All new construction in Morro Bay must comply with Title 24.
       The California Energy Commission (CEC) has developed a set of energy efficiency guidelines
        for local planning agencies. As part of those guidelines, the CEC addresses building efficiency
        beyond the Title 24 standards. The City of Morro Bay may wish to include these guidelines in its
        building code.
       The City “Green Building Incentive Program” provides incentives for green and energy-
        conserving projects. The City has a green building kiosk at the public services counter,
        maintained by SLO Green Build, that provides educational materials relating to green building
CITY OF MORRO BAY                                                                                 JUNE 2014
                                                       81

            HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
       and energy conservation. The City encourages residents to participate in energy efficiency
       retrofit programs by providing information, maintained by San Luis Obispo County Energy
       Watch, containing rebates and incentives relating to energy efficiency retrofits, at the public
       services counter.
      On January 14, 2014, the Morro Bay City Council adopted the City’s Climate Action Plan. The
       Climate Action Plan identifies strategies to reduce GHG emissions and focuses, in part, on
       reducing energy use from the built environment. The Climate Action Plan includes measures to
       encourage energy efficiency outreach and incentive programs, energy audit and retrofit
       programs, income-qualified energy efficient weatherization, incentives for exceeding Title 24
       building energy efficiency standards, small scale on-site solar photovoltaic, and income-qualified
       solar photovoltaic.
      Income-qualified Morro Bay homeowners are also eligible for no-cost solar installations through
       the nonprofit group Grid Alternatives.
  Examples of Programs from Other Jurisdictions
  Land use planning and zoning practices can conserve energy. For example, if the general plan and
  zoning ordinance encourage residential subdivision in a relatively isolated area, far from commercial
  facilities such as grocery stores, residents must travel longer distances to take care of their daily
  shopping and service needs. Keeping housing and jobs in balance and near each other helps to
  reduce energy use for commuting. Longer trips usually necessitate using an automobile rather than
  walking or cycling. Changing the land use pattern can also change energy use patterns. The intent of
  land use planning measures is to reduce the distances of automobile travel, reduce the costs of
  construction, and increase the potential for residents to complete shopping and other chores
  without driving or by driving shorter distances.
  One example of a land use planning technique for energy conservation is to encourage infill
  (development on vacant or underused lots) and compact, contiguous development. Morro Bay has a
  few existing vacant lots for development. As property is annexed to the city to meet the demand for
  housing, the city boundaries should expand concentrically rather than allowing dispersed
  development in outlying areas. Mixed-use development should be allowed, particularly in the core
  areas and along collector roads.
  Compact development results in the secondary energy savings of embodied energy. Embodied
  energy is the term used for the energy spent producing the materials and finished products, such as
  sewer pipes, electrical lines, and paving materials. Minimizing the length of necessary water, sewer,
  and electricity lines consumes less of those products and decreases the total energy consumption.
  Compact development also means there can be more convenient and accessible public transit.
  Efficient intracity transit service requires a minimum of 12 housing units per acre (Calthorpe 1990).
  The Regional Transit Authority (RTA) provides daily fixed-route service from the Morro Bay area
JUNE 2014                                                                        CITY OF MORRO BAY

   into Los Osos and San Luis Obispo, where transit riders can connect with other countywide transit
   services. The City also provides a dial-a-ride service within the city limits.
   Efficiency in Individual Homes
   A variety of public and quasi-public programs could be made available in Morro Bay to assist
   homeowners and renters in retrofitting to improve energy efficiency. The City currently provides the
   following programs:
      Home Investment Partnership Program, which includes energy and water efficiency upgrades as
       eligible activities.
      Toilet Retrofit Program Rebates
      Water Efficient Washing Machine Rebate Program
   The City should encourage energy efficiency in residential construction by offering incentives and
   negotiating with developers to emphasize energy-efficient construction practices. Developers and
   consumers often discard long-term savings potential in favor of immediate cost savings. The City
   currently provides the following incentives:
      Green Building Incentive Program, which provides eligible projects with building and plan check
       fee rebates for achieving third-party green building certification, exceeding 20 percent of Title 24
       requirements, renewable energy systems, and green roofs.
   Energy-efficient, new residential construction can cut energy consumption in the home by up to 50
   percent. Energy-efficient home construction and retrofits should contain some or all of the
   following:
      Double-pane windows (two panes of glass enclose a vacuum-tight space that does not allow heat
       and cold to transfer as quickly as it does in a window with a single pane of glass)
      Attic insulation greater than R-19 (soft, fiberglass insulation is given an “R” rating based on its
       capacity to insulate an area; a higher R value indicates greater insulation capability)
      Rigid attic insulation (generally a compressed Styrofoam insulation with an R-30 value)
      Additional wall insulation (older homes may not have insulated walls)
      Fluorescent indoor lighting (a standard, incandescent light bulb uses more energy)
      Dimmer switches and task lighting (dimmer switches allow lower lighting levels and less
       electricity use, while task lighting directs light to necessary areas without wastefully lighting a
       larger area)

     Halogen outdoor lighting (halogen, like fluorescent, is more efficient than incandescent light)
     Lighting motion detectors that turn on lights only when they detect a person in the room or area
     Shade trees along southern and western exposures, and glazing to reduce the heat from windows
      on hot summer days
     Solar screens that reduce the amount of heat from solar radiation coming through windows
     Evaporative cooler, which uses less energy than air conditioner
     Microwave oven, which uses less energy than an electric or gas oven
     Gas (rather than electric or propane) water heater and range/oven
     Weatherized windows and doors that do not have cracks to cause drafts
     Pools and/or hot tubs with integrated cleaning and heating systems (including pool covers,
      active solar heating, and efficient filters, pumps, and motors)
     Energy use automatic timers that provide energy use only when it is necessary
     Drip irrigation system that conserves water and reduces the energy needed for pumping water
     Drought-tolerant landscaping
     Active solar elements and passive solar design
     Energy-efficient appliances (in new construction and replacing older appliances in existing
      homes)
     Storm windows to cut back on heat loss through windows during the winter
     Reflective film on south-facing windows to minimize heat gain during the summer
     Individual meters for gas, electricity, and water (to encourage conservation) in multi-family units
  The City can also employ policies that encourage solar energy technology in both retrofits and new
  construction. There are two distinct approaches to solar heating: active and passive. Active systems
  use mechanical equipment to collect and transport heat–—the relatively common roof plate
  collector system used in solar water and space heaters. Collectors can contain water or air that is
  pumped through conduits and heated, then piped to the spaces to be heated or to a water heater
  tank.

   Conversely, passive solar systems collect and transport heat through non-mechanical means.
   Essentially, the structure itself becomes part of the collection and transmission system. Certain types
   of building materials absorb solar energy and can transmit that energy later. Passive systems often
   employ skylight windows to allow sunlight to enter the room and masonry walls or walls with water
   pipes inside to store the solar heat. This heat is then generated back into the room when the room
   cools in the evening.
   The best method to encourage use of active solar systems for heating and cooling is to not restrict
   their use in the zoning and building ordinances and to require subdivision layouts that facilitate solar
   use. Programs H-22.1 through H-22.6 are proposed to address energy conservation and efficiency in
   the City.

     6. REVIEW OF PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT
     In an effort to ensure the policies and implementation programs included in the Housing Element are relevant to addressing the current
     problems of Morro Bay, an evaluation of achievements under the previous Housing Element was undertaken. This evaluation provided the
     basis for recommended modifications and the establishment of new objectives in the Housing Element.

                                                   HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE
   7. OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
   State law requires that the Housing Element contain a “statement of the community’s goals,
   quantified objectives and policies relative to the maintenance, improvement and development of
   housing.” This chapter describes the proposed goals, objectives, policies, and implementation
   programs of the Housing Element for the City of Morro Bay.
   Dates shown in the “Time frame” indicate the scheduled implementation of the program, which will
   be in effect from that time through the duration of the planning period. For the Housing Element,
   the term “second unit” is interchangeable with “granny unit” and “accessory unit.” The term
   “lower-income groups” is interchangeable with the extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-
   income categories.
   1.      Housing Supply
           Objective: Provide a continuing supply of affordable housing to meet the
           needs of existing and future Morro Bay residents in all income categories.
           Policy H-1 (Fair Share)
           Maintain land use policies that allow residential growth consistent with the availability of
           adequate infrastructure and public services.
                   Program H-1.1
                   The City will give the highest priority for residential development to affordable
                   housing projects. These projects will automatically be allowed first priority for the
                   allocation of new residential growth in each year. The priority for affordable units
                   will also include the allocation of water and other resources as consistent with the
                   Local Coastal Plan.
                   Responsible Agency/Department:         Public Services Department

                   Program H-1.2
                   To ensure there is a sufficient supply of multi-family zoned land to meet the City’s
                   Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), the City will help facilitate lot
                   consolidations to combine small residential lots into larger developable lots by
                   annually meeting with local developers to discuss development opportunities and
                   incentives for lot consolidation to accommodate affordable housing units. As
                   developers/owners approach the City interested in lot consolidation for the
                   development of affordable housing, the City will offer the following incentives on a
                   project–by-project basis:

                  Decrease setbacks, and/or
                  Reduce parking requirements.
           The City will also consider offsetting fees (when financially feasible) and
           concurrent/fast tracking of project application reviews to developers who provide
           affordable housing.

           Program H-1.3
           To ensure affordable multi-family projects meet maximum densities, the City will
           continue to implement procedures with objective standards to promote flexibility in
           development standards (height, parking, and setbacks) and promote the use of
           density bonuses to increase densities. The City will biannually review the multi-family
           development standards in the Zoning Ordinance and revise as necessary to ensure
           they don’t act as a constraint to the development of affordable housing in the city.
           The City will give priority to projects that provide extremely low-, very low-, and
           low-income housing.

                secure funds and be supportive of others pursuing funds through state and federal
                programs for development of new lower-income housing and rehabilitation of
                existing lower-income households (including mobile homes). As funding becomes
                available, the City will prioritize a portion of the funds to encourage the development
                of housing for extremely low-income households.
                In addition, in light of budget constraints and reduced staffing levels, it is unlikely
                that the City will pursue grant funds for affordable housing acquisition or new
                construction projects. Housing grant funds will be pursued for energy efficiency
                audits and retrofits and infrastructure repairs. Pursuit of funds for rehabilitation will
                occur when it is determined there is a sufficient level of interest in this type of

                Most recent housing developments in Morro Bay have not been constructed to the
                maximum densities allowed by zoning. Market conditions, bank financing, and
                insurance requirements have favored the construction of single-family detached
                houses. To increase housing supply and obtain densities closer to those envisioned

        Policy H-6.a (General Affordability)
        Continue to require a percentage of new housing units built in the city be affordable to very
        low-, low-, and moderate-income households.
        Policy H-6.b (Variable Density)
        In order to encourage development of small units, development of a greater number of
        residential units than otherwise allowed under the existing land use and/or zoning
        designation may be permitted, provided that (1) at least 65 percent of the units are developed
        as studio or one-bedroom units; (2) the population density at full buildout of the project
        does not exceed the population density that corresponds with the existing land use
        designation and/or zoning or 1 person for every 500 square feet, whichever is less; and
        (3) the proposed project complies with all applicable zoning regulations, except as modified
        by the decision-maker through discretionary review.
                Program H-6.1
                The City will continue to implement the inclusionary requirements of Section 17.50
                of the Municipal code which requires that all new residential development projects of
                5 or more for-sale units provide a minimum of one unit or 10 percent of the total
                number of units, whichever is greater, to be affordable to families with incomes in
                the very low-, low- or moderate-income ranges, depending on the needs of the City
                at the time of approval. The lower-income units may be either for rent or for sale,
                but shall remain affordable for at least 30 years, or such other term approved by the
                City, consistent with state law.

                As an alternative to building inclusionary units, the City will allow a development to
                pay an in-lieu fee. Currently, the fee amount is determined with the following
                method: (construction cost x percentage of fee based on project size, where
                construction costs include all expenses related to the development of housing units,
                including land, construction, on- and off-site infrastructure, and associated soft
                costs). The City will conduct an analysis on the current method to determine
                whether the current fees are appropriate. If they are found to not be appropriate, the
                City will conduct a nexus study. Once established, the in-lieu fees will be collected
                and held in an affordable housing trust fund. To ensure any modifications to the
                City’s Inclusionary Program as a result of the nexus study do not adversely impact
                market-rate housing, the City will also evaluate whether the Inclusionary Program
                poses a constraint to the development of housing. If this is found to be the case, the
                City will revise the program to ensure it is not a constraint to development.

            The City will consider adopting an ordinance that would require, as a condition for
            approval of any permit for a significant remodel or addition to a residential dwelling
            within the City of Morro Bay, that the entire residence, including both the existing
            structure and the proposed addition or modification be brought into compliance
            with the currently-enacted requirements of Title 24 of the California Code of
            Regulations to the greatest degree feasible. In the event that full compliance with the
            requirements of Title 24 is asserted to be less than feasible by the applicant for such
            permit or by the Planning Department of the City of Morro Bay, approval of the
            requested permit should be granted only by action, in a duly-noticed public hearing,
            of the Planning Commission or City Council of the City of Morro Bay.

Morro Bay, CA 93442
RE:       PROPOSAL FOR COMPREHENSIVE GENERAL PLAN AND LOCAL COASTAL PLAN UPDATE,
          CORRESPONDING UPDATE OF THE ZONING CODE, AND PREPARATION OF
          ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT
Dear Mr. Graham:
Michael Baker International is pleased to submit this proposal to complete a comprehensive update of the City of Morro
Bay General Plan, Local Coastal Program, and Zoning Ordinance and to prepare a program environmental impact report
(EIR) for the project. We understand that the City intends to update the General Plan and Local Coastal Program (LCP)
by combining the two documents into a single user-friendly document. As noted in the RFP, the City’s General Plan
and LCP exist as the community’s statement of its base values and as a shared vision for its future growth and
development. It is intended to express how citizens of Morro Bay view the community both now and in the future, and,
most importantly, how the community intends to address current and future planning and development issues.
We understand that the City intends to hire a consultant to lead preparation of the General Plan/LCP Update (Update) for
the City according to California state law and aligned with the forthcoming General Plan Guidelines to be released by
the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research (OPR) during a two-year period from contract execution. The consultant
will coordinate with City staff and the General Plan Advisory Committee throughout the project. The City Council
affirmed its commitment to the project, including commitment of City resources to complete the Update by December
2017. The combined documents will be presented in two volumes, labeled the “blueprint” and the “greenprint,”
presenting the City’s intended long-term development and conservation policies, respectively. A program EIR will be
prepared to address the potential impacts of these plans, and updates to the Zoning Ordinance and Local
Implementation Plan will be completed to codify new provisions of the LCP. Much of the project is funded using
external grant resources provided by the California Coastal Commission and Ocean Protection Council.
The City prepared a comprehensive work plan for this effort with assistance from Michael Baker, and that work plan
forms the basis for this proposal. During our collaboration with the City to prepare the initial work program, we heard
from stakeholders that economic vitality, land use, sustainability, and environmental protection and conservation would
be key issues. As our project team reflected more on the issues and unique characteristics of Morro Bay’s past and
                                                                         1026 Chorro Street, Suite 225, San Luis Obispo, CA 93401

response to the technical capabilities requested in the RFP. Although we envision a collaborative work effort within the
project team, the discussions below indicate which firm will lead work to be completed for each topic.
Comprehensive Planning
Michael Baker will lead comprehensive planning for this project. We bring a valuable combination of experience and
qualifications to the comprehensive planning process. Our approach to preparing a general plan or local coastal
program focuses on providing a complete, workable policy document that reflects the vision and desires of the
community. Our in-house experts understand legal issues, best practices, and special considerations to develop
innovative, appropriate, and legally defensible policy solutions and implementation plans. In our capacity as contract

                                                                                                     Proposer Qualifications 5

  (GHG) emissions and respond to climate change. We also prepare plans that address climate adaptation, ranging from
  climate adaptation policies in general plans to vulnerability assessments.
  Additionally, our experts offer hazard mitigation planning, community health, and emergency management services.
  This expertise is uncommon in a planning firm and complements the wide array of services related to sustainability and
  climate change. In particular, Michael Baker’s hazard mitigation services focus on assisting communities throughout
  California to address natural and man-made hazards at a policy level as well as through discrete implementation
  actions and projects.
  Community Engagement
  Michael Baker will lead community engagement for this project. Our team includes planning professionals who have
  developed and implemented a broad range of outreach strategies and activities for local and regional public agencies
  and community-based organizations. Michael Baker offers a comprehensive range of community engagement and
  facilitation services, including stakeholder engagement and reporting techniques, community workshops and events,
  stakeholder meetings and interviews, surveys, and educational and interactive materials development. Our team
  members are trained and experienced facilitators for discussions of all sizes, from small advisory committees to large
  public workshops and special events. We have experience working with underserved, minority, and low-income

  construction support services. Our engineering experts regularly assist with planning efforts, including general plans,
  master plans, and specific plans, by assessing existing infrastructure and determining necessary additions or
  improvements for proposed projects.
  Economic Development
  Michael Baker will lead economic development for this project. A community is not just about what you can physically
  see and touch. While aesthetics, architecture, and infrastructure are important, good planning also considers the
  economic engine that drives why a community exists. Good planning builds wealth through sustainable jobs and wages
6        Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

while contributing to the tax base and overall fiscal health of the community. This allows communities to continue to
strengthen themselves over time in a manner that looks to solve economic issues through other facets of planning. Our
team understands how physical design, quality of life, and good economic development must be intertwined to create,
grow, and maintain good jobs for the people of our client communities in a competitive global economy.
When engaging in economic development planning, Michael Baker looks to provide a framework for new development,
revitalization, and redevelopment in each community. This process generally begins with the identification of the major
economic issues facing a community. This is critical to providing a framework for focus areas to assess throughout the
planning process. The plan is completed through the establishment of goals and policies that promote fiscal stability,
expand a community’s employment base, and enhance that community’s revenues in order to provide quality services
to its residents.
Michael Baker’s economic development planners have direct experience in workforce development, analyzing and
addressing skills-gaps and training programs, improving the economic base of the community, marketing, site
selection/preparation, business retention and expansion programs, and overall economic development strategic
planning.

as joint ventures for regional grants. Upon completion of grant proposals and procurement of funding, Michael Baker
has the resources to provide the necessary services to complete projects and develop accompanying reports to satisfy
the funding requirements. Our experts have developed grant proposals and assisted municipalities with funding
planning, sustainability, environmental, and housing projects and programs throughout California.
                                                                                                   Proposer Qualifications 7

  Coastal Hazard Planning
  M&N will lead coastal hazard planning for this project, consisting of the following services.
  Sea Level Rise and Climate Change
  Addressing sea level rise is not as simple as “building it higher,” because of the significant infrastructure already in
  place such as airport runways, container yards, homes and businesses, and the connections at the inland edges, which
  limit the ability to just elevate the waterfront areas. Over the years, M&N’s coastal engineers have routinely evaluated
  local and global sea levels as part of designing coastal flood protection projects, and they are very familiar with risk-
  based, probabilistic methods used in project life cycle analysis and risk assessments. M&N is particularly qualified to
  assess the vulnerability to sea level rise and to develop adaptation/mitigation strategies in a manner that is easily
  understood by planners, architects, and local communities.
  Coastal Numerical Modeling
  M&N has extensive experience in performing hydrodynamic modeling studies in the estuary and nearshore ocean
  environments. The team regularly applies widely accepted numerical models of varying complexity as aids to the
  design process. Its extensive experience with a wide range of hydraulic and hydrodynamic models, as well as with
  developing in-house models and interfaces, provides the ability to select the most appropriate model for any particular
  engineering problem and effectively analyze and present the results. M&N’s expertise also allows the firm to apply the
  right models in a fast and efficient manner to provide the most effective and constructible engineering solutions.
  Shoreline Processes
  An important aspect of shoreline protection work is the characterization of the dynamic nature of the coast along the
  project area. This coastal engineering assessment is generally done in terms of the beach’s long-term and seasonal
  dynamic response, and for a range of wave and water level scenarios.
  As is typically required, M&N can perform a wave run-up analysis, in conformance with the California Coastal
  Commission’s Beach Erosion and Response (BEAR) Guidance Document (1999), as well as its current guidance on
  including climate change and sea level rise in future planning (2015). The analysis includes design parameters such as
  still water elevation, storm surge events, anticipated long-term changes in sea surface elevations, extreme anticipated
  scour elevation, nearshore bathymetry, wave characteristics, wave run-up elevation, and wave overtopping rate (if
  applicable). The analysis is set up to look at a range of future sea level rise scenarios and timelines, and can be used to
  identify infrastructure at risk from wave action and sea level rise. M&N has done many wave run-up analyses and armor
  size calculations in support of shore protection and other coastal projects, including Blue Lagoon and Three Arch Bay
  in Laguna Beach, Broad Beach in Malibu, Sandpoint Road in Carpinteria, Seacliff Beach Colony in Ventura County, and
  others in Pismo Beach and Catalina Island.

Hydrology/Hydraulics
M&N provides a full range of coastal engineering/water resources/hydrology/hydraulics analytical services. M&N
numerical models enable analysis of parameters vital to understanding the behavior of coastal, watershed, riverine, and
tidal environments. M&N routinely applies models to establish boundary conditions, characterize existing systems, and
predict future parameters based on proposed system modifications. Its wind and wave hindcast models simulate the
effects of wave shoaling, refraction, diffraction, and wave propagation over complex bathymetries and provide statistical
return period analysis. Hydrological models can simulate the surface runoff response of a river basin, and the
hydrodynamic circulation models can calculate water surface elevations and velocities in a waterway system. M&N’s
capabilities also include sedimentation models which can simulate the sedimentation patterns and transport processes
in a river and estuary, and the convective diffusion programs model the spreading of physical properties impacting
water quality (e.g., pollutants, salinity, heat).
Environmental Review
Rincon will lead environmental review for this project. The company is well versed in conducting both project-specific
and programmatic environmental reviews as well as in the issues facing projects in a variety of settings. Most of these
projects involve comprehensive analysis of a broad range of impact issues and development of programmatic
mitigation measures required to minimize adverse effects.
CEQA documentation (EIRs, mitigated negative declarations [MND], categorical exclusions [CE]) accounts for roughly
two-thirds of Rincon’s Environmental Sciences and Planning business, while technical studies in related areas (air
quality, GHGs, noise) are also focal points for this group. In addition, all other groups at Rincon participate in CEQA
documentation within their areas of expertise, providing needed technical expertise to planners as appropriate for
individual assignments. Staff members are experienced with technical analysis of all 16 issue areas on the CEQA
checklist. Rincon provides in-depth analysis for those issue areas deemed significant in an initial study and warranting
review in an EIR. When an EIR is required, the initial study and scoping process is used to focus the document on
impacts that have the potential to result in significant impacts.
Local Coastal Planning
RRM will lead local coastal planning implementation for this project. RRM has extensive experience writing and
implementing local coastal programs (LCPs). The firm is currently working on the City of Goleta’s first LCP and is also
currently partnered with Rincon to prepare a comprehensive update to the City of Oxnard’s LCP. Both projects are
especially relevant as they are some of the first LCP updates to incorporate new Coastal Commission guidance for
addressing sea level rise. Both efforts involve extensive consultation with Coastal Commission staff. RRM emphasizes
                                                                                                  Proposer Qualifications 9

  identifying an organizational structure designed to function seamlessly for the local jurisdiction, citizens, and property
  owners over the long term, while facilitating efficient review by the Coastal Commission.
  Zoning
  RRM will lead zoning tasks for this project. RRM offers expertise in preparing zoning ordinances and development
  codes in a wide variety of settings, including urban centers, small towns, and rural counties. RRM is an industry leader
  in developing mixed-use and downtown development regulations that support and facilitate infill development and the
  creation of vibrant pedestrian- and transit-oriented centers.
  RRM has prepared development codes, area-specific regulations, and special purpose ordinances for topics such as
  landscaping, hillsides, parking, sustainability, planned development, and community benefits. Staff utilizes the whole
  menu of zoning approaches, including form-based, performance-based, and Euclidean, to devise a strategy tailored to
  the unique needs of each community. All codes and ordinances are prepared to be responsive, user-friendly, and easy
  to understand, including cross references, graphic illustrations, and web-interfacing abilities. The RRM team brings
  experience from all sides of the development process, from public sector development review to architects and
  designers building real projects.
  Transportation Planning
  CCTC will lead transportation planning for this project. CCTC has extensive experience providing traffic and
  transportation consulting services to clients, especially in the Central Coast region. The firm’s services include:
      Transportation impact studies                                  Project management and peer review
      Transportation data collection                                 Traffic   operations   analysis,   including   micro-

  Comprehensive Planning
  Huntington Beach General Plan Update and EIR
  Michael Baker is currently leading the General Plan update work program for the
  City of Huntington Beach. Several important topics are being considered in this
  work program, including consistency between the General Plan and the City’s
  many specific plans, repositioning industrial uses to be competitive in the
  regional market, community concern for wetlands and other sensitive resources,
  identifying opportunities to address contributions to and effects of climate
  change, and recycling school sites. Multiple technical studies are being prepared
  to support the General Plan update and EIR, including biological resources, police
  and fire levels of service, and a sea level rise vulnerability assessment. We are
  facilitating a General Plan Advisory Committee and conducting stakeholder
  outreach using a variety of innovative means. An updated General Plan,
  Greenhouse Gas Reduction Program (GGRP), Coastal Resiliency Program (CRP),
  and program EIR represent the main deliverables for this work program.
  The GGRP actions implement General Plan sustainability goals and policies, and emphasize actions with measurable
  benefits. The GGRP integrates economic development, water and energy conservation, waste reduction and recycling,
  alternative and active transportation, open space preservation, and GHG emissions from both new development and
  existing uses.
  The GGRP is complemented by the CRP and a sea level rise vulnerability assessment. In preparing the CRP, Michael
  Baker (supported by Moffat & Nichol) consulted with regional stakeholders and relevant resource agencies that manage
  ecosystem restoration areas. The CRP includes guiding principles for resilience, preparedness goals, and preparedness
24      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

actions for each of four coastal planning areas. The CRP identifies potential adaptation measures for various elements
of infrastructure affected by sea level rise. Potential measures include engineering resilience, ecological resilience, and
community resilience. The CRP also includes guidance for phasing, cost estimates, and regulatory, resource, or other
impacts (e.g., loss of land due to adaptations).
Hermosa Beach General Plan Update, LCP, and EIR
Michael Baker, as a subconsultant to Raimi
+     Associates,     is  leading    community
engagement, preparation of a LCP update,
and a program EIR to support PLAN Hermosa,
the City of Hermosa Beach’s General Plan
update. As part of the LCP update, Michael
Baker     staff   designed,   completed,      and
summarized a beach area survey focused on
beach use patterns, level of use, types of
visitors, activities, and transportation to and
from the beach.
Michael Baker led a comprehensive community engagement campaign for this project
consisting of formal visioning workshops, an educational workshop series on key policy
topics affecting the General Plan and LCP, and a “walking workshop” to review potential
land use and coastal development alternatives. We participated in numerous meetings
with Coastal Commission staff to identify key topics and propose strategies to meet
Coastal Act requirements and Coastal Commission guidance. Michael Baker prepared
PLAN Hermosa goals, policies, and actions addressing key topics such as coastal
access, scenic and visual resources, coastal hazards (including sea level rise), coastal
priority uses, natural habitat and wildlife, water quality, beach management, and special
events. We also prepared numerous revisions to the City’s Zoning Ordinance/Local
Implementation Plan to address these topics. Michael Baker also prepared goals,
policies, and actions for the Safety Element and Sustainability and Conservation Element. Michael Baker is preparing a
program EIR for PLAN Hermosa to address all required CEQA topic areas. At the conclusion of the project, Michael
Baker will prepare a fully indexed web-based electronic version of PLAN Hermosa.

  Morro Bay Downtown Enhancement Plan
  In 2010, a Cal Poly City and Regional Planning graduate studio, led by Professors Umut Toker and Chris Clark,
  developed three specific plan alternatives for the City’s historic downtown. Michael Baker team staff members, Chris
  Read and Eli Krispi, participated in the project and helped lead efforts to assess existing conditions, conduct
  community outreach, and develop conceptual plans and design standards for downtown enhancement. The project
  benefited from input from the Morro Bay City Council and Planning Commission, with special project assistance from
  numerous community members, including current City Council Member Noah Smukler.
  San Luis Obispo County EnergyWise Plan and Addendum to the Conservation and Open
  Space Element Program EIR
  In 2009, the County contracted with Michael Baker to prepare the EnergyWise (Climate Action) Plan for unincorporated
  San Luis Obispo County. The County’s plan relies on the goals, policies, and targets established in the Conservation
  and Open Space Element (COSE). In addition to GHG reduction work, we partnered with the County, the Local
  Government Commission, and the GEOS Institute on the preparation of a climate change vulnerability assessment and
  adaptation workshop series. Michael Baker also conducted an environmental review of the project and prepared an
  addendum to the programmatic COSE EIR.
  The adaptation strategies were prepared with extensive stakeholder public outreach tailored to the county’s character
  and needs. The process included a town hall–style opening workshop that engaged more than 100 stakeholders, a
  series of focused stakeholder discussions, an online survey and website, e-mail updates, a speaker series, climate
  change curriculum training for elementary teachers (grades 4–6), updates to community groups and the Planning
  Commission, fact sheets, an open house workshop, and public hearings.
  The plan was adopted by the Board of Supervisors in November 2011. The plan was recognized by the Association of
  Environmental Professionals with a 2012 Climate Change Merit Award and by the Central Coast Section of the
  California Chapter of the American Planning Association with a 2012 Award of Excellence for Innovation in Green
  Community Planning.

Laguna Woods General Plan Update and Climate Adaptation Plan
Michael Baker prepared updates to the City of Laguna Woods’ General Plan,
including Safety and Conservation Elements, in addition to the City’s
Climate Adaptation Plan. The project together with the local hazard
mitigation plan (LHMP) provides the City’s resiliency framework. In 2013,
Michael Baker staff updated the General Plan Safety Element. Since its
adoption in 2002, the Safety Element has become out of date due to recent
changes in California Government Code requirements, as well as recent
legislation changes pertaining to wildfire, flooding, and earthquake hazards. A key component of this update was the
integration with the City’s recently adopted LHMP, which provides the basis for assessing risks associated with natural
hazards in the city. The city now has an updated set of goals and policy objectives that meet state law requirements and
help to protect residents and businesses for the next 20 years.
Following the Safety Element, Michael Baker prepared the City’s Climate Adaptation Plan in coordination with City staff
and regional partners. Laguna Woods has a particularly large population of residents who are older than 65, which was
a major component of the vulnerability assessment and guided many of the adaptation measures proposed within the
city. Further complicating the analysis was a large portion of the city that is controlled by the homeowners association
that oversees the large retirement community located in the city (formerly Leisure World).
Development of the adaptation plan involved a robust vulnerability assessment followed by policy analysis, stakeholder
engagement, and strategy development. The stakeholder engagement process engaged staff, residents, business
owners, and leaders in the community to better understand the issues at hand in the city.
The City worked with Michael Baker to apply the California Adaptation Planning Guide to the process. The plan’s policy
development directly responds to the prioritized list of assets developed during the vulnerability assessment process.
Each implementation action includes a metric to track implementation status and action effectiveness. The City Council
adopted the Safety Element and Adaptation Plan in 2014.
                                                                                                    Proposer Qualifications 27

  Elk Grove General Plan Update
  Michael Baker is leading a comprehensive update of the City of Elk
  Grove General Plan. Incorporated in 2001, Elk Grove has grown to
  become the second largest city in Sacramento County. The General
  Plan update encompasses a number of important community priorities,
  including economic vitality, continued preservation of the rural area,
  influencing      and      responding    to regional  policy   influences,
  accommodating growth through infill and outward expansion
  strategies,     defining      neighborhood  and   community    character,
  encouraging multimodal and active transportation, and promoting a healthy and sustainable community. The project
  includes a comprehensive community engagement campaign including a kickoff Citizen Planning Academy, visioning
  workshops, mobile studio, and interactive web-based activities. A program EIR will be prepared for the General Plan
  update.
  Kern County Community Vision Plans
  Michael Baker prepared six vision plans, one for each of the communities of Oildale, Rosamond, East Bakersfield,
  Mojave, Boron, and Old Town Tehachapi. While each of these communities is a small-town community in need of
  revitalization, including basic amenities and streetscape improvements, each community had a unique character and
  set of challenges to bring to the visioning process.
  Background research and outreach to project stakeholders served as the first step in the process for these efforts. The
  project team conducted a two-day charrette-style community workshop in each community, providing the foundation
  for each of the vision plans. Citizens enthusiastically participated in these workshops, with attendance reaching up to
  150 participants at the two-day charrette events. Extensive media outreach was conducted in advance of the meetings,
  resulting in thorough coverage by multiple media outlets.
  The workshops included engaging techniques such as mapping exercises, live polling, prioritization activities,
  preliminary design work, and a walking tour of the downtown with a simultaneous slideshow and live Twitter feed at the
  venue for those unable to participate in the walk. The final vision plan for each community contains two key
  components: a vision poster illustrating the key improvements to achieve the community’s vision and an
  implementation matrix outlining both County-led and community-led actions necessary to realize the vision and
  assigning responsibility. A final community workshop was held at each community to unveil their vision poster and to
  vet the final vision plan with each community.

Lompoc General Plan Update and EIR
Rincon prepared a comprehensive update of the City of Lompoc General Plan. The General Plan update addressed the
community’s vision for development during the planning horizon, and implemented the programmatic direction of the
City’s Housing Element at a policy level. The General Plan Land Use Element and Circulation Element updates focused
on the implementation of programs from the Housing Element update to satisfy state affordable housing standards and
on the potential physical expansion of the city in four locations. A Program EIR is being prepared to evaluate the
intensification of residential development in the city as a result of implementation of these programs. Following
completion of the Land Use Element, Circulation Element, and Housing Element updates and Program EIR, Rincon will
update the remaining General Plan Elements, including Conservation and Open Space, Noise, Safety, Parks and
Recreation, Public Services, and Urban Design, and prepare a Supplemental EIR.
Shandon Area Community Plan Update EIR
Rincon provided environmental support to the County of San Luis
Obispo for preparation of an EIR for a proposed comprehensive
update of the Community Plan for the Shandon Urban Area of the
Shandon-Carrizo Area Plan. The Community Plan update would
expand the existing Urban Reserve Line (URL, a 20-year growth
boundary) and amend land use categories within the existing and
expanded URL, thereby creating a framework for the community of
approximately 1,200 residents to grow to a maximum population
of approximately 9,400. The proposed Community Plan update would also accommodate substantial commercial and
industrial growth, schools, and parks, which are summarized below. The project consisted of two primary components:
1) known development applications, some of which may ultimately be framed within Specific Plans; and 2) buildout of
the entire Shandon Community Plan area. Three major development applications outside the existing URL have driven
the need for the Community Plan update; together, these areas comprise 1,258 acres. When combined with the area
within the existing URL, the entire study area includes 2,072 acres.
Coastal Planning
Monterey Local Coastal Program Implementation Plan
Michael Baker assisted City staff in preparing the implementation plan for three
of the City’s five coastal segments. The implementation plan is a geographically
focused zoning document for those areas of the city in the coastal zone, which
enables permit authority for development in the coastal zone.
                                                                                               Proposer Qualifications 29

  Seaside Local Coastal Program Update
  Between 2008 and 2013, Michael Baker updated the City of Seaside’s 1983
  LCP document. The update integrates the LCP by combining the City’s
  policies and development standards that had been segmented throughout its
  planning documents. The update served to advance the planning goals of the
  City, address community needs, and provide compliance with state law and
  the Coastal Act. Key City planning goals addressed by the update included
  improving community connectivity via the Monterey Bay coastal
  bikeway/pedestrian trail, which accommodates an estimated 2 million users
  annually, and the preservation of the renowned scenic views of the Pacific Ocean viewable from the City’s segment of
  the trail. The update also incorporated key sea level rise adaptation, wetland conservation, and habitat restoration
  policies. In addition to updating the 1983 LCP document and associated Coastal Implementation Plan (zoning
  document), Michael Baker also completed the associated environmental review for the update. The LCP was
  unanimously approved by the Coastal Commission in December 2012.
  Sand City Local Coastal Program Update and Contract Staffing Assistance
  Michael Baker has been providing ongoing contract staffing services to Sand City since the late 1990s. As part of those
  services, our staff has prepared a number of LCP amendments and processed several coastal development permits
  through the Coastal Commission. Specific projects have included LCP amendments to redesignate areas in the Coastal
  Zone and coastal development permits allowing for the construction of the Regional Bike Trail, installation of new water
  lines, dune enhancement activities in coordination with state and regional parks, the review and processing of large
  coastal resort projects (the Sterling Project and the Monterey Bay Shores Project), and the processing of a regional
  shopping center (Edgewater Center).

habitat will consist of salt marsh, brackish marsh, and all associated
habitat types. M&N is performing numerical modeling of tides (with
RMA) and storm flows (with AdH). Analyses quantify tidal hydrology,
high water levels, and erosion and sediment transport during storm flows. The project is intended to provide for fully
functioning marsh ecosystem without modifying sediment transport to the ocean.
The models provide useful tools for Del Mar to assess potential flooding from the San Dieguito River from combined
high water levels during sea level rise. Flood scenarios from the river can be tested with the model. Also, the model can
assess implications of sea level to habitats within the SCE wetland mitigation area if needed. This specific task has
already been initiated as part of this W-19 project.
San Diego Regional Sea Level Rise Assessment
The 60‐mile San Diego segment of the Los Angeles to San Diego (LOSSAN) rail corridor extends from the Orange
County line and passes over six lagoons, Camp Pendleton, and the cities of Oceanside, Carlsbad, Encinitas, Solana
Beach, and Del Mar before coming to its final destination in downtown San Diego. Along with its companion the I‐5
freeway, the LOSSAN corridor plays a critical role in the movement of people and goods within the region’s North
Coast. The North Coast Corridor Project involves replacing multiple bridges along the I‐5 freeway and LOSSAN rail
corridor. The Coastal Commission has stipulated that sea level rise planning must be incorporated into the project as
part of a Public Works Plan. Caltrans will design the freeway bridges and SANDAG will design the railroad bridges; both
will share the responsibility of planning for sea level rise. M&N prepared the San Diego Regional Coastal Sea Level
Rise Analysis as the basis for sea level rise planning and infrastructure design along these transportation corridors; this
analysis was integral to the Public Works Plan. M&N reviewed existing sea level rise estimates and identified the design
criteria of various public agencies that may provide funding. Based on this information, M&N developed guidelines for
bridge design to provide adequate freeboard under combined high water within these corridors through year 2100,
including high water caused by sea level, tides, storms, and tsunamis. The study provides specific sea level rise
recommendations for year 2100 and adaptation strategies for bridge design in the future. M&N recommended elevating
infrastructure to meet high‐end estimates of combined high water if possible, and/or incorporating adaptation strategies
into future projects if these higher elevations were not able to be realized.

  Zoning
  Goleta Zoning Ordinance and LCP Update
  RRM is working with the City of Goleta to create a new Zoning Ordinance to implement General Plan policies and the
  LCP, replacing the Santa Barbara County Zoning Ordinance that the City has been using since it was incorporated in
  2002. The inherited ordinance does not reflect best zoning and planning practices that are appropriate for a growing
  city, and it is not effective in implementing the land use and design goals in Goleta’s General Plan and other City
  policies. The purpose of the new Zoning Ordinance is to create an innovative, integrated code that shapes future growth
  according to the community’s vision, is clear and easy to use, and provides objective, standards, and criteria for use in
  the development review and permitting process that will result in high quality development.
  RRM is also assisting the City in the preparation of its first LCP, consisting of coastal policies and new implementing
  ordinances. The Goleta LCP is one of the first LCPs to incorporate new Coastal Commission guidance for analyzing and
  addressing sea level rise. The project began with a Coastal Act consistency analysis and technical studies related to
  sea level rise, water and wastewater capacity assessment, and shoreline structure analysis. Consultation with Coastal
  Commission staff is continuing throughout the project.
  Santa Barbara New Zoning Ordinance
  In partnership with Dyett & Bhatia, Urban and Regional Planners, RRM is leading a comprehensive update of the City of
  Santa Barbara’s Zoning Ordinance. The Santa Barbara New Zoning Ordinance (NZO) effort was initiated to update Santa
  Barbara’s regulation of land use and development included in the Zoning Ordinance, bringing it up to date to reflect
  best practices and make the ordinance easier to use and understand by all users. The effort includes updates to the
  zoning districts located in the Coastal Zone, administrative provisions for Coastal Development Permits and LCP
  updates, and Coastal Zone Overlay District regulations. Specific objectives of the project are to craft a new Zoning
  Ordinance that:
      Is consistent with and implements the General Plan;
      Is modern and reflects the City’s current uses, practices, and development patterns;
      Provides clear decision-making protocols and streamlined review processes, where appropriate;
      Addresses previously created nonconforming situations and brings them into compliance to the extent feasible;
      Promotes adaptive reuse of properties; and
      Is clear, concise, understandable, and easy to use.

Plan Princeton: San Mateo County Zoning, General Plan, and LCP Update
Prior to her employment with RRM, Martha Miller served as principal-in-charge and project manager for the Plan
Princeton project, an effort to update the General Plan, Zoning Regulations, and LCP for the unincorporated area of
Princeton in San Mateo County. Princeton is home to one of the few working waterfronts remaining on California’s
Central Coast that support fishing, boating, and marine-related enterprise, and has an abundance of natural and cultural
resources that make it a destination for coastal recreation. The effort included a detailed study of existing conditions,
development of plan alternatives and a preferred plan, and draft Local Coastal Plan and Implementation Program
amendments.
Sustainability/Climate Change Planning
City of San Mateo Climate Action Plan
Michael Baker prepared a Climate Action Plan for the City, drawing on a robust engagement and advisory committee
process. We consolidated an expansive local history of sustainability initiatives to prepare the new Climate Action Plan
for the community. To create a new long-term climate strategy that builds on historic City leadership, the Climate
Action Plan consolidated and updated the City’s Qualified GHG Reduction Program and Sustainable Initiatives Plan
while providing a new ambitious trajectory for sustained reductions in GHG emissions. Michael Baker initially worked
with the City on the preparation and adoption of the Qualified GHG Reduction Program as part of the General Plan
Update EIR in 2009. Using the foundation of multiple historic GHG inventories and forecasts for the city, we updated
existing inventories for both 2005 and 2010, including peer review and confirmation of the City’s 2005 baseline. We
also developed GHG emissions forecasts for 2020 and 2030, developed and quantified reduction measures, and
prepared implementation tools. The Climate Action Plan project also included a General Plan Amendment for Climate
Action Plan consistency and an Addendum to the General Plan EIR. As a result, the Climate Action Plan now provides
project-level streamlining and a strategic plan that addresses climate change and sustainability initiatives in the city,
serving as a clearinghouse for climate mitigation work.
To support Climate Action Plan development, Michael Baker facilitated a broad public engagement process.
Engagement involved City staff, advisory groups, and the general public through a multipart outreach strategy. Outreach
included facilitation of interdepartmental meetings with City staff that served as technical advisory group meetings.
Meetings with City staff served to confirm existing activities, vet potential strategies, and refine recommendations.
Michael Baker developed meeting materials and tools to support discussion at these meetings, such as matrices to
analyze activities and tools to collect data on existing accomplishments. Throughout the duration of the project, we
presented or supported City staff at 13 meetings of advisory and decision-making bodies, including seven meetings of
the Sustainability Commission. To engage the community and broader public, Michael Baker conducted community
                                                                                                   Proposer Qualifications 33

  outreach through several pop-up workshops at concerts in the park, an online town hall event, a community workshop,
  and public hearings. From these events, the project team identified community priorities and sought to build capacity
  for near-term initiatives.
  A key task of Climate Action Plan preparation was review of the City’s existing accomplishments. Working closely with
  City staff, we analyzed progress to date and developed a “local adjustment” to the business-as-usual forecast. This
  method allows the City to capture the beneficial impact of its early and ongoing efforts, demonstrating the significant
  progress the City has already achieved toward its GHG reduction targets. As part of the Climate Action Plan, Michael
  Baker also prepared an implementation program and Excel-based monitoring and reporting tool. The monitoring tool is
  an easy-to-use tool that allows City staff to track measure implementation and overall progress toward GHG reduction
  targets. We also prepared a development checklist, which identifies project-level criteria for incorporation into new
  development. The checklist is just one example of the new methods created by the Climate Action Plan to equip
  developers, homeowners, and the community for attainment of ambitious Climate Action Plan targets.
  Santa Barbara County Energy and Climate Action Plan
  Michael Baker provided technical assistance to Santa Barbara County in the preparation of its Energy and Climate
  Action Plan (ECAP). Our climate action efforts included a peer review and updates to the existing community-wide GHG
  emissions inventory, identification of appropriate GHG reduction targets, and quantification of policies to reduce GHG
  emissions. GHG inventory and forecast update efforts included revisions to the analysis of energy use in the county to
  reflect the three different utility providers and to appropriately account for the large energy users that are outside of the
  County’s jurisdictional control, including a university, air force base, and offshore oil drilling facilities.
  Michael Baker has worked with the County to present multiple GHG reduction targets and show the GHG reduction
  impact that each measure would have under a voluntary, phased, or mandatory approach, allowing the County’s
  decision-makers to decide where their efforts can be more progressive and where they can rely on voluntary
  approaches. Our support to the County also includes the development of several customized Excel-based tools to
  support future staff efforts in conducting a feasibility analysis of implementing each measure, analyzing project
  consistency with the ECAP, and monitoring and reporting to allow the County to evaluate progress in the future as the
  ECAP is implemented.

San Mateo County Energy Efficiency Climate Action Plan, Vulnerability Assessment,
General Plan Update, and EIR
Michael Baker prepared an Energy Efficiency Climate Action Plan (EECAP) and implementation program for
unincorporated San Mateo County. We completed a GHG emissions inventory and developed and implemented the
EECAP through subsequent General Plan and Zoning Code updates. The inventory assessed all sectors required by the
Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) CEQA Guidelines, allowing the EECAP to serve as a qualified GHG
reduction strategy.
The EECAP integrates and build on two studies Michael Baker created with its partners. Michael Baker worked with
ICLEI-USA to develop a Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Plan specific to unincorporated San
Mateo County, and with DNV KEMA to develop an Energy Efficiency Strategy that identifies strategic energy planning
opportunities throughout the county. These reports, combined with technical analysis prepared by Michael Baker and
the team’s transportation planning partner Fehr & Peers, informed development of the EECAP. We collaborated with
staff to prepare General Plan and Zoning Code updates. An implementation plan and a monitoring and tracking program
positioned the County to achieve EECAP goals.
Throughout the project, Michael Baker managed an extensive public outreach campaign consisting of website outreach,
a technical advisory group, a steering committee, an adaptation stakeholder workshop, two public workshops, and
public hearings.
City of San Luis Obispo Climate Action Plan
The City of San Luis Obispo retained Michael Baker to peer review and prepare updates to the community and
municipal GHG emissions inventory and to provide technical assistance to complete updates to the Climate Action Plan
initially prepared by the Cal Poly (SLO) City and Regional Planning Senior Community Planning Studio in 2009–2010.
Our assistance to the City included a peer review and update to the business-as-usual and adjusted business-as-usual
forecasts of the city’s community-wide and municipal GHG emissions based on a preferred growth scenario and facility
master plan, and identification of an achievable GHG reduction goal of at least 15 percent below 2005 baseline
emissions levels by 2020. The scope of the assistance also included updates to reduction measures and quantification
of the City’s GHG reduction measures and existing GHG reduction efforts based on program results, peer-reviewed
research, and best practices. The City Council adopted the Climate Action Plan in July 2012.
                                                                                               Proposer Qualifications 35

  Sunnyvale Climate Action Plan and Land Use and Transportation Element Update
  Michael Baker is working with the City to develop a Climate Action Plan, Land Use and Transportation Element (LUTE),
  and EIR. The documents tiered off of the existing 1997 LUTE as well as subsequently adopted specific plans, major
  rezoning actions, other studies, and related environmental documents. The Climate Action Plan incorporated related
  existing Sunnyvale codes and policies that aid in reduction of GHG emissions as well as proposed new policies needed
  to meet required reduction goals. The LUTE identifies areas within Sunnyvale that will either be preserved, conserved,
  enhanced, or transformed in coming years under proposed land use and circulation policies. Proposed policies
  emphasize creation of mixed-use village centers and complete streets transportation concepts. The EIR will be
  analyzing the impacts of all policies and programs pursuant to CEQA, and the Climate Action Plan, LUTE, and EIR
  together will serve as programmatic tiering documents for subsequent projects. Along with all three efforts, Michael
  Baker is conducting an extensive public outreach and engagement effort.
  Benicia Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Plan
  Under a project funded by a Climate Ready Grant from the California State Coastal Conservancy, the City of Benicia
  initiated development of a plan to address climate change. The plan was modeled after the San Francisco Bay
  Conservation and Development Commission’s Adapting to Rising Tides vulnerability and adaptation model, which
  emphasizes stakeholder involvement. Stakeholder engagement was coordinated through a technical advisory
  committee composed of local, regional, and state public agencies that own, operate, or otherwise contribute to the
  planning and funding of infrastructure and natural habitats in Benicia; and a community advisory group composed of
  members of the public with a vested interest in the project such as homeowners, business owners, community group
  representatives, and City commissioners.
36      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Project phases included an initial vulnerability assessment of City assets, followed by implementation of a climate
change adaptation plan. The goal of the vulnerability assessment was to identify climate change-related stressors, and
determine how climate-related risks would affect shoreline and community infrastructure such as watersheds, shoreline
parks and trails, the Port of Benicia, wastewater treatment plant, and the industrial park. The results of the assessment
supported creation of an adaptation/mitigation plan for risks identified along the City's 15-mile shoreline. Additionally,
the information gathered was leveraged for aspects of future stormwater management, open space utilization,
recreational use of parks and trails, and local hazard mitigation of future climate change impacts.
As a subconsultant to ICF International, M&N provided input on selection of climate scenarios, refinement of the project
area, selection of sectors and assets to evaluate for vulnerability, and appropriate resilience goals for the project. M&N
assisted in developing and proposing adaptive measures to enhance the resiliency of the sectors and assets studied in
the vulnerability and risk assessment with concentration on the coastal and fluvial measures.
Mono County Resource Efficiency Plan
In 2012, Mono County used funding from a Sustainable Communities Planning Grant from the California Strategic
Growth Council to prepare a Resource Efficiency Plan (REP) as part of a targeted update to the County’s General Plan.
The REP included preparation of 2005 and 2010 emissions inventories for both community-wide and governmental
activities as a baseline to create a path toward creating more sustainable, healthy, and livable communities in rural
Mono County.
The County sought to develop a locally based sustainability approach that would maximize the efficient use of
resources and reduce GHG emissions within its communities and from government operations. The REP outlines
policies and actions aimed at reducing GHG emissions and providing energy, fuel, water, and monetary savings while
improving quality of life for residents and visitors in the county.
Michael Baker assisted the County with identifying co-benefits of the programs and actions to be incorporated in the
Mono County General Plan that align with local and state development and conservation priorities. The REP proposes
approximately 120 actions relevant to the distinctive rural characteristics of the county, the local economy, and the
unique demographics characterized by a large seasonal visitor population, large areas of state and federal land
ownership, and small residential enclaves distributed across large areas. Most best-practice strategies to reduce GHG
emissions apply primarily to urban environments. Therefore, the County made specific efforts to develop innovative
measures and actions applicable to a rural, visitor-serving, and resource-rich environment. These measures and actions
focus both on achieving local emissions reductions and making meaningful contributions to statewide renewable
energy goals.
                                                                                                    Proposer Qualifications 37

  Actions include implementing net-zero energy policies for County facilities; focusing development within existing
  communities to minimize land disturbance; and creating strategic opportunities for residents, businesses, and visitors to
  improve resource efficiency. The actions outlined in the REP are estimated to achieve a 10 percent reduction below 2005
  emissions levels by 2020, plus annual savings of 100 million gallons of water, over 30 million kilowatt-hours of
  electricity, and close to 10 million vehicle miles traveled. To measure progress toward the plan’s proposed goals, the REP
  includes an implementation and monitoring tool that allows the County to track and report improved resource efficiency.
  Morro Bay Climate Action Plan
  The San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) selected Rincon to
  lead the preparation of a regional Climate Action Plan for the APCD and individual
  programmatic Climate Action Plans for six of its cities (Arroyo Grande, Atascadero,
  Grover Beach, Morro Bay, Paso Robles, and Pismo Beach). The project includes the
  following major components: 1) baseline GHG emissions inventories and forecasts
  updates for each of the six cities and the region; 2) state and local policy review and
  gap analysis; 3) GHG reduction target refinement; 4) GHG reduction measure
  evaluation toolbox; 5) regional public engagement program, workshops, and
  stakeholder meetings; and 6) six city Climate Action Plans and one regional Climate
  Action Plan, including implementation and monitoring plans, and CEQA compliance
  checklists. Rincon also prepared an IS-MND template that was adapted by each of
  the six cities to evaluate the environmental impacts of their individual plans.
  Additional/Local Experience
  City of Morro Bay Contract Planning Services
  Michael Baker has maintained an open on-call contract planning services contract with Morro Bay since 2008. Michael
  Baker provided the City with an associate-level contract staff planner during the City’s recruitment period for regular
  full-time associate and senior-level planners in 2008–2009 and in 2013–2014. Services include the review and
  processing of development applications, staff report preparation, counter assistance, ordinance review and
  modification, code enforcement, training of new staff, preparation of grant applications, and related activities. Michael
  Baker planner Jaime Hill provided on-site temporary planning services to the City for approximately four months and
  continued with off-site on-call planning assistance. She managed two infrastructure projects for the City, including
  management of other outside consultants and amendment of the LCP for implementation of several Housing Element
  programs. Tammy Seale is the project director.
38      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Through our on-call planning services with the City of Morro Bay, the Michael Baker team has supported City staff with
the identification and pursuit of grant funds to support planning efforts consistent with the City Council’s goals and
priorities. We prepared four grant applications submitted to the Strategic Growth Council, Coastal Commission, Coastal
Conservancy, and Ocean Protection Council in support of the General Plan and LCP update and to update and integrate
efforts of related and recent planning activities, such as the Climate Action Plan and to address sea level guidance from
the Coastal Commission. Preparation of each application involved collaboration with senior City staff, Coastal
Commission staff, and community partners to identify project goals, key issues, a work program, and a budget for the
project. We are pleased that the City is a recipient of grant funds from the Coastal Commission to begin climate
adaptation studies that would be part of an updated LCP.
Morro Bay Housing Element Update
Michael Baker prepared the City of Morro Bay’s 4th and 5th cycle Housing Elements. The document included updated
demographic information, analysis of constraints to housing development, land available for residential development,
and updated goals, policies, programs, and quantified objectives based on changes in state law and evaluation of the
previous cycle Housing Element. The Housing Element update was prepared within the regulatory and policy
constraints of the city’s location completely within the Coastal Zone. The 5th cycle Housing Element update included a
stakeholder roundtable meeting, public workshop, and several meetings with the Planning Commission. The 4th cycle
Housing Element was certified in 2009 and the 5th cycle Housing Element was adopted in June 2014 (certified in
October 2014).
City of San Luis Obispo – Various Projects
CCTC has conducted numerous projects in the City of San Luis Obispo, many under an on-call contract held since
2012. CCTC staff has managed the transportation studies for the Orcutt Area Specific Plan EIR, Chevron Tank Farm EIR,
Avila Ranch Specific Plan, and Chinatown Mixed-Use Project EIR projects. CCTC acted as an extension of City staff as a
contract employee on the Circulation Element and Bicycle Transportation Plan updates. Other on-call projects include
traffic modeling support, peer review of traffic studies, railroad square parking study, and access management
guidelines, among others. Mr. Fernandez has managed these projects since 2006.
City of Paso Robles – Various Projects
CCTC staff has prepared numerous studies for projects in Paso Robles. Mr. Fernandez served as the project manager
for the City’s Circulation Element update which included the development of a citywide travel demand model. CCTC

Work Plan

Work Plan
This section provides the Michael Baker team’s understanding, approach, and work program for the proposed General
Plan and Local Coastal Program (LCP) Update (Update). Our understanding, approach, and work program are based on
City’s expectations as presented in the RFP and our collaboration with City staff, City Council, Planning Commission,
and other stakeholders to prepare the “Plan for the Plan” or draft work program for the Update. The work plan presents
our proposed approach to the Update, including a summary of all tasks. The proposed schedule is presented following
the work plan to ensure successful achievement of the project objectives.
Project Understanding
The City of Morro Bay intends to update its General Plan and LCP, preferably combining the two documents into a
single-user friendly document. As noted in the RFP, the City’s General Plan and LCP exist as the community’s
statement of its base values and as a shared vision for its future growth and development. It is intended to express how
citizens of Morro Bay view the community both now and in the future, and, most importantly, how the community
intends to address current and future planning and development issues.
We understand that the City intends to hire a consultant to lead preparation of the General Plan/LCP Update according
to California state law and legal guidelines during a two-year period from contract execution. All elements of the
General Plan, with the exception of the Housing Element, will require a comprehensive update as will the various
                                                                                                             Work Plan   41

  chapters of the LCP. The consultant will coordinate with City staff and the General Plan Advisory Committee throughout
  plan development. The City Council affirmed its commitment to the Update, including commitment of City resources to
  complete the Update by December 2017.
  Project Approach
  In order to deliver a user-friendly Update reflective of the community’s values and vision and which meets the key
  objectives of the project, the Michael Baker team focused on assembling a dedicated project team with relevant, multi-
  disciplinary, and local experience with significant involvement by local personnel and senior level staff, including the
  project director and firm principals. Our familiarity with Morro Bay and the Central Coast is complemented by our depth
  in experience with General Plan, LCP, and Zoning Ordinance updates, community engagement and outreach, and plans
  and programs to support community sustainability and resiliency.
  Sustainability and Resiliency
  The story of Morro Bay is one of resiliency in the face of new challenges. For many years, the economy and identity of
  the city depended on resource extraction and consumption. As Morro Bay positions itself for the future, it still honors
  the past, but through sustainable practices. For example, although commercial fisheries may have collapsed in the
  past, they are reemerging, thanks in part to sustainable fishery management. Similarly, although the Dynegy power
  plant lays dormant, the City has clean, sustainable energy plans in the works, bringing economic, community, and
  environmental benefits. Whereas past generations succeeded by taking advantage of resources in the city, the city’s
  economically and socially bright future will stem from its ability to manage resources, be they economic or natural,
  through sustainable, long-term strategies outlined in the Update.
  During our collaboration with the City to prepare the initial work program for the Update, we heard from stakeholders
  that economic vitality, land use, sustainability, and environmental protection and conservation would be key issues for
  the Update. As our project team reflected more on the issues and unique characteristics of Morro Bay’s past and
  present development, we identified a project approach for the City’s consideration that emphasizes economic,
  community, and environmental sustainability and resiliency as an integrating theme for the planning process and plan
  content. This approach enhances the traditional comprehensive planning process and is consistent with the proposed
  update to the OPR General Plan Guidelines, which emphasize designing resilient, equitable, healthy, resource efficient,
  and economically vibrant places.
42      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Sustainability is a long-term goal that guides our day-to-
day activities and decision-making about use of land and
natural resources to meet our social and economic needs.
A sustainable community will manage its financial, social,
and natural resources to meet current and future needs
adequately     and    equitably.   It   is   economically,
environmentally, and socially healthy and resilient to
chronic stresses and acute shocks. Unexpected natural
and man-made disasters can disrupt our economic and
community well-being, requiring immediate response. Additionally, chronic changes, such as sea level rise, require
strategic short and long-term decision-making to adapt to shifting conditions.
The City has a long history of working to protect valuable environmental resources, and residents continue to show
strong commitment toward making Morro Bay a sustainable and resilient place to live, work, and play. The City
continues to work with partners to improve the health of the estuary. The City has an adopted climate action plan and
has sought out and secured grant funding from both the Ocean Protection Council and the California Coastal
Commission to assess exposure to sea level rise and update the LCP. As local elected officials have noted,
sustainability must go beyond protecting environmental resources to ensure Morro Bay is poised to thrive socially and
economically over the long term in the face of greater or more frequent hazards.
A successful Update will document and support the City’s commitments to integrate solutions, taking a long-term and
comprehensive perspective that keeps the present and future in focus, ensuring long-term economic prosperity,
engaging citizens, striving for excellence in leadership and governance, engaging public and private partners for
support, and providing a safe, equitable, healthy, beautiful, and desirable place to live, work, play, and visit.
A sustainability and resiliency approach to the Update is aligned with the six components of the work program, and
provides an integrated, cost-effective, and pragmatic approach to resource decisions and capital investments that
supports balanced community development, economic growth, and robust natural, social, and economic systems
which can adapt to changing conditions without major disruption to function, structure, and identity. The approach
relies on a comprehensive community baseline assessment that will equip the consultant, staff, General Plan Advisory
Committee (GPAC), and community team to develop meaningful goals, policies, and implementation programs aligned
with community values and vision.
                                                                                                                  Work Plan 43

  Issues
   During preparation of the “Plan for the Plan” (the General Plan/LCP work program), Michael Baker facilitated a
  workshop attended by City staff, City Council members, planning commissioners, and interested stakeholders to
  identify key issues for the community and the Update and to discuss the approach to the Update. Key issues identified
  by the City and consultant team were separated into two categories: 1) issues for the process and 2) issues for the
  General Plan, LCP, and Zoning Ordinance Update that describe the City’s desired outcomes for the project, which are
  listed and summarized below.
                                    Issues for the Process
         Engaged and Active Community                                 Plan Accessibility and Usability
         Grant Funding Opportunities and Management                   Direct, Rapid, and Flexible Update Process

          Districts
  Issues for the Process
  Engaged and Active Community
  Morro Bay has a distinct opportunity to engage a significant percentage of the population in the effort to update the
  General Plan. The community is home to many engaged citizens who are invested in the future of their community, and
  many residents who are invested in their community but have yet to engage in any planning process. The challenge to
  this project team will be providing the community with the right opportunities to share their input. Engagement occurs
  not only when people care about the outcomes, but when there are accessible, welcoming ways to engage. The use of
  the recent CityVoice survey tool is an example of this, where the accessibility of engagement for all residents motivated
44      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

participation from those who had never before engaged
with local government. Our approach to community
engagement will expand upon this survey success with
neighborhood-based outreach meetings, and meetings
with     community     organizations,   business     owners,
community service providers, and others to encourage
participation in all aspects of General Plan development.
We will work with Code for America to bring subsequent
rounds of CityVoice surveys to Morro Bay, to help answer
big questions as we move through plan development.
The community engagement program will be capped by the GPAC, which will serve as a liaison between the
community and policy makers, ensuring that the community needs and desires expressed as part of the community
engagement process are addressed in the General Plan. Additionally, the GPAC will play an important role in promoting
and encouraging engagement, helping spread the word about the importance of the project from resident to resident.
Plan Accessibility and Usability
Accessibility and convenience are not only important for public participation. The current plans are bulky and
cumbersome to navigate by all users. In addition to outdated content, the combined plans are 1000+ pages and
cannot be easily cross navigated to support decision making. The General Plan, LCP, and Zoning Code are reviewed
regularly by decision makers (staff, City Council, Planning Commission), developers, review agencies, business
owners, and residents, and all have expressed frustration with outdated content, format, and style. The final documents
should consider a layout and style that prioritizes readability and access for all users.
A plan that is not usable will not be successfully implemented. Our approach to the plan, focusing on the identification
of needs, risks, and solutions, makes the format and layout of the plan more meaningful to residents. We’ve worked
behind the counter at the City of Morro Bay and other municipalities and understand the importance of documents that
prioritize readability and accessibility in format and style, with graphics, clear and concise wording, and cross-
referencing and checklists or navigation menus as minimum features. Additionally, our team understands the increasing
need for our governing documents to be available online—anywhere at anytime. We will work with staff, the GPAC, and
City Council to identify the most appropriate option for an online or digital General Plan, within the City’s resources.
                                                                                                                 Work Plan 45

  Grant Funding Opportunities and Management
  The City has been awarded two grants related to this project: 1) a $250,000 Ocean Protection Council grant to identify
  Morro Bay’s vulnerability to sea level rise and 2) a $147,000 Coastal Commission grant to support the LCP Update.
  Michael Baker project staff authored the successful Ocean Protection Council grant, as well as the first draft of the
  successful LCP grant. Staff on the Michael Baker team is also currently involved with implementing and reporting to the
  Coastal Commission for similar projects in California. The Michael Baker team will use this intimate knowledge of the
  grant programs, grant applications, and grant reporting process to maximize the benefit of these grants by ensuring
  their supporting work products are strategically developed to be useful across multiple parts of the project and
  coordinated with the timing limitations of these grant funding sources.
  The Michael Baker team has additional experience administering complex grants and will work with the City and the
  Ocean Protection Council and Coastal Commission to successfully administer the grants through the life of the project.
  We will assist in all phases of grant administration including monitoring to ensure billed activities are consistent with
  grant guidelines, preparing and submitting required financial and progress reports on behalf of the City to the granting
  agency, and leading the City through the grant closeout process.
  Additionally, the City has been competitive in large general plan grant opportunities but has yet to be awarded the
  funding necessary to comprehensively update the General Plan. The City expects that embarking on the initial phases of
  this work plan will make Morro Bay more competitive in future grant processes. While using existing internal and grant
  resources to initiate the first phases of the work program, the City anticipates applying for funding for additional grant
  resources to support later phases. The Michael Baker team developed the work plan to finish on time with existing
  funds, but in a way that is flexible enough to leverage interim accomplishments to support grant applications for
  funding opportunities as they arise.
  Direct, Rapid, and Flexible Update Process
  Since preparation of the initial work program for the Update, the City has dedicated funds to supplement grant funding,
  which will allow for the Update to proceed with minimal, if any, financial constraints. The initial project schedule
  assumed a 36-month schedule and a phasing approach to allow for discrete deliverables in response to limited
  funding. Since the City has confirmed the minimum budget for the Update, Michael Baker modified the work program to
  provide an efficient, cost-effective, and rapid plan development process. Currently, the City’s project schedule is
  constrained by funding and staffing. The process maintains the City’s goal to be direct and efficient while also being
  flexible enough to incorporate grant funding opportunities as they arise.
46      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Issues for the General Plan, LCP, and
Zoning Ordinance
While fulfilling statutory requirements of both California
general plan law and the California Coastal Act, the City
seeks to take an issue-based approach to the project. The
following paragraphs describe key issues the General
Plan, LCP, and Zoning Ordinance should address, as
identified by staff and community decision-makers during
a plan visioning session held on December 2, 2014.
These issues shape the work plan and serve as a starting
point for the Project Management and Community Engagement components of the project.
Economic Vitality
Economic vitality is the foremost priority for the project. The City has endured several economic transformations since
adopting the existing General Plan in 1988. The City has experienced the decline and rebuild of its commercial fishing
industry, the loss of jobs at the Dynegy power plant, and the rise of tourism as a primary economic driver. Morro Bay
has the social capital and physical infrastructure necessary to achieve substantial economic growth that provides head-
of-household jobs while also maintaining a robust tourist economy and enduring working-class legacy.
The City has already displayed a commitment to economic vitality by developing the Local Economic Action Plan
(LEAP), which it intends to implement through the Morro Bay Economic Development Strategic Plan (EDSP). The LEAP
is the product of more than 100 business and community leaders participating in two workshops and numerous action
team meetings and its initiatives and key steps represent the current desires of the City and the business community.
The Michael Baker team will leverage the LEAP findings to develop a General Plan that strongly enhances the City’s
economic vitality through expanding the tourism base and diversifying to other industries, including technology. The
Michael Baker team also intends to work with the consultants selected for the EDSP since research and analysis, such
as population and jobs projections, as well as the economic development potential of different land use alternatives
should be consistent between the General Plan and the EDSP.
Brownfield Development
Two major brownfield sites, the recently decommissioned Dynegy power plant and the City’s existing wastewater
treatment plant, along the City’s waterfront will cease operations and offer the City an opportunity to transition from
historical industrial land uses during the planning horizon for the Update.
                                                                                                            Work Plan   47

                                                                     Each site contains numerous challenges but presents
                                                                     considerable development opportunities. Potential
                                                                     challenges include expensive environmental cleanup
                                                                     and building demolition, and potential disagreement
                                                                     within the community about the range of possible
                                                                     future uses. Opportunities include the ability to add
                                                                     transportation connections; access to natural gas,
                                                                     electricity, water, and communications transmission
                                                                     lines; highly marketable waterfront locations; and
                                                                     wide-ranging economic development potential.
  The two brownfield sites feature prominently in the City’s 2015 LEAP. The Michael Baker team will work within the
  LEAP direction to “examine opportunities for re-use of power plant and sewage treatment plant when those spaces
  become available.” The Michael Baker team will help the City and the Power Plan Redevelopment Subcommittee
  consider multiple alternative uses for each site relative to City goals and priorities and will establish conditions under
  which each site could be developed to maximize community benefits and public and stakeholder support.
  Changing Coastal Conditions
  The City of Morro Bay’s commitment to coastal sustainability and resilience is paramount for the City’s future. Its iconic
  coastal setting and precious environmental resources require careful planning with extensive foresight. Fortunately, the
  state of California provides the critical policy framework and economic support to guide coastal cities toward a more
  sustainable and resilient future. In the recently adopted California Coastal Commission Sea Level Rise Policy Guidance
  (May 2015), the following fundamental guiding principles will form the roadmap for the LCP updates:
      Use science to guide decisions.
      Minimize coastal hazards through planning and development standards.
      Maximize protection of public access, recreation, and sensitive coastal resources.
      Maximize agency coordination and public participation.
  The Michael Baker team will use the best science to plan better for existing and future hazards associated with climate
  change and sea level rise. Update planning and development standards will allow the City to adapt to the future with a
  no-regrets approach such that the City can face future challenges with more resilience.
48     Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Why is this important? The City’s close relationship with the coast is a blessing, but not without economic and social
implications of proper stewardship. Examples of this include the following:
    Morro Bay Harbor is vital to the City’s economic well-being, provides great environmental benefit, and is a great
     recreational and public access resource.
    Ongoing harbor sedimentation requires dedicated federal and local funding to maintain navigation and the
     ecological health of the Morro Bay Estuary.
    The harbor is designated as a Critical Harbor of Refuge for the region, placing great value on maintaining harbor
     navigation.
    Sea level rise and projections of increasing storm intensity and frequency will increase vulnerabilities of shoreline
     and bluff-backed areas, and the sandspit.
    The working waterfront with Morro Bay Harbor is relatively low, as is typical of smallcraft harbors, and economics
     associated with infrastructure upgrades can be challenging.
Our team brings to the City an integrated approach to these existing and future challenges.
Working Waterfront and Commercial Fisheries
Morro Bay has a proud working waterfront and commercial fishing history. The industry is seeing a pronounced
comeback and continues to support the local economy. Because Morro Bay has one of the last working waterfronts in
the state, the City is committed to protecting this important cultural and economic asset. Morro Bay has a rich fishing
history despite incremental increasing of fishery regulations, foreign competition, aging workforce, and loss of
infrastructure on the waterfront. Being located on the Central Coast of California, Morro Bay possesses a great diversity
in commercial fishery landings when compared to other ports along the West Coast and includes species such as
salmon, groundfish (e.g., rockfish, sole), coastal pelagic species (e.g., squid, anchovies), tuna, swordfish, crab,
hagfish, white sea bass, halibut, and spot prawns. In 2007, commercial fishing landings in Morro Bay dropped to their
lowest level when 668,865 pounds valued at $1,695,930 were landed. Since 2007, landings in Morro Bay have
increased by nearly 900 percent with 2014 commercial fishing landings at 6,669,442 pounds valued at $8,297,265.
Despite the adversities, Morro Bay fishermen and related supporting commercial fishing businesses have had to adapt
to the changing fisheries and markets to be successful. Continued success by the Morro Bay commercial fishing
industry and their supporting businesses rely heavily on maintaining a viable working waterfront, which requires access
to offloading facilities, ice, fuel, docks, vessel slips, dry storage, live fish storage, and freezer storage. Morro Bay has
done well to date in maintaining the remaining critical fishing-related infrastructure the fishing fleet needs to operate.
However, to increase economic activities and to grow Morro Bay’s commercial fisheries, additional infrastructure will
be needed to ensure a prosperous working waterfront.
                                                                                                                 Work Plan   49

  Natural Resources and Amenities
  The City of Morro Bay and its environs feature stunning natural scenery, resources, and recreational amenities that are
  essential to the City’s identity. The Bay, Morro Rock, Morro Estuary Natural Preserve, the City’s beaches, and other
  natural habitats, open space, and recreational areas integrate to provide essential components of the quality of life that
  the City’s residents and visitors enjoy. We will work with the community and decision-makers to develop a General Plan
  that recognizes key resources and provides for an appropriate level of growth that retains and conserves the essential
  natural resources and amenities in the city. Resource protection policies will be designed to reflect current City values
  and state and federal requirements. Comprehensive consideration of natural resources and amenities will be provided,
  including open space and recreation, water quality, preservation of biological resources, identification and preservation
  of cultural (historic and prehistoric) resources, energy demand and conservation, air quality, and climate change/
  greenhouse gas emissions.
  Circulation System and Infrastructure Investments
  Much of the infrastructure supporting Morro Bay’s circulation network is nearing the end of its useful life, and General
  Plan policies prioritizing transportation infrastructure improvements are out of date (e.g., the Circulation Element refers
  to 1995 as the “future”). However, the City offers a well-established circulation network supportive of all modes of
  travel. Future land use changes, particularly on the City’s two major brownfield sites, offer the opportunity to improve
  the connectivity of the network to better serve residents and visitors. Change of uses at the brownfield sites will
  increase the importance of connectivity between north and central areas of Morro Bay. Long-planned improvements to
  the State Route 41/Main Street intersection and potential new vehicular connections to complement the recently
  completed bicycle and pedestrian bridge over Morro Creek could change existing travel patterns in the city, and more
  closely integrate north Morro Bay with the rest of the city.
  The City’s exceptional natural amenities serve residents and visitors alike. Visitor-serving uses are enhanced by the
  provision of safe, attractive, and convenient access supportive of this vital component of the economy. The mild climate
  and relatively flat topography support walking and biking, and the grid network in the downtown area offer a variety of
  travel routes spreading vehicular traffic. The Circulation Element update offers an opportunity to improve access and
  connectivity for all users by creating goals, policies, and procedures supportive of the land use and circulation visions.
  An overview of key circulation issues is provided below by area of the city.
50      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

North Morro Bay
North Morro Bay is predominantly residential with a mix of uses along Main Street. Highway 1 bisects this
neighborhoods to the east and west. Key circulation issues in this area are described below.
    Main Street parallels Highway 1 as a frontage road. The intersections of Main Street with Yerba Buena Street and
     San Jacinto Street are very close to Highway 1 and are difficult for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians to navigate.
     These intersections play a critical role in the connectivity across the highway, providing access to the beach, trails,
     and parks for the eastern neighborhoods and access to schools and shopping for western neighborhoods.
    The recently completed bicycle and pedestrian bridge over Morro Creek has shifted travel patterns in the area.
     Cyclists and pedestrians in north Morro Bay have an alternative route to access the Embarcadero and downtown
     areas mostly on Class I paths and along level low-volume residential streets. Improving the comfort and
     convenience of the Highway 1 crossings will increase the attractiveness of this route compared to the more heavily
     trafficked route across State Route 41. The planned Morro Bay to Cayucos Connector will further increase the
     attractiveness of cycling in the area.
    State Route 41 serves as an important regional connector with substantial local challenges. The State Route
     41/Main Street intersection is currently congested near the start and finish of the school day, and experiences high
     levels of pedestrian and cyclist activity from the high school during these times. Redevelopment of the City’s
     wastewater treatment plant could exacerbate the congestion at this location. Conversely, construction of a new
     vehicular connection across Morro Creek could shift traffic away from this intersection, potentially reducing the
     size of a roundabout or signal and improving conditions for pedestrians and cyclists.
Brownfield Sites
The power plant and wastewater treatment facility sites have the potential for redevelopment, which will affect
transportation demand throughout the area. The intensity of new development and the provision of a vehicular
connection across Morro Creek will play a large role on the circulation network.
Downtown and Embarcadero
A number of opportunities and constraints exist for the downtown and Embarcadero areas.
    Parking is an important component supporting the visitor-oriented uses in both areas. Many downtown streets have
     on-street parking with very wide travel lanes. While convenient for drivers, the wide roadways increase the crossing
     distances for pedestrians and often result in higher vehicle speeds.
    Pedestrian facilities are discontinuous in places and not wide enough to comfortably accommodate the number of
     visitors during busy weekends. Much of the Embarcadero provides 5-foot sidewalks, which are heavily used.
     Modification of the Embarcadero to improve pedestrian accommodation and vehicular flows has the potential to
     increase the attractiveness of this city asset to all users. Similarly, planning is under way to improve the
     connectivity between downtown and the Embarcadero, encouraging visitors to walk between these two attractive
     destinations.
    Commercial and recreational fishing is an integral part of the City’s culture and economy. The circulation network
     should support fishing activities by providing safe access routes for trailered boats, truck access for loading and
     unloading, and supporting haul-out and service facilities.
                                                                                                                 Work Plan   51

  The Michael Baker team understands that the City’s wastewater reclamation facility project is under way with the
  assistance of a team of consultants. The project will result in a new wastewater reclamation facility on a new site. The
  current plant will be decommissioned and the City will evaluate other options for the site as part of the General
  Plan/LCP Update process.
  The goals for the wastewater reclamation facility project are to produce tertiary disinfected wastewater, design for cost-
  effective reuse, allow for on-site composting, design for energy recovery, design to treat for contaminants of emerging
  concerns, design to allow for other municipal uses, ensure compatibility with neighboring land uses, and locate to
  avoid coastal and natural hazards. A facility master plan and environmental review is in progress with supporting
  technical documents. Based on the recent project schedule, preliminary planning, permitting, engineering, and
  procurement will occur concurrent with the planning process for the Update. The Michael Baker team will coordinate
  with City staff to review and incorporate technical studies and appropriate wastewater-related policies and programs
  into the Update for consistency with the wastewater reclamation facility. We will also confirm the site for the new
  wastewater reclamation facility with staff and discuss annexation issues or considerations for sites outside of the
  incorporated area.
  Distinct and Compatible Neighborhoods and Districts
  Morro Bay contains numerous distinct neighborhoods and districts, including, but not limited to, the north Morro Bay
  residential neighborhoods, the highway-serving commercial area along Main Street in north Morro Bay, downtown, the
  Embarcadero, and residential neighborhoods in the southeast. Neighborhood character and identity is an important
  issue to Morro Bay residents. Neighborhood character and quality is determined by existing uses and structures, who
  lives in each neighborhood and their personal vision for the area, current growth and development patterns,
  connectivity, walkability, and amenities, which include schools, parks, and access to activities. In response to requests
  by community members, elected officials, developers, and City staff for the need for neighborhood compatibility
  standards, the City drafted Interim Design Guidelines in 2015. The guidelines require design review of all single-family
  residential projects, including new structures and additions to existing structures. Most of Morro Bay is built out, and
  most new housing has been developed on infill sites. The intent of the Interim Design Guidelines is to help address the
  fact that the existing development standards are often unclear when dealing with projects that are controversial at the
  neighborhood level.
  A successful plan update will build upon the Interim Design Guidelines to provide neighborhood- and district-specific
  development policies that provide a clear picture of the City’s desired outcomes for the built environment, and will
  include changes to the Zoning Code related to allowed uses in each neighborhood and district. It will also update
  compatibility guidelines that aid staff, decision-makers, and the public in interpreting development standards.
52      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Stakeholders have also expressed a desire for the City to
use specific plans to maintain and enhance neighborhoods
and districts. The City’s current specific plans are out of
date and no longer contribute to the shared vision of the
community. A successful plan update will identify whether
and where specific plans or other focused planning tools
(e.g., neighborhood plans, community plans) may be
appropriate to achieve local objectives that are consistent
with but more detailed than the General Plan, and provide
standards to ensure new infill projects are consistent with
surrounding neighborhoods.
All of the updates described above will be informed by the Community Engagement process which will include
outreach to neighborhood groups. Michael Baker will also bring our knowledge of innovative concepts and best
practices related to infill development. Finally, consistency with Coastal Zone requirements will be maintained when
drafting policies and standards to implement neighborhood identity and compatibility.
Local Coastal Program and Coastal Commission Coordination
The purpose of an LCP is to establish the framework and mechanisms of how a local jurisdiction will carry out the state
Coastal Act’s mandate to protect coastal resources and maximize public access to the shoreline. The City intends to
update the LCP along with the General Plan, combining the two documents into a single user-friendly document. This
approach is appropriate as Morro Bay is almost entirely within the Coastal Zone and subject to Coastal Act provisions.
Preparing LCPs is a unique planning effort that must take the specific context of coastal planning, as well as the latest
statewide approaches to coastal issues, into consideration. The evolving knowledge and understanding of coastal
issues requires an awareness of new information and close coordination with Coastal Commission staff.
In addition to the Coastal Commission staff consultation being incorporated into every stage of this project, team
members’ current work on the Hermosa Beach, Carlsbad, Goleta, and Oxnard LCP updates uniquely positions us to be
at the forefront of current best practices, Coastal Commission direction, and policy considerations. Ongoing
consultation with Coastal Commission staff throughout these projects will enable us to bring the most recent Coastal
Commission input on these issues to Morro Bay for consideration.
                                                                                                            Work Plan     53

  Core Components of the Update
  As noted in the preliminary work plan that Michael Baker prepared for the City, the City would like the General Plan to
  serve as both a blueprint and a road map. It should set forth a legislative intent and establish basic ground rules for how
  the City will undertake development and conservation over the next 15–20 years. Our team’s proposed approach to the
  Update includes the following six core components, which will result in a consolidated and comprehensive General
  Plan/LCP Update.
          Community Engagement                      Community Vision                      Blueprint + Greenprint
                                                Implementation Program
                                                                                          Project Management &
                 Environmental                  (Coastal Implementation
                                                                                          Coordination, including
                   Assessment                        Program, Zoning
                                                                                           Coastal Commission
                                                        Ordinance)
  Visioning and Community Engagement
  The vision will be developed as the first component of the work program, building on engagement activities initiated by
  the GPAC. The project team will engage a broad spectrum of community residents in innovative and diverse ways. The
  General Plan relies on a fundamental underlying vision to help the community maintain a long-term view when making
  important short-term decisions about things like:
      Where to allow new development projects and what they should look like
      How to attract new head-of-household jobs and economic growth
      Where and how to provide housing for families and seniors
      Reducing traffic congestion and providing ways to get around without a car
      Maintaining and improving sewer, water, and storm drain infrastructure
      How to protect or enhance important resources such as parks, open space, habitat, and beaches
      Maintaining public safety
      Protecting residents and businesses from natural hazards
54     Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Blueprint and Greenprint
The development aspect of the General Plan can be
considered the City’s blueprint plan, while the conservation
aspect can be considered the City’s greenprint plan. These
plans share a common vision, and must be consistent with
and support one another. The blueprint plan identifies the
role of land use and circulation planning in supporting
resource conservation and sustainability. In turn, the
greenprint plan identifies the role of resource conservation and sustainability in supporting Morro Bay’s economy.
Community Baseline Assessment
In support of the blueprint, greenprint, and environmental assessment, the project team will conduct a community
baseline assessment. The assessment will begin as an existing conditions report and set the baseline conditions for the
EIR, and evolve to include an assessment of how baseline conditions currently respond to existing stressors such as
natural hazards and economic disruptions. This step will result in the sustainability and resiliency framework for the
blueprint and greenprint.
As a first step, we will identify the socioeconomic characteristics of the community, social services and resources,
public services and infrastructure serving the city, natural resources and ecosystem services in the city as well as those
serving the city from external sources (e.g., water supply), parks and recreation resources, transportation resources,
economic resources, and potential climate change impacts to the community, among other critical assets. As part of
this assessment, we will also update the policy and regulatory audit of the City’s plans and codes that we prepared for
the City in 2014 as part of the work program for the Update.
Following the compilation of the existing resources and their conditions, we will conduct a sustainability and resiliency
assessment to understand how the City’s social, economic, natural, and physical systems and assets in their current
condition function and respond to a wide range of stressors including current and projected economic, hazardous,
environmental, and climate conditions. For each key topic in the community baseline assessment, we will evaluate
existing assets’ and systems’ current performances during times of stress (e.g., off-season economy, drought,
flooding), discuss how those systems or assets could perform in likely future conditions (e.g., flooding from sea-level
rise, more days of extreme heat, economic disruption), and identify assets or systems that require policy or program
direction in the Update. The assessment will be initiated by the Michael Baker team, but will rely heavily on local
expertise through the engagement of City staff, GPAC, key stakeholders, and the community to fully understand the
strengths (adaptive capacity), weaknesses (vulnerabilities), and opportunities to enhance community sustainability and
resilience through the Update. This approach allows for local control and determination, guided by the Michael Baker
team’s experience and expertise, over how sustainability and resiliency are defined, understood, and ultimately
achieved in the Update.
                                                                                                              Work Plan    55

                                                                 Environmental Assessment
                                                                 During this phase we will prepare the General Plan
                                                                 Program EIR (PEIR) to analyze the potential impacts of
                                                                 the draft General Plan. The PEIR will provide a clear,
                                                                 concise overview of the programmatic nature of impacts
                                                                 associated with implementation of the General Plan. This
                                                                 document      will  inform   decision-makers     and    the
                                                                 community about future decisions regarding General Plan
  policies and implementation programs. The PEIR will be structured to meet the requirements of the California
  Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and to streamline future City consideration of development and public works projects
  consistent with the General Plan, when possible.
  We will prepare the PEIR in parallel with the General Plan goals, policies, and implementation programs, isolating and
  cataloguing those actions with potential to affect the physical environment. We will also develop policies to integrate
  into the draft General Plan that “self-mitigate” potential environmental impacts to the maximum extent feasible. This
  self-mitigating, proactive approach will minimize reliance on external mitigation measures, streamline future CEQA
  coverage for future projects, and allow the City to monitor the effectiveness of General Plan policies. The PEIR will also
  build off the City’s recently adopted Climate Action Plan and will anticipate emerging sustainability requirements (water
  demand, energy efficiency) in development standards.
  The General Plan/LCP PEIR will be prepared as a Community-Level EIR, consistent with Public Resources Code
  21159.20(d), and as a Program EIR, consistent with State CEQA Guidelines Section 15168. The goal of this approach
  is to establish the opportunity for the City to use the PEIR for environmental review of future, General Plan-consistent
  actions and projects, in accordance with State CEQA Guidelines Section 15168(c) and (d). When a project is
  consistent with the General Plan and all of its significant impacts have been addressed in the General Plan PEIR, the
  project may be determined to be “within the scope” of the PEIR, and no additional environmental document would be
  required. In other cases, the General Plan PEIR may be used to limit the topics that must be addressed in a later
  environmental document on a project consistent with the General Plan.

Clear Path to Implementation
Implementation is an integral part of the planning process,
not an afterthought. Plan policies are developed to a level
of detail to ensure a clear understanding of how they will
be implemented. Zoning regulations implement plan
policies with clear direction and straightforward standards.
It will be critical to ensure that the Update achieves the
desired results by guiding development and incorporating
the appropriate use of allowances, design standards, and
administrative provisions into the zoning regulations.
In Morro Bay, the Zoning Ordinance is also the Coastal Implementation Plan, providing specific development
regulations (and exemptions) for certain coastal zone activities. It also sets forth the criteria and procedures for
processing and approving City-issued coastal development permits. The Zoning Code Update will also need to address
other issues, such as neighborhood compatibility and economic development, consistent with direction in the General
Plan. Development standards can ensure new infill projects are consistent with surrounding neighborhoods. Use
allowances can help achieve economic development objectives.
                                                                                                         Work Plan   57
  Work Plan
  As noted in the RFP, the City will consider some deviation from the established work plan if a deviation would better
  serve the City in accomplishing the goals of this project. The initial work plan was prepared to provide a sequence of
  tasks to assist the City to complete the project across at least three fiscal years, producing complete deliverables at the
  end of sequential phases tied to discrete grant funding sources. In the interim, the City has secured a known amount of
  funding, and the schedule has been reduced from three years to two years. Therefore, we feel that the project can be
  streamlined in a manner that produces the blueprint plan and the greenprint plan simultaneously. This will reduce the
  number of CEQA environmental documents to be prepared, and enables the community engagement process to be
  more streamlined and effective.
  Based on our proposed revisions to the work plan, the project is now organized into six main tasks, supplemented by
  detailed subtasks describing the work to be undertaken:
      Project Initiation and Visioning
      Blueprint and Greenprint Preparation
      Environmental Assessment
      Zoning Ordinance Update and Coastal Implementation Plan
      Community Engagement
      Meetings and Project Management
  Because most of Morro Bay is in the coastal zone, the City intends to prepare an integrated General Plan/LCP Update.
  Under this structure, the coastal Land Use Plan (LUP) would be presented as part of the blueprint plan, resource-based
  components of the LCP would be presented as part of the greenprint plan, and coastal zoning provisions would be
  established in the Coastal Implementation Plan (CIP). Coordination with the California Coastal Commission to explain
  and implement this structure will be required.
  The work plan described below and illustrated on the process diagram on the following page identifies important tasks
  to be completed as part of each main task. For each task, subtasks are identified describing proposed methodologies
  and specific deliverable products associated with the work to be performed.

  60     Proposal to the City of Morro Bay
Task 1: Project Initiation and Visioning
This initial task has two objectives: (1) setting
expectations and protocols for project management, and
(2) completing a community visioning process to
establish a vision and supporting principles for the
General Plan Update.
1.1       Project Kickoff
The Michael Baker team will conduct an all-day kickoff meeting providing an opportunity for City staff and project team
members to get together and identify data sources and other resources to be used in the program, brainstorm ideas,
and allow the Michael Baker team to enhance our knowledge of Morro Bay. As part of the project kickoff task, we will
also develop and agree on a preliminary master outline for the vision, blueprint, greenprint, Zoning Ordinance, and CIP.
All Michael Baker project team members will participate in the kickoff meeting.

1.2       CityVoice Community Visioning
Because updating the General Plan, LCP, and Zoning Ordinance is in part triggered by the need to respond to
demographic change, it is appropriate to also revisit the vision for Morro Bay to ensure the community’s desired future
is accurately reflected in the plan documents. Community visioning should also provide information about the process,
with the goal of setting the stage for more focused policy discussions during subsequent phases. Once agreed upon,
the vision will serve as a foundation for each of the plans and will not be revisited during subsequent technical phases
of the project.
The Michael Baker team will convene community visioning early in the process to both announce the project and build
the foundation of a shared vision for the future. Due to the historically low level of attendance at community meetings,
Michael Baker recommends conducting citywide visioning outreach using CityVoice. We understand the City has
recently completed an effective CityVoice outreach process, which produced high levels of participation and valuable
community insights. We suggest using CityVoice for the initial community visioning process, in lieu of a
communitywide workshop. By placing signs throughout the City in high-trafficked areas, participants will be able to
participate on their own terms from locations that are convenient to them and relevant to the project. In addition to a
                                                                                                        Work Plan   61

number of structured questions, the telephone survey could include an open-ended question that asks participants to
share their vision for the future of Morro Bay. The results of a community visioning process will be summarized for
decision-makers in a graphically compelling document that articulates the vision and supporting principles that will
guide the project and its outcomes. This vision document serves as a statement of the direction that the community is
moving toward, and helps guide future policy discussions.

Task 2: Blueprint and Greenprint Preparation
This phase identifies tasks necessary to build from the vision established in Task 1 to complete the blueprint and
greenprint plans. The blueprint combines general plan requirements and options related to land use, economic
development, community design, circulation, and noise, and addresses development-oriented provisions of the coastal
LUP. Although not included as part of this work program, the City’s 5th cycle Housing Element may also become a part
of the blueprint. The greenprint combines general plan requirements and options related to conservation, open space,
safety, sustainability, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, and addresses conservation-oriented provisions of
the coastal LUP.
2.1       Community Baseline Assessment
This task describes steps to prepare a background report that informs the blueprint plan. This step is meant to take
stock of existing social, natural, and built environmental resources, systems, and assets and convey their value as
potential development or conservation opportunities or constraints. For each applicable topic, a sustainability and
resiliency assessment will be conducted that reviews how systems and assets in the planning area are vulnerable to
changing economic, social, and climate conditions. This assessment will inform blueprint and greenprint goals,
policies, and action At a minimum, the community baseline assessment will include discussion of the following
blueprint and greenprint topics as appropriate, supplemented by other subjects identified as important by City staff and
the community during the visioning process. A secondary goal of this effort is to identify and document baseline
conditions for the EIR.

Blueprint Topics
Annexation Feasibility
To support the City’s decision regarding whether or not to
annex adjacent areas, Michael Baker will prepare a report
analyzing the feasibility of several different expansion
scenarios based on fiscal assumptions and community
goals. The feasibility study will be based in large part on
technical information provided by existing City service
providers, geographic information systems (GIS), LAFCO
interviews, and technical analysis conducted to support
other parts of the project. It will consider both the physical and regulatory context.
Michael Baker will summarize up to three expansion scenarios, comprising a map, geographically based service
information (e.g. water, sewer lines, call rates, service times), and the objective of the scenario. A spreadsheet model
analysis will be presented along with analysis of the relative merits of each development scenario. We will meet with
staff to fine-tune the analysis, review the draft summary report for the scenarios, and make edits based on staff input.
We will also prepare materials for and attend a GPAC meeting or study session to present the results of the analysis.
This report will be used to identify whether expansion areas on the periphery of the city should be considered for land
use change in the alternatives analysis.
Economic Conditions and Market Trends
Michael Baker will prepare a market trends analysis that provides economic context for the project. The analysis will
consider local economic and demographic conditions and trends, and provide comparisons to regional or statewide
conditions. Conclusions will assess the growth and market opportunities that can be expected, given the general growth
outlook for the area and the specific competitive attributes of Morro Bay’s various real estate sectors, including
residential, retail, office, and coastal-dependent and non-coastal-dependent industrial uses. This analysis will be used
to identify focus areas within the city to be considered for future land use change in the alternatives analysis, and
provide a basis for establishing future land use projections.
Fishing, Boating, and Visitor-Serving Needs
Ecological Assets Management (EAM), with support from Michael Baker, will conduct research and analysis to assess
the needs of the fishing, boating, and visitor-serving economic sectors in the Morro Bay area to sustain existing
economic activities and/or transition and grow in the future. EAM will begin by assessing the historic and current
commercial fishing landings from both state and federal fisheries data sources from the California Department of Fish
                                                                                                        Work Plan   63

and Wildlife and PacFin (Pacific Fisheries Information Network). EAM will assess historic and current fishing-related
infrastructure to assess what has been lost over time and what types of projects (or specific projects) could encourage
and increase additional economic opportunities on the waterfront for the commercial fishing industry. In addition,
research and analysis of the needs of the commercial fishing industry and supporting businesses will be conducted
through interviews and interaction with key community members, fishery stakeholders, commercial fishermen, the
Morro Bay Commercial Fishermen’s Organization, the Morro Bay Community Quota Fund, and fishery business owners.
EAM will research and analyze other successful West Coast fishing ports with working waterfronts, such as Santa
Barbara and Moss Landing, to assess their strategies and successes in creating successful, sustainable fishing
communities. These efforts will result in policy and regulatory recommendations for the General Plan and LCP Update
that will foster these efforts at the planning and regulatory approval levels. This assessment will also consider and
provide recommendations regarding other qualitative needs, such as marketing and promotion.
Infrastructure and Public Services
Michael Baker will collaborate with City, County, and service providers to collect and summarize information regarding
the current status of existing wet utilities, including water, wastewater, and storm drainage infrastructure in the planning
area. This assessment will be informed by ongoing efforts related to the water reclamation facility project. We will also
summarize dry utility availability capacity and potential to serve outlying areas for electrical and natural gas, telephone,
cable television, and Internet communication services. We will identify the existing regulatory framework and known
potential changes to the framework (e.g., National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, California
Department of Public Health, California Accidental Release Program) affecting the capacity or operation of existing
infrastructure.
Land Use, Community Form, and Coastal Uses
Michael Baker will assess existing land uses, neighborhood and district identities, historic and current growth and
development patterns, physical constraints, brownfield sites and other potential infill development locations, and vacant
and underutilized lands. To meet both General Plan and LCP requirements, Michael Baker will define the planning area,
inclusive of potential annexation areas; analyze land capability relative to future growth for the planning period; collect
and summarize information describing visitor services available in the coastal zone; inventory and describe the
affordability of accommodations available to beach visitors and housing affordable to visitor service workers; identify
existing coastal-dependent and coastal priority land uses; and describe existing zoning regulations applicable to these
uses.

Noise
Rincon will perform acoustic, noise, and vibration analysis to
establish the existing and future noise setting for the planning
area. Rincon will work with City staff to review noise
complaint files as compiled by all City departments in order
to assess the following:
    Location and types of major offending noise sources.
    Noise-sensitive areas and land uses.
    Community attitudes toward specific sources of noise pollution.
    Degree of severity of noise problems in the community.
    Relative significance of noise as a pollutant.
Rincon will evaluate existing transportation noise levels adjacent to major roadways and transportation corridors, and
conduct a community noise survey consisting of several short- and long-term measurements at strategic locations.
Specifically, Rincon will conduct 20-minute short-term noise measurements at up to eight locations, including
locations near stationary noise sources, and locations along heavily traveled roadways during morning and evening
peak commute periods. The measurements will be taken using an ANSI Type II sound level meter. Rincon will calibrate
noise modeling based on these measurements. Using the Federal Highway Administration’s Traffic Noise Model,
Rincon will provide noise level estimates suitable for producing existing noise contours along up to 14 road segments,
based on traffic volumes collected and modeled for the project.
Transportation and Mobility
CCTC will describe the existing General Plan policies, street classifications, and circulation system. Existing plans and
plans under development, including the current Circulation Element, Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan, Parking
Management Plan, and Downtown/Waterfront Strategic Plan, will be reviewed, analyzed, and described. Existing
transportation conditions will be characterized and analyzed as described below.
Study locations and analysis time periods will be determined in consultation with City staff. A preliminary list of study
intersections is provided below.
    San Jacinto Street/Highway 1                                State Route 41/Main Street
    San Jacinto Street/Main Street                              Morro Bay Boulevard/Main Street
    State Route 41/Highway 1 SB Ramps                           Morro Bay Boulevard/Quintana Road
                                                                                                        Work Plan    65

CCTC will collect new traffic counts, including pedestrians and bicycles, during two peak hours at each study
intersection. The appropriate study time periods (e.g., typical weekdays vs. summer weekends) will be determined in
consultation with City staff. Intersection vehicular level of service (LOS) will be calculated for the study intersections.
Existing citywide vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data will also be prepared by origin and destination relative to locations
within and outside the city.
CCTC will evaluate the following roadway segments for multimodal vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle level of service:
     Embarcadero south of Pacific                                  Main Street south of Radcliff
     Morro Bay Boulevard west of Quintana                          State Route 41 east of Main Street
These segments are scheduled for new counts by the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG) in late 2015.
New segment counts, if needed, can be conducted as an additional service. Vehicular LOS will be determined based on
generalized daily roadway capacities, while pedestrian and bicycle LOS will be calculated for peak hour conditions
consistent with 2010 Highway Capacity Manual methods.
CCTC will describe the current status of the following transportation systems:
     Pedestrian facilities
     Bicycle facilities (Class I-III)
     Transit services, both local and regional
     Roadways, including truck routes for goods movement
     Parking, including parking at beach and waterfront access points and trailheads
     Waterfront facilities, including access for commercial fishermen and haul-out facilities
Collision data will be obtained for up to ten intersections. Collision rates will be
calculated and compared to the statewide average for similar facilities. Locations
with high collision rates or a notable collision pattern will be identified. The image
at right shows injury and fatal collision hot spots throughout the city based on five
years of collision data.
The SLOCOG travel demand model will be used to extract VMT under baseline
conditions, stratified by trips within origins and destinations completely and
partially within the City’s borders.
Michael Baker will assist CCTC by mapping and describing beach access points
and parking availability and pricing in nearby areas, and describing existing beach
access hours and parking regulations and restrictions.
                                                                                                              Work Plan     66

Greenprint Topics
Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Rincon will analyze and assess current air quality
conditions in the planning area (e.g., ambient monitoring
data, attainment designations, source types) and
summarize       the    applicable   regulatory    framework,
standards, plans, and significance thresholds for criteria
air pollutants, toxic air contaminants, and odors.
Michael Baker will perform a peer review of the
greenhouse gas emissions inventory data prepared for the Morro Bay Climate Action Plan by the San Luis Obispo Air
Pollution Control District to ensure the baseline year, emissions factors, and activity data are suitable for use in the
General Plan. If necessary, Michael Baker will update the emissions inventory to adjust the baseline year, correct any
discrepancies, or incorporate new state-of-practice methods. We will assess existing climate conditions in the planning
area (e.g., existing greenhouse gas emissions by sector), the current state of the science, and foreseeable effects of
climate change as they relate to Morro Bay and applicable federal, state, and local greenhouse gas emissions
regulations.
Coastal Resources and Resiliency
Moffatt and Nichol, with support from Michael Baker, will prepare the coastal resources and resiliency assessment to
be consistent with the California Adaptation Planning Guide and guidance accompanying the California Ocean Protection
Council grant.
Identify Existing Coastal Conditions. The first step of the baseline assessment for coastal resources and resiliency will
be to identify lands, environmentally sensitive lands, and infrastructure located within the coastal zone in various
planning areas to be identified for the LCP. With these resources identified and characterized, the next step is to
understand their physical characteristics to begin the assessment of potential vulnerabilities to sea level rise. This effort
will include gathering the best available aerial photographs and topographic and bathymetric survey data. The following
available data types/sources have been identified, and will be used to create a seamless digital elevation model (DEM)
for the planning area:
     Coastal Zone topography/bathymetry: 2013 California Merged Coastal LIDAR Project DEM
     Bathymetry: 2009 USACE Southern California Bathy LIDAR
     Upland topography: 2008 US Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset
                                                                                                         Work Plan      67

We will also draw upon the broad range of existing data and studies for the planning area, including harbor, shoreline,
and environmental studies conducted by and for the US Army Corps of Engineers. We will review maps, surveys,
drainage reports, and land use plans, and conduct a visual assessment of existing conditions to identify potential
vulnerabilities for different reaches of the shoreline.
Prepare Geo-Referenced Inventory Potentially Affected by Sea Level Rise. We understand the value of the GIS platform
to inform the decision-making process, and our team includes GIS experts who specialize in compiling and organizing
disparate data sources into spatially orientated databases. Working in collaboration with City GIS staff, M&N will
prepare a geodatabase from which the flooding, inundation, and erosion layers can be overlaid with various land uses
and coastal resources to identify particularly hazardous areas. The base map will include coastal resources (e.g.,
beaches and wetlands), the built environment (e.g., tourist-serving amenities, roadways, pedestrian and bike paths,
parking lots, buildings, utility infrastructure), land uses (e.g. vulnerable populations) and shoreline protective devices
(e.g., breakwaters, seawalls, bulkheads and jetties). The base map will be compiled from data collected from the City,
community members, and resource agencies as well as original data generated by the project team.
M&N will collaborate with the City to identify available and relevant attribute data relevant to future sea level rise
vulnerabilities to infrastructure, such as critical elevations, structure type, year built, replacement cost, and condition.
M&N will also use and build upon existing GIS data to be provided by the City. Metadata will be developed for each
feature class to allow data to be efficiently used in the future. Large-scale graphics will be prepared for stakeholder and
agency meetings to support information sharing.
Identify Sea Level Rise Scenarios and Model Cumulative Effects. The Coastal Commission guidance document points
to the National Research Council’s Sea-Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon and Washington (August 2012)
as the “best available science” for the state. Based on this guidance, the following sea level rise projections will be
used for the LCP planning horizons:
              Table 1.              Sea-Level Rise Projections – Locations South of Cape Mendocino
                          Time Period                Sea-Level Rise Projections (Year 2000 Baseline)
                                2030                                    0.13 to 0.98 feet
                                2050                                     0.39 to 2.0 feet
                                2100                                    1.38 to 5.48 feet
Coastal Flooding Hazards. Per the Ocean Protection Council guidance included in the RFP, we will model three sea
level rise scenarios (low, projected, and high) for three planning horizons (2030, 2050, and 2100). By applying the low
and high projections for each planning horizon, the potential range of impacts on each planning area will be evaluated.
  68      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

The proposed modeling approach is based on the methods used in the Coastal Storm Modeling System, as developed
by the USGS.
Cliff and bluff erosion rates will be based on existing studies and available information. The generally accepted
approach is to prorate historic erosion rates into future planning horizons. A backshore characterization of the coastline
will be developed based on geologic data from the California Geological Survey. Historic bluff erosion rates will be
extracted from the National Assessment of Shoreline Change Project, as developed by the USGS. If multiple LIDAR data
sets exist, verification of these erosion rates will be performed.
Coastal flooding hazard resulting from the various planning horizons will be mapped within the ArcGIS platform. A
spatial aggregation approach will be utilized to depict the relative probability of coastal hazards in each particular area.
Fluvial Flooding Hazards. The City of Morro Bay has a history of flooding along the lower reaches of Morro Creek and
Chorro Creek as well as localized flooding along other smaller creeks. Some of the City’s critical infrastructure (power
plant and wastewater treatment facility) is located within the existing 100-year floodplain of Morro Creek.
Sea level rise will result in a higher downstream water level that could potentially exacerbate flooding along low-lying
creeks and drainage systems. Step 1 of the approach will be a desktop study of the current flood hazards using
information from previous hydraulic analyses and FEMA floodplain mapping studies to understand the extent to which
these drainage systems may be affected by sea level rise. For creeks or drainage systems that may be vulnerable to
rising sea levels, a sensitivity analysis will be performed (Step 2) to estimate how fluvial flood hazards may be affected
by a range of sea level rise scenarios.
Analyze Sea Level Rise Vulnerability. Morro Bay generally lies on the narrow coastal shelf between the ocean and the
coastal hills. Most of the coastline is dominated by flat sandy beaches that rise to dunes or short coastal bluffs.
Significant portions of the bayfront are lined by man-made rock revetment or occupied by waterfront structures. Coastal
bluffs and isolated natural rock outcroppings, including Morro Rock, and the estuarine shoreline comprise the
remaining portions. The wide variety of coastal features and terrain results in a broad range of potential sea level rise
vulnerabilities.
Once coastal hazard areas have been defined, we will determine the vulnerability posed to Morro Bay’s beaches,
estuary, bluffs, visitor-serving amenities, waterfront, and residences as a result of sea level rise. The vulnerability of an
asset exposed to sea level rise will be assessed by evaluating its specific sensitivity to that impact and its resiliency or
ability to adapt to that change, as presented in the state of California Sea-Level Rise Guidance Document (CO-CAT). For
example, an asset that is sensitive to a sea level rise hazard with limited adaptive capacity would be considered highly
vulnerable. Barriers to an asset’s ability to adapt will be identified, as well as stressors that affect an asset’s capacity to
accommodate sea level rise. Asset vulnerabilities will be ranked for low and high sea level rise scenarios for each
                                                                                                             Work Plan    69

planning horizon. This ranking will enable the City to identify the most vulnerable areas and prioritize adaptation
responses within the planning area.
Once the vulnerabilities have been identified, a risk assessment will be conducted. It is essential to note that
vulnerability and risk are not the same. The risk to a given coastal resource or land use depends on: 1) the magnitude of
the impact (consequence), and 2) the likelihood of that impact occurring (probability). If a given asset has a high
vulnerability to sea level rise but low consequence, the level of risk may be tolerable. On the other hand, an asset with
low vulnerability but high consequence of failure may be considered a high risk. The consequence, probability, and
resulting risk to a given asset will be evaluated at the 2030, 2050, and 2100 time horizons using state sea-level rise
guidance (CO-CAT).
The risk assessment will focus on how sea level rise might affect people, development, infrastructure, and natural
resources in each planning area. The approach identifies “impact thresholds” for each asset or coastal resource,
describing the sea level rise scenario that triggers significant consequences to each asset. A magnitude of the
consequence (low/moderate/high) will be assigned based on the potential for damage or disruption of service that each
asset would experience for a given sea level rise scenario. Similarly, a qualitative probability (low/moderate/high) will
be assigned based on the likelihood of occurrence for a given “impact threshold.”
We will prioritize public and private resources or land uses at risk. The analysis will be based on existing and proposed
land uses and maps of planned development patterns under the proposed General Plan. An example of how resources
and assets in the planning area may be evaluated and ranked is shown in the figure and table below.

                       Inundation
Identify Adaptation Policy Framework. Once at-risk areas have been identified and prioritized, M&N will develop
adaptation strategies to minimize risks from hazards and to protect coastal resources and assets. A sea level rise action
plan will be prepared to present these strategies, based on the results of the vulnerability assessment and stakeholder
input. The plan will identify near-term and long-term strategies to build adaptive capacity into the City’s resources. The
plan will evaluate accommodation, protection, and retreat strategies as appropriate. The natural environment is
generally more equipped to adapt and accommodate change if sufficient room exists for natural migration. Conversely,
due to its fixed, rigid nature, the built environment typically cannot adapt to change and human intervention is often
needed to protect, fortify, or relocate the structure. In line with the State’s Safeguarding California for Reducing Climate
Risk guidance, strategies that protect vulnerable populations, achieve multiple benefits, and incorporate green
infrastructure solutions will be preferred.
Natural and Environmental Hazards
Michael Baker will characterize and assess natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes, flooding, landslides, tsunamis) and
environmental hazards (e.g., soil and groundwater contamination, hazardous materials storage) in Morro Bay. We will
also assess known hazardous materials sites and major hazardous materials users/producers. We will update and
characterize the general nature of geologic hazards in the city, including liquefaction, seismic activity, tsunami
inundation, and landslides, and review and document historic flooding information, together with Federal Emergency
Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate Maps and existing hydrologic investigations.
Natural Resources
Rincon, with support from EAM, will identify past and current occurrences of state and federally listed threatened,
endangered, and candidate plant species and all species listed by the California Native Plant Society. This section of
                                                                                                            Work Plan    71

the background report will assess potential occurrences of special-status species based on the habitat requirements of
each species relative to the habitat present in the city and known estuarine and fisheries resources. The analysis will
characterize major vegetation communities, including identification of greenways and gulches, timberland resources,
and agricultural uses. We will describe other natural resources, such as coastal wetlands, wildlife movement corridors,
and riparian habitats, and summarize the federal, state, and local regulatory framework applicable to these resources.
Parks and Recreation
Michael Baker will identify important open space resources, and parks and recreational facilities serving Morro Bay. We
will analyze current park service levels (e.g., park acreage per 1,000 population), identify any shortfall of park space
and recreational amenities, and describe existing recreational programs and services for residents of all ages.
Shoreline Erosion and Protection
M&N will characterize and assess shoreline erosion and protection opportunities in the city. Based on existing data and
studies, historic shoreline erosion rates will be presented. Future erosion trends as a result of sea level rise will then be
extrapolated using standard analysis methodologies such as the Bruun Rule. Plan views of each of the planning areas
exhibiting predicted shoreline erosion issues will be developed. These will be useful tools (combined with input from
the City and Coastal Commission) to support recommendations for setback requirements in areas subject to erosion.
We will closely collaborate with City staff to identify any required solutions to coastal access arising from sea level rise.
Water Supply and Quality
Michael Baker will describe current and anticipated future water demand and supply in Morro Bay. We will characterize
and assess surface and groundwater supply sources and reliability of sources, describe current water quality conditions
and identify pollutants of concern, and summarize existing and pending regulatory requirements applicable to water
supply and quality, including stormwater retention and sustainable groundwater requirements.
Michael Baker will assemble these baseline conditions assessments into an administrative draft community baseline
assessment report. Following review by City staff, we will incorporate staff comments to prepare a revised draft
community baseline assessment report for review by the community and advisory committee.

2.2       Key Issues and Policies
Based on work completed in previous tasks and findings from the background report, the consultant team will prepare a
summary of community issues to be addressed in the blueprint plan. Parallel to the resiliency planning process, at this
stage, we consider the vulnerability index for each background topic and define key community needs and priorities to
be addressed in the blueprint and greenprint. As a part of this effort, we will identify and discuss the most important and
potentially controversial policy issues and options (e.g., growth policy, changes to land use designations or density,
sea level rise adaptation strategies).
Michael Baker team members will define key issues and recommend policy approaches to meet community needs in a
summary working paper. These issues and policies will be presented to the Planning Commission and/or the City
Council in a study session format to further develop and review important issues prior to drafting goals, policies, and
actions.

2.3       Blueprint and Greenprint Alternatives Analysis
This task describes development and analysis of up to three alternative land use, circulation, and conservation
scenarios to address the range of key issues previously identified, ultimately defining a preferred blueprint plan and a
preferred greenprint plan.
Blueprint
The Michael Baker team will provide an outline of up to three concept blueprint alternatives for focus areas identified in
the market trends analysis and any identified expansion areas from the annexation feasibility study. Following staff
review and comment, the team will develop up to three detailed blueprint alternatives for review and deliberation by
staff, the GPAC, decision-makers, and the public. Each blueprint alternative will consist of a description of land use
categories, buildout assumptions, conceptual land use diagrams, and applicable policy concepts summarized in a
report with color maps and illustrations, as appropriate.
As part of the blueprint alternatives evaluation, CCTC will qualitatively evaluate the alternatives developed by the project
team. Travel forecasting will be conducted using the SLOCOG Travel Demand Model. The current traffic analysis zone
structure is shown at right, with the amount of household growth currently included in the SLOCOG model. Additional
refinements, model validation, or other modeling tasks can be conducted as an additional service. The SLOCOG model
will also be used to extract VMT, stratified by trips within origins and destinations completely and partially within the
City’s borders.

                                                the study segments will be developed for a baseline scenario, and LOS
                                                and citywide VMT results will be extracted. The likely circulation impacts
                                                of the alternatives will be described, along with key differentiators, to
                                                assist the team, City staff, and decision makers with the development of
                                                a preferred alternative. Detailed LOS results and citywide VMT estimates
                                                will be developed for the preferred alternative for use in the EIR.
                                                Greenprint
                                                Similarly, the Michael Baker team will also provide an outline of up to
                                                three concept greenprint alternatives to address the key conservation
                                                issues identified for the greenprint. While the blueprint alternatives are
                                                largely development alternatives focused on the placement, organization,
                                                and relationship of land uses and circulation to one another and to the
                                                coast, these greenprint alternatives are intended to explore how both
                                                coastal and inland resources can best be conserved and how people,
                                                property, and the economy can become more resilient to a changing
environment, economy, and shoreline. They may generally be characterized as more analytical and policy- or
mitigation-oriented than the blueprint alternatives. Following staff review and comment on the concept alternatives, the
consultant team will develop up to three detailed greenprint alternatives for review and deliberation by staff, the GPAC,
decision-makers, and the public. Each greenprint alternative will include a description of applicable policy concepts
summarized in a report with supporting data and analysis, as appropriate. The alternatives will also present greenhouse
gas emissions forecasts tied to the anticipated levels of residential and nonresidential development associated with
each alternative.
Based on the results of the vulnerability assessment and in particular the sea level rise action plan, M&N will support
the development of three conservation scenarios to address key issues. M&N will present the issues to the GPAC,
Planning Commission, and City Council.
The Michael Baker team will work with City staff to review and evaluate the blueprint and greenprint alternatives with the
community and the GPAC. Following public consideration and deliberation of the alternatives, we will present the
alternatives to the Planning Commission and the City Council in study session format to arrive at a preferred blueprint
plan and a corresponding preferred greenprint plan.

2.4        Administrative Draft Blueprint and Greenprint Plans
The Michael Baker team will prepare administrative draft versions of the blueprint plan and the greenprint plan for City
staff review. The plans must conform to applicable provisions of state general plan law and the California Coastal Act
relative to LCPs. They will be organized into elements containing an introduction; issues identification; goals, policies,
and implementation actions; and a plan narrative describing the basis for and application of the policies.
Information developed during the community baseline assessment, key issues and policies, and alternatives tasks will
form the basis of the planning concepts and information presented in each element. The format and desired objectives
and requirements for each element described below reflect a current understanding of the key issues. They may be
modified to reflect agreements reached during previous outreach and analysis tasks. For example, in the greenprint, this
work program recommends a stand alone sustainability and resiliency element; however, as a result of community
engagement, the results of the community baseline assessment or other guidance, we may determine that sustainability
and resiliency is an integrating theme across elements rather a stand alone element.
For each element, we identify which members of the Michael Baker team are recommending proposed goals, policies,
and actions. Many of the specific work items referenced within each task reflect an understanding of current policy
shortcomings based on a recent assessment of the adequacy of the existing City of Morro Bay General Plan and LCP
prepared as part of the recent “Plan for the Plan” work program.
Blueprint
Introduction
This portion of the blueprint describes the overall organization of the plan; relationship to the community vision,
greenprint, zoning ordinance, and CIP; and how the blueprint is to be used.
Land Use
Michael Baker will prepare the Land Use Element, consisting of key issues, goals, policies, and actions addressing
planned land uses in the city. This element will provide future development direction and performance standards for
reuse of coastal brownfield sites, other infill opportunity sites, and any greenfield development areas identified on the
city’s periphery. Among other items required under state law, this element will include appropriate land use
designations, a color land use diagram, and other illustrative graphics; estimates of population per residential land use
designation and explicit building intensity standards (e.g., units per acre, floor area ratio) for land use designations; and
identify areas covered by the plan that are subject to flooding.
                                                                                                            Work Plan    75

Community Design
Michael Baker will prepare the Community Design Element. This element will present the basic urban form of the
community, organized into districts, neighborhoods, and other areas with distinct community character and design.
Drawing upon the recently completed Neighborhood Compatibility Guidelines, it will identify community design
objectives for each distinct district or neighborhood. This element will advocate various techniques to achieve more
pedestrian-friendly, walkable neighborhoods and improved coastal access oriented around basic activities such as
parks, schools, community centers, and local- or visitor-serving commercial activities.
Economic Development
Michael Baker will prepare the Economic Development Element, with support from EAM. Building upon principles
defined in the recently completed LEAP and ongoing EDSP, this element will define Morro Bay’s long-term economic
vision, establishing strategies to retain and attract businesses by providing for more diverse coastal and non-coastal
industries, maximizing growth potential of key economic sectors and Morro Bay’s competitive economic position,
maintaining a sustainable jobs/housing balance, establishing priorities for community financing, and establishing
economic incentives for development consistent with the vision and objectives of the General Plan.
Circulation
CCTC will prepare the Circulation Element, with support from Michael Baker. This element will establish a balanced,
multimodal approach to serve existing development, provide coastal access, and accommodate anticipated growth. It
will include new policies to address both LOS and VMT as performance metrics for the circulation system, as well as
multimodal circulation, complete streets, water transportation, truck routes, neighborhood traffic calming, and coastal
circulation and parking. The updated element will show explicit correlation to the planned land use designations
identified in the Land Use Element, reflect current existing and planned networks identified in the 2011 Morro Bay
Bicycle & Pedestrian Master Plan, and identify how the transportation network and supporting standards will meet the
needs of bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, motorists, commercial goods movers, pedestrians, public
transportation users, and seniors.
Noise
Rincon will prepare the Noise Element, with support from Michael Baker. This element will provide guidance and a
basis to evaluate land use compatibility of both transportation and stationary noise sources by documenting and
mapping projected noise based on future conditions, and identifying areas that would be subject to significant noise in
the future, along with methods to reduce noise effects. It will include both existing and future noise contour diagrams.
   76     Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Greenprint
Introduction
This portion of the greenprint describes the overall organization of the plan; relationship to the community vision,
blueprint, and CIP; and how the greenprint is to be used.
Conservation
Michael Baker will prepare the Conservation Element, with support from Rincon and EAM. This element will identify and
define strategies to protect both coastal and inland natural resources, including but not limited to biological
communities, estuaries and fisheries resources, valued open spaces, wetlands, and viewsheds. While preparing the
Conservation Element, we will coordinate with water agencies and districts to incorporate recent urban water
management plans and available sustainable groundwater information. The element will identify rivers, creeks, streams,
flood corridors, riparian habitats, and land that may accommodate floodwater to support groundwater recharge and
stormwater management, and consider opportunities to reduce waste and improve water quality, such as low-impact
development and green building. The element will also address energy and water conservation opportunities; solid
waste management; and mineral, cultural, and paleontological resources. It will include air quality policies and
programs that integrate the relationship between land use, transportation and mobility, public health and safety, and
energy.
Open Space
Michael Baker will prepare the Open Space Element. This element will address open spaces used for all purposes
defined under general plan law, and will specifically define “open space” within the meaning of the law. It addresses
the parks and recreation needs of all ages and users, identifying parks, facilities, special use facilities, pedestrian-
friendly connections, trails, and open space needs for each park classification.
Public Health and Safety
Michael Baker will prepare the Public Health and Safety Element. This element will specifically define the link and
relationship of the City of Morro Bay Local Hazard Mitigation Plan to the General Plan Safety Element. It will address
natural hazards in the context of a changing climate, including sea level rise, tsunamis, wildfires, geotechnical and
seismic hazards, and flooding. The element will address risks to resources and access due to coastal erosion, and will
specifically include assessment of ground failure and liquefaction hazards, evacuation routes, peak load water supply
requirements, and minimum road widths. The element will also address public health, crime prevention, neighborhood
safety, and emergency preparedness and response, and include updated hazardous materials use, handling,
transportation, disposal, cleanup, and management information related to both ongoing hazardous sites and brownfield
development sites.
                                                                                                     Work Plan     77

The City last updated the Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP) in 2008. Based on our understanding of Disaster
Mitigation Act 2000, LHMPs are active for five years after adoption, and the City’s LHMP may not provide access to
federal hazard mitigation grant or funding opportunities. The expired nature of the plan also prevents the Public Health
and Safety Element of the Update from being certified as “enhanced” consistent with AB 2140. The “enhanced”
designation is applied to Safety Elements that are integrated with a jurisdiction’s active hazard mitigation plan and
allows for the state to cover 100% of certain costs related to disaster recovery (compared to the 75% cap for cities
without Enhanced Safety Elements). Much of the technical work required to complete the Public Health and Safety
Element is required to complete a LHMP. We will develop the Public Health and Safety Element to include technical
analysis and hazard mitigation goals consistent with LHMP requirements for streamlined integration into a future LHMP
update. The Michael Baker Team has assisted numerous agencies throughout California to obtain hazard mitigation
grant funding to update their mitigation plans and we recommend the City pursue funding in the 2016/2017 funding
cycle.
Sustainability and Resilience
Michael Baker will prepare the Sustainability and Resilience Element, with support from M&N. This element will
provide a policy framework for addressing sustainability, climate change, and community resiliency. It will describe and
codify Morro Bay’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal and discuss broad strategies the City will employ to
achieve the reduction goal, supported by specific reduction measures in the Morro Bay Climate Action Plan. This
element will also set forth a long-term community resiliency plan, identifying the community’s preferred strategy to
adapt to known sea level rise and other hazards likely to be exacerbated by climate change.
Michael Baker will author, edit, and illustrate each element to produce administrative draft blueprint and greenprint plan
documents for City staff review.

Task 3: Environmental Assessment
Rincon will prepare a Program EIR (PEIR) that addresses both the blueprint and greenprint as part of the City’s CEQA
compliance strategy for the project. The PEIR will programmatically evaluate the environmental consequences of
buildout of the General Plan, and identify policy-based mitigation measures to be incorporated into the General Plan
elements. Preparation of the PEIR will consist of the following tasks.
3.1       Notice of Preparation, Scoping Meeting, and Agency Consultation
Rincon will prepare a draft Notice of Preparation (NOP) consisting of a brief project description and a summary of the
probable significant effects on the environment resulting from adoption and implementation of the draft blueprint and
greenprint. The NOP will be submitted to the City within one week following City Council endorsement of the draft land
use scenario. As required by CEQA, the NOP will circulate to responsible and trustee agencies for 30 days. Because of
the broad, programmatic nature of the project, we will forego the preparation of an Initial Study and simply address all
of the environmental checklist issues in the body of the PEIR.
During the 30-day scoping period, Michael Baker and Rincon will facilitate a PEIR scoping meeting. The purpose of the
meeting will be to provide the community an opportunity to provide input on the PEIR work scope (issues of concern,
alternatives, etc.). Rincon will make a brief presentation on the General Plan and environmental review process, then
record all public comments received. These comments will be summarized in a memorandum to be included in a PEIR
appendix.
The City and Rincon will confer and meet with regulatory agencies, advisory agencies, and tribes regarding results of
technical studies and impact analysis approaches.
Meetings and Deliverables

Administrative draft and revised NOP (electronic)
                                                                                                          Work Plan     79

3.2       Administrative Draft Program EIR
Rincon will prepare a comprehensive administrative draft PEIR addressing all CEQA topic areas and containing
expanded analysis of issue areas identified in the NOP. The PEIR will identify General Plan policies and programs that
would reduce potentially significant impacts to a less than significant level, where possible.
The PEIR will evaluate the long-term consequences of the adoption of the draft blueprint and greenprint, and will
provide a “roadmap” for future CEQA documents to tier from the PEIR and streamline the CEQA process. It will draw
from the baseline community assessment and the draft blueprint and greenprint elements for the environmental setting
information. The project description will constitute a summary of the blueprint and greenprint. Existing information,
including information from the City’s water reclamation facility EIR process, will be used and leveraged as applicable
and available. The following summarizes the tasks needed to complete the administrative draft PEIR.
Summary
The summary will present a synopsis of identified environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and residual impacts in
tabular format. It will also discuss such CEQA requirements as areas of known controversy and issues to be resolved.
Introduction and Environmental Setting
These sections will lay the groundwork for the substantive analysis to follow. The introduction will describe the purpose
and legal authority of the study, and a discussion of lead, responsible, and trustee agencies. The environmental setting
will provide a general description of existing conditions and geography within the study area. To the degree feasible we
will rely on existing information sources, including the technical background report to establish the current
environmental setting.
Project Description
The project description will establish the framework upon which the environmental document will be based. As required
by CEQA, the project description will discuss: (1) the project location and characteristics; (2) lead, responsible, and
trustee agencies; (3) required approvals; and (4) project characteristics with potential environmental impacts. The
project description will reflect an estimate of citywide development potential based on either a growth forecast or a set
of assumptions regarding buildout. The project description will provide an appropriate level of detail to enable
environmental analysis of specific blueprint and greenprint components that are known, yet be broad enough to allow
environmental evaluation of some of the long-term development concepts and policies envisioned under the draft
plans.
   80     Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Environmental Impact Analysis
Each environmental issue addressed in the EIR will have four main subsections: Setting, Impacts, Mitigation Measures,
and Level of Significance after Mitigation. The setting will be based on existing data sources and, as appropriate,
technical studies prepared in conjunction with the draft blueprint and greenprint. Where possible, impacts will be
quantified and their level of significance established. If existing data does not allow definitive quantification, reasonable
assumptions will be used to qualitatively approximate potential impacts.
Issues to be addressed in detail in this section include:
    Aesthetics                                                      Land use and planning
    Air quality                                                     Noise
    Cultural resources                                              Population and housing
    Geology                                                         Public services
    Greenhouse gas emissions                                        Transportation/traffic
    Hazards/hazardous materials                                     Utilities/service systems
    Hydrology/water quality
The analysis will consider both general impacts associated with buildout under the draft blueprint and greenprint, and
site-specific impacts associated with any known projects and planned physical improvements.
Rincon will prepare all of the EIR analysis sections except for transportation/traffic, which will be prepared by CCTC,
and greenhouse gas emissions, which will be prepared by Michael Baker. All previously completed circulation and
transportation system analytical work will be incorporated in the preparation of the transportation/traffic section, which
will compare existing conditions to future conditions with both implementation of the existing General Plan (a “no
project” alternative) and with implementation of the proposed blueprint and greenprint.
Alternatives
As required by CEQA, the PEIR will consider alternatives to the proposed blueprint and greenprint plans. These will
likely include alternative scenarios that have previously been developed and additional scenarios designed to address
identified significant impacts of the proposed plans. Up to four alternatives, including the “no project” alternative, will
be studied. These will be developed in coordination with City staff. The alternatives analysis will be less detailed than
the project analysis, but will identify the magnitude of each impact and associated mitigation requirements.
                                                                                                            Work Plan    81

  Other CEQA-Required Sections
  This section will address other CEQA requirements, including growth-inducing impacts and significant, irreversible
  environmental changes. Growth inducement includes both direct and indirect population and job growth, as well as the
  removal of potential obstacles to growth. The discussion of irreversible changes will address the potential for the
  blueprint and greenprint to create significant environmental effects that cannot be reversed.
  Meetings and Deliverables
  Administrative draft PEIR – two rounds of review (electronic)
  3.3        Public Review Draft Program EIR
  Following receipt of City staff comments, Rincon will revise the administrative draft PEIR and prepare a screencheck
  draft PEIR, followed by a public draft PEIR and Notice of Availability for public circulation. As required by CEQA, the
  draft PEIR will circulate for a period of 45 days. Our scope of work assumes that the City will provide a distribution list,
  distribute required notices, and pay newspaper publication fees.
  Meetings and Deliverables
  Screencheck draft and public review draft PEIR (electronic)
  Notice of Availability for draft PEIR
  3.4        Responses to Comments/Final Program EIR
  Rincon will review comments received during the public review period, prepare responses to comments, and make
  necessary changes to the draft PEIR to create an administrative final PEIR. After receipt of City staff comments on the
  draft Response to Comments report, Rincon will prepare the final Responses to Comments, which will be incorporated
  into the final PEIR.
  Rincon will prepare an administrative draft mitigation monitoring and reporting program (MMRP). The MMRP will take
  the form of a detailed table that identifies mitigation measures identified in the final EIR. The table will compile all of the
  mitigation measures developed in the body of the PEIR, and indicate the monitoring action to occur, the timing and
  frequency of monitoring, and the party responsible for monitoring. Following receipt of City staff comments on the
  administrative final program PEIR and administrative draft MMRP, Rincon will revise the documents and prepare the
  final PEIR for distribution.
  Rincon will prepare an administrative draft of the CEQA findings and statement of overriding considerations, if
  necessary, for review by City staff. Following receipt of City staff comments on the administrative draft CEQA findings,
  Rincon will revise the document and prepare the final CEQA findings for inclusion in the staff report. Rincon will

Task 4: Zoning Ordinance Update and Coastal Implementation Plan
This task identifies work items necessary to complete updates to the Zoning Ordinance directed by the General Plan
Update and to establish a CIP for Morro Bay that meets Coastal Act requirements. All subtasks identified in this task will
be performed by RRM, with limited assistance from Michael Baker.
4.1       Identify Proposed Zoning Ordinance/CIP Revisions
RRM will prepare a short Zoning Ordinance/CIP analysis memo identifying necessary revisions to the City’s existing
Zoning Ordinance and CIP for consistency with the blueprint and greenprint. The memo will identify necessary revisions
to address topics identified during the project, as well as coastal-related issues such as:
    Coastal development standards and a post-certification map
    Parking and transportation demand management
    Coastal access, beach use, and special events
    Visitor-serving uses and tourism
    Sea-level rise and coastal resilience
    Stormwater management and water quality
The Zoning Ordinance/CIP analysis memo will be reviewed at meetings with City staff, the GPAC, and Coastal
Commission Staff (see Tasks 5 and 6). City staff may also review the memo with the Planning Commission, City
Council, and other groups. Feedback on the memo from these meetings will be used to prepare the Zoning
Ordinance/CIP amendments.

  4.2        Staff Draft Zoning Ordinance/CIP Amendments
  Based on the comments received on the Zoning Ordinance/CIP analysis memo, RRM will prepare an initial draft of the
  Zoning Ordinance/CIP amendments for City staff review. The amendments will consist of changes necessary for
  consistency with policies in the blueprint and greenprint. The amendments will address topics identified in the Zoning
  Ordinance/CIP analysis memo, and be designed to maximize ease of understanding as well as to integrate with the
  existing Zoning Ordinance. The staff review draft Zoning Ordinance/CIP amendments will be reviewed in a meeting with
  City staff (see Tasks 5 and 6).

Meetings and Deliverables
Final Zoning Ordinance/CIP amendments (electronic)
Optional Task 4.O            Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance/CIP Update
As an optional task, RRM can prepare a comprehensive update of Title 17, Zoning, and Zoning Map, creating a more
effective and user-friendly Zoning Ordinance/CIP and zoning map in accordance with the goals and policies of the
blueprint and greenprint, and consistent with state and federal law. A comprehensive update provides an opportunity to
repurpose the Zoning Ordinance/CIP and zoning map as a more effective tool to provide the kind of development Morro
Bay wants, consistent with the plans.
Key components of this effort are summarized below. More detail may be provided should the City wish to pursue the
comprehensive Zoning Ordinance/CIP and zoning map update.
Technical Analysis and Diagnosis Memo. Conduct a technical review of the existing Zoning Ordinance/CIP to evaluate
strengths, weaknesses, and possible changes. Review technical zoning issues, staff reports of controversial projects,
the types of variances granted, and standard conditions imposed; meet with stakeholders to discuss strengths and
weaknesses of the current ordinance; and prepare a diagnostic memo identifying areas of potential changes and
distilling the key choices and options for the Zoning Ordinance/CIP update.
Annotated Outline. Prepare an annotated outline of the Zoning Ordinance/CIP. The outline will provide the
recommended framework for the new ordinance, retaining, amending, or discarding sections as necessary, and
                                                                                                           Work Plan   85
  proposing new sections where needed to improve clarity and user-friendliness. The proposed framework will be
  structured so that the Zoning Ordinance/CIP can be updated and amended over time.
  Draft Regulations and Zoning Map. Preliminary regulations and a preliminary zoning map will be drafted based on the
  annotated outline and presented in discrete, discernible chunks of related sets of regulations to facilitate review and
  make the effort more approachable.
  Public Review Draft Zoning Ordinance/CIP and Zoning Map. Based on comments in the preliminary drafts of
  regulations, a public review draft Zoning Ordinance/CIP and zoning map will be prepared for public review and
  adoption.
  Final Zoning Ordinance/CIP and Zoning Map. After public review and adoption, a final Zoning Ordinance/CIP and zoning
  map will be prepared.
  Task 5: Community Engagement
  The following techniques for community engagement should be considered to achieve the goal of a representative and
  productive public participation process. While techniques may ultimately vary, the outcome of broad deliberative
  participation, leading to fruitful and purposeful discussions about big issues facing Morro Bay and a responsive plan, is
  desired. Community engagement is particularly important for the assessment of vulnerabilities and development of
  policy solutions. The general direction of these discussions is outlined below.
  Asset, Needs, and Sustainability Assessment Discussions
  Once the vision is established, attention should turn from the future desired state to the more pragmatic task of fixing
  known problems and anticipating future needs and risks. Discussions with neighborhood groups, community groups,
  service providers, and advisory committees will help the project team to identify Morro Bay’s social, natural, and
  physical assets, as well as assess their ability to absorb changes such as housing affordability, job loss, climate
  change, natural and human-caused disasters, drops in tourism, environmental degradation, and loss of local
  businesses, both today as well as anticipated in the future. This assessment of needs and risks will help the project
  team identify policy solutions for the General Plan. The particular forums for these discussions are described below.
  The results of these discussions will support the development of the sustainability and resiliency index, which will
  provide the foundation for the proposed policy solutions.
  Policy Solution Discussions
  Drafts of proposed General Plan policies will be brought back to community groups and the GPAC for review, focusing
  on the topic areas where the greatest challenges to Morro Bay, and greatest opportunities for the future, are. These
86      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

focused policy discussions will help to answer remaining questions for community deliberation, providing input to the
City Council as they weigh tradeoffs and make difficult policy decisions.
The proposed components of a comprehensive community engagement campaign are outlined in the subtasks below.
5.1       General Plan Advisory Committee
We understand that a GPAC has been convened, which will serve for a three-year period. The role of the committee is to
provide input and guidance on the planning process by bringing technical expertise, knowledge of community issues,
and the ability to represent key constituencies to City staff and the project team. Up to 16 committee meetings are
anticipated, with up to two members of the consultant team in attendance at each meeting.
Meetings and Deliverables
Up to 16 GPAC meetings, agendas, presentations, and summaries
5.2       Visual Identity
Michael Baker’s graphic designers, in coordination with City staff, will create a unique graphic format and project
branding to create a recognizable identity for the project and garner enthusiasm and unity. This involves a process of
translating community personality, local culture, and unique environmental attributes into a graphic language of fonts,
images, colors, and layout concepts. This template is then used for all project products, including the website, meeting
materials, and planning documents.
Meetings and Deliverables
Visual identity concepts (electronic)
5.3       Website
An inviting, user-friendly website will be important to the project. Michael Baker will create content for a robust
information portal for residents to learn about and stay involved with the project. The website will include responses to
frequently asked questions and serve as a repository for project documents as well as a virtual notice board for
upcoming meetings. We recommend adding a webpage to the City’s existing website as the hub for all project
information. Surveys, social media, and other participation tools can be embedded in or linked to from the main project
webpage.
Meetings and Deliverables
Website concepts and ongoing maintenance (electronic)
                                                                                                              Work Plan   87

  5.4       Stakeholder Interviews and Discussions
  Time should be allocated to interview key stakeholders and convene group discussions when necessary. Michael Baker
  will conduct up to eight interviews to ensure that a broad range of perspectives are included in the conversation early
  on. We will work with City staff to develop a diverse list of participants. We will also invite focus group and stakeholder
  interview participants to play an active role throughout the process as project ambassadors. Based on the results of the
  interviews and focus groups, Michael Baker will identify community themes for the blueprint and greenprint plans in a
  memorandum. These themes represent the beginning organizational stage for issues, goals, and policies. Up to two
  members of the consultant team are anticipated to attend these meetings.
  Meetings and Deliverables
  Up to eight (8) stakeholder interviews and summary of key themes (electronic)
  5.5       Neighborhood and Community Group Outreach
  Outreach to existing community groups and neighborhood organizations is desired in order to reach broad
  representation from the community at large. This effort is intended primarily to advertise and provide information about
  the project and to help drive participation and attendance in the project’s community workshops and events. It is
  anticipated that one member of the consultant team would attend up to 16 community group meetings.
  Meetings and Deliverables
  Up to 16 neighborhood and community group meetings and summaries (electronic)
  5.6       CityVoice Policy Area Surveys
  Surveys may be considered as an additional technique to ensure broad and diverse participation in the update process,
  particularly when focused on key policy issues. Once the vision’s foundation is established, Michael Baker will
  distribute additional community-wide surveys (either additional voice surveys via CityVoice or online surveys using a
  tool such as MySidewalk or SurveyMonkey), which may be used to provide an opportunity for community members to
  review and refine proposed plan content. It is anticipated that up to three policy area surveys will be conducted.
  Meetings and Deliverables
  Up to three (3) policy area surveys and summaries (electronic)
  Optional Task 5.O                 Additional CityVoice Collaboration
  As an optional task, Michael Baker can facilitate additional coordination with CityVoice to assist in completing the
  community engagement program. We understand from discussion at the pre-proposal meeting that the City is
  considering extending its relationship with CityVoice based on the success of the initial Vision and Values exercise.
88      Proposal to the City of Morro Bay

Michael Baker staff has contacted CityVoice to determine what level of additional cost may be required to support use
of CityVoice technology and software to assist on Tasks 1.2 and 5.6 of this proposed work program. Based on our initial
consultation, we anticipate the approximate fee for CityVoice to support the work program to be $5,000. This cost is
included as an optional component of our work program and may be added to our work scope or covered through
another means available to the City.
Task 6: Meetings and Project Management
The following work items describe tasks we will undertake to manage the project to a timely, successful, and cost-
effective conclusion, and the various venues we will use to meet with City staff and decision-makers to consider and
identify strategies at key benchmarks throughout the project.
6.1       Project Management
Project management is an ongoing work effort by the project management team (City and Michael Baker project
managers and technical and task leads) that ensures the project adheres to schedule and budget parameters.
Additionally, this group provides leadership and guidance to overcome or take advantage of any challenges or
opportunities presented during the project’s duration. This task provides for overall project management, coordination
of team members and tasks, preparation of project updates, consultation with City staff, team meetings, and invoices. It
includes conference calls every other week throughout the project to review tasks in progress, share information, and
review key milestones and deliverables. Additional communication with the City team by e-mail and phone will occur
throughout the project, independent from the scheduled calls.
Meetings and Deliverables
Biweekly project team conference calls
6.2       City Staff Meetings (up to 10)
Members of the Michael Baker team will meet in person with City staff to supplement the project management calls
identified in Task 6.1. Up to 10 City staff meetings are anticipated throughout the course of the project.
Meetings and Deliverables
Up to 10 City staff meetings, agendas, and summaries
6.3       California Coastal Commission Staff Meetings (up to 6)
The City will coordinate with Coastal Commission staff to create an LCP that will meet local needs and address issues
of statewide importance. The City has initiated discussions with Coastal Commission staff and anticipates ongoing
coordination and collaboration. As part of the project, the Michael Baker team will meet with regional Coastal
                                                                                                           Work Plan     89

  Commission contacts to discuss the LCP update process and set clear goals and expectations for coordination and
  engagement and engage Coastal Commission staff in early review of technical analyses and draft reports to ensure the
  commission’s priorities are achieved in the development of the coastal LUP and implementing ordinances. Up to six
  meetings are anticipated.
  Meetings and Deliverables
  Up to six (6) Coastal Commission staff meetings, agendas, and summaries
  6.4       Study Sessions (up to 6)
  The Michael Baker team will conduct study sessions before the Planning Commission or Planning Commission
  Advisory Committee to review key milestones throughout the project. At the City’s discretion, we recommend that the
  City Council participate as desired, making these sessions joint study sessions. It is anticipated that up to six study
  sessions with the Planning Commission and/or the City Council will be conducted throughout the project.
  Meetings and Deliverables
  Up to six (6) study sessions, presentations, and summaries (electronic)
  6.5       Public Hearings (up to 4)
  Public hearings before the Planning Commission and the City Council are required to adopt the blueprint, the
  greenprint, and the CIP. Key members of the Michael Baker team will attend up to four public hearings to support
  review and adoption of project components.
  Meetings and Deliverables
  Up to four (4) public hearings, presentations, and summaries
  6.6       Grant Administration
  The Michael Baker team has additional experience administering complex grants and will work with the City, the Ocean
  Protection Council, and California Coastal Commission to successfully administer the grants through the life of the
  project. We will assist in all phases of grant administration, including monitoring, to ensure billed activities are
  consistent with grant guidelines. This task provides for grant management and administration tasks to assist the City in
  preparing and submitting required financial and progress reports to the granting agencies, and leading the City through
  the grant closeout process.
  Meetings and Deliverables
  Grant progress reports, invoices, and meetings as directed by City staff (electronic)

Items Required
   from the City

Items Required from the City
Michael Baker International does not anticipate that any additional information that is not reasonably available to City
staff through the normal course of business will be required to complete the proposed work program. Michael Baker
project staff will prepare a comprehensive report and data needs list for City staff consideration and we will review the
list together at the project kickoff meeting. At this time, no additional items or resources not listed in the RFP are
required to complete our response relative to the scope and fee proposed.
In terms of work requested from City staff to support the work program, we anticipate that needs associated with the
work program may include, but are not limited to, the following:
     Coordinate and facilitate participation and engagement of City staff across departments to support a collaborative
      and meaningful update that advances City objectives beyond the domain of traditional planning.
     Collection and transfer of data requested by the Michael Baker team at the project kickoff meeting.
     Scheduling of meeting locations for City staff meetings and Coastal Commission staff meetings identified in the
      work plan.
     Serve as primary contact for City Council and the media related to the project. Michael Baker staff will only interact
      with the media as directed or requested by City staff.
     Scheduling, noticing, and coordination of all audio-visual (AV) services for public meetings, workshops, and study
      sessions held with the GPAC, Planning Commission, City Council, and broader community.
     Provide official meeting minutes and prepare and distribute staff reports for official meetings of the GPAC,
      Planning Commission, other City Commissions, and the City Council related to the project. Michael Baker will
      provide meeting summaries and action items City staff may use as the basis for these materials.
     Assistance in identifying key stakeholders and community and neighborhood groups to meet with to identify and
      discuss key community issues and policies.
     Providing Michael Baker with one set of consolidated comments on each deliverable and resolving any conflicts
      among comments from multiple reviewers prior to providing comments to Michael Baker.
     Several deliverables will be presented to the GPAC for discussion. We recommend that the GPAC advise staff
      regarding desired content of the reports, and that City staff direct any revisions to the contents of deliverables (i.e.,
      the GPAC will not provide independent direction to Michael Baker).
     Coordination of required SB 18 and AB 52 tribal consultation. Michael Baker will provide sample letters and other

94     Proposal to the City of Morro Bay
 VI
Fee Schedule

Fee Schedule
The Michael Baker team’s proposed fee schedule is provided at the end of this section and identifies team member
levels, hourly rates, estimated hours per task, total number of hours and cost, and subconsultant and direct costs. As
identified in the attached budget, Michael Baker proposes to complete the tasks identified in our work program for the
City of Morro Bay General Plan, Local Coastal Program, Zoning Ordinance Update and EIR work program for a budget of
$806,138. This budget is aligned with expectations established by City staff in the April 14, 2015, presentation to the
City Council for the project. If identified as a desired task by the City, the optional additional collaboration with
CityVoice would add $5,000 to the fee. A comprehensive Zoning Ordinance update would add $80,000 to $140,000 to
the project fee.
Our objective in assembling the budget is to provide a realistic assessment of the effort required to complete the work
items identified in the RFP. We understand that City staff and the City Council intend to continue working to secure
additional funding to support additional components of the work program, including but not limited to supplemental
community engagement activities. Therefore, the work program and budget remain flexible at this time and will be
adjusted as needed to meet City needs and priorities.
Payments would be made on a monthly basis based on actual time spent by Michael Baker team staff toward
completion of project tasks in the previous month. Michael Baker will provide an annotated progress report with each
invoice that allows the City to identify task progress associated with each payment.
Cost Assumptions
With the objective of ensuring clarity about the proposal, Michael Baker has prepared the following assumptions for our
scope of work that explain the basis for the cost and effort to implement the work scope.
    The topics and scope of studies completed as part of the community baseline assessment will be confirmed
     through an initial meeting with City staff. Michael Baker has scoped and budgeted for the studies described in the
     RFP.
    Our scope and budget estimate relies primarily on existing studies, databases, and the data identified in the RFP
     and throughout this proposal. It does not include costs associated with biological or other field surveys beyond
     basic reconnaissance.
    Our scope and budget do not specify costs for mass printing and distribution of general plan publications (e.g.,
     draft reports, newsletters, notices).
                                                                                                           Fee Schedule 95

   The work scope assumes up to 16 GPAC meetings, with each meeting to be attended by two Michael Baker staff
    members: (1) the project manager, who will serve as the meeting moderator, and (2) the assistant project
    manager, a technical expert, or a dedicated note-taker. Michael Baker will prepare meeting agendas, presentations,
    and summaries. Michael Baker assumes that the City will be responsible for securing meeting locations, logistics,
    and noticing.
   The work scope assumes that two Michael Baker staff members and one representative of each of the consultant
    team members will be present at public hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council. We will assist
    City staff in preparing a presentation for the public hearings. Michael Baker further assumes that Planning
    Commission comments and recommended revisions to work products will be presented as an addendum in the
    staff report to the Council, not as revised documents.
   The scope of work assumes up to 10 project management meetings with City staff.
   The budget for direct costs represents our best estimate of internal costs for travel, supplies and materials, and
    other miscellaneous costs.
   Our cost estimate is based on the proposed 24-month schedule included in this proposal. Should significant delay
    (more than 120 days) occur for reasons beyond our control, additional charges may apply to the remaining work,
    based on labor rates in effect at the time of the delay.

Kern County Vision Plans and Community Charrettes, Oildale, Rosamond, East Bakersfield, Mojave, and
Tehachapi. Strategized and coordinated the visioning effort and action planning for the future development of
several Kern County communities. Prior to the visioning workshops, extensive public outreach created a high level
of community enthusiasm for workshop participation, and event turnout was unmatched for planning efforts in the
region. The two-day intensive community visioning workshops successfully provided forums for soliciting issues,
ideas, and strategies for addressing community economic prosperity and enhancing the quality of life. As a result of
the workshops, oversaw the creation of an illustrative Vision Plan encapsulating the community's ideas and a
strategy for future development. Finally, all projects, programs, and policies necessary for the Vision Plan's
implementation were outlined in an action plan and assigned with priorities, dates, and possible funding
sources/mechanisms.

outlining strategies to establish a transit-supportive environment by improving connections between the station
and adjacent destinations, densifying and intensifying land uses at key locations within the project area, and
enhancing the physical design of the urban environment.
City of Pinole, Three Corridors Specific Plan, Project Manager. Led this planning effort as it dovetailed into
the parallel General Plan update and provided a higher level of vision and land use specificity as well as a clear
focus for Redevelopment Agency activities. The Specific Plan enhanced the economic vitality of the city’s three
major circulation corridors and community gateways. The plan relies on a strong economic development strategy
for infill and new development patterns and formulates and implements design guidelines for the commercial
retail, residential, and mixed-use development in each plan area using form-based zoning.

City of Arroyo Grande, Centennial Square.* Provided conceptual site
planning that would transform an existing city street into a public plaza, in
preparation for the city’s upcoming 100-year anniversary. This space was
designed in response to the City’s desire to expand on the existing outdoor
gathering spaces and to make a vital connection between the recently
revitalized Branch Streetscape and the historic swinging pedestrian bridge
that ties downtown to Heritage Square (public park). This plaza is the hub of
the historic village of Arroyo Grande and provides a vital link for the city’s
large community-wide spring and fall events. The design included multi-use
spaces that could be utilized for outdoor dining space by adjacent
restaurants or simply used as public seating areas during restaurant off
hours.

acre park that successfully synthesized community input and the rich history of the historic downtown area to
develop a unique facility. The Michael Baker International Urban Design team worked closely with the
community, stakeholders, and staff to develop a creative solution to programming the city’s central public space.
Input played a significant role and guided the design process, preferred materials, public art, and features. The
final design was a collaboration of thoughtful ideas, a nostalgic nod to the city’s deep-rooted history, and a
functional and artistic interpretation of the city’s past, present, and future. The new community space will be
used as the primary venue for all public events and festivals in Old Town Peoria.
City of Salinas, East Market Streetscape Improvements, Lead Landscape Architect.* Refined and provided
design development drawings and details for this 1-mile streetscape project incorporating LID practices with
bulb-out planters containing drought-tolerant trees and shrubs designed to be irrigated by intercepting
stormwater. The scope of this project also included coordination with the California Department of
Transportation, community meetings with business stakeholders, concepts for gateway and mural designs, street
lighting, and a decorative crosswalk materials report to aid the City in the selection process for adopting a
decorative crosswalk standard.
City of Riverbank, Gateway Project, Lead Architect.* Created concept and construction drawings for this
multiple-location gateway project. The project objective was to create a unique city identity by providing
improvements and signage at each end of State Route 108, which involved coordination with the California
Department of Transportation and utility providers. The project consisted of a 2-acre area of ornamental planting
on the east end of town and a water feature, city sign, and artistic mosaic on approximately 2,000 square feet at
the west end.

JOSH’S RELATED PROJECT EXPERIENCE
             Lompoc General Plan Update and EIR
             Josh assisted in the facilitation of a series of workshops to inform and
             educate community members regarding the various elements of the City’s
             General Plan. Utilizing the information gathered from the workshops, Josh
             was able to craft an Urban Design Element. The Urban Design Element
             provides clear policy direction for infill developments, City beautification and
             unification, residential development, and protection of natural resources.
             Port San Luis Master Plan and Local Coastal Program Amendment
             (Avila Beach)
             Port San Luis is located along the shores of San Luis Obispo Bay. Josh
             assisted with the preparation of policies and graphics to support expanded
             public access and use. Since adoption, the document has served as a tool for
             the redevelopment of Harbor Terrace, Harford Landing, improved RV and
             Boat Parking, development of the Coastal Gateway Meeting Facility, as well
             as guided improvements to pedestrian circulation.
             North 40 Specific Plan (Los Gatos)
             Bordered by two freeways and a major thoroughfare, the North 40 Specific
             Plan Area has been identified as a prime location to offer transit oriented
             development. Josh assisted in the facilitation of advisory committee
             workshops to strategize land use alternatives that balanced the community’s
             desires with the general plan permitted density. Josh’s efforts helped to
             produce a land use alternative that clustered residential density and focused
             on providing mixed-use development within walking distance to transit stops.
