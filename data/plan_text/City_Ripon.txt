VOLUME I - CHAPTER ONE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.1     PORTRAIT OF RIPON
Community Profile
Known for its small town charm, Ripon presents a quality of life unequaled in the region. The quaintness of the
community is demonstrated by the Main Street area of the historical downtown section of the City, with its landscaped
areas and innovative storefronts. The result of these improvements along with a surge in the construction of high-
quality housing throughout the community continues to make Ripon an extremely desirable place to live and work.
                       Main Street looking west.
A Great Regional Setting
Nestled along the Stanislaus River, and located in the northern section of the San Joaquin Valley, Ripon is the
southern most community in San Joaquin County. It lies between Stockton (20 miles to the north) and Modesto (4
miles to the south) and is bisected by State Route 99 and the Central Valley route of the Union Pacific Railroad.
(Exhibit 1.1 shows Ripon’s regional location.) Ripon is fast becoming recognized for being a strategic location for
regionally related businesses and services.
In the past ten years Ripon has been selected as the site for two major auto/truck travel plazas, and a state crime
laboratory.
                                                        1-1                            Adopted September 19, 2006

Volume I - Chapter One                                                                      Executive Summary
Economic Base
Ripon’s economic base has long been tied mainly to agriculture and related businesses. And, while agriculture
continues to play a large part in Ripon’s economy, during the past ten years, Ripon along with the rest of San Joaquin
County has begun to transition towards other non-agriculture industries. As for Ripon, the transportation and traveler
accommodation industry has increased its presence in the community with the addition of a second travel plaza, fast
food restaurants, and motels at the Jack Tone Road/State Route 99 interchange area.
                          Located at the Jack Tone Interchange
The Stanislaus River
Acting as the City’s southern boundary, and the boundary between San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties, the
Stanislaus River, with its source high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, is truly one of the last pristine waterways
remaining in the California Great Central Valley.
The community has identified the Stanislaus River corridor as its most valuable natural resource because of the wide
variety of wildlife and the numerous recreation opportunities it provides, and vows to conserve and preserve it.
                                                              1-2                       Adopted September 19, 2006

Volume I - Chapter One                                                                       Executive Summary
City Government
Ripon is a general law city operating under a council-administrator form of government with the five-member City
Council elected at large. From its incorporation until 1994, council members were selected using a ward system. In
1994, the city changed its process and now elects its council at-large within the community by the electorate within
the community. The council however continues to designate the Mayor from their body.
In 1990, a new City Hall/Police Department facility was constructed to house the administrative, planning, building,
engineering, utilities, and police services, but in 1999, the Building Department was relocated to the Public Works
Yard on Vera Avenue. Then in 2002 it was determined that the present facility was not adequate to meet the ever-
growing needs for service to the community, and construction is now underway on a major addition to this facility.
                       City Hall Council Chambers under construction
1.2      PURPOSE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
A General Plan expresses a long-range public policy to guide the use of private and public lands within the
community’s boundaries. This Plan looks into the future not two to five years, but to the year 2040.
The Ripon General Plan is the principal policy document designed to help the City in maintaining a sense of
community, while enhancing the lives of its citizens. In California, the General Plan is often described as a “blueprint
for future growth” or a “constitution for future development” of a community.
A major challenge for any community is to create a blueprint of how the future vision can be achieved within the
setting of the real world. Equally challenging is how the plan can be implemented in a dynamic setting of change.
The General Plan for a community should be viewed as a document that evolves over time. This can only be
accomplished if enough flexibility is provided within the plan for midcourse corrections while maintaining a clear
perspective of the plans original intent.

For a practical matter, the General Plan is a set of policies, exhibits, charts, tables, figures, and other graphics that
collectively respond to California State Law, and is structured to meet local conditions.
STATE PLANNING LAW REQUIRES GENERAL PLANS ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING SEVEN MANDATED SUBJECTS:
Land Use - Establishes land use, growth accommodation and community design goals, policies, and actions to give
direction to development in Ripon.
Circulation (transportation) - Consists of general location and extent of transportation facilities and public utilities all
correlated with the land use.
Housing - Sets goals, policies and programs for housing development for all economic segments of the community.
Open space - Regulates open space for preservation and managed production of natural resources, outdoor recreation
and public health and safety.
Conservation - Provides for the conservation, development and utilization of all natural resources.
Safety - Plans for protecting the community from fires, seismic, floods and geological hazards.
Noise - Identifies and appraises noise problems in the community and possible solutions to any existing or foreseeable
noise problems. Noise must be considered when establishing the pattern of land uses.
Besides these mandated subjects, communities are beginning to identify a variety of other subjects of special interest
that also affect them.
SOME MORE FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED SUBJECTS ARE:
Economic Development - Objective is to improve employment opportunities, stimulate business activity, diversify and
strengthen the local economy, increase local revenues, and encourage investment in the community.
Air Quality - Addresses air quality within the context of land use and transportation planning.
Historic Preservation - Establishes goals and polices to preserve historical structures and places.
The Plan provides a framework to consider these concerns in an integrated and coordinated fashion.
1.3      OVERALL LAND USE, HOUSING, AND ECONOMIC GOALS
The following are the overall land use, housing, and economic goals and policies developed during the community
outreach program as recommended by the Update Task Force:
Land Use
•    Provide a framework for orderly development to promote balanced residential growth, and maintaining property
     value, and reevaluate where such growth should be located.
                                                         1-5                                Adopted September 19, 2006

1.4     INITIAL AND UPDATE GENERAL PLAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
In August 1992, the City Council approved the Ripon General Plan Revision program. As directed by the
Council, the program contained three (3) major components.
•   The formation of two (2) advisory committees.
        o   A Citizen Advisory Committee composed of members of the community, both within and outside the
            existing city limits, who represented a variety of interests.
        o   A Technical Advisory Committee composed of city department heads and staff representatives of
            other public agencies.
•   Creation of a public outreach effort.
        o   Publication of public information articles in local newspapers.
        o   Distribution of information to citizens at community wide special events.
        o   Presentations to local civic clubs and business organizations.
        o   Sponsorship of awareness meetings throughout the community to solicit input from interested persons on
                                                        1-6                           Adopted September 19, 2006

Volume I - Chapter One                                                                     Executive Summary
            the various land use proposals developed by the committee.
•   Preparation of a Preferred Land Use Alternative.
During the next thirty-two (32) months, the committees held a total of twenty-four (24) meetings, including four (4)
community outreach meetings to solicit input from interested persons on the various land use proposals.
In January 1995, the committees submitted a “Preferred Land Use Alternative” report to the City Council that
contained their recommendation. The Council subsequently approved the report and directed staff to begin
preparation of the draft plan.
Consultants were eventually selected to perform the following tasks:
Circulation Element (San Joaquin County Council of Governments)
Environmental Impact Report (In Site Environmental-Charles Simpson)
Public Facilities Financing Plan (Taussig & Associates)
Draft Plan and other elements (Lou Thanas - Planning Consultant)
In June 2002, the City Council approved the update of the Ripon General Plan 2035 and the following process:
•   The formation of an update steering committee consisting of the City’s department heads along with various
    consultants for specific elements.
        o   The steering committee was formed at its first meeting on June 18, 2002.
•   Conduct a public outreach effort
        o   Presentations were made to the Ripon Unified School District and Ripon Consolidated Fire Board of
            Directors, and two public information meetings were held at the Ripon City Hall.
During the period of June 2002 through May 2003, the steering committee held monthly meetings to review various
proposals for changes in the land use, circulation, housing, open space, safety and economic development elements.
The following are some of the major decisions made by the committee incorporated into the proposed updated
document:
•   Amend the primary urban boundaries to increase developable lands equivalent to those used up during the
    previous 5-year period.
•   Remove approximately 400 acres from the primary urban boundary in the southeast and increase the urban
    development lands in the north along the Jack Tone Road corridor.
•   Facilitate an exchange of lands designated as Urban Reserve within the Ripon General Plan boundary on the
    south side of State Route 99 near Austin Road with the City of Manteca for similar acreage on the north side of
    State Route 99 west of Jack Tone Road.
                                                         1-7                            Adopted September 19, 2006

At the end of this series of meetings, the committee approved a draft land use diagram, and changes in the plan
document were initiated.
Consultants were selected to perform the following tasks:
Circulation Element (CCS Planning and Engineering, Inc.)
Environmental Impact Report Update (InSite Environmental – Charles Simpson)
Public Facilities Financing Plan Update (Goodwin & Associates)
Housing Element (Lou Thomas – Planning Consultant)
Subsequently, a public review draft of the updated general plan (Ripon General Plan 2040) was prepared for
circulation.
1.5      PUBLIC FACILITIES FINANCING PLAN
Incorporated by reference in the Ripon General Plan 2035 is the Public Facilities Financing Plan (PFFP), initially
prepared by Taussig and Associates, which describes those public facilities such as water, sewer, storm drain,
roadways, police stations, libraries, parks and recreation facilities (community centers, youth activity centers,
softball/baseball/ soccer complexes, etc.) needed to serve future developed areas in the general plan, and those costs
associated with constructing these facilities.
Included in the 2005 Update, prepared by Goodwin & Associates, are amended fees to address adjusted costs
associated with these various facilities.
1.6      GENERAL PLAN ORGANIZATION
The General Plan 2040 (2005 Update) document consists of three (3) volumes. Volume I is organized into topical
chapters that discuss the seven subjects mandated by state law, along with the added subject of Economic
Development. Volume II is the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the General Plan 2040 (2005 Update) and
Volume III is the technical appendix.
Volume I
Chapter One - Executive Summary, presents an introduction and background.
Chapter Two - Land Use, illustrates the Planning Area land use with written material and diagrams.
Chapter Three - Circulation, provides information on transportation for the present and future.
Chapter Four - Community Health and Safety, refers to health and safety concerns and discusses noise.
Chapter Five - Open Space and Conservation, describes area resources.
                                                        1-8                             Adopted September 19, 2006

Volume I - Chapter One                                                                       Executive Summary
Chapter Six - Housing, discusses methods of achieving affordable housing and providing the City’s share of the
regional housing needs.
Chapter Seven - Economic Development, presents the City’s economic development strategy.
Chapter Eight - Implementation, presents the tools available to the City to attain its General Plan goals.
Volume II
The primary purpose of a General Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is to fulfill the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) requirements for the disclosure of the environmental impacts, and identification of mitigation
measures and alternatives prior to adoption of a General Plan. And, while not as specific as an EIR prepared for a
project application, a General Plan EIR can serve as the primary basis for preparing Initial Studies, issuing Negative
Declarations, or information included in future EIRs.
The City of Ripon’s General Plan 2035 EIR served as a: 1) tiering document; 2) Program EIR; and 3) Master
Environmental Assessment, in an effort to streamline the permitting of projects whenever appropriate. The City of
Ripon intends the General Plan 2040 (2005 Update) EIR to serve as such. All of these documents are detailed in the
General Plan EIR Purpose and Organization Section.
Volume III
The Technical Appendix contains a list of documents incorporated by reference within the text of the General Plan and
while not attached as part of the policy document, are available for review at City Hall or the Ripon Public Library.
Background material used in the preparation of the General Plan is contained in the separate documents. While the
information contained in these documents was not adopted as policy by the City Council, and are not essential for the
day-to-day use or implementation of the Plan, they nevertheless provide valuable aid in the overall understanding of
the Plan.

VOLUME I - CHAPTER TWO
LAND USE AND GROWTH
ACCOMMODATIONS
2.1      INTRODUCTION
Purpose
The Land Use Chapter establishes land use, growth accommodation and community design goals, policies, and
actions to give direction to development in Ripon. The Land Use chapter provides the central policy background on
which to base all land use decision-making in the City. It is through the realization of the goals and carrying out of
corresponding actions that the future land use patterns of Ripon will continue to be shaped.
Assumptions of this land use component are: 1) continued growth will require the eventual conversion of agricultural
lands; 2) demand for new residential development will remain at its current pace; and 3) the demand for new
commercial and industrial uses will increase.
ESTABLISHING A VISION. The underlying intent of the land use component is to support the vision of the community
as developed through a citizen participation program early in the General Plan process.
Consistency with State Planning Law
State Government Code requires that a general plan include a land use component that designates the general
distribution and general location and extent of various types of land use. This chapter includes a land use diagram
and land use standards that meet the State Government Code requirements.
2.2      GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL A: A BALANCE BETWEEN JOBS, HOUSING, EDUCATIONAL, AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.
Policy A1. Designate adequate land to meet residential, commercial, and industrial development needs.
Policy A2. Designate adequate land intended for public and quasi-public uses to support existing and new residential,
commercial, and industrial development.
Policy A3. Urban development should be kept as contiguous as possible to avoid premature urbanization of valuable
farmland, promote resident convenience, and provide for economy in city services.
Policy A4. Preserve natural resource areas while providing open space to meet recreation needs.
Policy A5. The City may require that development occurring on newly annexed lands are done as a Planned Unit
Development or that a Specific Plan be prepared.
Policy A6. The City may require execution of an Annexation Agreement before the annexation of any land to the
City.

2.3 POPULATION
During the 1980's, Ripon experienced rapid growth well above the 4% annual rate it typically experienced since its
incorporation in 1945. In fact, between 1980 and 1987, the annual growth rate exceeded 10%. (Table 2.1 gives a
detailed summary of the population levels from 1960 through 2005)

Faced with the problems that such growth inevitably presents to a community (wastewater treatment, schools, etc.),
The City created a growth accommodation program in 1988, which allowed development to continue, but at a much
more acceptable rate. Since implementation of the program, the City has experienced an annual growth rate of 3.9%.
2.4 GROWTH ACCOMMODATION
The City’s residential growth accommodation program sets the average annual residential growth rate at 3% to 6%
during the planning period shown in General Plan 2040. Percentage rates for any single year could go higher or
lower although the City policy would be to maintain growth at 3% to 6% through the planning period. The City
Council, in 1999, set an interim maximum rate at 3% with the option to raise it to 4% if an individual project
contained features for the good of the community. Enough land will be annexed by the City to provide for the
projected growth rate.
Build-Out Population
According to the State Department of Finance, as of January 1, 2005, Ripon had a population of approximately
13,241 persons. It is anticipated that annual residential development within the Primary Urban Area will be at a rate
of 4% (an average of a little more than 700 people per year), and will result in an estimated total population of about
40,000 at build-out of the general plan no earlier than the year 2040.
2.5 DEFINITIONS OF LAND USE CATEGORIES
The Land Use Map (Exhibit 2.1and 2.1a) illustrates proposed land use in Ripon and the surrounding area through the
year 2040, depending on the rate of growth. Boundary lines between the land use designations usually follow parcel
lines. These lines may be made more specific by amendments to the General Plan as more detailed planning for
projects are undertaken in these areas.

2.6 THE PLANNING AREA
Planning Area Boundaries
The Ripon Planning Area consists of approximately 13,400 acres both within and outside the existing City limits.
This area, as shown in Exhibit 2.2, is generally bounded by Austin Road to the west, Carrolton Road to the east,
Highway 120 to the north, and the Stanislaus River to the south.
Land Area Summary
The Ripon Planning Area is divided into five (5) urban and non-urban categories. Three (3) urban development areas
have been established to assist in achieving orderly and balanced growth, while two (2) reserve areas are designated
for study and non-urbanized buffer purposes during the planning period. (Chart 2.1; Land Area Summary, details the
acreage and percentages associated with each of these areas.)

Existing Urban Area (Existing City Limits as of January 01, 2006). There are approximately 3,250 acres within the
Urban Core Area. It includes most of the urban development within the City limits as it existed in January 2006, and
approximately 450 acres of undeveloped lands situated in various spots throughout the City:
PrimaryUrban Area (Sphere of Influence minus the Existing Urban Area). Those lands designated for future
development during the planning period of the General Plan, aside from those within the Existing Urban Area
contained within the Primary Urban Area. There are approximately 3,775 acres contained in the Primary Urban
Area. It is generally bounded by a line midway between Frederick Road and Olive Avenue on the west;
approximately ¼ mile north of Graves Road on the north; Murphy Road on the east; and the Stanislaus River on the
south. The Primary Urban Area is depicted by the yellow line in exhibit 2.1. (The Primary Urban Area boundary
also delineates the Sphere of Influence boundary for the City of Ripon.)
Secondary Urban Area (Area outside the Primary Urban Area within the City of Ripon’s long term planning
influence). Those lands outside the Primary Urban Area not anticipated to develop during the 35 year planning
period. There are approximately 6,380 acres contained in the Secondary Urban Area. These lands have been
designated as one of the following Reserve Areas:
     • Urban Reserve Area. This area contains approximately 2,875 acres and is intended for study purposes should

     • Agricultural Reserve Area. Approximately 2,875 acres within the Ripon Planning Area has been designated
          Agricultural Reserve. The properties within this area are not eligible for urban development within the
          current planning period, however, they would serve as agricultural buffers between development adjacent,
          but outside of, the Planning Area and Ripon
     • Resource Reserve Area. There are approximately 630 acres designated as Resource Reserve in the Secondary
          Urban Area. These lands are located along the Stanislaus River corridor and are not intended for urban
          development. Rather, these lands would become a part of the community’s wildlife habitat preservation

 2.7 INFRASTRUCTURE
The effects on the infrastructure (i.e., basic installation of roads, potable and non-potable water distribution lines, storm
drainage collection lines, and sanitary sewer collection lines, etc.) of future development within the 2000 City Limits
are expected to be small. On the other hand, projected development of the unincorporated portions of the Planning
Area will produce substantial demand for new and upgraded infrastructure. The following sections discuss the
implications of the various elements for the infrastructure system.
Water Service
Groundwater Basin
The City of Ripon has its own water system that provides water to all residents and businesses within the City.
Groundwater is the source of potable water supply. The City also has non-potable supplies from non-potable City
wells, surface water from the South San Joaquin Irrigation District, and treated non-potable groundwater from Nestle
groundwater extraction and treatment facilities. Several industries and schools have wells on their own property for
irrigation and industrial use.
The City of Ripon is located within California’s Central Valley, at the northern end of the San Joaquin Valley.
Groundwater supplies 40 percent of the water used in the San Joaquin Valley during years with normal precipitation,
and higher percentages during drought years. In the drought year of 1977, groundwater provided about 80% of
agriculture needs in the San Joaquin Valley.
The Central Valley is considered an alluvial basin, which acts as a groundwater resource. There are two primary
groundwater aquifers underlying the City of Ripon planning area. The two aquifers have a combined annual recharge
of 196,000 to 263,000 acre-feet annually. Using a conservative estimate of 15% of the specific yield, the estimated
available groundwater per 1,000 surface acres is approximately 6,000 acre-feet. Over the approximately 10-square mile
of planning area, this would amount to nearly 40,000 acre-feet. This analysis has not taken into account surface water
infiltration along the Stanislaus River, which would increase the potential groundwater available in the Ripon area.
The City was an active participant in the October 2001 Water Management Plan for San Joaquin County that was
conducted under the lead of the San Joaquin County Flood Control and Water Conservation District. The County
Study identified that the Eastern San Joaquin County Groundwater Basin, which includes the Ripon area, is critically
over drafted in some parts. The critical overdraft areas are located in the central part of the basin near Stockton, and
near the northern boundary north of the Mokelumme River. The study identified that overdraft is not typically a
problem in the southern portion of the basin, where Ripon is located, since irrigation districts in that area have
sufficient surface water supplies and conveyance facilities and have historically not relied heavily on groundwater for
irrigation.
Ripon is located at the southernmost boundary of the basin and has not experienced overdraft due to its location
adjacent to the Stanislaus River and its relatively small demand compared with other users. The City has adopted a
Groundwater Preservation Plan to proactively address stabilizing and enhancing the groundwater levels in the Ripon
area as future growth occurs. This plan provides the planning framework for groundwater recharge basins in the
general area around the City.
Potable Municipal Groundwater Wells
All of Ripon’s potable water currently is supplied from (8) groundwater wells. These wells tap underground reserves
or aquifers from approximately 125 to 450 feet below the ground surface. The aquifers are replenished by rainfall, the
Stanislaus River, and agricultural irrigation water. Annual water production in Ripon over the last twenty-five years
has increased from 1,067 acre-feet in 1980 to 2,195 acre-feet in 1990, to 4,021 acre-feet in 2000 4,565 acre-feet in
                                                               2 -69
                                                                                                   Adopted September 19, 2006

2002, and finally in 2005 to 4,615 acre-feet.
The City currently has well capacity in excess of their average daily demand, and uses the wells to help meet summer
peaking needs. In the future, the City will construct additional groundwater wells as needed to meet increased
demands. If the City’s existing potable wells were pumped at their maximum capacity over the entire year, the total
water supply would be almost 16,000 acre-feet.
Currently the City has a 1.55 million gallon (MG) elevated water storage tank, which was constructed in 2002, and
currently a 2.5 million gallon elevated water storage tank is under construction. Water storage is used to help meet
peak hour needs and for fire protection.
1.55 million gallon (MG) water tower constructed in 2002    2.5 million gallon (MG) water tower under construction
In 1996 the City completed the upgrade and replacement of all substandard potable water lines per improvements
identified in the Ripon Redevelopment Agency Downtown Water System Improvement Project.
The City has a master plan for expansion of the potable water system to meet the present and future demands of the
community. Expansion will consist of additional wells and above ground storage capacity to ensure an adequate supply
of potable water. The City plans to construct 10 new 1.5M elevated storage tanks, and 13 new domestic water wells
during the planning period covered by the Water Master Plan 2040.
Groundwater Quality
The City chlorinates all its potable groundwater. All wells and storage tanks are designed to allow chlorine injection.
One well has GAC filters to remove chemicals. The most prevalent chemicals found in groundwater in the Ripon area
include:       trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE), a solvent used for dry cleaning; and
dibromochloropropane (DBCP), an agricultural pesticide for control of worms.
Other groundwater quality issues faced by the City include hardness, nitrates, arsenic, and total dissolved solids (TDS).
     • Hardness is an aesthetic issue, not a health and safety issue. Hard water requires use of more soap for cleaning,
          and can cause scaling and staining of water heaters and fixtures.
     • Nitrates are a health and safety issue. The safe nitrate limit for domestic water is set at 45 mg/L by the U.S.
          Environmental Protection Agency. The City is exploring treatment options in lieu of abandoning wells with
          high nitrate levels. The City has abandoned a few wells because of nitrate contamination.
     • Arsenic at levels close to the new maximum contaminant limit (10 ug/l) recently adopted by EPA has been
          found at two wells. The City will provide treatment when required.

                                                                                                    Adopted September 19, 2006

Volume I - Chapter Two                                                 Land Use and Growth Accommodations
    • TDS is not an issue for drinking water, but is a potential issue with respect to wastewater disposal. The TDS of
        the City’s potable drinking water is below the secondary limit of 500 mg/1, and well below the maximum of
        1,000 mg/1. However, future wastewater disposal requirements for disposal by percolation may require
        reductions in the TDS of treated wastewater effluent, which is typically higher in TDS than the potable
        groundwater. This may require additional wastewater treatment or alternative disposal methods in the future.
On all potable wells, the following protection measures are used: sanitary seals at a minimum of 150 feet in depth,
well head is set up 2 feet above ground level; and daily visual inspections are made. During construction of new
wells, the City ensures that there are no sewer lines within 50 feet.
Non-Potable Municipal Groundwater Wells
The City has two non-potable municipal wells that can be used as supply for the non-potable water system. The water
quality of these wells is not suitable for potable use, but can be used for irrigation and other suitable uses. Currently
the City has a 550,000 gallon storage tank with booster pumps for non-potable water use and storage.
The wells could provide up to 2,800 acre-feet per year of non-potable water if pumped 365 days per year at the design
production rate. Assuming that the wells are pumped for 6 months each year for irrigation during the dry season, the
annual volume would be 1,400 acre-feet per year.
South San Joaquin Irrigation District Surface Water
The South San Joaquin Irrigation District (SSJID), a 72,000-acre district that surrounds and includes the City, has
historically provided water for agricultural irrigation in the Ripon area. SSJID’s major facilities and assets include full
or partial ownership in several storage reservoirs, various rights in the Federal New melons Reservoir project, about
30 miles of water transmission facilities, and more than 350 miles of distribution pipelines and channels located
throughout the District.
In 1999, the City of Ripon entered into an agreement with the SSJID for surface water that can be used for
groundwater recharge or municipal and industrial (M&I) use. The City intends to use this water for non-potables uses,
such as irrigation or for industrial/commercial process or cooling water.
SSJID has an extensive distribution system in and around Ripon allowing for the delivery of water to locations
favorable to groundwater recharge. Currently, the City has three basins used to recharge SSJID water: a quarter-acre
water hazard on a golf course, a twenty acre open field, and an approximately 3-acre site between the City’s
wastewater ponds and the City’s urban area. In the future, the City will distribute the water between groundwater
recharge and the City’s non-potable water system.
Other Non-Potable Water Sources
In 2003, the City entered into an agreement with Nestle to receive treated groundwater from its Groundwater
Treatment Facilities for conveyance to other parties for non-potable water uses. Nestle currently operates in the City a
groundwater extraction and treatment system that is currently discharging to the City’s industrial sewer. Nestle will be
constructing additional groundwater extraction and treatment facilities. Treatment includes GAC filters and air
stripping, and the treated groundwater is high quality. Both the City and Nestle desired that such treated groundwater
be dedicated to beneficial non-potable uses.
According to the terms of this agreement, Nestle will supply the City with treated groundwater at an average rate of
about 500 gallons per minute year-round. To convey the treated groundwater from the Nestle facility, the City has
completed construction of a pipeline that ties into the City’s existing non-potable system.
                                                            2 -71
                                                                                                 Adopted September 19, 2006

 Non-Potable Water System
 The City has a codified ordinance for the distribution and use of non-potable water in a system entirely separate from
 the City’s potable water supply. The intent of the non-potable water system is to supplement and conserve the City’s
 potable groundwater supply. Water used in the non-potable system does not need to meet current potable water
 standards and could be either groundwater that is not suitable for domestic use or surface water from SSJID (or other
 future sources). Non-potable water will be used for landscape irrigation, and for industrial/commercial uses such as
 cooling water.
 The City’s current Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance specifies that all new or rehabilitated landscapes must
 include an irrigation design plan including a dual water system to permit non-potable water, unless the City grants a
 written exemption. The irrigation systems must make use of non-potable water unless the City grants a written
 exemption stating that non-potable water is not available and will not be available in the foreseeable future.
 The non-potable system currently includes three sections of pipeline north of Highway 99 with four planned phases of
 expansion. In 1995 the City constructed approximately 6,000 linear feet of 12-inch non-potable water line in a
 commercial/industrial area. In 1996, a subdivision was constructed with approximately 1,400 linear feet of 12-inch
 non-potable water line. This section of the non-potable water line was tied into a well site that is no longer used for
 domestic water due to high nitrate levels. In 2003, the City constructed a pipeline from the Nestle groundwater
 treatment facility that ties into the existing non-potable lines located on the north and south sides of Highway 99.
 When this pipeline is completed, there will be about 3 miles of non-potable pipeline in place.
 The non-potable system master plan adopted by the City will eventually extend pipelines throughout the incorporated
 and unincorporated areas of Ripon.
Sewage Disposal System
The City provides domestic sewage disposal for all residents, businesses, and schools within the City. Industrial
sewage is also provided for all users, except Fox River Paper Company, which has its own facility. A combination of
ponding, aeration and land irrigation is the method used for sewage disposal. Approximately 100 acres in the
floodplain of the Stanislaus River has been isolated from the river by levees and separated into two-acre to five-acre
ponds. An additional 18-acre site, not protected by levees, is used for the industrial water disposal.
The City operates eight (8) sanitary sewage pump stations; Doak Boulevard and Jack Tone Road, Oak Street, Parallel
Avenue, Jack Tone Road and North Frontage Road, Boesch Drive and North Acacia Avenue, Franklin Avenue, East
Milgeo Rd, and at the treatment plant headwork’s at the south end of Acacia Avenue.
The use of ponding aeration for domestic and industrial sewage is an efficient and economical means of treating
sewage. Occasionally ponds produce an odor when there are algae blooms. This has been a major reason for
designating areas near to the treatment ponds for nonresidential use. Continued restriction of residential uses near to
the treatment ponds appears prudent. Other cities that use mechanical aeration have adopted similar policies.
Eighty (80) acres of ponds are available to process domestic effluent similar to a farming operation and can process
effluent from more than thirteen thousand (13,000) people at normal rates of production.
The industrial effluent is handled like a farming operation using flood irrigation. Diked levees are formed to handle
one day’s effluent and the areas are rotated on a 14-day schedule. The soil is currently tilled after the irrigation; in the
future it may be used to plant crops. During potential flooding, industrial effluent is placed in the domestic ponds.
Modest user fees, sewer district taxes, and annexation hookup fees help offset costs for operation and expansion of
sewer facilities. The City Council, in 1993, moved to adopt a study done by Dewante and Stowell to look at other
                                                           2 -72

Volume I - Chapter Two                                                Land Use and Growth Accommodations
alternatives for sewage treatment. A policy statement, setting a goal to build a Wastewater Treatment Plant, has also
been adopted by the City Council.
The City is currently exploring the possibility of connecting with the City of Modesto’s wastewater disposal system as
an alternative to modifying or expanding Ripon’s existing disposal system.
At this time, it is envisioned that the system connection would necessitate the extension of a force main line, possibly
16 to 18 inches in diameter, eight miles to Modesto’s Sutter Avenue plant, and modification of an existing lift station
at the Ripon facility.
THE MAJOR ISSUES BEING STUDIED WITH MODESTO
1. The specific type of project anticipated to be undertaken.
2. The maximum and minimum intensity of any anticipated subsequent project, such as the number of residences in a
    residential development, and, with regard to a public works facility, its anticipated capacity and service area.
3. The anticipated location, and alternative locations, for the collection facilities.
4. A capital outlay or capital improvement program, or other scheduling or implementing device that governs the
    submission and approval of subsequent projects.
Storm Drainage System
Ripon has four (4) systems for handling storm water run off. Storm water drainage in the older industrial part of the
City west of State Route 99 flows into the industrial sewage lines. Another portion is pumped into South San Joaquin
Irrigation District lines or canals. The largest portion of the drainage flows by gravity through seven (7) outfalls
directly into the Stanislaus River. The commercial area north of State Route 99 near Jack Tone Road is collected and
taken to a storm water detention pond. The water can be pumped south into a City gravity storm drainage line in Jack
Tone Road that drains into the Stanislaus River. Most of the soils in the planning area are of the sandy loam type,
providing good percolation and little erosion and sedimentation. The terrain generally slopes toward the Stanislaus
River, allowing gravity flow of storm water. Although the current system appears adequate for severe storms, the City
shall encourage the installation of new drainage facilities to accommodate future growth and enhance existing storm
water protection.
The City has developed a sixty-acre storm basin in the North Pointe Area to serve approximately one thousand acres
of future development in the area.
Solid Waste Disposal
Solid waste is collected from residences, schools, and businesses by the City in its own equipment and delivered to
San Joaquin County’s Lovelace Transfer Station where it is combined with other wastes and shipped to the Foothill
Land Disposal Site. Solid waste from commercial, and industrial, plants is handled by private operators.
In 2000, the City disposed of 9,602 tons of solid waste. The figures are taken from the annual report prepared by San
Joaquin County. The average solid waste disposal in 2000 was approximately one ton per person, based on a
population of 10,400.
Public Facilities Finance Plan
A Public Facilities Finance Plan (PFFP) has been prepared to implement Ripon’s General Plan. The PFFP provides
                                                           2 -73

Volume I - Chapter Two                                                Land Use and Growth Accommodations
an approach by which all public facilities required to serve land uses in the General Plan can be funded. The PFFP
includes:
•   List of all public improvements by major facility category
•   Estimated facility costs by category
•   Recommended level of funding by financing mechanism for each facility category
•   Computation of annual or total financing burdens assigned to each land use type under each recommended
     financing mechanism
•   A discussion of the tool procedures associated with recommended funding mechanisms
•   Sufficient detail to proceed with implementation of first phase development.
Land Use Goal E incorporates by reference the Public Facilities Finance Plan into this Chapter of the General Plan and
it can be found in the Technical Appendices (Volume III).
2.8 OTHER SERVICES
Natural gas service is provided by, Pacific Gas & Electric Company, telephone service is provided by Verizon; and
cable T.V. is provided by Charter Communications.
Both Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and the Modesto Irrigation District (MID) provide electrical service
to the community.
2.9       SCHOOLS
Schools for Ripon residents are provided by the Ripon Unified School District (public schools), Ripon Christian
Schools (private), Yosemite Junior College District (Modesto Junior College and Columbia Junior College), and the
San Joaquin Community College District (San Joaquin Delta College).
The school board and teachers of the public school system have established criteria for classroom size and instruction
aimed at providing quality education for the community’s children.
This tends to reduce the potential for securing state support for new facilities, because the least support is given to
schools having only twenty-five students per classroom.
The community has shared the interests of the school board and teachers in providing a quality school system, and
collects fees from all residential construction to offset costs for new schools, mainly restrooms and administrative
facilities.
Current public schools within the City Limits are Ripon Elementary and Ripon High School (Acacia and Main),
Ripona Elementary School (Oregon), Weston Elementary School (Jack Tone and Stanley) and Park View Elementary
(Cindy Drive and E. River Road).
Colony Oak Elementary, at Murphy and Santos, is the only public school campus not actually located within the
current City limits. (Exhibit 2.5 shows existing school sites.)

2.10 NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION
The City’s code enforcement effort is designed to protect the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. Code
enforcement activities include monitoring and rehabilitation programs to detect and improve housing units in
deteriorating condition. Rehabilitation efforts preserve housing, commercial, and industrial units from demolition with
a goal of improving the appearance of neighborhoods and make the City an attractive and desirable place.
In an effort to approach code enforcement in a comprehensive manner the City created the Neighborhood Code
Compliance Division in 1999 under the Director of Planning and Economic Development. Under these new
provisions, the code compliance team was created consisting of representatives from each of the City’s regulatory
departments (i.e. Planning, police, building) along with the City Attorney’s office and Ripon Consolidated Fire
District. The team meets on a monthly basis to review and act on code complaints, and on occasion, holds hearings
regarding extreme cases. Through the team, staff monitors ongoing violations for the removal of abandoned vehicles,

VOLUME I - CHAPTER THREE
CIRCULATION AND
TRANSPORTATION
3.1      INTRODUCTION
The Circulation and Transportation Chapter presents goals and policies that: 1) coordinate the transportation and
circulation system with planned land uses; 2) promote the efficient movement of people, goods and services within the
Ripon area; 3) use the existing systems to their fullest extent; and 4) plan for practices that will improve the systems.
Acknowledgment
San Joaquin County Council of Governments (COG) prepared a draft for Circulation and Transportation to be
included in the Ripon General Plan Update. This chapter, as it has been drafted, uses the document as a model. The
complete document as prepared by SJCOG is included in the Appendix to the General Plan.
Purpose
Circulation and transportation are required topics in any general plan under California State Law. It is designed
to:
•   Show the existing and future demands on the transportation system and adjacent land areas during the
    Planning Period to 2040;
•   Identify the location and general scope of existing and future transportation routes and facilities, based upon the
    above needs;
•   Identify policies and priorities to be used by the City in preparing its future capital improvement programs, and in
    dealing with development proposals within and next to the City’s boundaries;
•   Establish a technical basis to support policies to fund these improvements.
Assumptions About the Future
The City of Ripon has established principles and policies in its General Plan to guide the community’s development
and growth throughout the planning period. These principles and policies have a direct impact on the circulation
system. They establish assumptions that a discussion on circulation must address.
KEY TRANSPORTATION ASSUMPTIONS IN RIPON’S GENERAL PLAN ARE:
1. At an annual growth rate of 4%, Ripon will have a population base of 20,524 by the year 2020, and an
    employment base of 5,192.
2. The City will change from a community that exports workers to other cities and counties to one that imports
                                                                                                 Adopted September 19, 2006
                                                            3-1

Volume I - Chapter Three                                                         Circulation and Transportation
     workers to the area.
3. Ripon will undertake a sizeable effort toward economic development that relies upon the circulation system as a
     prime community attribute. Community building and enhancing activities will continue to be promoted in Ripon’s
     circulation system as evidenced by the adoption of the Bicycle Route Master Plan.
4. While Ripon’s Circulation System will continue to support its strong economic ties to Stanislaus County and the
     City of Modesto, greater emphasis will be given to regional connections with the addition of the Olive/River
     expressway and future river crossing linking with Gates Road.
5. As of the 2000 Census, Ripon is included in Modesto’s Urban Area. All Federal transit funds will be received
     through the City of Modesto.
Understanding that these population and employment projections are comparatively high for a community the size of
Ripon is important; they are targeted by the City to take advantage of future opportunities afforded by Ripon’s
strategic location. Ripon lies along a major intrastate transportation corridor, State Route 99 and the Central Valley
route of the Union/Pacific Railroad. It is also positioned on the outer edge of the Bay Area’s commute patterns.
Key Issues and Concerns
This discussion on Circulation must be responsive to the pressing community-wide needs of the City of Ripon. These
are expressed below as issues and concerns, and are simply illustrative of more detailed discussions that will follow in
the rest of this chapter.
ISSUES AND CONCERNS:
1. What steps can the City take to expand opportunities for non-automobile trips within the Ripon area, and to points
    outside the Ripon area? Specifically this deals with transit and bicycle opportunities including those to Stanislaus
    County.
2. What roadways are going to need to be widened, extended, and created to meet the future demands caused by
    population and employment growth?
3. What interchange improvements will be necessary to approach State Route 99 in an effective manner?
4. Can an alternative be provided over the Stanislaus River so that more than one option exists?
5. What opportunities will be presented with the development of River Road as a regional expressway?
3.2        GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL A: PROVIDE A CIRCULATION SYSTEM CORRELATED WITH EXISTING AND PROPOSED LAND USE THAT
CONTRIBUTES TO EFFICIENT AND SAFE MOVEMENT OF PERSONS, GOODS, AND SERVICES WITHIN AND THROUGH
RIPON.
Policy A1. The City will maintain existing streets and intersections in a safe condition and require new streets to be
built to City standards, except under extraordinary circumstances which require a finding to be made by the City
Engineer that to deviate will not adversely affect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City.

Policy A2. The City will require adequate access and circulation be made available to every new development,
without adversely affecting the existing circulation system.
Policy A3. New streets will be designed to discourage heavy through traffic within residential neighborhoods, but
will also provide direct and adequate access for emergency service vehicles.
Policy A4. The City will consider visual aesthetics and safety aspects in future developments, including landscaping
requirements and setback requirements.
Policy A5. The City will not allow private streets in residential developments except in Planned Unit Developments.
Policy A6. A Level of Service (LOS) of “D” will be the minimum standard for all streets within the City.
Policy A7. Require off-street parking for all development, and any other project or event that will cause a safety or
parking congestion problem when parking is allowed on the streets.
Policy A8. Implement parking control measures, as necessary, to promote the efficient use of parking facilities.
Policy A9. The City will consider the creation of new alleys in development projects. However, they will be required
 to be constructed to City standards with those in residential projects being dedicated to the City as public rights-of-
way if not located in a Planned Unit Development.
Policy A10. The City will maintain a program of identification and surveillance of high traffic accident locations,
with emphasis on early detection and correction of conditions that could potentially constitute traffic hazards.
GOAL B. MINIMIZE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF DEVELOPMENT ON THE EXISTING AND FUTURE CIRCULATION
FACILITIES.
Policy B1. Development within the city that is likely to generate significant levels of daily or peak hour traffic on
local streets will be required to have a traffic study prepared by a qualified traffic engineer at the applicants expense.
The study will identify potential traffic impacts and specify improvement measures needed to assure an acceptable
service level on affected streets.
Policy B2. On and off-site circulation improvements, dedication of rights-of-way, and reciprocal easements may be
required at the time of development as conditions of approval.
Policy B3. Development will be responsible for paying all costs associated with providing all new streets or expanded
roadway facilities required by traffic access and circulation needs of that development.
Policy B4. Investigate potential locations for park and ride lots and a multi-modal station within the community with
an emphasis for facilities near State Route 99.
Policy B5. Pursue alternate funding sources, including County, State, and Federal funds to implement the City’s
Circulation Plan.
Policy B6. The City will actively support and encourage the San Joaquin County Council of Governments and
Caltrans in promoting planning and funding for additional mainline SR99 improvements as needed.

Policy I1. Cooperate with and support San Joaquin and Stanislaus County airport facilities in the development of
passenger and airfreight services.
3.3        CIRCULATION SYSTEM
The general well being of Ripon, and any modern city, is dependent on its ability to transport people and goods
efficiently and safely within, and through its boundaries. The network of highways, roads, and streets that move its
residents and goods define, and simultaneously constrain the City itself. Mobility within and through Ripon is still
easy because of its small size. Some aspects of its physical setting constrain future expansions of the City’s
transportation systems.
3.4        DESCRIPTION OF EXISITING CONDITIONS AND FACILITIES
Roads and Streets
Like any community, Ripon, has developed a road and street system that is the backbone of its transportation network.
No matter the choice of method of transportation (auto, pedestrian, bicycle or transit) a traveler in Ripon will be
following the roadway network. The system works to serve the needs of the existing community well. However,
opportunities and constraints exist for the City’s future. Both as an obstacle and an opportunity, State Route 99 bisects
the community. The roadway network varies significantly on each side of the freeway, and there has not been a
seamless meshing of the two. The southwest side is the older developed part of town with a common grid system for
the most part. Most of the community activity is off West Main Street, with industrial and school activities located
against the River or the Freeway while the Jack Tone Road corridor is rapidly becoming a major highway service
center. The northeast side has developed with residential activity nestled between the old County pattern and
commercial and industrial activity along the frontage road. (Exhibit 3.1 shows the street network as it exists in 2005.)

The Freeway
State Route 99, Ripon’s gateway to the rest of California, bisects the community as a six-lane freeway.
As shown in Chart 3.1, over 100,000 vehicles a day pass through Ripon. This is the most heavily traveled north-south
route through the Central Valley connecting Northern and Southern California.

The City’s location contributes in large part to Ripon’s population growth during the 1980s and 90s. Ripon is an
attractive residential area for professionals working in Modesto, Stockton and the Bay Area. The easy access to the
freeway system is probably a major factor in residential location decisions. The same factor could prove important for
economic development opportunities for the City.
Crossing the Freeway
Physical limitations to travel between the northeast and southwest portions of the City are created by State Route 99,
and the Union Pacific/Southern Pacific Railroad running parallel through the City. Transportation movements
between northeast and southwest portions of the City are funneled onto three (3) overpasses. This has significant
implications for the City’s growth, internal communication, and safety. All three (3) connections span the freeway and
the railroad tracks.
Two (2) of the roadways connecting the north and south parts of the City have limitations.
•   The Main Street over crossing is a route requiring at least two turns to cross the Freeway but provides full
     freeway access north and south.
•   The Fulton Avenue over crossing is an interchange with northbound freeway access only, and is limited to two
     travel lanes crossing the freeway.
However, the Jack Tone Road interchange is a dynamically designed facility which will serve large volumes of traffic,
especially trucks, long into the future. It is the center-piece of a thriving highway service corridor focusing on
highway motorists.

Volume I - Chapter Three                                                          Circulation and Transportation
Crossing the Stanislaus River
State Route 99 is Ripon’s only direct access southward across the Stanislaus River to Salida, Modesto, and other
destinations to the south. A single southern crossing limits the City circulation system and restricts regional travel. (It
can be closed by emergencies.) However, with the construction of the recently completed bike/pedestrian bridge over
the Stanislaus River such users no longer need to use the SR99 Bridge.
Existing Circulation System
Main Street’s function is to move traffic east to west. It provides access to residential, school, and park areas of the
City on both sides of State Route 99. West Main Street has been reconstructed in the Downtown area, and widened
between Wilma Avenue and Jack Tone Road as the result of development.
Milgeo Road is a minor collector, but its role is limited because of many driveways and intersections.
Doak Boulevard has been developed into a two-lane minor collector with a landscaped median from Mohler Road to
Vera Avenue in the residential areas while turn lanes have been provided between Vera Avenue and S. Stockton Street
in industrial districts. Eventually, Doak Boulevard will continue westerly and connect with Hutchinson and ultimately
with Austin Road.
Colony Road is a minor arterial serving east to west traffic between North Ripon Road and Jack Tone Road
interchange.
Santos Avenue is a minor arterial serving east to west traffic between North Ripon Road and Fulton Drive and Hoff
Drive to Frontage Road.
River Road is a major arterial and the connection between N. Ripon and N. Jack Tone Road has been completed. It is
anticipated that it will become an expressway in the future with westerly extension to a new interchange between
Austin and Jack Tone Roads.
State Route 99 divides north-south travel, except at Jack Tone Road because of the State Route 99/Jack Tone
interchange. North Manley Road, Fulton Avenue and Stockton Avenue/North Ripon Road are important north-south
roads on the north side of the State Route 99. Jack Tone Road, Robert Avenue, Wilma Avenue and Stockton Avenue
serve as north south collectors on the south side of State Route 99. Frontage roads provide access to highway and
commercial service businesses on both sides of State Route 99.
Level of Service
To evaluate the operational characteristics of a roadway, a simple grading system is used that compares the traffic
volume carried by a road with the capacity of that road. The ratio of the volume to capacity (volume/capacity) is an
indicator of traffic conditions, speeds, and driver maneuverability. (See Table 3.1)
Roadway Classifications
Roads can be classified and defined several different ways, but the most commonly used approach is to characterize
them by their function, that is, how they are used. (See Table 3.2)
                                                        3-8

Volume I - Chapter Three                                                             Circulation and Transportation
Traffic Control Device Development Fees are being collected from residential, commercial and industrial development
based upon the traffic each project is expected to produce. The fees will be used for traffic signals and other
improvements when traffic volumes require.
                                                      Table 3.1
                                                LEVEL OF SERVICE
A    Conditions of free flow; speed is controlled by driver=s desires, speed limits, or physical roadway conditions.
B    Conditions of stable flow; operating speeds beginning to be restricted; little or no restrictions on
     maneuverability from other vehicles.
C    Conditions of stable flow; speeds and maneuverability more closely restricted; occasional backups behind
     left turning vehicles at intersections.
D    Conditions approach unstable flow; satisfactory speeds can be maintained by temporary restrictions may
     cause extensive delays; little freedom to maneuver; comfort and convenience low; at intersections, some
     motorists, especially those making left turns may wait through one or more signal changes.
E    Conditions approach capacity; unstable flow with stoppages of momentary duration; maneuverability
     severely limited.
F    Forced flow conditions; stoppages for long periods; low operating speeds.
Traffic Patterns
Ripon has little in the way of traffic congestion. Most streets have plenty of capacity, and peak hours are not a serious
issue. The heaviest amount of congestion is at State Route 99 especially during peak commute periods; State Route
99/Jack Tone Road interchange; and Colony and Santos intersections where heavy truck traffic leads to delays. (The
major intersections within the City, which are currently controlled by 4-way stops or signalization, are shown in
Table 3.3.)
Traffic Collisions
A motor vehicle striking another motor vehicle accounts for the largest number of reported collisions. The last fifteen
years (1985 [17] to 2000 [28]) have shown an ever-increasing rate in these types of crashes. This is consistent with
the growth of the City, but it is not a particularly high figure. While drawing conclusions from these numbers is
difficult, there has been an increase in the number of collisions attributed to improper turns.
Bus and Rail Transit Service
Ripon owns a nine-passenger bus, operated by volunteers, used for transit service within the City and trips to
Modesto.
Services are designed primarily for the elderly and disabled. On Thursdays the bus makes a round-trip to Modesto at a
cost of $1.00 per passenger. The number of riders has been quite small ranging from 400 to 600 passengers a year.
Special trips are available at a cost of $15.00 per passenger.
Presently San Joaquin Regional transit provides service from Ripon to other cities in San Joaquin County. No
passenger rail stops are available in Ripon. Amtrak passenger services are found in Modesto, approximately 15 miles,

Bicycle Circulation
In October 1994, the City adopted its first ever Bicycle Route Master Plan (Exhibit 3.2), which proposed
improvements that would initiate bicycle lanes, paths, and routes. A Bicycle Advisory Committee was established to
conduct informational meetings and receive comments at public hearings. A City survey of bicycle users showed 170
bicycle trips to school sites plus various trips to the Senior Citizens Center, City Hall, and retail locations. The
generally low traffic volumes makes bicycle riding a popular recreational activity in Ripon.
Today, the City is in the process of implementing some of the programs, and providing some of the improvements,
outlined in the Master Plan. Currently, there are Class 1 bikeways along Santos Avenue, Hoff Drive, Jack Tone Road,
Fulton Avenue, River Road and Colony Road on the north side of State Route 99 and along portions of Doak
Boulevard on the south side of State Route 99. Class 2 bike lanes have been delineated on South Jack Tone Road from
West Main Street to Doak Boulevard and along sections of Doak Boulevard.
Currently plans are underway to convert the Class 2 bike lane on Jack Tone Road between Doak Boulevard and Canal
Boulevard to a Class 1 Bike lane.
In addition, a ‘bike bridge’ across the Stanislaus River at the end of Parallel Avenue has been erected to eliminate the
safety concerns of pedestrians and bicyclists using the State Route 99 Bridge.

Off-Street Parking
Off-street parking is required by the Development Code for all development, including shopping centers, churches,
schools, business and industrial users. In addition, off-street parking is required for civic and social activities where
the number of people involved or the nature of the activities has a potential to cause traffic congestion and traffic
safety problems.
Downtown where most of the properties are already developed without off-street parking, parking is provided by on-
street diagonal parking spaces. A few private off-street parking lots or parking areas, and a 38-space City owned
parking lot, found south of Main Street and west of Stockton Avenue, serves the Downtown area. Additionally, a new
City owned parking lot containing 38 off-street parking spaces is currently under construction at North Stockton
Avenue and South Frontage Road, north of Main Street.
Parking demands on average weekdays are satisfied by these parking facilities. The Main Street reconstruction project
added parking for the Downtown area by converting parallel stalls to diagonal stalls. Concern remains that parking
will become a problem because some parking congestion is still being experienced at the east end of Main Street, and
the City has taken some interim steps to relieve the problem by making minor improvements along the Union Pacific
railroad tracks between Industrial and North Stockton Avenues. The City has leased a parking lot on Industrial for
additional Downtown parking and a park and ride lot from the now departed Nestlé’s coffee plant.
Air Transportation
While there are no airfields within the Ripon Planning area, there are five (5) within a moderate commute distance.
STOCKTON METROPOLITAN AIRPORT located fifteen (15) miles to the north presently does not have any commercial
air passenger service, but it does have airfreight and general aviation services.
MODESTO AIRPORT, about ten (10) miles to the south, has limited commercial passenger service plus airfreight and
general aviation.
SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL, OAKLAND INTERNATIONAL, and SACRAMENTO INTERNATIONAL are the nearest
large airports serving Ripon residents with long distance or international flights.

3.5     FUTURE CIRCULATION AND/TRANSPORTATION
Road and Streets
Ripon will provide roads, streets, and programs to manage anticipated traffic volumes. The roadway network will
continue to serve as the backbone of the transportation system, but will be asked to do several things in the coming
years. (Exhibit 3.3 shows the future circulation system.)
The Freeway - State Route 99
State Route 99 was widened to six lanes in 1998 from the Milgeo off ramp to State Route 120, but the numbers in
Chart 3.2 suggest the Freeway will need eight lanes. San Joaquin County 2020 Regional Transportation Plan, as it is
adopted, does not include this widening. If it is not widened, this segment of State Route 99 will operate at, or near
capacity, with low operating speeds on both a daily and an average peak hour basis. (Traffic volumes on State Route
99 are projected to increase as shown on Chart 3.2.)

Freeway access to and from Ripon are provided by the Main Street and Jack Tone Road interchanges for north
and southbound traffic, and at the Fulton overpass for northbound traffic. The Fulton and Main Street
interchanges have little capacity for storing vehicles from the northbound State Route 99 side of the Freeway.
Additional storage capacity will be needed. The ramps at the Main Street interchange on the southbound side of
the Freeway should operate within acceptable limits. A new interchange at Olive Avenue and State Route 99 is
recommended and currently being studied.
The State Route 99 and Jack Tone Road interchange has been reconstructed. Improvements included lengthening the
ramps and the addition of another lane of storage and two northbound ramps which increases capacity and enhanced
access to and from state Route 99.

Additional capacity at the Main Street interchange on and off-ramps will be reached by intersection modifications
at East Main Street.
An Olive Expressway will be constructed to State standards, and will likely be a diamond configuration, though
that will be determined in the environmental and design process. (Chart 3.3 shows the anticipated total daily
averages for these interchanges.)

A recent feasibility study has determined that an Austin Interchange and an Olive Expressway Interchange will be
needed to serve future development between existing Jack Tone Road and existing Austin Road.
Crossing the Freeway
Projected traffic volumes for the interchanges at Jack Tone Road and the one proposed at Olive and River Roads will
handle a sizeable amount of newly generated traffic within the City. Jack Tone Road interchange has been completed
with four through lanes and full freeway access to State Route 99. The Olive Road over crossing may not need four
lanes for the short term, but it should be constructed with four lanes to adapt to potential growth in the area. Turn
lanes will be necessary to handle movements at the ramp intersections assuming a standard diamond interchange is
built.
The Main Street interchange will not have to be widened because its existing four lanes will handle the anticipated
volumes. Stockton Avenue and East Main Street intersections will need to be monitored. The East Main Street
intersection may have to be modified with new intersection controls.
The Fulton Avenue over crossing will have to be widened to accommodate the four lanes to the north and south.
Reconstruction of the Jack Tone Road interchange provides the added value of giving Ripon no at grade railroad
crossing of any street except spurs serving industrial sites. This is a major boom for the community by improving
emergency response time, roadway congestion and safety.
Crossing the Stanislaus River

Two additional automobile lanes have been added to the State Route 99 crossing, however even with six lanes, the
Freeway will operate with conditions approaching unstable, but with bearable speeds.
Since there is no present alternative in the Ripon area to crossing the Stanislaus River, this Plan proposes a new four-
lane structure across the River at Olive Avenue connecting to Gates Road in Stanislaus County. While a four-lane
road is not required by the projections developed in this Plan, the structure should be geared to serve the area well
beyond the life of the General Plan. The bridge will provide a detour for traffic delayed by incidents on State Route
99, improve emergency services, improve regional circulation, and create another connection between San Joaquin
and Stanislaus Counties.
Moving East and West in Ripon
Several new east-west arterial and collector roadways are proposed by this Plan.
On the south side of the freeway, Second Street and Main Street will continue to serve their traditional function with
significant changes only to Main Street. adding a lane in each direction west of Jack Tone Road.
Doak Boulevard will be extended westerly to intersect with the Olive Avenue expressway.
Two (2) new roadways, Canal Boulevard and South Frontage Road, will be needed to serve east to west movement
south of State Route 99.
Canal Boulevard will connect S. Jack Tone Road with Olive expressway and serve commercial, retail, and residential
traffic. It can be constructed as a four-lane collector, but left turn lanes will be necessary, particularly at the
connection to the South Frontage Road. This roadway will serve as a connector for truck traffic between Jack Tone
Road and the industrial area at the southeast end of the City.
Garrison Way will parallel the Freeway. East of Olive Avenue it will serve traffic as an alternate route to the
downtown and industrial areas of the City. At Olive Avenue the frontage road will carry traffic west towards the
Austin Road interchange. At this time, it is anticipated that the South Frontage Road will only need to be two lanes in
width with occasional turn pockets for traffic circulation. Extensive intersection work at Olive Avenue and Austin
Road is anticipated with both locations likely to require signalization.
On the north side of the State Route 99, an extensive new system of roads is currently being developed. Shasta Road,
Colony Road, Santos Avenue and River Road, connecting with the newly constructed/realigned Fulton Avenue (a
north/south road currently being developed), all serve vital east/west traffic circulation needs.
Shasta Road will be a minor collector with limited access and will carry approximately 10,000 vehicles per day at its
intersection with Fulton Avenue. Shasta can function as a two-lane undivided road with access controls at Fulton
Avenue, North Ripon Road, and Murphy Road.
Colony Road serves both as a collector and major arterial. East of Fulton Avenue, Colony Road collects local traffic.
West of Fulton Avenue, it carries largely commercial traffic from State Route 99 to Jack Tone Road.
Santos Road, like Colony Road, serves many of the same functions. It carries traffic from the residential areas of the
northern part of the City to Jack Tone Road. Santos Avenue currently functions as a two-lane collector east of Fulton
Avenue and is identified as a major arterial west of Fulton Avenue to accommodate commercial traffic.
River Road will serve the northern part of the City as a six-lane expressway collecting traffic destined for Jack Tone
Road, the Olive Avenue Expressway, and points east. River Road will serve a larger regional function carrying traffic

Moving North and South in Ripon
North-south traffic roadways in Ripon will be North Stockton Avenue (North Ripon Road), Fulton Avenue, Murphy
Road, Jack Tone Road and the Olive Avenue Expressway.
North Ripon Road will develop as a four lane divided road north of Milgeo, while, north of Clinton South Avenue, it
can function as a two-lane roadway with turn pockets during this planning period, but right-of-way must be reserved
for its future. North Stockton Avenue south of Milgeo Road will experience a slight increase in traffic with the
majority of the traffic traveling to the downtown area diverting to Fulton Avenue.
Jack Tone Road will be a six-lane divided roadway with turn pockets at intersections between State Route 99 and
River Road. North of River Road, Jack Tone Road will be four lanes with turn pockets. Traffic signals at the
intersections of Colony Road and Santos Avenue have been installed to maximize traffic flow during peak hours. The
intersection at River Road and Jack Tone Road will have some sort of intersection control, alternatives for this
intersection control will be analyzed and evaluated as plans for this intersection are developed. South of State Route
99 Jack Tone Road could function with four lanes with turn lanes, although it will experience unstable traffic flow
near State Route 99 by 2016. (Table 3.4b details the existing and projected 2040 traffic volumes for those roadways
traveling north and south).

While it has always been Ripon’s desire to provide for a Level of Service C, by today’s standards this is a high level
of service for roadways. Level of Service C is when conditions of traffic flow are stable, operating speeds and
maneuverability are sometimes restricted and occasional backups occur behind left turning vehicles at intersections.
Therefore, the City has to reluctantly lower the standard to Level of Service D. Level of Service D maintains
satisfactory speeds but temporary restrictions may cause extensive delays and little freedom to maneuver. Some
drivers, especially those making left turns, may have to wait through one or more signal changes.
Moving Around in the Ripon Area
Ripon’s traffic focus in the year 2020 will be shared between the existing downtown to Jack Tone Road. This is the
result of expanded employment opportunities in commercial and industrial activities near State Route 99. Traffic
conditions on most streets south of the Freeway and east of Jack Tone will remain similar to today’s circumstances or
increase modestly. Significant changes will be the addition of Canal Boulevard to connect Jack Tone. In addition the
construction of South Frontage Road will act as a frontage Road serving trucks between the industrial areas to the Jack
Tone interchange, and eventually the Olive Road interchange.
Traffic on Jack Tone Road will increase dramatically and at the interchanges, and there will be a need for traffic
controls. Otherwise, conditions on Ripon areas south of the freeway will not change very much.
Changes in the north will be noticeable, as Jack Tone Road becomes a busy arterial. A high percentage (25%) of
trucks will increase concerns along Jack Tone. Ripon’s interchanges will serve regional plus local functions.
INTERSECTION CONTROL MEASURES WILL BE DETERMINED AS CONDITIONS DICTATE. CONTROL MEASURES

Ripon traffic model has produced some street segment improvements if the Olive Avenue/State Route 99 interchange
is constructed. The Circulation and Transportation Appendix contains those improvements.
Structures proposed for construction by this document are: Olive Avenue Bridge over the Stanislaus River, Olive
Avenue and River Road interchanges at State Route 99, and reconstructed Fulton Avenue interchange and over
crossing at State Route 99.
Intercity Transit
The City of Ripon will provide public transit services to meet the needs of its population, and to encourage fewer
automobile trips. The transportation disadvantaged, specifically the elderly and physically disabled, have been targets
of the existing public transit program and will continue to be priorities for the City. The public component to the
existing service will be expanded gradually to provide internal city trips for commute, academic, recreational and
shopping trips. By the year 2016, the City’s current transit service may no longer be a volunteer driver service, but
will have professional drivers with a larger vehicle fleet serving daily trips over expanded hours. The service may also
involve some limited fixed route service during peak hours to meet an expanded intercity commuter population.
As an example, Tracy’s transit service when it was a city of 25,000 provided a model of a transit program to serve
Ripon’s potential needs. At the time, Tracy ran six, twelve passenger minibuses on a demand response (dial-a-ride)
basis. Tracy Trans, as it was called, carried 30,000 to 35,000 passengers a year. The system was designed strongly to
serve the disabled, the elderly, and youth. The demographics of Tracy ten years ago were different from those
projected for Ripon because the Ripon of 2016 will have a stronger employment base and more urban characteristics.
This, along with the City’s own efforts to mitigate for air quality concerns and reduce congestion during peak hours
would argue for a component of the system to serve employment sites.
The value of transit, as compared to roadways, is the capital equipment in transit can be moved from site to site to
respond to the changing needs of the community. By comparison, a roadway is fixed so it cannot simply be moved.
Because of this flexibility with transit, the City should be prepared to invest in this service as demand warrants, and as
its policies dictate. For illustrative purposes, the following public transit service would fit these needs. It could be
that Ripon will not grow to the point in 2016 that this extent of service is needed. In such a case, the capital and
operations would be less.
•    Ripon Transit Capital Needs: Six, 15-passenger minibus fleet
•    Ripon Transit Operations Needs: Demand Response System Fixed Route, Peak Hour Component Weekday

    Service, 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
Intracity Transit
Presently, the City provides a general-purpose dial-a-ride service with a 9-passenger bus. The service, which goes to
Modesto one day a week primarily for medical appointments and shopping, is operated by volunteer drivers and is
limited to the disabled and senior citizens. Additionally, SJRTD continues to provide a fixed route service to Ripon
and the surrounding area. By the year 2016, Ripon will be experiencing significant increases in demands for
commuter service. The San Joaquin Council of Governments Regional Transit Systems Plan recently initiated regional
transit service for Ripon by SJRTD on a Stockton-Manteca-Ripon- route. The service provides a weekday route for
commuters and shoppers alike, on a fixed route system with stops on the north and south sides of the community.
Train Service
While an intracity passenger rail stop serving the community is desirable, future rail service rests in the hands of the
State of California. Presently, rail service is provided by AMTRAK on the Valley line by stations in Modesto and
Stockton. Local commuter service is provided by ACE, a rail line between Stockton, and San Jose with a station in
Manteca.
Park and Ride Lots
Park and ride lots to serve the Ripon Planning Area’s commuters will continue to be provided at the current Industrial
Avenue location, as well as a possible future one near the Olive interchange. Anticipated capacity in both locations
will be fifty (50) vehicles.
Bicycle Circulation
A Bicycle Route Master Plan for the area has been adopted by the City. It is a Plan that seeks to take advantage of
Ripon’s size and short distances to encourage bicycles as alternative transportation to the automobile.
Air Transportation
Air service to Ripon will continue to be supplied by the Stockton Metropolitan Airport and the Modesto Airport. The
City supports a regional airport for the Stockton-Modesto area to help improve passenger service.

VOLUME I - CHAPTER FOUR
COMMUNITY HEALTH
AND SAFETY
4.1      INTRODUCTION
This Chapter focuses on issues that must be considered in the physical development of the Ripon Planning Area and
sets policy direction. Environmental conditions that have the potential to affect the community adversely include
flooding, fire, geological and seismic hazards. Additional issues of concern to the City are personal safety and
management of hazardous materials.
Hazards are natural or man made conditions that have the potential to threaten life, cause injury, or damage property.
Disasters are specific events resulting from interaction between hazards and human populations. Through
investigation of hazard risk and careful land use planning to reduce or restrict development in high risk areas, the
potential for disaster can be reduced. Development sitting, design considerations, and emergency preparedness can
reduce, if not eliminate, risks of hazards to the Ripon Planning Area.
Safety is a required topic of the General Plan, and is consistent with the other chapters of the Ripon General Plan
Update.
Consistency with State Planning Law
State legislation requires that a safety analysis, be adopted by counties and cities as part of their general plans. That
legislation also permits cities to adopt portions of the County General Plan Safety Element that pertains to their City
for addressing the requirement for a local Safety Element.
This approach is used by including Goal I of the Community Health and Safety Goals and Policies for seismic,
geological, and flood hazards.
The function of this chapter is to identify hazards due to seismic and geological activity, fire, flooding, and noise, and
propose measures to protect the community against these hazards. This document is designed to fulfill these
requirements.
THE HAZARDS CONSIDERED IN THIS ELEMENT ARE:
Seismic - including faulting, ground shaking, liquefaction, and seiches
Geological - including subsidence, erosion, expansive soils, and landslides
Fire
Flood
Emergency services
Eliminating all risks is not possible due to natural hazards. Steps can be taken to reduce risk, however, these
measures may each carry a cost. In this chapter, an attempt has been made to balance the damaging potential of
                                                            4-1
                                                                                                 Adopted September 19, 2006
Volume I- Chapter Four                                                  Community Health and Safety
natural hazards against the costs of mitigating these hazards.
4.2      GOALS AND POLICES
GOAL A: PREVENT LOSS OF LIVES, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE DUE TO GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS.
Policy A1. Require preparation of geological reports or engineering reports for development located in areas of
suspected significant geological hazards.
Policy A2. In cooperation with state and local emergency service agencies, the City of Ripon will prepare and
maintain a Community Emergency Preparedness Plan.
Policy A3. The Department of Public Works shall maintain maps and records which delineate areas known to be
affected by site-specific geologic hazards.
Policy A4. The Ripon General Plan shall be amended to incorporate data and/or analysis provided by the State Mining
and Geology Board pursuant to the Seismic Hazard Mapping Act.
GOAL B: PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE DUE TO THE COLLAPSE OF BUILDINGS AND CRITICAL
FACILITIES, AND THE DISRUPTION OF ESSENTIAL SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE.
Policy B1. The City will not approve any change in use to higher occupancy or more intensive use in unreinforced
masonry structures constructed before 1940 until an engineering evaluation of the structure has been conducted and all
structural deficiencies are corrected.
Policy B2. Enforce building codes and City ordinances regarding earthquake protection.
Policy B3. Encourage the Ripon Consolidated Fire District’s efforts to provide adequate resources (facilities,
apparatus, equipment and personnel) needed to service development. Specifics such as numbers and locations of
stations, staffing levels of apparatus and stations, service levels and response times are as defined in the Ripon
Consolidated Fire District Strategic Plan, originally developed by 9-1-1 Consulting. This plan will be periodically
updated by the District to ensure its appropriateness.

Policy C1. Continue to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. To this end, the City will enforce local
regulations according to standards adopted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Policy C2. Prohibit the construction of buildings within the 100-year flood plain.
Policy C3. Construction in the vicinity of existing levees should be coordinated with the responsible maintenance
agency to ensure that structures, ponds, or water applications do not result in weakening of the flood control
structures. Such areas will be designated ‘special study’ districts, and must comply with the provisions of that district.
GOAL D: PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE, INJURY, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE DUE TO WILD LAND AND URBAN FIRES.
Policy D1. All new non-residential development will be equipped with automatic interior sprinkler systems to meet
the Uniform Building Code.
Policy D2. Encourage the Ripon Consolidated Fire District to maintain a regular program of fire inspection for
existing commercial and industrial buildings. Involve the District at the planning stage of new development to ensure
                                                           4-2

4.3     SEISMIC, GEOLOGICAL, AND FLOOD HAZARDS
Seismic and Geological Hazards
No known seismic or geological faults are found in the Ripon Planning Area. The nearest faults are the Tracy-
Stockton Fault and a small buried fault that extend south from Banta to Stanislaus County. These faults have no
surface trace and have not had any movement over the last three million years. Figure 4.1 is a map compiled for
the San Joaquin County General Plan (adopted July 1992) which shows that such hazards do not exist in the
Ripon Planning Area.
Active or potentially active faults such as the Calaveras Fault, Hayward Fault, Green Valley-Concord Fault, the
Midland Fault and the San Andreas Fault are also shown on the Map.
Like any other place in the Valley, the area could be affected by earthquakes along faults in other parts of the

Volume I- Chapter Four                                                  Community Health and Safety
region and elsewhere in California. Recorded earthquakes from outside the Ripon Planning area have produced
ground shaking in and around the City.
A maximum intensity earthquake could cause considerable damage in ordinary structures. Most injuries, loss of
life and property damage during earthquakes result from structural failures due to ground shaking. Damage from
ground shaking is a combined function of the structural integrity of the buildings before the earthquake, and the
quality of soils or bedrock underlying the buildings.
Older structures generally were not built to withstand the lateral stress imposed by the ground shaking of a major
earthquake. Generally, the older the structure, the less likely it is to resist an earthquake. This applies particularly
to buildings having walls of reinforced brick held together by sand lime mortar, and usually to all multi storied
buildings that do not have steel reinforcements.
Flooding Hazards
Flooding is one of the costliest natural hazards in California. In the Ripon area the problem of flooding, defined
as breaching of the banks of a natural water course, is limited to property along the Stanislaus River. Completion
of the New Melones Dam has significantly reduced the chance of damage along the flood plain of the River. The
older parts of the City have never been known to flood. (Exhibit 4.1 shows the 100 Year Flood area in the
Planning Area.)
Programs for reducing flood losses include structural and non-structural approaches, some directed at preventing
floods, and others controlling that which cannot be prevented. New Melones Dam on the Stanislaus River is a
method of prevention. Channel maintenance and development is an additional means of flood prevention.
Nonstructural measures include flood forecasting, zoning, exclusions from designated floodway and building
code requirements.
In conformity with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) standards, no building within the flood plain,
except by special permit, is permitted within the city.
New Melones and Tullock dams have been identified as having the potential of inundating Ripon in case of dam
failure. Inundation areas for each dam are found in the San Joaquin County General Plan Public Health and Safety
Element’s. Despite the presence of these dams, the risk of flooding is considered very low, because the likelihood of
dam failure is low. A dam failure can occur as the result of an earthquake, as an isolated incident due to structural
instability, or during heavy rains that exceeds design capacity.
The San Joaquin County Public Health and Safety Element adopted July 1992 contains additional data on the Ripon
Planning Area for seismic, geological, and flooding hazards.
Policy I of the Community Health and Safety Goals and Policies recommend adoption by reference portions of the
San Joaquin County Public Health and Safety Element covering the Ripon Planning Area.

 4.4      LAW ENFORCEMENT
Police protection within the City Limits is provided by the City’s police force. The average level of staffing is one
officer per patrol unit. The number of patrol beats range from one to three, depending on personnel availability. All
police calls for service are handled from the central facility; average response time is three to five minutes for all calls.
 Calls involving Part 1 offenses or other life-endangering situations have an even faster average response time.
In 2000, the Ripon Police Department had a total staff of 13 sworn officers. This represented a staff to population ratio
of approximately 1.3 officers for per 1,000 persons. In the 1994 Uniform Crime Reports, it was reported the Nation’s
law enforcement community employed an average of 2.3 full time officers for every 1,000 inhabitants. Ripon’s Police
Departments personnel includes the thirteen sworn officers, five dispatchers, an office manager, an animal control
officer, police reserve officers, and volunteers in police service.
The Department also sponsors a Crime Prevention Program, and a large, viable, volunteer program that includes
Police Reserve Officers, Technical Reserve Officers, Citizen Volunteers, an Intern Program, and a Police Chaplain
program.
Citizen Volunteers give service by helping crime prevention patrols, business watch, traffic control, vacation checks,
neighborhood watch, senior liaison and administrative operations.

Contract police dispatching for the City of Escalon is also provided by the Ripon Police Department.
Law enforcement in the unincorporated area is the responsibility of the San Joaquin County Sheriffs Department. The
sheriffs department maintains a beat that includes the Ripon area. This beat is designated as District 7 and includes
Manteca, Lathrop, Escalon and Farmington. Usually one or two officers are on duty for this beat, but often during
evening hours no officers are available. The Sheriffs Department has law enforcement power within incorporated
cities and outside corporate limits. Coroner’s service is provided throughout the County by the Sheriffs Department.
The California Highway Patrol (CHP) handles all traffic-related incidents on the freeway and in the unincorporated
County area. This includes issuing traffic citations, and investigating vehicle accidents and auto theft. Fifty CHP
officers are assigned to the Stockton office and 25 officers assigned to the Tracy Office.

4.5      HAZARDOUS MATERIALS MANAGEMENT
Production, storage, and transportation of hazardous materials within the City have the potential for accidents and
spills. The City has the ultimate responsibility to ensure that mitigation of these types of incidents is properly
conducted according to all applicable law. In addressing this issue, the City has entered into an agreement with the
Ripon Consolidated Fire District to participate in the Joint County Hazardous Materials Response team. The District
maintains adequate numbers of personnel trained to meet the minimum requirements to maintain membership on the
team per team policy.
4.6      FUTURE CONDITIONS AND MEASURES TO REDUCE HAZARDS
Build out within the 2004 City Limits is expected to result in the need for at least three (3) additional police officers,
one (1) additional dispatcher and one (1) additional community service officer. Future development of the areas
outside the existing City Limits will require additional law enforcement officers and equipment.
The Police Department has thirty four (34) full-time employees, fifteen (15) volunteers who average 160 hours per
week of volunteer time, and three (3) Police Reserve Officers who average approximately twenty (20) hours per
month. Based on the number of volunteer hours worked, the Department has a total of thirty-eight (38) full time
employees.
Ripon’s Police Facility has approximately 5,450 square feet, which is an average of 227 square feet per full time
employee. Based on an industry average of 250 square feet per employee, the Department would need approximately
6,000 square feet to meet its present needs.
The Police Department has updated the Emergency Services Operational Plan for the City, and periodic exercises are
conducted to help the City prepare for emergencies. Mutual assistance agreements between the City, County, and
other agencies throughout the County will continue to assure aid in case of emergencies.
4.7      FIRE HAZARDS AND PROTECTION
The threat to structures from wild land fires is extremely low because the City is surrounded on the west, north, and
east sides by land primarily used for agricultural orchard crops. The south side of the City is bounded by the
Stanislaus River and associated vegetation. The development of the habitat area adjacent to Stanislaus River by the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will significantly increase developments in the area. Wild land fires will occur in the
river bottom area and are usually caused by human error.
Ripon Consolidated Fire District is responsible for both the City and the surrounding area that consists of 55 square
miles. The Insurance Services Office (ISO) currently classifies the area in the City as a Class 4 and the rural area is a
Class 9.

                             Fire Station No. 1 located on S. Stockton Ave.
The Ripon Consolidated Fire District employs a Fire Chief, Assistant Chief, Administrative Secretary, and a part time
Receptionist/Clerk. The District also employs 12 full-time emergency personnel and utilizes approximately 50
volunteers to assist staffing two stations and 10 pieces of apparatus, including an Advanced Life Support Ambulance.
The City currently has an adequate water supply to meet the emergency needs of the Fire District. The City, using
Redevelopment funds, has replaced the water system in the older parts of the community. New development is
required to install water systems sufficient to address the potential emergency needs. The City has also installed a
1,500,000 gallon water tower to augment the water supply and construction is underway for a 2,500,000 gallon water
tower.
4.8      NOISE
The primary purpose of the noise discussion is to describe the existing and projected noise environment in Ripon so
that harmful and annoying sound levels can be avoided or reduced. Major noise sources are identified, noise levels
throughout the community are recorded, and the effects of noise on the community are discussed.
Three aspects of environmental noise are important in determining subjective response: the intensity (amplitude)
or level of the sound, the frequency spectrum of the sound and time varying character of the sound. The
combination of these three dimensions produces what we hear.
How Noise is Measured
Because hearing varies widely between individuals, what may seem loud to one person may not to another. Although
loudness is a personal judgment, precise measurement of sound is made possible by the use of decibels (dB) calculated
on a logarithmic basis. Zero dB is the threshold of hearing, and the ear begins to feel pain at 120 dB.
An average person will perceive a 10 dB sound level increase at any level as a doubling of loudness. Thus, 90 dB will
sound twice as loud as 80 dB, and four times as loud as 70 dB.
Sound levels drop off at 4.5 decibels for every doubling of distance from a noise source. Thus, without barriers, a
source that is 90 dB at 50 feet will be 85.5 dB at 100 feet, and 81 dB at 200 feet. With barriers in the way, sound
levels will be further reduced, depending on the barriers height, length, and type of construction. Sound levels in
decibels are not combined by simple addition. Combining two identical sound sources increases the overall sound
level by only three decibels. If one source is more than 10 decibels above another, the lesser noise adds practically
nothing to the overall sound level.
                                                                4-10
                                                                                              Adopted September 19, 2006
Volume I- Chapter Four                                                  Community Health and Safety
The range of sound frequencies that the human ear can hear is tremendously wide; however, the ear does not hear all
frequencies equally. In measuring sound frequency, the most widely used decibel scale is the A-weighted decibel
scale (dBA), which is measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighting filter network. The A-weighting filter
reduces very high and very low frequency components of sound similar to the response of the human ear, and give
good correlation with subjective reactions to noise.
The ambient noise of the community is all environmental noise, which is usually a composite of sound from many
sources near and far. An intrusive noise is that noise that intrudes above the existing ambient noise, such as the noise
of individual events like a passing car or train, an aircraft flying overhead, or a lawnmower in the neighborhood
To represent the cumulative effects of varying noise levels throughout the day adequately, noise level descriptors that
average the hourly noise levels have been developed. These systems averages the noise levels for a twenty-four-hour
period, giving extra weight to the evening or night sound levels in recognition of the facts that people are much more
disturbed by noise at night than at any other time. Two primary community noise level systems currently in use are the
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and the Day-Night Average Level (Ldn).
The CNEL system calculates average sound levels from the A-weighted sound levels during a 24-hour day, after
addition of five decibels to sound levels in the evening between 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., and after addition of 10
decibels to sound levels in the night hours after 10:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m.
The Ldn system calculates average sound levels from the A-weighted sound levels during a 24-hour day, after
addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night hours after 10:00 p.m. and before 7:00a.m.
Average noise levels calculated with the CNEL or Ldn systems have been found to differ only slightly. For the
purposes of this Noise Element the two systems will be regarded as essentially identical.
For this Noise discussion, areas with CNEL or Ldn noise levels of 70 dBA or greater (at 50 feet) will be considered
noise impacted. Mitigation measures for new residential land uses may be required. CNEL of Ldn noise levels of less
than 65 dBA will be considered in the acceptable range for residential land uses (based on HUD standards). Interior
noise levels should not be more than 45 CNEL. (Table 4.1 shows the compatibility of various land uses with various
community noise exposure levels using the CNEL and Ldn systems.)
The Noise contours presented in this Noise discussion have been prepared using the methodology of “The Noise
Guidebook” published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, D.C., 1985. The
noise contours presented are extremely useful for generalized planning; however, they should not be used as highly
accurate estimators of the noise levels at specific locations.
4.9      EXISTING CONDITIONS
Noise in the planning area is primarily from vehicular traffic and railroad operations, with some impact from aircraft
operations. No existing industrial activities have been identified which generate noise at levels causing residents to be
uncomfortable. A small train switching area in the southeast portion of the City is in an industrial area that tends to
mitigate any potential adverse noise effects.
Within the City, the major sources of existing noise are the traffic along Highway 99 and the train operations on Union
Pacific Railroad that is parallel and next to the highway. Traffic on the major circulation routes within the City is a
less significant noise source. Noise more than 65 Ldn along most local streets and roads is within street right-of-ways
and low speeds and traffic volume does not ordinarily make up a nuisance.

Traffic Sources
Vehicular traffic, including auto, trucks, buses, utility, and maintenance vehicles, generally establishes the ambient
sound in a community. This ambient level varies throughout the day based upon the intensity of other community
sound sources. Ambient level is dependent upon traffic flow rate, average vehicular speed, distance to sound
receivers, and the ration of type of vehicles. The estimated existing noise levels generated by vehicular traffic levels
are shown using CNEL noise contours in Exhibit 4.2 for Highway 99 and the highest volume local streets (West Main
Street and Jack Tone Road). Superimposed upon this ambient level are the intrusive, single event sounds emitted
from “specially equipped” trucks, cars, or motorcycles. All vehicular sounds are attributable to four sources: rolling
stock (tires, gears, etc.), body rattles, vehicular aerodynamics, and engine noises. (Chart 4.1 shows traffic counts
taken in 2003 by the San Joaquin County Council of Governments.)
Truck traffic on these roadways is estimated at approximately ten percent of the total except Jack Tone Road south of
West Main that at this time carries very few trucks. In April 1996 Jack Tone Road at the north City Limits carried
approximately 3,790 (vpd) and at the South side of the Union Pacific Railroad tracks carried approximately 5,708
(vpd).

Caltrans 2000 Route Segment Report showed traffic counts on State Route 99 at the Stanislaus River as 72,600 (vpd)
and 66,500 (vpd) at Jack Tone Road. Approximately fourteen percent of those vehicles were trucks.
Railroad Sources
The Union Pacific Railroad main route through the San Joaquin Valley runs through Ripon. A large share of the
development along the railroad is commercial or industrial which creates a partial barrier to the transport of noise.
 Any construction of residential uses adjacent to the railroad or the highway shall be insulated and constructed to
meet acceptable standards.
Currently, an average of approximately 16 to 18 train operations occur per day on this railroad line according to the
Union Pacific Railroad Company. Each train consists of an average of three locomotives and 80 cars, traveling at
speeds up to 60 mph.
Comparing State Route 99 CNEL levels shown, equivalent daily noise produced by existing rail traffic is less
extensive than that of the existing highway traffic when averaged more than twenty-four hours. (Note that the
contours shown in Exhibit 4.2 also adequately represent the Year 2005 KNEEL contours for this railroad line,
because no significant increase in the projected volumes of future train operations has been identified.)
Noise Sensitive Land Uses
Residential land uses are the primary land uses, which can be affected by noise sources that might expose potential
                                                             4-15

residents to unacceptable noise. Naturally, those residential areas within or near to Highway 99 and the railroad are
the most sensitive within the residential land use category. Existing land uses within the City that are especially
sensitive to noise include schools, a rest home/ convalescent hospital, and recreation areas such as parks.
4.10 FUTURE NOISE GENERATORS
Traffic Sources
Noise generation within the existing City will increase along Highway 99 as traffic increases, unless improvement of
noise controls of trucks improve significantly. Caltrans District 10 estimates that by the Year 2010 the daily traffic
volume levels will have reached a total of 82,000 (vpd) including an estimated 14,750 trucks.
Existing local major streets such as West Main Street, Jack Tone Road and River Road can be expected to experience
increases in daily traffic volumes that are approximately proportionate to the increase in residential and non-residential
land uses. Doak Boulevard running along the south side of the City between South Stockton Avenue and South
Mohler Road will be extended westerly to Olive Avenue. It is also expected to serve as a traffic collector adding
traffic to Jack Tone Road south of West Main Street. The traffic on these roadways is expected to increase to at least
2.5 times the 2000 daily traffic volume levels. (Exhibit 4.3 shows the projected Year 2040 CNEL noise levels to be
generated by Highway 99 and the highest volume local streets.)
Railroad Sources
According to the Union Pacific Railroad Company, specific projections are not available for Year 2010. Train
operations on the main line through Ripon and specific trends toward increased operations cannot be identified at this
time. The highway traffic noise level within the area bounded by the railroad dominates those from the railroad.
(CNEL contours of Exhibit 4.3 also serve to represent the future noise levels associated with the railroad line.)

4.11 MITIGATING METHODS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO NOISE
         PROBLEMS
The Land Use Chapter of this plan reflects the community noise contour data of this noise element in the designation
of land uses to achieve as much noise compatible land use as possible within the planning area.
Noise impact studies by a qualified acoustical engineer may be required for any future development that appears to
have the potential to generate or be exposed to significant noise sources. Such impact studies may be required to
identify the potential noise impacts by or on the development, and to recommend measures to mitigate such noise
impacts to within an acceptable range.
A performance standard of 45 CNEL interior noise level for all residential construction next to major community
noise sources should be enforced. Building Code energy standards currently require dual pane windows and insulation
that reduce interior noise to acceptable standards.

VOLUME I - CHAPTER FIVE
OPEN SPACE
AND CONSERVATION
5.1      INTRODUCTION
The Open Space and Conservation Chapter describes the various recreational, cultural, and natural resources
within the Planning Area and establishes policies and programs to be used to protect and maintain these resources.
5.2     GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL A: TO PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN PARKS SUITED TO THE NEEDS OF RIPON RESIDENTS AND VISITORS.
Policy A1. City park acquisition, dedication and development efforts will be based on a minimum standard of 3 to 5
acres of community and neighborhood park land per 60 to 80 acres residential or 1,000 population. This standard is
separate and exclusive of school site acreage within the City limits.
Policy A2. Pursue State and County funding to augment City revenue to the extent such funding is available.
Policy A3. Continue to impose park development fees on all new residential development.
Policy A4. Promote and encourage the preservation of open space areas along the Stanislaus River and maximize its
potential for public enjoyment.
Policy A5. The City will continue to explore leasing of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fee title lands along the
Stanislaus River, and other lands, which may be available for public recreational purposes.
GOAL B: TO MAINTAIN RECREATION PROGRAMING SUITED TO THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF RIPON
RESIDENTS.
Policy B1. Encourage continued use of school facilities for City-sponsored recreation programs.
Policy B2. The City’s Parks and Recreation Commission will survey community attitudes and preferences for
recreational programs.
Policy B3. The City’s Parks and Recreation Commission will annually update statistics on participation in the various
City recreation programs and use of City recreation facilities.
GOAL C: PROTECT ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES
Policy C1. The city will not knowingly approve any public or private project that may adversely affect important
archeological sites.
Policy C2. Development proposals that may adversely impact archeological sites will be referred to the California
Archeological Inventory at Stanislaus State University. Archeological site evaluations will be conducted at the
expense of development proponents.
                                                        5–1

Volume I – Chapter Five                                                 Open Space and Conservation
Policy C3. The City will require site-specific archeological surveys for sites determined to be highly sensitive for
cultural resources and evaluation of potential historical structures. Surveys and evaluations shall be conducted at the
expense of development proponents.
Policy C4. The City will advise applicants that, in accordance with State law, if any cultural resources are discovered
during project-related construction activities, all work is to stop and the City and a qualified professional are to be
consulted to determine the importance and appropriate treatment of the find. If Native American remains are found,
the County Coroner and the Native American Heritage Commission, Sacramento (916-653-4082), are to be notified
immediately for recommended procedures.
GOAL D: TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT ON SURROUNDING AGRICULTURAL AND
RIPARIAN HABITAT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICIES OF THE GENERAL PLAN.
Policy D1. Discourage premature conversion of agricultural lands to reduce the intrusion of urban development
into agricultural areas. Strategies include deterring development of properties subject to Williamson Act
contracts, for which a notice of non-renewal has not been filed.
Policy D2. Continue to prohibit urban building within flood plain areas except by special permit.
Policy D3. Projects in the vicinity of the Stanislaus River should be referred to the California Department of
Conservation for comment with regard to mineral resources in conjunction with project CEQA reviews.
Policy D4. The City shall require submittal of a Notice of Intent with the Regional Water Quality Control Board and a
copy of the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan filed with the City prior to approval of improvement plans for any
project greater than one acre.
Policy D5. The City shall implement the Groundwater Management Plan adopted by the City Council. This program
includes, but is not necessarily limited to: the ongoing collection and analysis of well quantity and quality data; the
identification of recharge areas within the Planning Area; inter-agency coordination and planning to protect and
enhance recharge areas; establishment of a well head protection program to ensure well and aquifer testing for new
city wells; and the installation of monitoring wells, as required.
Policy D6. The City shall review design and operation parameters for storm water detention facilities and make
feasible
adjustments to these plans, which would promote recharge of storm water to the groundwater system. For example,
siting detention facilities in areas of maximum infiltration capacity; increasing detention time for where necessary
storage
capacity is not compromised, and adjustment of area/depth ratios to maximize infiltration.
Policy D7. The City shall review the siting and design of proposed terminal storm drainage and explore options for
detention of runoff in highly permeable materials adjacent to the Stanislaus River. These options may be coordinated
with potential retirement of the City’s sewage treatment facility and future recreational development in this area.
Policy D8. The City shall require verification of compliance of new industrial development and uses with applicable
hazardous materials and waste regulations in conjunction with Project Plan Review.
Policy D9. Proposed land uses and structures within or crossing the Stanislaus River channel or floodplain shall be
subject to hydrologic and biologic analysis, and conditioned as required, to ensure that existing resources and
functions are not significantly affected.
Policy D10. Tentative map applications shall be required to identify existing native trees greater than six inches in
diameter and to include a plan, which maximizes their preservation. The plan should address siting of development to
avoid tree removal as well as construction controls needed to avoid damage to remaining trees.

Volume I – Chapter Five                                                 Open Space and Conservation
Policy D11. Planning of projects which involve encroachment into the Stanislaus River riparian, areas shall be
designed to minimize potential habitat losses.
Policy D12. The City of Ripon will continue to participate in the San Joaquin County Habitat Conservation and Open
Space Plan (SJCHCOSP).
Policy D13. Project applicants who elect not to participate in the (SJCHCOSP) shall be required to prepare biological
analyses and provide alternative mitigation sufficient to reduce significant effects to less than significant.
Policy D14. The City shall encourage landowners within the Primary Urban Area to file for non-renewal of
Williamson Act contracts if they anticipate development within the planning period.
Policy D15. Prohibit the conversion of agricultural lands to urban uses, unless the property is contiguous to existing
or approved urban uses and such conversion is consistent with patterns of urban development.
GOAL E: TO CONSERVE AIR QUALITY WITHIN THE PLANNING AREA.
Policy E1. Coordinate air quality efforts with other local, regional and state agencies.
Policy E2. Identify and implement measures to reduce emissions associated with future development through the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review process.
Policy E3. Emphasize alternatives to motorized transportation.
Policy E4. The Air Quality Attainment Plan prepared by the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District
is incorporated by reference to this Chapter of the General Plan.
GOAL F: TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUILDINGS, SITES AND STRUCTURES.
Policy F1. Establish regulations that encourage the preservation of important historic resources, including flexible
parking and other associated requirements, which allow historic structures to remain in use in the future.
GOAL G: PRESERVE THE RIPARIAN AREA ALONG THE STANISLAUS RIVER FOR RECREATIONAL USES.
Policy G1. Prohibit all development within the riparian area along the Stanislaus River, except recreational uses where
the City has acquired land or an easement, as long as the uses do not interfere with capacity of the river during floods.
Policy G2. Recognize the special resource Ripon has in undeveloped river frontage and draft a plan for public
enjoyment and preservation of the natural environment.
5.3      EXISTING RESOURCES
Soils and Agricultural Resources
Agriculture has formed the traditional economic base for communities within the California Central Valley.
Agriculture not only supports local economies, but, carries regional and statewide economic significance so the
conversion of agricultural lands must be considered as development is proposed. Expanding urban growth can have
negative effects on surrounding agricultural practices. Among these are use conflicts between agricultural and urban
uses and the tendency for urban land speculation to raise property values which in turn impact agricultural operations.
                                                          5-3

Volume I – Chapter Five                                                 Open Space and Conservation
Most of the farmland in the planning area is found outside Ripon’s city limits. A variety of crops are grown.
Almonds, walnuts and peaches are the main tree crops, with beans, alfalfa, and corn being the major row crops.
United States Department of Agriculture soil survey of San Joaquin County shows the principal soil types of the
Ripon area are in the Delhi, Veritas and Tinnin series. All three of the soil types are suited to irrigated row, field,
orchard, and vineyard crops. Most agricultural land in the area is rated by the California Department of Conservation
as either “prime” or “of statewide importance”. Prime farmland is the most suitable for a variety of agricultural uses
based on soil characteristics, irrigation, and other indicators. Farmland of statewide importance is distinguished from
prime farmland because it is less desirable with respect to rooting depth, permeability, salinity or alkalinity, or erosion
hazard. These classifications do not provide information about actual productivity of the land, which is also affected
by availability of irrigation water and the use of agricultural management techniques. Many valuable commodities,
for example milk, are produced in areas with poor soils.
The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, as amended, commonly known as the Williams Act, is a voluntary tax
incentive program for preserving agricultural land and open space lands. The county and the property owner enter
into a ten-year contract. The contract is renewed automatically each year unless it is canceled or one party gives
notice of non-renewal. The county places restrictions on the use of the land and is guaranteed that the property will
remain in an agricultural or open space use. The property owner is guaranteed that the property will be taxed
according to the income it is capable of generating from agriculture and other compatible uses, rather than its full
market value.
Many parcels in the Ripon planning area are held under Williamson Act contracts and are not available for annexation
until notices of non-renewal or other releases are filed. When Williamson Act contracts are subject to notices of non-
renewal, the City should approve development of such properties only where such properties are contiguous with
existing or approved urban development.
Runoff from all soils in the planning area is slow and the hazard of water erosion is slight. Soil permeability in the
planning area is rapid to moderately rapid, and the hazard of wind erosion is moderate to high (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service).
Groundwater Resources
Ground water is a renewable natural resource found beneath the earth’s surface in water conducting geologic
formations called aquifers. A ground water basin can be replenished again naturally, by either rainfall, snowmelt and
surface run off, or it can be replace artificially through groundwater recharges.
The Stanislaus River, surface water from the mountains, and the hills to the east of the planning area all play a role in
recharging the underground aquifers. Underground water levels have not varied greatly over the last twenty years,
except under severe drought conditions equalized in subsequent wet years. Currently, ground water levels are
between 27 and 35 feet below the ground surface.
Ripon uses deep wells for the community water source. All of the water supplied to city customers meets the
minimum public health standards. The city ahs one well contaminated with VOC’s (volatile organic chemicals). The
VOC’s is removed by filtration through a carbon filter. Man made chemical contaminates continue to plague valley
community water systems. Most can be removed with carbon filtration. Nitrate removal requires a sophisticated
system for removal. Usually it is more cost effective to abandon the well and construct a new well and seal the upper
aquifers. The city has abandoned a few wells because of nitrate contamination.
River Resources
The Stanislaus River, which forms the boundary between Stanislaus County and San Joaquin County, is a narrow river

Volume I – Chapter Five                                                       Open Space and Conservation
lined with riparian vegetation. The river is fed by mountain streams whose rate of flow is controlled by several
reservoirs further upstream, including New Melones reservoir. Except in unusual rainfall conditions which effect
water releases into the San Joaquin River, the flows are kept well below 8,000 cubic feet per second (cfs).
                          A look at the Stanislaus River from the bike bridge
During emergencies, the New Melones flow rate has been restricted, thus requiring increased flows later and for
longer periods. Under these conditions, land within the flood plain may flood. This includes the City industrial sewer
ponds and solid waste composting area and some Fox River Paper Company industrial sewer pond areas that lie within
the flood plain. City business and residential areas are above the 100-year flood plain.
As part of the New Melones reservoir project, the Corps of Engineers has acquired flood and riparian easements along
the river, as well as a few sites for recreation development. In these areas, the extensive vegetation will be protected.
The Ripon recreation area is included in this group for public access, but as of 1996, development of this area is not
planned.
Vegetation and Wildlife Resources
Vegetation, fish, and wildlife have commercial, recreational, educational and aesthetic values and play critical roles in
the food chain. Various species of plants, wildlife, and fish have become extinct due to human influences, coupled
with insufficient concern for conservation.
Consequently, the United States Congress passed the Endangered Species Act in 1973. The State enacted a parallel
act, the California Endangered Species Act. These two acts, with the California Environmental Quality Act and
National
Environmental Policy Act, help to protect the ecosystems that endangered and threatened species need to survive.
Generally, the term endangered refers to a species that is in danger of becoming extinct throughout all or a
significant portion of its range. Threatened (Federal and State) or rare (State) species is one that could become
endangered in the future.
Surrounding Ripon, the San Joaquin valley floor contains some of the most fertile soils in the nation. Although most
agricultural operations are disruptive to native plants and animals, some crops do provide food to wildlife. Along the
edges of fields and orchards, dense protective cover for wildlife and food for birds are found where stands of weeds,
blackberry brambles and brush are left undisturbed. Game birds, small animals, and rodents are also found in these
                                                                   5-5

The Stanislaus River is the location of riparian habitats in the planning area. Riparian vegetation is characterized by
Oak, Willow, and Cottonwood along the river banks that are home to some sensitive species. (Table 5.1 lists the

Fish need suitable food supplies and cover. The removal of vegetation along watercourses reduces the quality of
suitable fish habitat and can cause an increase in water temperature that may lead to fish mortality. Maintaining
shoreline and aquatic vegetation provides cover for protection from predators and serves as a food source. Certain
Characteristics, of the stream environment are necessary to ensure survival of fish. A stable flow of water that closely
resembles the natural environment is the most critical element. This is not always easily achieved downstream of
impoundments. Adequate stream flow is an important consideration for the dam operators. Water depth, force and
velocity are characteristics that are closely associated with flow. Each fish species has specific requirements for each
of these characteristics. (Table 5.2 shows the estimated flow requirements for salmon runs and spawning grounds on
the Stanislaus River.)

The Ripon planning area lies in the northern portion of the San Joaquin Valley air basin bounded by the coastal
mountain ranges on the west and the Sierra Nevada Range on the east. The Carquinez Strait is a sea level gap in the
coastal range, found approximately 60 miles northwest of Ripon. The intervening terrain is flat. Prevailing wind
direction in the planning area is from the northwest, resulting from breezes through the Carquinez Strait and
Altamount Pass. In the winter, winds diminish. Average rainfall for the year in San Joaquin County is approximately
14 inches, while U.S. Weather Bureau records show the average annual temperature is approximately 60 degrees
Fahrenheit.

Local governments’ responsibility for air quality increased significantly with the passage of the California Clean Air
Act (1988) and the 1990 amendment to the Federal Clean Air Act. Both pieces of legislation place emphasis on
reducing motor vehicle trips and vehicle miles traveled at the local level. San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution
Control District (SJVUAPCD) is required to include transportation control measures and indirect source programs in
its air quality attainment plan. Cities and Counties through their Council of Governments are responsible for most
implementation measures. (The air quality attainment plan prepared by the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution
Control District is adopted by reference into this plan by Goal E of the Open Space and Conservation Goals and
Policies.)
Urban emission sources in the San Joaquin County area plus what is transported from the San Francisco Bay Area are
the main sources of two existing air quality problems. Currently, the entire San Joaquin valley has been designated as
“non-attainment” by protection Agency (EPA) for both ozone and PM-10.
Ozone, the main component of photochemical smog, is primarily a summer/fall period pollution problem. Federal and
State ozone standards have been periodically exceeded in parts of San Joaquin County for many years. The major
contributors to regional ozone problems are motor vehicle emissions and evaporation of various organic compounds
(fuels, solvents, etc.). Ozone is not emitted directly into the air, but is formed through a complex series of chemical
reactions involving other compounds (various organic compounds, nitric oxides, and nitrogen dioxide) which are
directly emitted.
Fine particulate matter (PM-10) is particulate matter 10 microns in diameter. Among the many sources for PM-10 is
construction activities (i.e., the movement of soil, use of heavy equipment, bulk materials handling, asphalt paving,
etc.) which can generate emission associated with development projects. The San Joaquin Valley Unified Air
Pollution Control District adopted Regulation VIII (Fugitive Dust Prohibitions) to reduce the amount of PM-10
                                                                5-7

entrained into the ambient air from man-made sources.
The state has classified the San Joaquin Valley urbanized areas, with the exception of the Fresno area, as “attainment”
for carbon monoxide (CO) due to the infrequency of CO exceedences. Official federal redesignation is pending.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is primarily a winter period pollution problem. Motor vehicle emissions are the dominant
source of co in most areas. (As a directly emitted pollutant, transport away from the emission source (such as a
roadway) is accompanied by dispersion and reduced pollutant concentrations with increased distance.)
Archeological and Historical Resources
Archaeological sites can yield information about prehistoric activities of man; evidence of earlier historic cultures that
once inhabited an area, and sites of cultural, social or economic importance to these past peoples; and sites having
spiritual or cultural significance to living Native Americans. The locations of archaeological sites, unlike other types
of historical resources, are not to be publicized. Archaeologists recommend that such sites be left untouched until
competent professional research can be done.
A plaque for California Historic Landmark #436, New Hope, is at the Ripon Community Center located at Fourth and
Locust streets. New Hope was the first known agricultural society in the San Joaquin Valley.
No buildings found within the City are on the National Register of Historical Places. Several buildings in the City
have historical significance such as the Odd Fellows Hall, the first brick building on Main Street, and the Markham
Building on Main at Stockton Streets.
The City has adopted an ordinance with provisions for a historic preservation district and consideration should be
given for the establishment of a historic preservation commission.

Parks within the City of Ripon are operated and maintained by the City. The City has a Parks and Recreation
Commission, which is a six-member advisory body appointed by the City Council. The commission presides over the
City’s parks and recreation programs and makes recommendations for the recreation facilities. The Parks and
recreation Department is responsible for park planning and recreation activity programming. The Public Works
Department maintains all City parks and recreation facilities.
City owned parks include Mistlin Sports Park on River Road, Mavis Stouffer Park east of Highway 99 next to the
Stanislaus River, Thiemann Park on Fourth Street, Vermeulen Park on Azalea Street, Harvest Estates Park on Pecan
Drive, Curt Pernice Skate Park on Hughes Lane, Lan Park on South Highland Avenue, Boesch-Kingery Park on East
Boesch Dr, Veterans Memorial Park on First Street, a small park on Wilma Avenue and many small parks throughout
the City. (Exhibit 5.1 shows the location of parks and open space, and Table 5-3 is a summary of parks and
recreation facilities in the City.) Described below are some of the Cities parks and their associated facilities.
The Mistlin Sports Park is an eighty (80) acre site intended for future development as a park and regional storm drain
facility. Presently, eight (8) soccer fields, an interactive water feature, a two diamond baseball complex with

5.4.     EFFECTS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT ON NATURAL RESOURCES
Soils and Agricultural Resources
The primary impact on soils and agriculture of future development within the Planning Area will be the loss of
productive farmland. This will primarily be felt in the unincorporated area, since very little land within the existing
City limits is devoted to agricultural uses.
Groundwater Resources
Future development within the Planning Area is expected to have only minimal effect on underground aquifers.
Natural recharge from the Stanislaus River and the availability of good surface water for irrigation of surrounding
agricultural uses reduces the need for groundwater pumping.
It is unknown how the quality of groundwater may change in the future. The City may be forced to abandon an
excessive number of its wells as sources of drinking water due to nitrate or organic chemical contamination in excess
of health standards. Annexations and additional development may have to be prohibited until an adequate source of
good water can be identified and developed. The City has an ongoing program for monitoring the water quality in all
of its wells to provide early detection of recognized potential water quality problems.
River Resources
Future development within the planning area is not expected to produce significant adverse impacts on the Stanislaus
River. One potential effect is increased storm drainage runoff, since seven of the City’s storm drain lines flow by
gravity into the river.
The City acquired land in the flood plain along the River to restrict development and to enhance recreational
opportunities. Some development in this area could be undertaken to provide bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian paths
for greater public use of this resource.
Vegetation and Wildlife Resources
Ripon’s policy prohibits building within the Stanislaus Rivers 100-year flood plain except by special permit;
consequently, development within the Planning Area is not expected to have significant effects on existing
riparian habitat and vegetation or other areas along the river supporting wildlife.
Any construction within the 100-year flood plain of the Stanislaus River would require a Stream Bed Alteration
Agreement from the Department of Fish and Game as required by Sections 1601-03 of the Fish and Game Code.
Removal of land from agricultural use could affect the availability of habitat for common animals such as pheasants,
quail, and rabbits.
Air Quality
Air quality would unavoidably and adversely be affected to a minor degree by residential, commercial, and industrial
development within the Planning Area. The adverse effects would be due to increased emissions generated by
automobile travel and stationary source additions resulting from such urban development.
Another important air quality issue locally is that of odors. Odors from poultry farms bordering the urbanized area
may prove objectionable at times to residents of developing portions of the Planning Area. Additionally, odors from
the City’s domestic and industrial sewer ponds need to be recognized in consideration of compatible land uses near
these ponds.

City Parks and Recreation Facilities
The total developed and undeveloped City park land, exclusive of school recreation facilities, provides 344.75 acres of
combined neighborhood and community parks and recreation facilities. This represents approximately 25.7 acres per
1,000 persons within the City limits, at the 2005 population level of 13,241. (This compares favorably with State and
National guidelines for parks and recreational facilities, as shown in Table 5.4, which suggests that between 2.0 and
4.0 acres per 1,000 persons is appropriate. In the past the City has used a rule of thumb of one park per 60 to 80
acres for residential development.)

Regional park facilities for the Ripon area are provided by Caswell State Park and the Corps of Engineers park and
bike bridge along the Stanislaus River, and the Mistlin Sports Complex on River Road.
Future needs for neighborhood and community park facilities can be estimated using the existing parks to population
ratios. At the City’s projected Year 2040 population level of 40,000, a total of at least forty-one (41) acres of
additional neighborhood/community parks and recreation facilities will be needed to maintain the existing ratio.
For the purposes of this discussion, a mini park is typically expected to be similar in nature to a neighborhood park,
but involving less land area (primarily at the expense of some turf play area found in neighborhood parks). A
neighborhood park provides playground equipment and turf play areas, but no restrooms, formal ball field areas or
parking areas. Neighborhood parks are typically expected to be in the range of 5 to 10 acres or less for a mini park.
Community parks are typically expected to be larger 25+ acres depending on the types and extent of recreation
facilities provided. A community park provides formal ball field facilities, picnic areas, restrooms, parking areas, and
possibly other amenities besides playground equipment and turf play areas. (Future Recreation Facilities are shown
 in Table 5.5)

Open Space/Recreation Opportunities along the Stanislaus River
Since City policy prohibits building within the Stanislaus River flood plain area except by special permit, a unique
opportunity exists to use some of these areas for open space and recreation. For example, from Stouffer Park the flood
plain area follows the rivers on the north side to Highway 99 and possibly westward.
Cooperation between the City, the Corps of Engineers, and affected property owners and developers will be necessary
to use the potential of this area that might otherwise be an untapped recreational and open space asset. These policies
should be actively pursued.
In 2005, the City sold 57.25 acres of property, an oak grove, to San Joaquin County and is leasing it back for open
space. The City also acquired an easement for public access to the Corps of Engineers park site next to State Route 99
and the Stanislaus River.

VOLUME I - CHAPTER SIX
HOUSING
6.1      INTRODUCTION
The Housing Chapter is intended to guide residential development and preservation in a way that supports the overall
economic and social values of the community. The residential character of a city is largely dependent on the type and
quality of its residential neighborhoods and the dwelling units within them. This chapter on housing is an official
response to a continuing awareness of the need to provide housing for all economic segments of the community. It
establishes goals, policies, and programs about the development of housing, and adopts a program of actions to be
undertaken toward this end. In addition, the discussion identifies and analyzes housing needs and resources and
constraints to meeting these needs, including the City’s share of the countywide housing needs for all income levels.
Housing is a basic human necessity, and historically low-income families have always had some difficulty in
adequately meeting that need. Housing costs have risen over the past several years faster than the incomes of Ripon
residents. As a result, most low-income families find themselves in the position of paying a larger share of their
income for housing. Many moderate-income families also find it more difficult to afford adequate housing. The
provision of housing has become a critical and multifaceted problem requiring complex solutions that will need to be
undertaken jointly by all levels of government and the private sector.

Housing Program
The Housing Chapter, according to State Code, must include a statement of community goals, quantified objectives
and policies concerning the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing, and include a program to
implement these policies, and achieve these goals and objectives. The program should contain goals the community
can realistically achieve, and should: 1) identify adequate sites that will be made available to ease and encourage the
development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels; 2) help in the development of adequate housing to
meet the needs of low and moderate income households; 3) address, and where appropriate and legally possible,
remove government constraints in the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing; 4) conserve and
improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock; and 5) promote housing opportunities for all persons
regardless of race, sex, color, religion, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, lawful occupation, family status, disability
or age of owners or intended occupants of a residential development or emergency shelter.

Special Housing Needs
An assessment of any special housing needs is required such as those of the elderly, large families, farm workers,
persons with disabilities and families with female heads of households.
Overcrowding
An analysis and assessment of overcrowding in the City is required to be included in a housing discussion.
Housing Condition
Documentation of the number of substandard units in the community is required, including the number suitable for
rehabilitation and the number in need of replacement. If possible, the number suitable for rehabilitation should be
further broken down into owner and renter occupied units for program targeting.
Housing Needs Analysis
State Government Code requires that localities document and analyze population employment trends, quantify
population trends, and quantify existing and future needs including the locality=s share of the region=s housing needs.
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
Localities must quantify existing and future housing needs for all income levels. These needs are to include the
locality=s share of regional housing needs. The San Joaquin Council of Governments determines Ripon’s share of
regional need.
Land Inventory
A housing discussion must contain an inventory of land suitable for residential development including vacant sites and
sites having potential for development. The discussion must also include an analysis of the relationship between
zoning and public facilities, and services to these sites.
Constraints
State Government Code requires an analysis of the potential and actual government constraints to the maintenance,
improvement, and development of housing for all income levels, including the availability of financing, the price of
land, and the cost of construction. The purpose of the constraints analysis is to identify governmental and non-
governmental factors unique to the community that inhibit development, maintenance, or improvement of housing.
Once identified, decision makers can take steps to reduce or eliminate the constraints through the implementation of
programs and actions.
Citizen Participation
This Housing Chapter was prepared as part of Ripon s General Plan Update. As part of the planning process,
extensive public information meetings were conducted. The program consisted of several public informational
meetings held at City Hall and with groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, Ripon Unified School District, Ripon
Consolidated Fire District, the Ministerial Association, and Agriculture Community.
A Public Review Draft was prepared and made available to the community

General Plan Consistency
California Government Code requires that General Plans contain an integrated, internally consistent set of policies. To
ensure internal consistency is maintained, a review of all of the sections of the Plan was conducted as part of the
public workshops. Housing is linked to the goals, policies, and actions of Land Use and Circulation to ensure each
section supports the implementation of the entire Plan. Assumptions used in the Plan use existing and projected
population, employment, and dwelling unit figures generated from both City land use data and Census data.
The Housing Programs
This Section contains the City=s statement of goals, policies, programs, and quantified objectives for housing. (Table
6.1 summarizes the City=s quantified objectives contained in this Chapter which were established based on existing
and projected fiscal and political realities rather than unrealistic and unattainable expectations for meeting the
City=s affordable housing demand.)
The proposed actions contained in this Section reflect the City s philosophy that its primary role will be one of
encouraging the construction of housing by developers. Where feasible and necessary, the City, and San Joaquin
County Community Development Department, will take direct action to seek funding for housing activities. More
often than not, the City will use its ability to soften the impact of regulation on housing cost and production as its
primary tool to achieve its objectives.
The City in the Annual Report will monitor program achievement. Programs and housing production will be part of a
yearly review by the Planning Commission and City Council.

Ripon has approximately 2,994 acres of vacant land designated for residential development, with 149 of those acres
designated for multifamily construction. The City has taken actions to provide opportunities for the construction of
affordable housing.
An Affordable Housing Committee has been formed (that includes members from the City Council, Planning
Commission and City Staff to monitor progress of the programs and to help project proponents in identifying possible
funding sources and potential project sites. Renter and owner occupied residential rehabilitation programs have been
implemented throughout the community using Community Development Block Grant and Redevelopment funds.
6.2      GOALS AND POLICIES
GOAL A: IDENTIFY ADEQUATE SITES THAT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO HELP AND ENCOURAGE THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A VARIETY OF TYPES OF HOUSING FOR ALL INCOME LEVELS.
Policy A1. Provide an adequate supply of land at various densities to meet the housing demand of all income
segments of the community.
Program A1a. Annexing Land. Property Owners have contacted the City regarding annexation of lands designated for

low-density residential development in the northeast part of the City. The City will continue to work with property
owners of vacant land within the City=s Sphere of Influence that it determines is appropriate for R1-U and R-3 zoning
to meet very low and low income housing demand. The City will continue to determine interest and readiness of
properties to annex and develop by meeting regularly with property owners regarding annexing land for development
of housing for all population segments of the City. As part of the annexation process the City includes in development
agreements a requirement that each development participate in the City=s affordable housing program.
Quantified Objectives. The City will maintain an inventory of land available to provide for the development of
sufficient housing for all income groups. Annex and rezone sufficient land to accommodate 37 dwelling units for very
low income households and 33 dwelling units for low income households at densities of 13 to 22 units per acre, to
annex sufficient land to accommodate 24 dwelling units for moderate income households. Table 6.27 summarizes the
Vacant Land Inventory.

The City will identify sites on corner lots in the older areas of the City that are zoned R1-UC that can be appropriately
developed for duplexes and triplexes for lower income households. The City encourages developers to disperse
modest single family residences, townhouses and/or duplexes in their projects for lower income households. An
Ordinance amendment, R1-U District, was adopted by the City to give an opportunity to developers for a variety of lot
sizes. Minimum lot sizes range from five thousand (5,000) square feet for interior lots and six thousand (6,000) square
feet for corner lots. A maximum density of seven (7) units per gross acre is permitted.

6.3     HOUSING NEEDS IN THE CITY OF RIPON
The City of Ripon=s affordable housing challenge is to meet the housing needs of its current and future residents by
providing a range of purchase and rental units that are affordable to all income groups. This section provides a
summary of the housing needs in Ripon by identifying: existing and projected housing needs; analyzing population
and housing trends; and addressing special needs within the Ripon area.
Based on U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000 data, current sales and rental prices, and the definition of affordability, the
following housing assistance needs have been identified for each group:
Low and Very Low Income Households who are not homeowners probably cannot qualify for home ownership without
some form of a deep subsidy, unless their incomes rise significantly. Subsidies for some rental units may be needed to
remain affordable to very low-income households.
Moderate Income Households are expected to afford rental units without financial assistance, however, they may
require some assistance in purchasing a home.
Above Moderate Income Households are considered financially able to find affordable units for purchase or rent
within the Ripon housing market without any special efforts by the City.
Housing Stock
In 1960, Ripon had 632 dwelling units, and the 1990 Census showed Ripon had 2,653 dwelling units. The U. S.
Census Bureau, Census 2000 shows a total of 3,432 housing units. These figures show that approximately 82% of the
housing units in Ripon are less than 40 years old. (See Table 6.2.)

Income Limits
Household income is an important consideration when evaluating housing needs because low income typically limits a
households’ ability to afford adequate housing and services.
Based on annual nationwide surveys, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
calculates household standards for federal housing programs which is indicated in (Table 6.5) below.
                                                     Table 6.5
                                   HUD Definitions of Household Income Levels
VERY LOW - 0-50% of Median Income
LOW - 51-80% of Median Income
MODERATE - 81-120% of Median Income
ABOVE MODERATE - More than 120% of Median Income
The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) uses this data to establish household
income limits. The income limits for San Joaquin County for 2005 are shown in (Table 6.6) below.

Housing affordability refers to the financial ability of a household to rent or buy a housing unit. Government
agencies, lenders, and landlords generally consider a household eligible to rent or buy if monthly payments do not
exceed 30% of the total household income. Given this guideline, the monthly rent or mortgage rate a household can
afford is easily calculated, although ownership costs will vary with interest rates, down payments, and the type of
financing instrument.
Poverty Level
According to the 2000 Census, Ripon’s poverty status in 1999 was 126 households or 4.7% of the total
population, which was a very slight increase over the 4.6% reported in the 1990 Census. The income
characteristics of Ripon have likely been affected by development trends in the last 20 years. About 82% of the
dwelling units in Ripon have been constructed since 1980. Residents in these homes are likely to have higher
incomes, on average, than other residents of the community. (See Table 6.7)

Housing Condition
Since the September 1997 windshield survey conducted by Ripon=s Building Official conducted a windshield housing
survey in September 1997, and estimated approximately 310 residential structures or 12.2% of the City=s total housing
units to be in a deteriorated condition. About 245 of those structures may be in need of significant repairs or should
be replaced.
Residential units that currently exhibit structural decline are in Ripon=s older neighborhoods built before World War II
The cost of lots in developing areas makes repairing and rehabilitating homes in the City=s older areas attractive
economically for lower income families.
Rehabilitation and replacement of older homes is an ongoing effort encouraged by the City. Ripon annually allots
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), H.O.M.E., and Redevelopment Funds for its Rehabilitation Program
administered by the San Joaquin County Community Development Department.
Housing Costs
Housing has become a less affordable commodity. Median price of housing in Ripon is low compared with the Bay
Area and other higher cost areas of California, but incomes of City residents are lower. Increases in the cost of housing
have affected the ability of City residents to afford housing within their means, particularly those who want to own a
home.
Generally, the standard for determining housing affordability used by HUD and lending institutions is that housing
costs should not exceed 30% of gross household income. When computing the City=s housing needs, analysis is
necessary to find the percentage of unaffordable units within the various income levels. “Affordability” is defined as
a household=s ability to pay for housing based on income. According to current accepted standards, very low or low-
income households that pay more than 30% of their monthly income for housing face a financial hardship.
The data is an estimate based on census tables and does not represent a complete count of all households. This is the
only available data that measures housing costs as a percent of income. The table uses households with incomes equal
to or less than $44,250 per year (80% of County median family income by household size) as a cut off for lower
income households. This was the targeted income for small cities Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program.
The 2000 Census showed that the median house value in Ripon was $166,500. By comparison, the median house
value in San Joaquin County was $142,400. Ripon homeowners were paying a medium mortgage payment of $1,285
and San Joaquin County homeowners were paying a median monthly mortgage cost of $ 1,235 per month. (See
Table 6.8)

According to the 2000 Census the median gross rent in San Joaquin County was $617. At the same time the median

Measures of overpayment vary from 25% to 30% of a households’ income. (Table 6.9) shows Owner Cost as a
Percentage, and (Table 6.10) shows the Gross Rent Percentage of Household Income.
If 25% is used as a basis of overpayment, 888 or 37.6% of Ripon’s owners over paid on their mortgages.

Overcrowding
The U.S. Census Bureau defines overcrowding as a dwelling unit that houses more than one person per room and
extreme overcrowding is defined as more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding should also be evaluated in terms
of other factors such as cultural expectations, size of rooms, availability of common open areas, as well as age and
relationship of persons in the units.
The 2000 Census lists Occupant Per Room in occupied housing units. It does not differentiate between owner
occupied and rental units.
Overcrowding is not a serious problem in Ripon because less than 6% of the occupied units are overcrowded, as
shown on (Table 6.11).

To alleviate overcrowding in rental units, the City could use incentives to encourage developers to provide some 3 and
4 bedroom units in their project.
The City is attempting to ease overcrowding in owner occupied units by participating in the Community Development
Block Grant rehabilitation program using Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), H.O.M.E., and City
Redevelopment funds to rehabilitate existing housing.
Vacancy Rate
Vacancy rate is an indicator of housing availability and market conditions. A 5% vacancy rate is considered the
minimum required to allow reasonable rental mobility. A lower vacancy rate will decrease the renter=s ability to find
appropriate housing and the strong market pressure will allow rates to rise. Ripon=s vacancy rate, according to the
2000 Census, was 2.3% for-rent and for-sale units. Vacancy status for rental housing units was 24 (1%) and Afor-sale@
units was 55 (2.2%) with an overall vacancy rate of 4.1%. The California Department of Finance Population and
Housing Estimates show Ripon averaging a 4% to 5% vacancy rate since 1990. (Table 6.12) indicates the changes

Population
The population trends, demographics, and special needs of a community largely determine the amount and type of
housing needed. This section reviews the population characteristics of Ripon. (See Table 16.13)
Future housing needs are partially created by forces outside the City. There has been, and will likely continue to be, a
movement of people from the greater San Francisco Bay Area. Most jobs are still being created along the Interstate
580 and Interstate 680 corridors of the Livermore Valley. This is likely to create a search for economical housing.
Future housing needs generated by these employment opportunities will be largely determined by what takes place in
the communities surrounding that area. Economics, political interests, ability to provide infrastructure, water, schools,
and way of life will all play a part.
It is likely, however, that the San Joaquin Valley will continue to experience steady demand for housing because of
that employment growth.

Regional Housing Needs Allocation
State Government Code requires the San Joaquin County Council of Governments (SJCOG), and other councils of
Governments, to set existing and projected regional housing needs, both for their respective regions and for local
jurisdictions within their respective region. Regional housing plans have been developed since 1981.
Council of Governments are required to consider the following factors when determining local shares or projected
housing need: the market demand for housing; employment opportunities; availability of suitable sites and public
facilities; commuting patterns and public transportation facilities; the loss of units in assisted housing developments
that changed to non-low-income use through mortgage prepayments; subsidy contract expirations or end of use
restrictions; type and tenure of housing; and the housing needs of farm workers. The purpose of the regional housing
needs plan is to help plan for future residential growth so that residents of all income levels will have access to
housing, both within the region and by jurisdictions. Distribution of regional housing needs must promote efficient
commuting patterns, and the provision of housing close to employment opportunities or public transportation
facilities. The COGs are also directed to seek to reduce the concentration of lower income households in cities or
counties that already have disproportionately high proportions of lower-income households.
Providing adequate housing sites is vital to satisfying the housing need of all portions of the community. As indicated
in (Table 6.16), Ripon must provide adequate sites for the construction of 1,208 units from 2001-2008, as determined
by the San Joaquin County Council of Governments in its Regional Fair Share Housing Plan (RHNA). Provision of
adequate sites is a key function of the Land Use and Zoning Regulations.

The Land Use Chapter of the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance provide the planning and regulatory framework
for the future development of adequate housing sites. A variety of residential development is possible in the City,
ranging in density up to 22 units per acre excluding density bonuses. Housing alternatives included in the Ripon
Development Code are second unit dwellings, density bonuses and an affordable housing exception. There are seven
(7) residential land use designations provided by the Land Use Plan.
The City will continue programs and procedures with the intent of achieving its fair share of the regional housing
allocation. The City will encourage low-income housing units in density bonus projects. The affordable housing
exception will be used when infill development occurs.
Master Affordable Housing Schedule
An affordable housing schedule has been developed for approved single-family residential projects that identifies the
type of housing by income level (very low, low and moderate). Pending multiple-family projects are included in the
list and it is anticipated that approximately 50 units (30 very low and 20 low) will be constructed during the next 5
year period. (See Table 6.17)

Density Bonus
Ripon=s Development Code includes a housing density bonus section that regulates concessions and incentives for the
development of housing for low income and very low income individuals and senior citizens. If the Density Bonus
concept is used, greater residential densities may be achieved. The Ordinance allows 25% increase in the allowed
range of density based on the project=s design and ability to meet certain housing criteria. Density is considered a
necessary component in providing for affordable housing. (See Table 6.19)

In 1998, the City implemented its Density Bonus Program. Since that time, the City processed one project, the
Bethany Garden West senior PUD, on a 3.2 acre site, resulting in a total of 45 units, of which 29 were constructed
using the density bonus provisions.

Assisted Housing Units At-Risk
Over the last thirty (30) years the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA) have administered many subsidy programs to encourage the development of multi-family
housing for low and moderate income households and for elderly and disabled persons. These subsidies took many
forms, including mortgage and rental subsidies.
Private owners of government assisted rental housing developments are often eligible to end rent restrictions once a
specified contract period has expired. Government issued contracts including subsidy, mortgage prepayment, or rent
restrictions often extend to 40 or 50 years; however, borrowers may have the option of prepaying their loans after 20
years, after which time they may convert their low income rental units to market rates.
Ripon has no assisted rental housing units that are at risk of converting to market housing, nor are there any rental
developments that might fall into this category in the future. The Ripon City Council adopted Resolution 92-19 on
May 5, 1992 which made the finding that there is no assisted housing in the City at risk.
Special Housing Needs
There are particular groups that need special housing. These groups include large families, seniors, persons with
disabilities, migrant and seasonal workers, female-headed households, and homeless people. Large families need
larger units with more bedrooms and baths, while senior households may need smaller units. Persons with disabilities
may need specially constructed units. Female-headed households often need low cost housing and may include both
large-family and elderly persons. Migrant and seasonal workers need housing accessibly to agricultural areas.
Homeless persons need emergency shelter and assistance in finding permanent housing.
Large Households
Large households (defined as five or more persons) may have specific needs that differ from traditional families due to
income and housing stock limitations. About 2.4% of the households in Ripon have more than 1.51 or more persons
per room. This is a small percentage of Ripon’s household.
Seniors
Ripon’s 65 and over population increased from 9% in 1990 to 17.9% in 2000. Many of the seniors in the City live
alone.
Some seniors have the physical and financial ability to continue driving well into retirement, but there are those that
cannot or chose not to drive. Housing designed for seniors should take into consideration close and easy access to
medical, transportation, commercial and recreational facilities. Walkable neighborhoods are also very important to
seniors.
There are 262 senior householders living alone in the City. There were 108 individuals 65 years and over in poverty
status in 1999 according to the 2000 Census. This group finds it difficult to find adequate housing because of the low
income. (See Table 6.20)

Female Householder
Female headed households tend to earn low incomes, thus limiting housing availability. In 2000, females headed 322
Ripon households and 209 of those had children less than 18 years of age. The poverty level in this group was 27%.
Providing housing opportunities for female-headed households relates both to affordability and child care services.
Farm Worker Households
Ripon located in the San Joaquin Valley, is located in a rich agricultural area. Most of the farms in the area are family
farms ranging in size from 20 to 60 acres. Agriculture is also changing over to crops that can be harvested
mechanically. This change has resulted in the need for fewer farm workers.
The San Joaquin County Housing Authority maintains housing at sites in French Camp and east of Lodi on Harney
Lane. Some larger farmers provide housing for their employees in season.
According to the 2000 Census, there were approximately 67 Ripon residents employed in farming, fishing, and
forestry occupations. There is no fishing or forestry in the City so it can be assumed that the residents of Ripon are
employed in farming. Employment in farming does not necessarily mean the status of the person is always that of the
migrant or a seasonal worker; it is likely that some residents engaged in farming, do so on a large scale and employ
others, or are permanent residents with continuing employment on nearby farms. The Housing needs for farm workers
can be fulfilled in the City’s affordable housing approach because the need is small. (See Table 6.21)

Emergency and Transitional Shelter
The housing needs of those seeking emergency shelter or transitional shelter has increased dramatically in recent
years. The fastest growing population of those in need of shelter is families with children. Factors contributing to the
rise of homeless population include the lack of affordable housing, increase in the number of persons who fall below
the poverty level, reductions in public subsidies to the poor, and removing the mentally ill from institutions.
The City of Ripon had no homeless persons as of 2005. Those looking for emergency shelter or transitional shelter go
to Manteca, Modesto and Stockton where services are available.
The Ripon Police Department reports they do not observe any homeless in the City of Ripon. Occasionally officers
                                                           6-21

Volume I – Chapter Six                                                                                         Housing
will find the presence of an abandoned campfire down by the Stanislaus River; however, they do not have any
individuals making it an extended campsite. The campsites appear to be used for overnight stays while traveling along
State Route 99.
In addition, to the publicly subsidized programs, some private organizations, including several local churches, have
programs to help homeless persons. The primary provider of such services for Ripon residents is Love Thy Neighbor,
a private corporation in Manteca that while it has no housing facilities, arranges and provides financial assistance for
homeless people in search of places to stay. It also provides a wide range of associated services for both individuals
and families in need, including a food kitchen.
Ripon’s revised Development Code permits small shelter in the R-3, R-4 and R4-U residential districts with site plan
approval by the Planning Commission. Small shelters are defined as any public or private building that provides a
homeless shelter or transitional housing for the homeless up to two families or not more than 5 adults.
Persons with Disabilities
Physical disabilities can hinder access to housing units of normal design as well as limit the ability to earn an adequate
income. Disabled persons may need specially designed housing to assist with their independence and it should be
located as to be convenient for services and transportation. Housing opportunities for the disabled can be maximized
through housing assistance programs. Ripon encourages developers to construct single level units, ground floor units,
and units that incorporate design features such as widened doorways, access ramps, and lower drain boards and other
features accessible to the disabled. (See Table 6.22)

Persons with disabilities in Ripon have different housing needs depending on the nature and severity of the disability.
Physically disabled persons generally require modifications to the housing units such as wheelchair ramps, elevators
or lifts, wide doorways, accessible cabinetry, modified fixtures and appliances. If the disability prevents the person
from operating a vehicle, the proximity to services and access to public transportation are also important. People with
severe or mental disabilities may also require supportive housing, nursing facilities, or care facilities. If the physical
disability prevents individuals from working or limits income, then the cost of housing and the costs of modification
can become even more of a concern. Because physical handicaps vary, this group does not congregate toward a single
service organization making it difficult to estimate the number of individuals and specific needs. In addition, many
disabled people rely solely on Social Security income, which is insufficient for market rate housing.
A growing number of architects, designers, and developers are integrating universal design principles into their
buildings to increase accessibility. The intent of universal design is to simplify design and construction by making
products, communications, and buildings more usable by as many people as possible without the need for adaptation
or specialized design. Applying these principles, in addition to the regulations specified in the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) to construction in Ripon will increase opportunities in housing and employment for everyone.
A group care facility is defined in Ripon’s Development Code as “a facility authorized, certified, and licensed by the
State of California to provide non-medical care and supervision on a 24 hour-a-day basis to either mentally disordered
or otherwise disabled persons, to dependents and neglected children or to aged individuals”. Small Group Care
facilities, six persons or less, are permitted in all residential zones by a Site Plan Permit that is approved by Staff in the
                                                               6-22

Volume I – Chapter Six                                                                                     Housing
same manner as any other residential use. Large Group Care facilities, more than six persons, are permitted in the R4
(Multiple Family Residential) and R4-U (Multiple Family Residential Urban) Zones with a Site Plan Permit approved
by the Planning Commission. Site Plan Permits do not require noticed public hearings.
Ripon’s Building Code and Development Code comply with ADA. All multifamily complexes are required to provide
handicapped parking at a rate of one for every twenty non-handicapped spaces. One parking space is provided for each
dwelling designated for people with disabilities. The City works with developers of special needs housing and will
reduce parking requirements if the applicant can demonstrate a need for reduced parking.
The Ripon City Hall and other offices are accessible to persons with disabilities. Disabled applicants are treated with
the same courteous one-to-one service as all applicants when completing forms to apply for building permits, planning
or other applications. Applications for retrofit are processed over-the-counter in the same manner as for any
improvement to a residence.
Migrant Farm-Workers
Public projects in outlying parts of San Joaquin County, and low cost apartments and lodging in Modesto and
Stockton largely satisfy the need for the region=s farm worker housing and are expected to continue to do so during the
planning period of this plan.
6.4      ENERGY CONSERVATION
State law requires every city preparing a housing element to conduct an analysis of opportunities for energy
conservation with respect to residential development. Opportunities for energy conservation are several types: energy
savings from new construction techniques that emphasize energy conservation; subdivision design and building
orientation that maximize winter sun exposure; helping homeowners in weatherizing their homes; and other efforts by
the City at promoting and encouraging conservation.
The City will continue to enforce energy standards required by the Building Code that define construction standards
that promote energy conservation such as insulation, air leakage, vapor barriers, space conditioning, water heating
plumbing system measures and lighting.
The City, through its subdivision ordinance and development standards, will promote energy efficiency through
approvals that include proper solar orientation and landscape design standards that encourage tree planting.
San Joaquin County Department of Aging Energy Assistance has a program for weatherization for elderly and low-
income homes throughout the County. Energy assistance is also included in rehabilitation projects administered by
San Joaquin County Neighborhood Preservation in the City.
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) offers weatherization programs that provide conservation measures at low or no cost
to the homeowner.
6.5      CONSTRAINTS TO MEETING HOUSING NEEDS
Many factors can potentially affect the City=s ability to achieve its housing objectives for all income groups. Some of
these factors arise from, or are controlled by, the City itself. Other factors that could affect the City=s housing
objectives involve actions or regulations carried out by other public agencies and levels of government, which Ripon
cannot control. The City=s housing program can also be affected by circumstances that arise from the operation of the
private sector, which provides most of the capital and labor to construct and improve housing in Ripon.
THIS SECTION FOCUSES ON TWO TYPES OF CONSTRAINTS:
                                                            6-23

Volume I – Chapter Six                                                                                     Housing
1. Governmental constraints relating to zoning, code enforcement, subdivision and development standards, fees and
    exactions, infrastructure capacity, and the City’s development permit process; and
2. Non-governmental constraints arising from the interplay of capital and financing costs, the cost of land and
    construction, and other factors affecting the private sectors ability to meet housing demand and need between
    Ripon’s current and future residents.
Governmental Constraints
Land use controls are intended to improve the overall quality of housing, but they may serve as a constraint to housing
development. Examples of those land use controls are zoning, subdivision improvement standards, development and
permit fees, and infrastructure standards.
Growth Accommodation
Development during the 1980’s alerted the City to problems related to rapid growth because City services were
not able to keep up. Therefore a growth accommodation policy was adopted in the 1988 General Plan. While
percentage rates for any single year could go higher, the City policy would maintain growth at a rate in the range
of 3% to 6% during the planning horizon by annexing sufficient land to provide for the projected residential
growth. This policy will continue during the planning horizon for General Plan 2040 by maintaining an up to ten
(10) year supply of vacant residential land.
To further monitor and maintain this growth accommodation policy with the adoption of the 1988 General Plan,
the City implemented a building permit allocation schedule. Developers of residential projects of ten (10) or more
units are required to execute a development agreement which includes a provision limiting the maximum number
of building permits issued to each developer. Projects using local financial assistance (i.e., RDA funds) for
affordable housing are not included in this allocation schedule, except that no more than fifty (50) building
permits shall be allocated in any year for such projects.
Ripon’s share of the regional housing need can be fulfilled within this policy by providing adequate housing sites
to satisfy the demands of all income levels of the community. Each new project is required in the development
agreement to include its share of low-income housing.
In August of 2001, the City adopted the Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing Program into Title 16 of the
Development Code implementing a method for providing affordable housing opportunities to all segments of the
community. A developer of 10 or more units must enter into an affordable housing agreement with the City to
include in a residential project at least 10% of the dwelling units for rent or initial sale to lower income
households. A recorded document restricts resale of the property to assure that the owner-occupied or rental
dwelling units will remain affordable.
Growth within the Primary Urban Area is anticipated to be at a rate of 4.5% per year with a build-out population
estimated to be around 39,000 persons.
Residential Land Use Categories
Residential land use categories, as shown in (Table 6.23), in Ripon are cumulative, rather than exclusive. This means
that, overall, all residential land uses allowed in lower density residential categories are also allowed in the higher
density residential categories. In addition, the High Density residential category permits certain other uses with an
approved use permit.

Zoning Analysis
The Development Code, initially adopted in March 1999 and amended during the subsequent period, is intended to
serve as the basis for all land use regulations. The Development Code is the primary tool for implementing the goals
and policies of the Ripon General Plan.
Standards contained in the Development Code are in harmony with the intended uses and densities for the various
General Plan land use designations.
Single-family residences are permitted in higher density R-3 and R-4 zones. This could present a problem in finding
sites for lower income housing if sites zoned R-3 and R-4 are developed for single family residences rather than
apartments.
Nonresidential uses such as private clubs, lodges, and nurseries that are not related to or incidental to residential uses
are no longer permitted in the R-4 or the R4-U Zones in the Development Code adopted in 1999. The R-4 zone is the
City=s multifamily zone with a density high enough to make it feasible to develop low-income multifamily housing.
Present zoning regulations permit land zoned for high density use to be used instead for nonresidential uses. The
Planning Commission allows densities of 13 to 22 units per gross acre with Site Plan approval. These densities appear
adequate to satisfy affordable housing developments.
One possible solution is to amend the Development Code to make development of single-family detached and
non-residential uses in the R-3 and R-4 zones possible as conditional uses. Approval could be subject to the City
finding that the site on which a development is proposed in one of those two zones is not needed to meet the City=s
affordable housing needs. Another possible solution is to increase the amount of land zoned R-3 and R-4 so that it
exceeds the estimated need during the planning period. Land uses other than multifamily housing could be
accommodated without negatively affecting the City=s ability to meet its lower income housing needs.
The Planned Development Overlay District (PD) allows mixed –use projects containing residential, commercial, and
civic uses that are desirable and compatible with surrounding uses. The PD zone could be used in the City Core Area

Volume I – Chapter Six                                                                                   Housing
or in the commercial and industrial areas developing in the north area of the City. The Planning Commission in
recommendation to the City Council must consider a PD plan or specific plan. Likewise, the Below Market Rate
(BMR) Housing Program, adopted August 2001, is intended to provide a method to give affordable housing
opportunities for all segments of the community, and for the City to meet its fair share of the regional housing needs
program. A balanced community is only possible if part of the new housing built in the City is affordable to low and
moderate-income households. Requiring builders of new housing in all zones to include some housing affordable to
low and moderate-income households is fair because zoning and other ordinances concerning new housing in the City
should be consistent with the community’s goal of economic balance.
There is limited land in the City designated on the Land Use Element diagram of the General Plan or zoned for
multifamily use; however, residential uses are permitted in the C-2, C-3, and MU (Mixed Use) zones with an approved
use permit subject to certain findings and meeting the development standards of the zones.
The minimum 6,000 square foot lot size does constrain some affordable housing development, but using a density
bonus or a planned unit development can reduce the lot size. (Refer to Table 6.24 for a summary of the residential
zoning standards.)

Second Unit Dwellings
Secondary residential units may be permitted on residentially zoned lots that already contain a legally created

dwelling.
Second units are also encouraged in new residential projects. A secondary residential unit is a separate unit containing
sleeping quarters, kitchen and a bathroom. An existing residential unit may be remodeled to add separate kitchen and
bathroom facilities that are not shared in common.
Minimum requirements for second dwelling units are: the unit is for rental only; no more than one existing residence
on the property; and the second dwelling unit must be on the same lot as an existing single family dwelling; with only
one second dwelling unit is allowed on a lot.
Planned Development Overlay District
The Planned Development Overlay District (PD) is designed to provide a maximum environmental choice for the
residents of the City by encouraging flexibility and creativity of design, greater diversity of building types, open space
arrangements in keeping with the general intent of the Development Code, and consistent with the intent and purpose
of the General Plan. Design flexibility includes zero lot line, cluster, attached and similar non-typical residential
designs that may entail modifications of lot area and width, yard area, structure height, lot coverage or open space
requirements.
A PD is permitted in any zone for any of the uses permitted in that zone. Subject to City Council review, the Planning
Commission is authorized to examine, approve, approve with conditions, or deny any planned unit development
proposal. PD’s do not impose standards that constrain the development of affordable housing.
Below Market Rate Housing Program
In an effort to meet the acute need in Ripon for affordable housing and comply with the State’s ‘fair share of regional
housing requirements’, the City adopted a Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing Program. Developers of residential
projects with more than ten (10) units, implemented through development agreements, must provide at least three
percent (3%) of their project affordable to low and three percent (3%) to moderate-income households for rent or
owner-occupancy. The developer has an option to either build three percent (3%) very low or pay an in-lieu fee.
Buyer’s resale or regulatory agreements are recorded against the properties to ensure affordable for the household
income category.
Land Inventory
An inventory of vacant land is maintained by the Planning and Economic Development Department. All sites listed
on the inventory can be readily connected to the City water and sewer systems by the extension of lines. (Table 6.25
and 6.26 shows the potential number of units that could be developed on this vacant land if all of the parcels are
developed under the existing zoning.)
There are approximately 373 acres on which 1,059 dwelling units could be constructed within the City. Landowners
are discussing possible annexation in the near future. In addition the Land Use Diagram shows territory outside the
2005 City boundaries designated High Density on the west side of Jack Tone Road adjacent to the proposed extension
of Canal Boulevard, and High Density on the east side of N. Ripon Road near the easterly extension of Santos
Avenue. (Table 6.27 shows a vacant land inventory as of 2005 for residential development.)
Landowners are discussing possible annexation in the near future. As a policy, Ripon does not initiate annexations, but
the City encourages and assists property owners with annexations that comply with City and LAFCO polices. To
initiate the application, the applicant must file a request for a pre-application conference with the Policy Review
Committee. Property owners then apply for annexation and pay a City fee of $2,343 indexed annually. Local Agency
Formation Commission (LAFCO) and State fees are also required. An annexation agreement must be a part of the
                                                            6-28

application. The annexation agreement includes a development concept with a written description including maps,
diagrams and fiscal impact. A pre-zoning application must be filed simultaneous with the annexation request.
Annexations require public hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council.
After the City Council approves the annexation, the annexation request is then forwarded to LAFCO. The approximate
processing time is twenty to twenty six weeks.
Some dwelling units affordable to low income households are expected to become available through development of
duplexes on corners. Another method of providing some low income housing would be to encourage developers to
take advantage of the density bonus provisions in the Zoning Ordinance and disperse some low income dwellings in
their residential projects.

Manufactured Housing and Mobile Homes
Manufactured housing means a factory built dwelling unit designed specifically for placement on a permanent
foundation. Manufactured housing is permitted as a single-family residence in the residential zones, the agricultural
reserve zone and in a Planned Unit Development, when those units comply with City ordinances under the same
conditions as new construction. Manufactured housing is encouraged as a method of providing affordable housing.
Mobile homes are permitted in mobile homes parks and as temporary uses as caretaker mobile homes.

Small Lot and Zero Lot Line Developments
Ripon=s Zoning Ordinance permits affordable housing exceptions when they are included in a development agreement
or an affordable housing agreement. Single-family units can be constructed on interior lots and two family units can
be constructed on corner lots. Lots may be reduced to 3,500 square feet if the dwelling is one story in height. Zero lot
lines are permitted when two single-family units are constructed next to each other.
Subdivision Improvement and Development Standards
Ripon=s Subdivision Ordinance carries out the requirements of the State Subdivision Map Act. The Ordinance does
not, by itself, impose any unreasonable or extraordinary standards for development, but merely implements the
requirements of state law.
Ripon=s development standards for new residential development are meant to ensure compatibility between land uses
and to maintain the livability and safety of its neighborhoods. Development standards include parking standards,
building setback requirements, landscaping and fencing for multi-family housing, and construction for certain on site
improvements such as curbs, gutters, and sidewalks.
These standards are not a constraint to the development of housing because they are considered minimum standards
designed to protect the public health, ensure compatibility between adjacent land use, and to maintain and enhance the
livability of Ripon=s neighborhoods.
Building Codes and Enforcement
Building permits are issued for new construction and rehabilitation only after demonstrated compliance with Building
Code standards and adopted codes. In order to simplify conservation of existing housing stock in case of rehabilitated
buildings, only those portions of the building that are being reconstructed are required to be brought into conformity
with current standards. The remainders of those structures are only required to be brought into conformity with
minimum building code regulations. This makes it easier to rehabilitate and conserve housing stock, and to encourage
rehabilitation without imposing unreasonable restrictions.
Development Permit Process and Approval
The permit process in Ripon conforms to the State Planning Law. Permits are reviewed by Staff, and if required, by
the Planning Commission and City Council.
Pre-application conferences between a developer and City Staff are encouraged to identify and solve any issues or
problems and to identify conditions of approval. Pre-application conferences reduce public hearing time because
issues may be resolved and conditions of approval have been established.
Under current procedures the time required to process a general plan amendment, rezoning, or a tentative subdivision
map takes approximately 8 to 20 weeks for the review and public hearing process to be completed. Use permits and
tentative parcel maps take less time, 9 to 12 weeks, because only Planning Commission approval is required. When a
project requires multiple applications, the applications are processed concurrently to expedite the approval process.
Improvement of the development permit process will continue to be a primary aim of the City.
Development and Permit Fees
Homebuilders in the Ripon area have not shown that development fees charged by the City are unreasonable or
significantly affect their ability to produce housing. City fees represent 10% to 14% of the total cost of a new
                                                           6-30

dwelling unit in Ripon.
Construction fees are based on International Conference of Building Officials standards. A Public Facilities Finance
Plan (PFFP) fee of $35,186 (2006) is charged when a building permit is issued for a residential unit. Park fees of
$12,392 per dwelling unit are included in the above amount. School fees established by state law are paid directly to
the School District before issuance of a building permit. Fire fees are paid directly to the Fire District before issuance
of building permits.
The time required to process a project varies greatly from one project to another and is directly related to the size and
complexity of the proposal and the number of actions and approvals needed to complete the process. It should be
noted that each project does not necessarily have to complete each step in the process. Small-scale projects that are
consistent with the General Plan and zoning do not generally require general plan amendments, rezones, or variances.
If an environmental impact report is required for a project, it is processed along with the other required actions. Ripon
encourages the joint processing of related applications for a single project. As an example, a rezone application may
be reviewed concurrently with a general plan amendment, and tentative subdivision map. Time, money and effort are
saved for both the developer and the City. It is important to note that time lines cannot be shortened because it is
necessary to comply with State laws as they relate to public notice requirements and compliance with the California
Environmental Quality Act. (Refer to Table 6.28 for the various processing fees).

Infrastructure
Ripon provides public facilities and services for existing development. Developers are responsible for connection to
the existing system and construction of the infrastructure within their development. The following sections discuss
and summarize the infrastructure within the Planning Area. A more detailed discussion of public facilities and
services is included in the Land Use Element.

Water Service
Ripon has its own water system that provides water to all residents and businesses within the City. Several industries
and schools have wells on their own property for irrigation and industrial use. Ripon’s system consists of seven wells
and one 550,000 gallon storage tank and 1.5 million gallon elevated storage tank. Pumping capacity of the wells is
9,000 gallons per minute and with the current storage capable of an additional peak capacity flow rate in excess of
8,000 gallons per minute. The City is in process of developing two new water wells, and a new 2.5 million gallon
elevated storage tank is now being designed for 2004/2005 construction.
In addition to the domestic drinking water system, the City is now in the process of bringing online a non-potable
water (NPW) system. The dual water/non-potable water system is expected to be online in the summer of 2003. This
system will make use of older municipal wells that do not meet drinking water standards. This system will serve City
parks, commercial and industrial users of process water and irrigation water needs. The non-potable system is
expected to reduce loading on the drinking water system. Currently there are approximately 3,200 connections.
Is it anticipated that with the increased capacity the water system could serve a population of approximately 15,000
persons which is the City’s projected population for 2010.
Sewage Disposal System
Ripon provides domestic sewage disposal for all residents, businesses, and schools within the city. Industrial sewage
is also provided for all users except Fox River Paper which has its own facility. A combination of ponding, aeration
and land irrigation for industrial waters are methods employed for sewage disposal. Approximately eighty (80) acres
in the flood plain of the Stanislaus River has been isolated from the river by levees and separated into 2 and 5-acre
ponds. An additional 18-acre pond, not protected by levees, is used for industrial water disposal.
In 2002 the City completed a Waste Water Treatment Facility renovation and expansion, so the plant is now capable
of 2.5 million gallons per day. Current effluent flows are 1.2 million gallons per day.
User fees, sewer district taxes, and annexation hookup fees help offset costs for operation and expansion of sewer
facilities.
Storm Drainage System
Ripon has four (4) systems to dispose of storm water run off. Storm water from the older part of the City in the
industrial area west of State Route 99 flows into the industrial sewage lines. Another portion is pumped out into South
San Joaquin Irrigation District lines and canals. The largest portion of the storm drainage flows by gravity through
seven (7) outfall/discharge points into the Stanislaus River. A regional detention pond is included in the North Pointe
project north of State Route 99 and Jack Tone Road.
Solid Waste Disposal
Solid waste is collected from residences and schools by City staff using City owned equipment. After it is collected,
solid waste is transported to San Joaquin County=s Lovelace Transfer Station. Private operators collect Solid waste
from commercial and industrial users.
Schools
Schools for Ripon residents are provided by the Ripon Unified School District (public schools), Ripon Christian
Schools (private), Yosemite Junior College District, and the San Joaquin Community College District.

Non-Governmental Constraints
The extent to which residential construction occurs within a community is largely determined by the local, state and
national economic climate. Factors such as market conditions, interest rates, financing terms, and land cost may
impose non-governmental constraints to production of new housing.
Cost of Construction
The cost of construction is primarily dependent on the cost of labor and materials. Construction costs in Ripon are
comparable to costs throughout the Central Valley. Non union labor is typically used for residential construction and
there are no unusual costs with obtaining materials.
Construction costs in Ripon run approximately $200 per square foot. The source of this figure was a review of
Building Permit fees. Ripon uses the International Conference of Building Officials good standard for a basis of
building permit fees.
Cost of land is influenced by the cost of the raw land, the cost of holding the land during the development process, and
the cost of providing services to meet City standards for development. The cost of raw land is influenced by variables
such as scarcity, location, availability of public utilities, zoning, general plan designation, and unique features like
trees, water frontage, and adjoining uses. A finished lot with all improvements in place currently (summer 2002) has a
cost of approximately $80,000. In 1992, the San Joaquin County Community Development Department=s Housing
Element stated that the price of raw land in the Ripon area was $67,500 to $160,000 an acre.
Cost of Capital
There are two kinds of capital used in providing housing: capital used by developers for initial site preparation; and,
construction and capital used by the home buyer. The availability and price of both types affect the cost of housing.
Financing for developers is currently readily available but it is costly. Costs usually run 2% to 4% over the prime
interest rate. Mortgage rates fluctuate weekly and are now running about 7% for a fixed 30-year loan. Variable
mortgage loans are also common on the market and those rates vary with lenders and terms.
6.6      HOUSING REVIEW: PROGRESS REPORT
State Law requires each City to review its Housing Element to examine and evaluate the goals, policies, and programs.
The Planning and Economic Development Department performs these duties.
The City of Ripon adopted a Housing Element in 1998, and this is an evaluation of those goals and programs:
The evaluation of the City=s previously adopted Housing Element addresses these three issues: the effectiveness of the
previous element through actual results of goals, policies and objectives;
The progress implementation in what was planned versus what actually was adopted; and appropriateness of the
goals, policies and objectives incorporating what was learned from the previous Housing Element into the goals,
policies and programs of the current Element.
Ripon, in adopting its Housing Element in 1998, set realistic goals and policies. The program statements were set out
clearly and with time lines that could be easily addressed in a review.
While some of the goals were accomplished as a result of a specific action, several are ongoing efforts to provide
                                                             6-34
                                                                                                 Adopted September 19, 2006

Volume I – Chapter Six                                                                                 Housing
housing for all economic segments of the community.
One example of a goal which was dealt with by a specific action was one intended to address, and where appropriate
and legally possible, to remove governmental constraints in the maintenance, improvement and development of
housing. Subsequently, a Development Code was adopted by the City that permits smaller lot sizes, reduces non-
residential uses in the R-4, Multiple Family Residential District, and the R4-U, Multiple Family Residential Urban
District.
The City’s accomplishments under the programs adopted in the 1998 Housing Element are summarized in Table 6.29

GOAL A: IDENTIFY ADEQUATE SITES THAT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO HELP AND ENCOURAGE THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A VARIETY OF TYPES OF HOUSING FOR ALL INCOME LEVELS.
Policy A1: Provide an adequate supply of land at various densities to meet the housing demand of all income
segments of the community.
Accomplishment. Approximately 373 acres of land are within the City on which 1,059 dwelling units could be built.
The Below Market Rate Housing Program was adopted in 1999 to promote housing for lower income households.
Developer can enter into an affordable housing agreement to include 10% of the dwelling units to be made available to
lower income households. During the period between 1998 and the present, 500 acres have been annexed, of which
290 acres were for residential development.
Policy A2: Evaluate the potential for meeting some of the City’s housing needs through infill development.
Accomplishment. The Development Code was amended to include small lot and zero lot lines. The R1-U and R1-

The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, the H.O.M.E. program, and the owner occupied and
rental housing rehabilitation program are administered by the San Joaquin County Development Department for the
City of Ripon.
Housing Density Bonus
The purpose of a density bonus, according to the Government Code of California, is to provide for and regulate
concessions of incentives for the development of housing which would be made available to low income persons, very
low income persons, and senior citizens through density bonuses or other incentives of equal financial value.
The Housing Density Bonus section of Ripon=s Development Code entitles a developer to a twenty-five percent
density
bonus over the housing unit density allowed on the site by existing zoning and General Plan designation when a
developer agrees to construct a housing development with one or more of the following types of affordable housing:
Twenty percent (20%) of the units for low income persons, Ten percent (10%) of the units for very low income
persons, Fifty percent (50%) of the units for senior citizens.
If the developer has shown economic necessity, the City will grant an additional incentive. The additional incentive
                                                           6-37

may be a reduction in site development standards, modification of Zoning Code requirements, or reduction of design
requirements that exceed minimum building standards.
Affordable Housing Exception
The affordable Housing Exception permits one family dwelling on an interior lot or any two family dwelling on a
corner lot be built on lots less than the district minimum if they are one story. Lot size may be 3,500 square feet in the
R1 and R1-UC districts and to 4,000 square feet in the R1-A, R1-C and R1-U districts.
Ripon Redevelopment Agency
The Redevelopment Agency of The City of Ripon is the tax collecting body. Part of these funds is then used to
rehabilitate and provide housing for persons with very low, low, and moderate incomes. These funds are used with
CDBG and H.O.M.E. monies.
Ripon=s Redevelopment Agency was established in 1982 to provide a mechanism to eliminate blight conditions in the
City. The Agency has allocated and spent more than $8.0 million dollars on various projects. Of this total,
$1,250,000 was allocated to the housing rehabilitation program.
The Redevelopment Agency recently sold bonds and $1,000,000 is designated for funding affordable housing
The Agency=s Five-Year Implementation Plan includes programs for implementation of affordable housing and a
housing production plan. An Affordable Housing Committee was formed to monitor the programs in the CHAS and
assist project proponents in identifying funding sources and potential project sites. San Joaquin County Community
Development Department=s Neighborhood Preservation Division administers the City=s rehabilitation programs for
homeowners using CDBG, H.O.M.E. and Redevelopment Agency funds.
The Housing Production Plan (AB 315 Plan) contains estimates of total new and rehabilitated units by year, and
describes programs for meeting those estimates. San Joaquin County Council of Governments Regional Housing
Needs Allocation, 2001-08, shows Ripon=s Fair Share 1,208 housing units needed from 2001 and ending on 2008.
Housing construction in Ripon has met the City=s fair share, however, Table 6.29 indicates the number of housing
units constructed for very low and low income groups did not meet the City=s fair share. Measures to reduce this
deficit are discussed in the Housing Programs.
Housing Authority of the County of San Joaquin
The Housing Authority provides very low income households with a monthly rental subsidy so they can afford
privately owned and operated housing in Ripon. The Housing Authority expects to continue to give households
Section 8 rental subsidies in future years.
Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG)
CDBG is a Federal block grant intended to develop viable urban communities by providing decent housing and a
suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities to persons of low and moderate income.

H.O.M.E. (Renter and Owner)
H.O.M.E. is a Federal housing program block grant intended to expand the supply of affordable housing. Eligible
activities include moderate rehabilitation, substantial rehabilitation, new construction, site improvements, acquisition,
tenant-based rental assistance, financing costs and relocation benefits. Funds may be used as loans or grants, interest
rate and subsidies, equity or other methods approved by HUD (Housing and Urban Development).
For rental housing, at least 90% of the funds must be used for units that serve households at or below 60% of the area
median income. For home ownership programs, 100% of the funds must be used for units that serve households at or
below 80% of the area median income.
The GAP Program
The AGAP@ Program, funded by Ripon Redevelopment Agency funds, helps first-time home buyers. The program
targets very low, low and moderate income households. The loans are intended to fill the GAP between the cost of a
home and how much the household can afford. Funds are limited and are awarded on a first come first served basis.
The program began January 1, 1995 with $200,000 in funding. Since that time over $1.8 million has been allocated to
the program which funded a total of 85 loans, and as of January 1, 2006, 48 were still outstanding.

7.3      ECONOMIC HISTORY
Since it’s founding in 1875, Ripon’s economic base has been based on farming and agriculturally related businesses.
The Ripon area is important for growing almonds because of its sandy soils. Known as California’s Almond Capital,
the nut has been the mainstay of the economy for many years. While almonds dominate, other crops such as grapes,
walnuts, peaches, olives, eggs, poultry, and milk are produced in the area.
Manufacturing and Processing Businesses
Ripon area farming operations attracted agriculturally associated manufacturing and processing businesses such as
                                                   7-2

Volume I – Chapter Seven                                                                 Economic Development
Nulaid Eggs, DenDulk Poultry, Golden West Nuts, NuCal Foods, Ripon Milling, and Franzia Winery.
Farm equipment manufacturers and agriculture chemical producers located here to supply area farmers. Ripon Farm
Service, Jack Rabbit Industries, and Ripon Manufacturing were founded to supply the agricultural community.
Trucking firms such as Aartman Trucking and Wever Trucking were established to transport agricultural products to
market.
Diversified Industry Base
Over the past 50 years, Ripon’s industrial base has diversified. Besides the agriculturally related businesses, a variety
of other types of industry such as paper, steel fabrication, motorist services, and non-agricultural transportation have
been established. Firms like Fox River Paper Company, Guntert Steel, Jimco Truck Stop, Flying J and Love’s Travel
Plaza, David Hall Masonry and Silverado Inc. are all examples of this diversity.
Ripon has become recognized for being a strategic location for regionally related industries. The State of California
constructed a regional crime lab in the community to serve a six-county area.
Tax Revenue Base
Traditionally, Ripon has had only enough retail and service businesses to serve local customers. As a small farming
community, the needs of the residents were typically met by small, locally owned businesses that sell groceries,
sporting goods, hardware, dry cleaning, barber and beauty shops, insurance, and real estate. While this was adequate
once, it is no longer the case.
As the community has grown, so has the need for more affordable and diverse goods and services. This increase has
now reached a level, which local businesses cannot supply, thereby forcing residents to shop ‘down the road’,
resulting in a significant loss of sales tax revenue for large and specialty items like autos, appliances, and home
furnishings. This loss has the likelihood of creating a very serious problem for our residents because residential
development requires more services than all the revenues it generates through property taxes. Without increased funds
it will become more difficult to maintain Ripon’s current high service levels.
7.4      COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN
The City Council has adopted, an Economic Development Plan. The purpose of the Plan is to identify the economic
development strategy for the community, detailing efforts for the overall development of service, retail, industrial, and
special category businesses. The overall goals of the Plan are; to create a balance between jobs and households; and to
provide for the generation of at least $650 per capita in total tax.
A Business Retention and Expansion Program developing programs and policies that promote a diversified stable
local economy are included in the Plan. A successful Program serves a variety of local economic development needs.
It supports existing businesses through identifying and solving immediate problems that hinder their vitality. It also
provides access to a variety of public services - training, financing, infrastructure - which can promote the long term
success of the business community.
The Plan contains methods to encourage retail, commercial and manufacturing development. Goals, policies and
action programs are designed to accomplish the task without sacrificing Ripon’s small town character.
Small businesses are vital contributors to Ripon’s economy. A Small Business Assistance Program is included in the
Plan to help resolve some problems small businesses experience regarding starting and expansion.
While the City has made significant strides to simplify its development and permitting procedure, an efficient and

VOLUME I - CHAPTER EIGHT
IMPLEMENTATION
8.1      INTRODUCTION
Chapter Eight, General Plan Implementation, presents a variety of tools available to the City to put into action the
“vision for the future” set forth in the Plan. The General Plan can be successful only if the vision for physical
development is realistic and can be carried out. The City carries out the General Plan through the review of
privately initiated development requests such as subdivisions, rezoning, conditional use permits and building
permits. In addition, the City undertakes public development through redevelopment and construction of the
infrastructure. Finally, the City considers a variety of administrative and financial tools that encourage public and
private development. This chapter presents the tools to guide development in the City by implementing the
policies contained in earlier chapters.
 8.2     SPHERE OF INFLUENCE
The sphere of influence is a plan for the probable physical boundaries and service area of a City. A sphere of
influence is adopted by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) according to State Government
Code. Following adoption of the Ripon General Plan Update, Ripon’s Sphere of Influence should be expanded to
include the boundaries shown on the Land Use Diagram. In this way, land use policy direction would be
provided for all of the land within the Sphere of Influence.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of the Sphere of Influence
San Joaquin County LAFCO uses Ripon’s Sphere of Influence as a guide for approving annexations to the City.
In determining spheres of influence, the LAFCO must consider and make written findings on the present and
possible service capabilities of the City; its range of services; projected future population growth; type of
development occurring in or planned for the area; present and probable future service demands of the area;
adequacy of existing services and who provides them; social and economic interdependence and interaction
between the City and the area surrounding it; and the effect on agricultural preserves.
8.3      ANNEXATIONS
Annexations, known technically as reorganizations, are the inclusion, attachment, or addition of territory to a
City. Annexations to Ripon are reviewed by the San Joaquin County Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO).
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of an Annexation
LAFCO is required to consider certain factors such as: population; population density; land area and land use;
assessed valuations; natural conditions; proximity to other populated areas; projected growth of the area; needs;
cost; and adequacy of government services. LAFCO is also required to consider the effect that a proposed
annexation will have on: adjacent areas and local government structure within the county; conformity with
adopted LAFCO policies on orderly development; agricultural preserves and open space uses; boundary lines;
conformity with city and county general and specific plans; and the sphere of influence.

8.4      ZONING
Ripon’s Zoning Ordinance is Title 16 of the City’s Municipal Code. The purpose of zoning is to regulate the use
of buildings, structures, and land for industry, business, residence, open spaces including agriculture, recreation,
enjoyment of scenic beauty, use of natural resources, and other purposes.
Implementation Device Governing the Submission and Approval of Zoning
Title 16 of Ripon’s Municipal Code regulates the submission and approval of Zoning, which must be adopted by
ordinance. At least one public hearing before the Planning Commission and City Council is required before
adoption by the City Council.
Development Code
The development code (Title 16) combines the provisions commonly found in separate zoning and subdivision
ordinances.
8.5      MISCELLANEOUS LAND USE PERMITS
The City processes a variety of permits that help development. Examples include, but are not limited to, the
following: conditional use permits, variances, and building permits.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of Miscellaneous Land Use Permits
Procedures governing the approval of miscellaneous land use permits are found in the Ripon Municipal Code.
Conditional Use Permits and variances require public hearings before the Planning Commission. Building
Permits are reviewed by Staff for compliance with the Uniform Building Codes and Title 16 of the Ripon
Municipal Code.
8.6      SUBDIVISION
Subdivision is the process used to divide raw land for subsequent development. The procedure is governed by the
State Subdivision Map Act and Title 16 of the Ripon Municipal Code. The Codes distinguish between major
(five or more parcels) and minor (four or fewer parcels) subdivisions. Major subdivisions require a tentative and
final map, while minor subdivisions require a parcel map.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of a Subdivision
A subdivision map can be conditionally approved by the City Council providing the Council finds the proposed
subdivision, with its design and improvements, is consistent with the Ripon General Plan and the Ripon
Municipal Code.
8.7      ANNEXATION AGREEMENTS
Annexation Agreements are contracts between the City and owners of property proposed for annexation. An
annexation agreement may be combined with a development agreement.

Volume I - Chapter Eight                                                                            Implementation
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of Annexation Agreements
Title 16 of the Ripon Municipal Code authorizes annexation agreements. The agreement may include conditions,
terms, restrictions, requirements and phasing for the annexation.
8.8      DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
Development Agreements are contracts that give private developers assurance that the necessary permits will be
issued despite changes in regulations, and the City with assurances of the adequacy of the development and
completion of the project.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of Development Agreements
State Government Code and Ripon Municipal Code specify minimum contents of development agreements.
Some contents of the agreements are duration of the agreement, the permitted uses of the property, density and
intensity of the use, maximum size and height of the proposed buildings, and dedication of land for public
purposes. The agreement may also include conditions, terms, restrictions, and requirements for subsequent
approvals.
8.9      PROJECT FISCAL ANALYSIS REPORTS
A project fiscal analysis report is required to show the fiscal impact a project will have on the existing City and its
residents. These studies are to identify service costs, project revenues, and mitigation measures. The report is
professionally prepared at the developers expense.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of Fiscal Analysis Reports
The city will determine a threshold project size above which a fiscal impact analysis is required and set fiscal
standards that must be met by the project. Fiscal analysis reports are submitted with a project application so they
can be considered during the environmental and project reviews at the public hearings.
8.10 REDEVELOPMENT PLAN
California Community Redevelopment Act of 1945 gives cities the authority to establish redevelopment agencies
and gives these agencies the authority to attack problems of urban decay. To remedy these problems, agencies are
given certain fundamental tools such as the authority to buy and sell real property, negotiate with property
owners, the authority to impose land use and development controls according to a comprehensive plan for
redevelopment.
An amendment to the Redevelopment Plan added territory to the existing project being considered by the City.
The largest portion of the added territory is in the northern part of the City, but areas in the southern and eastern
parts of the City are involved. Some unincorporated areas are part of the plan. A preliminary list of proposed
public works, housing and economic development projects and programs are included in the Plan.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of a Redevelopment Plan
Ripon City Council members also serve as the Board of the Redevelopment Agency and have the authority to
conduct public hearings on redevelopment plans and matters. Ripon’s Redevelopment Agency was established in
1982 to provide a mechanism to eliminate blight conditions in the City and thus ensure the City’s economic base

                                                                                                Adopted September 19, 2006

Volume I - Chapter Eight                                                                           Implementation
would grow and remain healthy through the provision of new public improvements, commercial development,
and affordable housing.
8.11 HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE ELEMENT
The State Public Resources Code requires the City to adopt a Household Hazardous Waste Element, which
identifies a program for safe collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous wastes generated by
households in the City. Wastes identified should be separated from the solid waste stream.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of Household Hazardous Waste Element
Ripon is the lead agency responsible for handling clean up procedures. The City has sponsored a member of the
Ripon Consolidated Fire District to participate in the Joint County Hazardous Materials Response Team.
8.12 SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING ELEMENT
The State Public Resources Code requires the City to adopt a Source Reduction and Recycling Element to show
the methods by which the City will reduce the amount of solid waste disposed of by the City.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of the Source Reduction and Recycling
Element
The City of Ripon has adopted a Source Reduction and Recycling Element to meet the State Public Resources
Code. The Code requires the element to consider recycling, waste characterization, source reduction, composting,
solid waste facility capacity, education and public information, funding, and special waste.
8.13 WASTEWATER MASTER PLAN
The City developed a Wastewater Master Plan to construct, operate and maintain various wastewater facilities. In
developing the Plan, consideration is given to rehabilitation of existing facilities, expansion of current excess
demand and the timely expansion for future demand. As the City’s population increases, the City updates the
Wastewater Master Plan as appropriate to address the sewage collection and treatment needs anticipated in the
General Plan.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of Wastewater Master Plan
Ripon’s Wastewater Master Plan was last revised in 2003. The Plan encompasses the entire Ripon General Plan
area.
8.14 WATER MASTER PLAN
The City developed a Water Master Plan to construct, operate and maintain various water facilities to provide
water to Ripon residents, businesses and industries.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of Water Master Plan
A Water Master Plan was prepared for Ripon, and last revised in 2003 to include areas in the 2040 Ripon General
Plan.
                                                          8-4

Volume I - Chapter Eight                                                                             Implementation
8.15 STORM WATER FACILITIES PLAN
Storm water drainage facilities may be constructed, operated, maintained and replaced in a way that will provide
the best possible service to the public, given the financial abilities and constraints of the City.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of Storm Water Master Plan
A Storm Drain Study Master Plan was prepared for Ripon, and last updated in 2003 for the areas included in the
Ripon General Plan 2040.
8.16 PUBLIC FACILITIES FINANCING PLAN
Several options are available to cities to finance public facilities such as streets, water, sewer, storm drainage,
schools, parks, Fire and Police stations, and public utilities.
Implementation Device Governing Submission and Approval of Public Facilities Financing Plan
A Public Facilities Financing Plan was adopted for the City of Ripon.
8.17 CONDUCT A HISTORICAL SURVEY
The City conducted a Historical Survey to identify historical sites, buildings and structures.
Implementation Device to Conduct a Historical Survey
City Council should consider appointing a committee to identify historical sites, buildings and structures and to
prepare a report. The committee should determine whether a historical preservation district should be added to
the Zoning Ordinance.
8.18 SPECIFIC PLANS
The City should consider requiring the preparation of specific plans for the systematic implementation of the
general plan for development of those properties of one (1) acre or less and fifty (50) acres or more in size, and
development consistent with such plans.
Implementation Device for Preparation of Specific Plans and Subsequent Development of Affected
Properties
The City should prepare development guidelines for each of the Planning districts for those properties which
would require the preparation of a Specific Plan.
8.19 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS (PUD)
The City should consider requiring a Planned Unit Development (PUD) permit for any development project either
requesting or necessitating a special consideration of the density, intensity, or other zoning provisions (i.e., lot
dimensions, setbacks, structure heights, etc.).

Implementation Device for Development as a Planned Unit Development (PUD)
The City should prepare development guidelines for the types of projects which would require a PUD permit.
8.20 NEIGHBORHOOD PRESERVATION
Neighborhood Preservation is a combination of code enforcement and rehabilitation. Rehabilitation conserves
structures, and code enforcement both saves buildings and is used to remove unwanted materials.
Implementation Devices to Continue Neighborhood Preservation.
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding is an important source for housing rehabilitation. The
City will continue to work with San Joaquin County to obtain these funds. Code enforcement will remain a
priority with Staff.

Response to comment letter from Governors office of Planning and Research, State
Clearinghouse and Planning Unit, February 10, 2006.
Response 1A: This letter acknowledges the circulation of the Draft EIR and the Ripon
General Plan Update 2040 to state agencies for review pursuant to CEQA. The letter also
transmits comments received by the SCH from state agencies to the City. No response is
required.


Responses to comment letter from California Department of Conservation, Division of
Land Resource Protection, February 9, 2006.
Response 2A: This comment introduces the agency’s roles and responsibilities in
agricultural land conservation, and introduces its comments on the Draft EIR. No response
is necessary.
Response 2B: This comment restates and characterizes information provided in the Draft
EIR. No response is necessary.
Response 2C: This comment suggests that the City institute a program for mitigation of
agricultural land conversion, specifically the purchase of agricultural conservation
easements. The City currently has no such program in place. However, City staff will
recommend that the City Council adopt Agricultural Land Mitigation Fund in conjunction
with the adoption of the Ripon General Plan Update 2040. Adoption of the fund will
involve the imposition of an agricultural impact fee on new development amounting to
$4,500 per acre, to be collected at the time of building permit issuance. The purpose of the
fee will be to mitigate the loss of agricultural land resulting from urban development.
Among other things, the fees will be used to leverage other funds for the acquisition of land
and or the execution of conservation easements. The EIR has been amended to reflect this
proposal.
The City of Ripon appreciates the Department of Conservation’s input on other potential
agricultural land mitigation systems. This information will be considered by City decision
makers as the General Plan Update 2040 proceeds through the review and process.
Response 2D: The General Plan and Draft EIR discussion of Williamson Act contracts is
not a reflection of City, County or other policies but rather the requirements of the
California Government Code, which governed Williamson Act contract administration and
cancellation. The City of Ripon expects that Williamson Act contracts affecting certain
lands proposed for annexation will have either expired by non-renewal or will be
considered by the City Council for immediate cancellation, subject to the applicable
Government Code requirements.
The Ripon Planning Area does/not include lands that are under contract in Farmland
Security Zones. This information has been added to the EIR.
This comment provides additional information as to the City’s obligation to succeed to
Williamson Act contracts that were executed in the County, unless the provisions of
Government Code Section 51243.25 apply. The City is aware of its obligations pursuant to
the Government Code and would intend to abide by all relevant requirements with respect
to Williamson Act contract cancellation.




Response to comment letter from California Department of Transportation, February 8,
2006.
Response 3A: This comment notes that the project may involve a significant effect on state
facilities and requests the collection of fair share fees for improvement of those facilities.
The City of Ripon collects local (i.e. Ripon) Public Facilities Fees as well as Regional
Transportation Impact Fees (RTIF) to cover the local share cost of transportation
improvements necessitated by new urban development. In addition, the City of Ripon
supports the concept of the collection of additional sales tax revenues to support major
transportation improvements.
In addition to local transportation improvements, the various impact fees are directed to
necessary improvements of state highway interchanges, such as the planned Austin Road
and Olive/River Road interchanges with SR 99. Some impact fee money may also be use
to make up the local match to state and federal funding for state highway main line
improvements. However, these improvements are funded by other revenue sources
including gas taxes.
The City of Ripon contributes to reductions in potential future traffic on state highway
facilities through its various land use planning and transportation improvement programs,
including the construction of parallel facilities to provide local road alternatives to state
highway use.
Response 3B: This comment recommends balance in housing and employment as a part
of the City Planning Program. The Ripon General Plan Update 2040 incorporates this
concept already.
Response 3C: This comment is a general planning recommendation that promotes the
incorporation of non-auto transportation routes and associated recreational values in urban
planning. The Ripon General Plan Update 2040 makes substantial provision for the
development of bikeways, pedestrian paths, and green ways. The purpose of these facilities
is to support non-auto transportation; the concepts of continuity and connectivity are
extensively incorporated in the proposed plan.
Response 3D: This comment is also a general transportation planning recommendation
promoting interconnected streets and alternative transportation routes, including routes
that parallel state highways. These concepts are incorporated in the Circulation Element of
the Ripon General Plan Update 2040. See previous responses.
Response 3E: This general planning recommendation again promotes the incorporation of
non-auto transportation modes in transportation planning. The City has made substantial
provision for pedestrian and bicycle facilities, including the adoption of a bikeways master
plan. Provisions for future transit stops are incorporated into major commercial
development, among other things.
Response 3F: This comment restates the probability that SR 99 will need to be widened to
eight lanes as a result of local and regional growth. The Draft EIR identifies the potential
impacts of urban development in the City of Ripon on this future need. The City routinely
requires the reservation of right-of-way that would support necessary highway expansion in
conjunction with urban development in the vicinity of SR 99. The City has incorporated
infrastructure to support future ramp metering and other improvements in its recent
expansion of the SR 99 Jack Tone interchange; the City anticipates that similar provisions
will be made in conjunction with future interchange improvements.
Response 3G: The City of Ripon recognizes the need to coordinate with Cal Trans with
respect to park-and-ride lots. This has been the practice of the City in conjunction with
large projects in the SR 99 vicinity, including the SR 99/Jack Tone Road interchange
improvements.
Response 3H: This comment suggests the preparation of traffic impact studies in
conjunction with new development. This is a routine matter in the City of Ripon; traffic
studies are required for major projects, and these studies are required to address freeway
interchanges as well as local roads.
Response 3I: This comment identifies the agency’s maintenance and responsibilities for
the state highway system. The City of Ripon recognizes the need to coordinate with Cal
Trans on any project that would affect state facilities.
Response 3J: This comment identifies state highway encroachment permit requirements.
The City is familiar with these requirements and would coordinate with Cal Trans and
obtain any necessary permits together with any required environmental review, in
conjunction with projects involving state highway encroachments.


Response to comment letter from California Department of Water Resources, January 30,
2006.
Response 4A: This comment provides information regarding the State Reclamation Board’s
permit requirements for projects that encroach on rivers, creeks or other channels subject
to Reclamation Board jurisdiction. There are no such projects identified in the Ripon
General Plan Update 2040. However, the City of Ripon acknowledges the need for
Reclamation Board approval for any projects that may, in the future, be located within
their jurisdiction. No further response is required.



Response to comment letter from Department of the Army, US Army Corps of Engineers,
January 17, 2006.
Response 5A: This comment identifies the Corps’ jurisdiction over waters of the United
States and wetlands, and the permit requirements associated with potential work affecting
those resources. Due to the very porous nature of soils in the Ripon vicinity, wetland
resources are relatively limited. However, projects that would potentially impact wetlands
would be subject to the permit requirements identified by the Corps. The potential need for
Corps permits has been added to the EIR.
Response 5B: The proposed General Plan Update 2040 does not include development
plans that would involve potentially significant impacts on wetlands; therefore alternatives
that would avoid wetlands are not warranted. The remainder of this comment addresses
procedures for wetland delineation and permits for fill or disturbance of wetlands. These
would be applicable to any projects within the planning area that have the potential for
wetland impact. These requirements would be applicable to a future bridge crossing of the
Stanislaus River; however, as noted in Response 5A, few other if any other such projects
would be anticipated within the planning area.






Response to comment letter from San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District,
January 12, 2006.
Response 6A: This comment affirms the Draft EIR’s finding that the project may involve a
significant air quality impact and affirms that EIR mitigation measures would be
implemented. The City of Ripon will adopt a mitigation monitoring implementation plan in
conjunction with General Plan approval; this will provide for implementation of all
applicable mitigation measures.
Response 6B: This is a specific recommendation that the city adopt an ordinance limiting
the insulation of fireplaces or wood burning stoves in new residential development. The
City routinely refers developers to the APCD for input and advice on the implementation of
its recommendation. Existing APCD regulations currently limit the number of wood
burning appliances that may be installed. The City believes that, if the prohibition of wood
burning appliances is an air quality priority, a rule prohibiting such appliances should be
adopted by the District.
Response 6C: This comment identifies the various adopted APCD regulations that would
potentially apply to new development within the City of Ripon. Developers, contractors,
and other entities are responsible for compliance with these rules and regulations. The EIR
has been amended to note these requirements. No further response is necessary.
Response 6D: This comment provides the input as to potential measures to reduce energy
use and associated air emission. The City of Ripon supports the incorporation of all
available mitigation measures in new development. New development projects are
routinely conditioned to comply with APCD recommendations wherever possible.
Developers are directed to coordinate with APCD staff to develop project-specific
mitigation agreements.
Response 6E: As documented in the General Plan, limited transit service is available to the
City of Ripon. The City requires the incorporation of transit-supporting facilities in major
retail development, which encourages broader use of the transit system. The City will
continue to participate in the annual “unmet transit needs” process and to promote the
expansion and development of the local transit system wherever feasible.
Response 6F: This is a general recommendation regarding minimizing the expansion of
paved surfaces within the City. See Response 6D.
Response 6G: This is a recommendation for incorporation of sidewalks and bikeways in
new development as noted in the response to Cal Trans, response 3C and 3E, the City of
Ripon makes substantial requirements for the incorporation of these facilities. These
requirements include the installation of 10-12 foot class one bikeways on all arterial
streets. In addition, the City has adopted a master bikeway plan.
Response 6H: See Response 6D.
Response 6I: See Response 6D.
Response 6J: See Response 6D.

Response 6K: The Draft EIR acknowledges the APCD’s Regulation VIII, which provides for
dust control during construction. The APCD”s Guide to the Analysis and Mitigation of Air
Quality Impacts indicates that conformant with Regulation VIII requirements will reduce
construction air quality impacts to less than significant.
Response 6L: The City of Ripon does not maintain substantial numbers of construction
equipment. However, the City is making substantial strides toward incorporation of clean
air vehicle in its fleet. The City has constructed a compressed natural gas (CNG) filling
station for public vehicles that currently include garbage trucks. Other vehicles in the fleet
will be converted to CNG as opportunities warrant. The City fleet also includes several all-
electric vehicles. In addition, the City is currently constructing a major expansion of the
City Hall facility; this facility will include a solar photovoltaic system. The City is also
exploring the use of photovoltaic and other energy conservation technologies at City
installations. In addition, the City is constructing a public-accessible CNG station that will
promote the public use of clean-air vehicles.
Response 6M: The City supports the use of idle reduction technology’s and has promoted
the installation of such equipment at the two large travel plazas located at the SR99/Jack
Tone Road interchange.
Note: Since the submittal of this comment letter, APCD Rule 9510, the Indirect Source
Rule, has become effective. Like other APCD rules, Rule 9510 will be applicable to the
future urban development within the City of Ripon.



Response to comment letter from Modesto Irrigation District, February 6, 2006.
Response 7A: This comment identifies the existence of MID electrical facilities is the City
of Ripon and establishes the District’s regulations and requirements for connecting to the
MID system as well as utility easement requirements for new development. These are
routine matters that are considered by the City in the review of all new development
projects. These projects are routinely referred to MID for comment.



Response to comment letter from San Joaquin County Public Works Department,
February 8, 2006.
Response 8A: This is a comment on the Circulation Element of the Ripon General Plan
Update 2040, rather than a comment on the EIR. No response is necessary. However,
rather than being a Minor Collector as suggested by the County, Colony Road is actually
classified as a “Minor Arterial,” which is a higher classification.
Response 8B: This is a comment on the Circulation Element of the General Plan, rather
than the EIR. No response is necessary. The roadway system proposed by the Circulation
Element is intended to improve east-west circulation in the subject area; the intent of the
Ripon General Plan Update 2040 is to discourage north-south movement along Manley
Road.
Response 8C: As with the previous comments, this comment addresses the Circulation
Element of the Ripon General Plan Update 2040, rather than the EIR. No response is
necessary. The County’s suggestion is appreciated; however, the City wishes to maintain its
current description of planned circulation improvements.
Response 8D: For the most part, planned circulation improvements identified in the Ripon
General Plan Update 2040 would be improvements to existing or future City streets; as the
City limits are expanded with planned new urban development, sections of existing County
road would be annexed into the City in conjunction with the adjoining development
properties. As a result, provisions of the San Joaquin County General Plan would no longer
be relevant for these street sections.
The Ripon General Plan Update 2040 envisions the improvement of River Road, including
sections outside the City limit, as a regional arterial. This roadway section is not identified
as a major road by the County, and this proposal is inconsistent with the existing County
Ripon General Plan Update 2040 designation. River Road is, however, a major
transportation route in the Ripon vicinity, and this two-lane facility is currently
accommodating heavy traffic loads. River Road will need to be improved; expansion of
this roadway to a major four-lane facility has been discussed in detail with the County
Department of Public Works.
This and all other projects that involve County roads would be coordinated with
Department of Public Works staff. An example of this is existing City-County cooperation
with regard to the Olive Road-Austin Road feasibility study; interagency coordination on
this project also includes the San Joaquin County Council of Governments and the City of
Manteca.
Response 8E: The traffic impact analysis included in the EIR was based on a model
developed specifically for the City of Ripon by TYLIN Transportation Engineering. The
traffic model was based on the San Joaquin County COG Model. DETAILS REGARDING
METHODOLOGY WHEN AVAILABLE. A copy of the modeling report is available for
review at the City offices.

Response 8F: As noted in Response 8D, the City is working closely with the City of
Manteca, San Joaquin County, the San Joaquin County COG and Cal Trans on plans for the
future interchange. CITY ADD DETAILS? IS CITY PREPARING PSR?
Response 8G: The planned interchange would be designed to accommodate projected
future traffic. Construction of the improvement would follow preparation of a Project Study
Report, project engineering and environmental review. Each state of review would include
consideration of future traffic loading at this location.
Response 8H: This is a typographical error that will be corrected in the final document.
The City has no plans for additional improvement to the Jack Tone Road interchange.
Response 8I: The future Olive Avenue bridge is expected to involve a multi-agency effort,
including the City, San Joaquin County, Stanislaus County, and the US Army Corp of
Engineers, among others. As plans for this project mature, it is anticipated that one or more
interagency agreements will be required.
Response 8J: See Responses 8D and 8F.
Response 8K: The final General Plan Update 2040 documents and EIR will reference
improvements at this location as “intersection control,” noting that alternatives for
intersection control will be evaluated as plans for this intersection are developed. The use
of a roundabout would constitute one potential option for intersection control at this
location.



Response to Comment letter from Ripon Consolidated Fire District, January 14, 2006.
Response 9A: The comment letter from the Ripon Consolidated Fire District consists of
three policy recommendation applicable to the proposed Ripon General Plan Update
2040. These are not comments on the EIR and do not require a response. However, these
comments have been considered by the City of Ripon. CITY DISCUSS DISPOSITION OF
THESE COMMENTS?





Responses to comment letter from Ripon Unified School District, February 3, 2006.
General Response: Several of the comments submitted by the Ripon Unified School
District mis-characterize the EIR as a study of a specific development project rather than a
general plan. This reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of a general plan EIR, and more
broadly a program-level environmental analysis is under the California Environmental
Quality Act. The referenced comments are identified in more detail below.
CEQA defines (CEQA Guidelines Section 15161) a project EIR as “the most common type
of EIR (that) examines the environmental impacts of a specific development project.” In a
project-level EIR, the EIR must examine all elements of the project in detail and provide
project-specific analysis of impacts, mitigation measures and alternatives.
The CEQA Guidelines address the preparation of general plan EIRs, indicating that these
documents require a lesser level of detail due to their programmatic nature. The EIR
requirement for a general plan may actually be satisfied by the general plan itself, if the
general plan addresses all of the points required to be included in an EIR. A general plan
EIR may also be prepared as a Program EIR (CEQA Guidelines Section 15168), which
allows the City to provide a broader analysis of the environmental impacts associated with
the range of development activities that would be generally authorized by the General
Plan.
In either case, the required scope of an EIR is guided by CEQA’s general rule related to
“degree of specificity” (CEQA Guidelines Section 15146). The degree of specificity of an
EIR must correspond to the degree of specificity of the activity addressed in the EIR. This
section specifically addresses the adoption or amendment of a local general plan. Section
15146 (b) states that such an EIR “should focus on the secondary effects that can be
expected to follow from the adoption or amendment, but the EIR need not be as detailed as
an EIR on the specific construction projects that might follow.”
The Ripon General Plan EIR has been prepared in accordance with the above-described
requirements. Consequently, the EIR does not address potential environmental impacts
and mitigation measures at the project level but rather provides a general programmatic
description of these impacts, consistent with CEQA requirements. Similarly, the mitigation
measures identified in the EIR are general in nature and consist of General Plan policies
that will apply broadly to future development projects.
The comment letter includes comments on numerous specific issues and provides specific
recommendations regarding mitigation measures that may be appropriate to future
development projects. These comments will be considered by the City in its consideration
of the Ripon General Plan Update 2040 as well as future development projects.
Response 10A: See General Response.
Response 10B: The Ripon Planning Commission and City Council will each consider and
ultimately certify the Final EIR on the Ripon General Plan Update 2040, after public
hearings before each body. The initial Planning Commission meeting is scheduled for late
May 2006. The initial City Council meeting is scheduled for June 2006.

Response 10C: See General Response. Urban development envisioned by the Ripon
General Plan Update 2040 would include the extension of urban utilities, including
electrical, gas, sewer, water and storm drain pipelines. The Ripon General Plan Update
2040 proposes no other specific projects other than the types of development that could
occur in accordance with the plan’s land use designations. The City is not aware of any
element of the Ripon General Plan Update 2040 that would involve a conflict for the
RUSD under Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations.
Response 10D: All documents referenced in the EIR are available for review at Ripon City
Hall, 259 North Wilma Avenue, Ripon, CA. The proposed Ripon General Plan Update
2040 is based upon the most recent version of the Ripon General Plan and EIR, which
were last certified and adopted by the Ripon City Council in 1998. The current Ripon
General Plan Update 2040 and EIR are the result of recent additional study and analysis.
Any information carried forward from the previous general plan and EIR has been subject
to detailed re-evaluation.
Response 10E: See General Response. The Ripon General Plan Update 2040 makes no
specific proposal for any land use that would involve hazardous air emissions in the
vicinity of school sites, or any facility described by Public Resources Code Section
21151.4.
Response 10F: See General Response. The referenced air quality policies would apply to
future development projects in conjunction with other applicable air quality rules and
regulations.
Response 10G: See General Response. The proposed policy measures are appropriate
mitigation measures in the programmatic general plan EIR context.
Response 10H: See General Response. The City agrees that land development occurring in
the context of the Ripon General Plan Update 2040 may involve localized air quality
impacts. These potential impacts would be considered on a project-specific basis in
conjunction with future CEQA environmental review, or these impacts would be addressed
via existing or future Air Pollution Control District regulations. The San Joaquin Valley
APCD’s existing Regulation VIII addresses the potential air quality impacts of grading and
construction; these potential effects, and the applicability of APCD regulations, were
addressed in the Ripon General Plan Update 2040 and EIR.
Response 10I: This comment raises a general concern, which is addressed by both City and
future development project conformance with applicable particulate matter emission
controls. Control of these emissions is within the purview of the San Joaquin Valley APCD.
Response 10J: See General Response. This comment raises issues related to a City proposal
to extend a roadway known as the South Frontage Road along the southwest edge of SR 99
in the vicinity of the existing Ripon High School campus. The General Plan EIR makes no
specific proposal with respect to the project, and its potential impacts are not addressed in
detail in the EIR. The City of Ripon has, in the past, made specific proposals for
development of this roadway and has prepared project-specific environmental review

documents in conjunction with the consideration of these projects. Development of the
South Frontage Road segment adjacent to the Ripon High School is not currently under
consideration. Should that project be reconsidered, the City will proceed with project-
specific environmental consideration. As a part of that future project, the RUSD’s
environmental concerns will be addressed in detail.
Response 10K: See General Response and Response 10G. The GP EIR does not identify
“future studies” as mitigation measures. Instead the EIR identifies general plan policies and
standards that will apply to future development.
Response 10L: This comment raises a hypothetical question regarding the potential success
of the City’s Public Facilities Finance Plan (PFFP). The City has successfully implemented
its current PFFP, and the proposed PFFP represents a continuation of the existing program,
applied to planned future development. CEQA does not require the analysis of speculative
potential impacts such as the potential issue raised in this comment.
Response 10M: As documented in the Cumulative Impacts chapter of the EIR, the City of
Ripon notes that the general plan EIR is, itself a cumulative analysis of planned future
development of the City during the planned period ending in 2040. No additional
cumulative impact analysis is required.
Response 10N: See General Response. Potential impacts of the development of schools is
accounted for in the various analyses included in the EIR. Site-specific impacts of planned
future school development projects will need to be addressed by the RUSD in individual
project-specific environmental review documents.
Response 10O: Planned bridges will require permits from both the Army Corps of
Engineers and the California Department of Fish and Game, among others. Consultation
with the US Fish and Wildlife Service will be required as a part of the Army Corps of
Engineers permit process. The proposed bridge project is a future project for which no
design or construction plans exist. All necessary permits will be obtained at the time that
the City and other involved agencies are prepared to proceed with this project. See also the
General Response.
Response 10P: See General Response. The Ripon General Plan Update 2040 or the EIR
considers potential construction noise associated with new urban development. New
development plans located in the vicinity of RUSD schools are routinely circulated to the
District for comment. The District is encouraged to identify any project-specific concerns it
may have so that they may be considered by the City in their review of the project.
Response 10Q: This response criticizes the EIR’s consideration of alternatives and requests
an explanation for the dismissal of certain alternatives. This explanation was provided in
the Draft EIR on page ----. The alternatives analysis included in the EIR was based upon a
more extensive consideration of alternatives in the current adopted general plan and EIR.
The EIR gives detailed consideration to the No Project and Reduced-Scope Ripon General
Plan alternatives in Chapter 6 of the EIR. No additional alternatives were identified during
the preparation of the revised GP EIR. No additional alternatives have been identified by
the commenter.




Response to comment letter from Pacific Gas and Electric, January 19, 2006.
Response 11A: This is not a specific comment on either the Ripon General Plan Update
2040 or the EIR but rather a request for coordination in conjunction with new land
development activities. The City encourages project applicants to coordinate with PG&E
during the development of subdivision improvement plans; these plans cannot be
approved until they adequately reflect the needs of the utility.
Response 11B: Similar to the previous comment, this is not a comment on the Ripon
general plan or EIR but rather a statement of policy with regard to allocation of the costs
and approval requirements of relocating existing PG&E facilities. No response is necessary.
Response 11C: This is not a comment on the EIR, but the comment does note the potential
for cumulative impacts on utility facilities. The City routinely requires coordination with
PG&E during the review of projects. Such coordination would identify the need for any
additional utility improvements that may be required in conjunction with new
development projects.
Response 11D: This is not a comment on either the general plan or the EIR but rather a
discussion of potential electrical and gas utility improvements that may be required in
conjunction with new development. This information has been incorporated in the utility
impact discussion of the EIR.
Response 11E: As noted in previous responses, the City will continue to coordinate with
PG&E with regard to utility needs associated with new development projects. This
consultation will include the potential for any cumulative impacts on the PG&E system. If
and when PG&E identifies significant physical improvements that may be needed in
conjunction with a planned development project, these improvements should be
accounted for in the environmental document prepared for the project.
Response 11F: This comment suggests the inclusion of information regarding electro-
magnetic fields in the General Plan and EIR. The suggested paragraph has been
incorporated in the EIR. Repeated studies of the potential health effects of EMF have failed
to reveal any significant linkage between the presence of EMF and disease.
Response 11G: This comment is both a request for coordination with the City on planned
urban expansion as well as a statement of the utility’s responsibility to the California Public
Utilities Commission and a recognition of the CPUC’s authority over utility-related matters.
As noted in previous responses, the City will continue to coordinate with PG&E on utility-
related matters. No further response is necessary.
