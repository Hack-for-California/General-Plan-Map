                                                               I. INTRODUCTION
A. PURPOSE AND CONTENTS OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The Marysville Housing Element is part of the City’s General Plan, a comprehensive policy
document regarding the physical, economic, and social development of the city; the preservation
and conservation of natural human features of the landscape, particularly historic buildings and
sites; and the redevelopment and reuse of land and buildings within the city.
The Housing Element addresses one of the most basic human needs—shelter. For this reason, the
Housing Element represents a critical link between land use and transportation policies, which
define the location, layout, and movement of people and goods, and environmental/resource
policies. For a region to have a strong and balanced economy, its workers must also have places
to live within their economic means. From the perspective of human needs, housing should be
high on the hierarchy of policy priorities. Yet in a typical community, places for people to live
usually require more land than any other human activity. Although housing represents a high
priority, as a land use, it must still be balanced with the community’s economic needs and
environmental, resource, and open space protection policies, which are also essential aspects of
the City’s General Plan.
The Housing Element contains three parts: a community profile, an analysis of resources and
constraints, and a housing strategy. The community profile contains an analysis of population,
housing, and employment characteristics and trends; the needs of special population groups such
as seniors, large families, and persons with disabilities; indicators of unmet need, such as
overcrowding, overpayment, substandard housing, and the potential loss of affordable rental
housing; and future housing construction needs. The purpose of the community profile is to
characterize existing conditions and unmet housing needs among Marysville’s residents and to
plan for future residents expected to reside in the city.
The second part of the element analyzes resources and constraints to meeting the housing needs
identified in the community profile. Resources include the availability of land, public and private
organizations that provide housing and supportive services, and funding to implement the City’s
housing strategy.
Constraints include the impacts of government action on housing availability and affordability,
the interaction of market forces, and environmental conditions. In this section of the element, the
City will analyze the magnitude of potential constraints and identify potential mitigation
measures to reduce the impacts of constraints.
The third part of the Housing Element contains the City’s housing strategy—goals, policies,
implementing actions, and quantified objectives to meet identified housing needs, reduce
constraints, and make effective use of available resources. As part of its strategy, the City will
identify the agencies responsible for implementing actions contained in the Housing Element,
time frames for actions, and the anticipated results, quantified when possible.

B. COMMUNITY CONTEXT
The capacity of Marysville to accommodate additional residential development is determined
largely by the city’s location at the confluence of the Feather and Yuba rivers. The mean
elevation of the city is below the flood level elevation of the two rivers. Marysville is surrounded
by a system of levees. While the levee system created a habitable community, it also created a
barrier to the city’s physical expansion. As a result, development within the current city limits is
confined to relatively small, vacant infill sites or the reuse of underutilized properties. The City
estimates that less than 20 acres of vacant land exists within the current city limits, most of
which are sites of less than 1 acre.
The city’s enclosure by levees has also created a relatively compact community, in which most
residents are within comfortable walking distance or a short drive to downtown Marysville. The
developed city area within the levees occupies about 2,000 acres of land, or just over 3 square
miles. The city has a residential density typical of small, central city communities, but higher
than most suburban communities. Expansion of the city outside its current city limits can occur
to the north and east, but only if the levee system that protects the city is extended (or
development occurs outside the floodplains) and public services and facilities are available. The
Sphere of Influence also extends to the south of the city.
The unique physical characteristics of the city have greatly impacted its development rate and
pattern of growth. Population growth in Marysville throughout the twentieth century and the
beginning of the twenty-first century has averaged about 1 percent per year. During the 1980s,
Marysville experienced a population increase of over 2 percent per year, primarily due to a
higher rate of occupancy of the existing housing stock and larger household sizes. Since 1990,
the city’s population has declined slightly, standing at 12,072 in 2010.
Despite the population contraction in the city during the 1990s and 2000s, the long-term
prospects appear greater for growth and development. Continued expansion of the Sacramento
Valley economy, in combination with completed improvements to State Routes 99 and 70
between Marysville and Sacramento, will increase economic and commuting ties between the
city and Sacramento. The demand for housing and population growth will be affected by the
increasing number of workers living in Marysville and commuting to job centers in the southern
Sacramento Valley.
The City’s challenge for the twenty-first century is to continue to establish land use and housing
policies that can increase the effective use of the remaining vacant land, provide additional
housing opportunities through the redevelopment of existing uses, and ultimately, expand
Marysville’s development potential through the expansion of the levee system and public
facilities beyond the present city limits. If the City is able to address these challenges, it can also
improve long-term prospects for Marysville’s economic well-being.

C. SUMMARY OF HOUSING NEEDS AND STRATEGIES
Although Marysville is physically constrained by the system of levees which surround the city, it
has not been immune to the growth pressures affecting the southern Sacramento Valley. During
the 1980s, the city experienced a substantial influx of new residents. Between 1980 and 1990, the
city’s total household population (excluding 640 individuals in group quarters) grew by 22
percent, from 9,569 to 11,684. The number of households increased by 15 percent, which means
that higher population growth was accompanied by a decrease in the average household size.
Only two-thirds of the increase in households was accommodated by new residential
construction as the city’s housing stock grew by just 10 percent over ten years, to 5,083 housing
units. The additional 5 percent increase in households was accommodated by the existing
housing stock.
As the city reached buildout during the 1990s, housing construction and population growth
slowed. The city actually lost population between 1990 and 2010, a decline of about 2.4 percent.
As the desire by many residents for living close to work and services increases, Marysville may
benefit from the potential for reuse and infill development.
Marysville’s population is predominantly non-Hispanic whites, although less so than in previous
years. From 2000 to 2010, the white population in the community declined by 8.3 percent, while
the number of Hispanic persons rose 35.7 percent. The composition of Marysville’s population
by age group also changed from 2000 to 2010, with an increase in young adults (ages 20 to 34),
middle-aged people (45 to 64), and those 85 years old and older. The growth in the number of
young adults suggests that there is a greater need for housing of sufficient size and affordability
for those starting families.
Nearly half of Marysville residents have lower incomes (less than 50 percent of median income).
Those most likely to have lower incomes are single parents with children, the elderly, and large
families. Citywide, about 23 percent of individuals had poverty-level incomes or lower in 2010
(a federally defined level of income that is the minimum needed for subsistence living). Families,
including those with children, were generally less likely to live below the poverty level, except
for female-headed households with no husband present, which were substantially more likely.
Conversely, seniors had relatively low rates of poverty—just under 10 percent in 2010 for those
65 years of age and older.
According to the 2010 Census, multifamily dwellings comprise approximately 38 percent of the
housing stock in 2010, and renters outnumber homeowners 58 percent to 42 percent. The
proportion of multifamily housing and renters is significantly higher than in most other small
communities and somewhat above the averages statewide (44 percent renters and 35 percent
multifamily housing in California). The high percentages of renters and multifamily housing are
related to lower incomes in Marysville, as renters are more likely to have lower incomes than
homeowners. From 2000 to 2010, homeownership declined somewhat and the number of rental
units increased slightly (US Census 2000 and 2010).
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element               3                                      1/24/2014

In February 2013, the median price for an existing home was about $140,600, and the median
rent was approximately $751 based on a survey of rents on Zillow.com. Housing in Marysville
has become increasingly unaffordable to lower-income households, particularly households
earning less than 50 percent of the Yuba County median income (nearly $30,000 in 2013 for a
family of four). Among renters in this income group, 76 percent paid more than 30 percent of
their incomes for housing expenses, a common measure of housing affordability. Among
homeowners in this income group, 63 percent paid 30 percent or more for housing (US Census
2010; ACS 2010).
The condition of older housing remains a concern in Marysville. In 2010, over 83 percent of
houses in the community were built prior to 1980. Based on a housing conditions survey
conducted in March 2013, about 37 percent of housing units required at least moderate
rehabilitation or replacement.
Future housing needs in Marysville will be affected by regional employment trends in the Yuba-
Sutter area. According to the California Employment Development Department, two of the three
employment sectors expected to experience the greatest job growth, retail and service industries,
tend to create jobs with extremely low- to moderate-income wages.
Marysville should plan to accommodate 72 additional housing units between 2013 and 2021,
according to a regional housing plan adopted by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments
(SACOG). Twenty of these housing units should be affordable to households with incomes less
than 80 percent of the Yuba County median income. Per Government Code 65584.09, the City
must also address the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) from the previous planning
period, which totaled 137 housing units. Ten of those units must be affordable to those earning
less than 80 percent of Yuba County median income. The City has determined that it could
potentially accommodate about 445 additional dwelling units during this time frame in
consideration of homes constructed or approved since 2006 as well as residential development
potential on vacant sites. In some cases, these sites also allow commercial uses. The uses
ultimately developed on these sites will depend on future development proposals. To address the
community conditions and housing needs presented in this document, the City has adopted a
strategy of accommodating the minimum number of new units assigned by SACOG as
Marysville’s share of regional housing needs. The City of Marysville has also adopted policies
and programs to facilitate and assist in the production and rehabilitation of a wide range of
housing, shelter, and supportive services for all income levels and special needs groups.

D. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The City of Marysville encouraged participation by all segments of the community in the
preparation of the Housing Element through a combination of general public notices and direct
contacts with organizations serving lower-income and special needs groups and inviting them to
attend public workshops and hearings on the Housing Element. Because Marysville is a small,
compact community, it is relatively easy to inform individuals and organizations of public events
and encourage their participation.
1. Public Workshop
To provide opportunities for public participation in the preparation of the Housing Element, the
City conducted a public workshop on February 28, 2013, at 6 p.m. at City Hall to explain the
purpose and contents of the Housing Element, state requirements, and the update process. The
Planning Commissioners and City staff, as well as a number of residents and service providers,
attended (see Appendix A). The meeting started with a brief presentation made by the consultant.
The presentation included a summary of Housing Element state law requirements, identification
of new laws that affect this Housing Element update, a summary of demographic information
from the 2010 Census, and a listing of the City’s current Housing Element goals, policies, and
programs.
Following the presentation was a question and answer session. Some of the community needs
identified were:
   Higher-income/executive-type housing is needed. Residents currently in starter homes
    looking to buy a bigger home have to move out of Marysville.
   The hospital expansion project will bring more doctors and nurses to Marysville and increase
    the needs for executive-type housing.
   There is an aging population in the community that needs senior housing options.
   There is a need for housing for college students/traveling nurses, including studio/single-
    room occupancy (SRO)-type units.
   Residents would like to see the Marysville Hotel restored. The historic building code can be
    used as a resource.
   The City needs to work with the hospital to get them to invest in the community to create a
    more vibrant downtown including mixed use with commercial on the bottom floors and
    residential above.
   The older house stock needs to be rehabilitated.
   The City needs to work with regional homeless organizations to assist with the homeless in
    the community.

   Look to other similar-sized communities and communities with vital downtowns for ideas to
    revitalize the downtown (examples identified were Eureka and Vancouver, Canada).
The City also conducted a public hearing before the Planning Commission to solicit public
comments prior to adoption of the Housing Element. The Planning Commission hearing was
held on August 28, 2013.
The meetings were noticed in the newspaper and on the City’s website. To encourage
participation by lower-income residents and organizations serving their needs, the City compiled
a list of public agencies and nonprofit organizations that provide housing and social services to
lower-income residents of Marysville and mailed them a letter to request their attendance at
public meetings. Appendix A contains a list of agencies and community organizations contacted
by the City.
2. Planning Commission Hearing
To provide the Planning Commission and members of the public the opportunity to provide input
on the Draft Housing Element, the City conducted a public workshop on August 28, 2013, at 7
p.m. at City Hall to explain the purpose and contents of the Housing Element, state requirements,
and the update process. The Planning Commissioners and City staff, as well as a number of
residents and service providers, attended. The meeting started with a brief presentation made by
the consultant. The presentation included a summary of Housing Element state law requirements,
identification of new laws that affect this Housing Element update, a discussion of the land
inventory analysis, a listing of the draft Housing Element goals, and key programs from the draft
Housing Element.
Comments were received from the public as well as Planning Commissioners and included:
   Landlords don’t do enough to address special needs of the disabled.
   Much of the low-income housing in Marysville is clustered in the same area. It would be
    better if it were spread out.
   Incentivize maintenance of existing and creation of new barrier free housing for those with
    disabilities.
   Encourage housing that allows seniors to age in place.
   The current expansion of Rideout Hospital is an opportunity to create supportive and long-
    term care housing.
   Consider visitability requirements in all new construction and when rehabilitating housing
    units.
   Encourage City to use any future CDBG funds obtained to fund FREED Center for
    Independent Living’s (FREED) program that performs minor modifications and repairs for
    those over the age of 60.

    inventory.
   Draft should analyze realistic development capacity of sites in the land inventory.
   City should use minimum default densities for lower-income sites.

    and California Agricultural Workers Survey.
   Farmworker needs are not adequately addressed in the draft.
   There is a need for more Farmworker policies in the draft.

    special needs group identified for Marysville.
   Further assessment of homeless need and whether existing facilities are sufficient is needed.
   The draft does not address the need for SROs.
   The draft should include analysis and programs to address state law related to mobilehomes
    and factory built housing.

3. Other Input
The City received one letter via email from a representative of St. John’s Episcopal Church with
several comments prior to the Planning Commission hearing. The comments included:
    A 2012 Homeless Count, led by John Floe of Sutter County Mental Health should provide
     updated numbers for Yuba County.
    Of all the clients who came to St. John's Community Food Shelf during the first six months
     of 2013, 30% were homeless.
    Would favor a lenient regulation allowing mobile homes to be used on small lots.
Comments received on the Public Review Draft Housing Element have been considered and
when required by state law or are appropriate and feasible based on available City resources,
changes have been made to the plan to address the comments. Additional detail about changes
made is included in Appendix A.
E. DEFINITIONS
Certain terms are used repeatedly in this document and are defined below.
Affordability. For homeowners, “affordability” is usually defined by the maximum percentage
of gross income allowed by mortgage lenders in qualifying homebuyers. Lenders will usually
allow a borrower to devote no more than 35 percent of gross income to housing costs, including
the mortgage, taxes, insurance, municipal services, and utilities. Because certain homeowner
expenses are tax deductible, homeowners can receive substantial tax savings relative to renters
paying an identical proportion of gross income to housing expenses. However, extremely low-,
very low-, and low-income households have lower marginal tax rates and do not receive as
significant a tax savings from homeownership as do moderate- and above moderate-income
households (see income definitions below). For this reason, the City will define “affordability”
for extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households as an expenditure of no more than 30
percent of a household’s gross income before taxes and for moderate- and above moderate-
income as an expenditure of no more than 35 percent of gross income before taxes.
For extremely low- through moderate-income renters, “affordability” is defined as an
expenditure of no more than 30 percent of gross income before taxes on housing costs (rent plus
utilities).
Housing Cost. For homeowners, housing cost includes payments for home loans (principal and
interest), property taxes, insurance, and utilities. For renters, housing cost includes payments for
rent and utilities.

Housing Types. Housing types are as defined in the Marysville Zoning Ordinance (Title 16 of
the Marysville Municipal Code), Chapter 18.04, and include apartment houses, apartment hotels,
boarding houses, community care facilities (including group care facilities and residential care
homes), group dwellings (two or more detached dwellings on a single parcel), one-family
dwellings (single-family homes), two-family dwellings (duplexes and halfplexes), multiple-
family dwellings (multifamily dwellings intended for occupancy by three or more persons),
mobile homes, rooming houses, and second residential units.
Income Categories. Extremely low income equals 30 percent or less of the Yuba County
median income, as estimated annually by the California Department of Housing and Community
Development. Very low income equals 30 percent to 50 percent of the median Yuba County
income. Low income equals 50 percent to 80 percent of the Yuba County median income.
Moderate income equals 80 percent to 120 percent of the Yuba County median income. Above
moderate income equals 120 percent or more of the Yuba County median income.
Median Income. A dollar amount at which 50 percent of households earn more and 50 percent
earn less.

Addressing the current and future housing needs of Marysville residents requires a
comprehensive assessment of the community’s housing needs. An understanding of these needs
provides the basis for an appropriate and adequate housing strategy (refer to Section IV). This
section presents an analysis of the demographic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristics that
may affect housing needs in Marysville. Appendix C: Data Sources and Their Use describes data
sources used to update this chapter.
A. POPULATION AND HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
1. Overview
The type and amount of housing need in a community is largely determined by population
growth and demographic characteristics, such as age and household size, and income. An
analysis of population and household trends helps to draw a picture of the community and how
the community has changed over time.
2. Population Trends
Marysville is the largest incorporated city in Yuba County, with an estimated 2012 population of
12,104 according to the California Department of Finance (DOF). However, Marysville’s
population has decreased slightly in recent decades. Census data showed that between 2000 and
2010, the city’s population decreased by 1.6 percent, or by 196 residents (see Table II-1). During
the same period, Wheatland and unincorporated Yuba County grew 51.9 percent and 24.0
percent, respectively. As of 2010, Marysville’s population was almost gender-equal. The
community had 6,025 males (49.9 percent of the population) and 6,047 females (50.1 percent).
Most of the decrease in the city’s population occurred through a decline in residents living in
owner-occupied homes. The renter population in the community stayed constant and the number
of individuals living in group quarters rose from 607 to 670 from 2000 to 2010, primarily due to
growth in the number of people living in correctional institutions. As the county seat of Yuba
County, Marysville houses several regional-serving group quarters facilities, including the
county jail, the county’s juvenile correctional facility, group homes for individuals recovering
from substance abuse (some of whom are former inmates of the county’s correctional facilities),
nursing homes, and homeless shelters. Section D of this chapter, Special Housing Needs,
provides more information on populations in group quarters.

3. Population and Household Projections
This section presents the projections within SACOG’s 2004 Preferred Blueprint Scenario. These
projections are based on SACOG jurisdiction-level data for the City of Marysville and DOF
county-level data for Yuba County. According to the DOF, population is estimated to grow to
143,973 in 2050 which represents a 99 percent growth rate from 2010 (72,329). The SACOG
Blueprint projects Marysville’s population will grow to approximately 19,000, an increase of 57
percent from 2010. Housing units are expected to grow at primarily through small-lot single
family infill.
4. Age Characteristics
Each age group has distinct lifestyles, household compositions, and income levels. As
individuals move through stages of life, housing needs and preferences also change. For
example, young adults typically move more frequently and do not earn as much as older adults.
Young adults cannot generally afford, or are not ready, to purchase homes and look for rental
housing to meet their needs. In contrast, older young adults and early middle-aged residents (35–
54) typically have higher earning potential and higher rates of homeownership.
Residents approaching retirement age or recently retired (early 60s to mid-70s) tend to have the
highest rates of homeownership. As seniors age, the demand for smaller housing or specialized
residential developments, such as assisted living facilities or active adult communities, increases
to meet the changing lifestyle and self-care abilities of these older adults. According to the 2010
Census, the largest segment of the population was individuals 25 to 34 years old, making up 15.1
percent of the population in Marysville. The greatest population growth in Marysville occurred
among individuals 55 to 59 and 60 to 64 years old; the population of residents 55 to 59 years old
increased by 52.4 percent and residents 60 to 64 years old grew by 41.8 percent.
The largest decline occurred among residents between 35 and 44 years old, as the number of
persons in this group declined by 527 (28.2 percent). In 2010 the median age of Marysville
residents was 32.5, compared to 32.1 for all of Yuba County and 35.2 for California as a whole,
according to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey.
Table II-2 shows the age characteristics of Marysville residents in 2000 and 2010.

5. Race and Ethnicity
Race and ethnicity may affect housing needs differently based on housing preferences and
requirements related to family size, income, the presence of extended family members, and other
factors. Marysville, along with the rest of Yuba County, has experienced changes in the racial
and ethnic composition of the population.
The majority of Marysville residents are non-Hispanic White (61.3 percent), as shown in Table
II-3. The non-Hispanic white population decreased by 670 residents, or 8.3 percent, between
2000 and 2010. The number of residents who identified themselves as of Asian/Pacific Islander
origin or as African American also decreased, by 34.0 percent and 10.0 percent, respectively.
The only group to experience a significant numerical and percentage gain was persons of
Latino/Hispanic origin. Hispanic individuals constituted 17.5 percent of the Marysville
population in 2000, climbing to 24.2 percent of the community’s residents in 2010. Overall, the
Hispanic population in Marysville increased 35.7 percent between 2000 and 2010.

6. Household Type
According to the 2010 Census, there were 4,668 households in Marysville, a decrease of 0.4
percent from 2000. Of those 4,668 households, 2,705 households, or 57.9 percent, were families
living together. The number of families in Marysville declined 4.3 percent from 2000 to 2010.
The remaining 1,963 households (42.1 percent) consisted of households comprising persons
living alone or unrelated persons living together. These types of households increased by 5.6
percent from 2000 to 2010. The median household size in Marysville was 2.44 people, and the
median family size was 3.14 people.
The Census defines a household as any group of people occupying a housing unit, which
includes persons living alone, families (a group of related individuals), or unrelated persons who
share living quarters. Persons living in retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or other
group living situations are not considered households. Household characteristics are important
indicators of the type and size of housing needed in a community.
The modest growth in non-family households and the related decrease in family households
suggest that there may be an increasing demand for smaller housing units and rental housing to
accommodate the demands of younger, non-family households.
The total group quarters population in Marysville increased from 607 people in 2000 to 670
people in 2010. The inmate population rose by 406 persons in 2010, an increase of about 19
percent from 2000 levels.

7. Household Income
Five categories are typically used to compare incomes. These categories are extremely low
income, very low income, low income, moderate income, and above moderate income, which are
defined as a percentage of the Yuba County median income (see Appendix D: Income
Definitions). These categories are used by most agencies to define who is lower or moderate
income in terms of eligibility for participation in various government programs.
Historically, the majority of city residents have had low and very low incomes. According to the
2006–2010 American Community Survey, the median household income in Marysville was
$37,858, a significant increase from 2000 levels, but still below the Yuba County average of
$46,807. In general, income levels are lower for renters than for owners in Marysville. Based on
data from the 2005–2009 American Community Survey, 11.3 percent of all households are
owner-occupied units with an average income of 80 percent or less of the area median income
(AMI). Area median income for all of Yuba County is $59,400 in 2013. By contrast, 42.6
percent of all households are renter-occupied units with an annual income of 80 percent of AMI
or less.

In the entire Yuba City Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which includes Marysville, the
median household income was $47,162 in 2000 as reported by the 2010 Census, declining to
$46,314 in 2010 according to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey. Adjusted for
inflation to 2011 dollars, the 2000 median household income in the Yuba City MSA was
$62,890, falling to $47,657 in 2010. The MSA median income is lower than the AMI for the
county, indicating lower incomes in Marysville and Yuba City than countywide.
The poverty rate is another relative measure of financial well-being. The poverty level is a
federally defined measure of the minimum income needed for subsistence living. The poverty
level is an important indicator of severe financial distress, and the rate of poverty in a community
(proportion of the population with poverty level incomes or less) provides important information
about individuals and families who have the greatest financial need. The dollar threshold for
poverty is adjusted by the federal government for household size and composition, but not by
region, which may skew the results.
According to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, 23.2 percent of Marysville residents
lived below the poverty level, compared to 20.0 percent of all Yuba County residents. Female-
headed households with children under 18 years old were among the most likely residents to live
below the poverty level: 40.3 percent of such households in Marysville and 42.5 percent of such

        households in Yuba County were below the poverty level. Among all families, 12.3 percent of
        Marysville families and 8.0 percent of Yuba County families were below the poverty level,
        although rates were somewhat higher among families with children under 18 years old.
        Compared to 1999, poverty rates have decreased among some demographic groups and increased
        for others. Between 2006 and 2010, more Marysville residents but fewer Yuba County residents
        were living in poverty than in 1999. Poverty rates declined for families, including those with
        children under 18, in both areas. Poverty rates for female-headed households have improved for
        all Yuba County residents, but the percentage of female-headed households living below the
        poverty level increased in Marysville. Table II-6 compares the poverty rate among population
        groups in Marysville.

B. HOUSING STOCK CHARACTERISTICS
1. Housing Type
According to 2010 numbers from the California Department of Finance, housing units in
Marysville continue to be predominantly single-family homes. Single-family units made up 62.3
percent of Marysville housing stock, compared to 37.5 percent for multifamily units. A
significant majority (89.1 percent) of the single-family housing units were detached, and most
(59.4 percent) multifamily units were in complexes of 5 or more units.
The number of housing units decreased slightly in Marysville from 2000 to 2010, down by 117
units (2.3 percent), consistent with the 1.6 percent decrease in population over the same time
period. While the number of both single-family attached and detached units increased compared
to 2000 levels, significant drops were seen among multifamily units in complexes of at least 5
units. There was also a large decline in the number of mobile homes, down from 41 units in 2000
to 8 in 2010.

Census.

2. Tenure
The majority of housing units in Marysville are rentals (60.8 percent), compared to 39.2 percent
which are owner-occupied. In Yuba County as a whole, 59.5 percent of units are owner-occupied
and 40.5 percent are renter-occupied. Since 2000, the number of owner-occupied units in
Marysville has decreased, while the number of renter-occupied units has risen. In 2010 there

were 4,571 people living in owner-occupied units and 6,831 in rental units, compared to 4,835 in
owner-occupied units and 6,826 in rental units in 2000, similar to the overall household trend.

   Notes: The total number of units is less than in Table II-9 because this table only counts occupied
   units and Table II-9 counts all units (vacant units included). There may also be minor differences in
   household counts in various tables that are based on sample data from the 2000 Census
According to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, rental households are more likely to
live in multifamily buildings, or other housing units except for single-family detached houses, as
shown in Table II-9. Although these units make up only 44.5 percent of all housing units in
Marysville, two-thirds of all rental households live in these houses, with only one-third living in
single-family detached units.

No racial or ethnic population group in Marysville has a majority of homeowners, although
people of Asian origin have the largest percentage of homeowners. Of the 159 Asian
householders, 78 (49.1 percent) own their homes. Only 22.6 percent of Black or African
American householders are homeowners, the lowest percentage of any racial or ethnic group in
the community. Homeownership rates are also relatively low among Hispanic residents at 35.3
percent. Among White householders, 58.6 percent rent their homes and 41.4 percent are
homeowners. Table II-10 compares tenure by race and Hispanic origin.

Further evidence of differences in tenure among population groups is shown in Table II-11,
which compares tenure by age. In general, older Marysville residents are more likely to be
homeowners, as 55.7 percent of homeowners are at least 55 years old and 33.6 percent are 65
years of age or older. Renters are somewhat more widely distributed across the different age
groups, although they are more likely to be younger (36.7 percent of renters are under 35 years
old). Only two age groups saw a significant change in tenure from 2000 to 2010: the number of
homeowners between 25 to 34 years of age and 65 years and older decreased, while the number
of renters in these age groups increased.

3. Housing Vacancy
According to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, there were 528 vacant housing units
in Marysville, or 10.2 percent of the housing stock in the community. Compared to past years,
vacancy has increased significantly. Since 2000, when 313 housing units were vacant, the
Marysville vacancy rate has increased 68.7 percent. Among the six categories of vacant houses,
the number of vacant units has increased in all but one category (only the number of homes that
had been rented or sold but not yet occupied decreased, down 57.9 percent compared to 2000
levels). The effective vacancy rate (the percentage of total households currently vacant) for rental
housing in Marysville was 11.3 percent in 2010 for rental units and 2.8 percent for ownership
housing. An effective vacancy rate for rental units above 5 percent is usually considered
sufficient to provide adequate choice and mobility among renter households. Low vacancy rates
create upward pressure on housing costs and can increase the gap between housing costs and
local incomes.

  4. Overcrowding
  Overcrowding is a measure of the capacity of the housing stock to adequately accommodate
  residents. Too many individuals living in a housing unit with inadequate space and number of
  rooms can result in unhealthy living arrangements and accelerated deterioration of the housing
  stock. In the United States, housing providers and government agencies typically consider a
  household as overcrowded if there is more than one person per room or two persons per
  bedroom. Extreme overcrowding is often defined as more than 1.5 persons per room.1
  Overcrowding results when: (1) the cost of available housing with a sufficient number of
  bedrooms for larger families exceeds the family’s ability to afford such housing, (2) unrelated
  individuals (such as students or low-wage single adult workers) share dwelling units due to high
  housing costs, (3) the cost of housing requires two families to double up, or (4) housing costs
  force extended family members to become part of the household.
  1
    According to the US Census Bureau, the number of occupants per room is obtained by dividing the number of
  people in each occupied housing unit by the number of rooms in the unit. “Rooms” do not include bathrooms,
  porches, balconies, foyers, halls, or unfinished basements (2010 American Community Survey Questionnaire,
  question #37).

Renter households typically have a higher rate of overcrowding than homeowners, and this
pattern is visible in Marysville. According to the 2005–2009 American Community Survey, 40
renter-occupied households (1.5 percent of all rental units) were considered overcrowded. An
additional 120 rental units (4.6 percent of the total) were severely overcrowded, while 10 owner-
occupied households (0.5 percent) were overcrowded and another 10 were considered severely
overcrowded. In general, rental units are significantly more likely to be overcrowded or severely
overcrowded.

5. Housing Costs
a. Housing Prices
The price of housing in Marysville has declined over the past several years, a similar pattern to
that seen in most of California. In 2002, the median selling price of a home in Marysville was
approximately $115,000. It rose to a peak of $319,000 in February of 2006 before beginning to
decline, according to the website Zillow.com. Housing prices reached their lowest point in May
of 2011, with a median sales price of $107,000, although prices have rebounded somewhat since.
As of February 2013, the median sales price of a house in Marysville was $140,600.
According to a survey of for-sale properties available on Zillow.com as of February 4, 2013,
there were 103 houses for sale in Marysville, excluding those in foreclosure and sales of land
only. Of these properties, 48, or 46.6 percent, were three-bedroom houses. Four-bedroom houses
were the second most numerous, comprising 29 properties, or 28.1 percent of for-sale houses.
Prices ranged from $31,700 to $1,100,000, with a median price of $153,000. All but three of the
for-sale houses had an asking price of under $500,000.

b. Rents
Rental costs are usually evaluated based on two factors: rents paid by existing occupants of
rental units under a rental or lease agreement (“contract”) and advertised rents for vacant units.
Rental costs can also be evaluated based on the gross rent paid by tenants, which includes utility
payments, versus the contract rent for the dwelling units only.
According to Zillow.com, 44 units were available for rent in Marysville as of February 4, 2013:
27 units, or 61.4 percent, were two-bedroom houses; 11 units were one-bedroom houses; 4 were
three-bedroom units; and 2 available units had four bedrooms. The median rental price for all
available units, as well as for two-bedroom houses, was $750, and the median rent for one-
bedroom units was $625. The least expensive unit, a one-bedroom apartment, had an asking rent
of $495, while the most expensive unit, a three-bedroom single-family house, had a rental price
of $1,650.
Examining all rental units in the community and not only those on the market, the 2006–2010
American Community Survey reported that the median rental cost in Marysville was $767, with
no units renting for less than $200 or for over $2,000. In addition, 21.7 percent of units had rental
costs of over $1,000 and 12.2 percent had costs below $500.

units in February 2013.

c. Housing Affordability
Housing affordability can be determined by comparing the sales prices and rents for housing in
the county versus the amount of income available for households at different income levels.
County-level information is used because that is the geographic unit for which the State provides
income limits. This information can show whether a household in a particular income group can
afford to rent or own housing, those who would likely experience overcrowding or cost burden,
and those eligible for assistance.
Table II-17 shows the maximum affordable home and rental price based on the 2013 income
limits determined by the California Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD). Assuming a standard of 30 percent of gross income as the maximum amount any
household should apply toward housing expenses, the table shows the highest monthly rent and
the maximum purchase price for an individual or family at the top end of four income categories.
For renters, housing cost refers to rent and utilities. For purchasers, housing cost includes
mortgage, utilities, property tax, insurance, and homeowners’ association fees as applicable. This
illustration assumes a household at the top of each income range (e.g., a moderate-income four-
person family could have an annual income as low as $47,501, but the example is based on the
same family with a $71,300 income). Therefore, it would be inaccurate to infer that all
households of a given size and income group could afford to pay what the table shows for a
similarly sized household at the top of the income group.
A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is two and one-half to three times its
annual income, depending on the down payment, the level of other long-term obligations (such
as a car loan), and interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors allows some
households to qualify for homes priced at more than three times their annual income, while other
households may be limited to purchasing homes no more than two times their annual income. In
the early to mid-2000s, many lenders and mortgage brokers introduced (or more extensively
marketed) loan products that required very little or no down payment, interest-only loans
initially, or adjustable rate loans with initial low interest rates for 1 to 5 years. These loans
allowed more households to become homeowners, and many borrowers to purchase homes
representing a higher multiplier of their earnings—sometimes four or more times the household’s
annual income.
According to Zillow.com, the median rental price in Marysville in February 2013 was $750, as
shown in Table II-17. This rental cost is not affordable for a family of four in the extremely low-
income category and is slightly above the affordability level for a family in the very low-income
category as well. The median home price in Marysville is not affordable to extremely low-
income or very low-income households and is close to being overpriced for low-income
households.

6. Overpayment for Housing
A household is generally considered to be overpaying for housing if housing costs represent 30
percent or more of the household’s gross monthly income. This generally accepted standard is
used to roughly assess the ability of the household to meet its monthly financial obligations. The
ability of any particular household to devote a specified percentage of income to housing will
depend on that household’s income level, size and composition, debts, and other necessary
expenditures (such as on health care).
Although overpayment is a problem for both renters and homeowners, it is more common among
those who rent their homes. According to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, 38.4
percent of homeowners and 58.7 percent of renters in Marysville pay more than 30 percent of
their income on housing costs. Overpayment also becomes more common as income levels
decrease, among both renters and homeowners. Of householders who make less than $20,000
annually, 84.4 percent of homeowners and 88.1 percent of renters are overpaying. By
comparison, among those making at least $75,000, only 7.4 percent of homeowners are
overpaying.
Among households paying more than 50 percent for housing costs, a large majority of renters
(83.9 percent) and about half of homeowners (49.2 percent) had very low income. For those
paying 30 to 50 percent of their income on housing costs, renters were more likely to be lower
income and homeowners were more likely to have moderate or above moderate income levels.

Overpayment rates have increased since 2000. In 2000, 23.7 percent of homeowners and 38.6
percent of renters were spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs.
Moreover, while these changes have occurred across all income levels, lower-income households
have been particularly affected; the percentage of renters making between $20,000 and $34,999
who were overpaying rose from 18.7 percent in 2000 to 78.6 percent for the 2006–2010 average.
This suggests that, even with the recent collapse of the housing market, income levels have failed
to keep up with rising housing costs.

of their incomes for housing in 2010.

7. Housing Age and Condition
a. Overview
The age and condition of the housing stock provide additional measures of housing adequacy and
availability. Some of the indicators of substandard housing, such as an aging housing stock and
the number of dwelling units lacking complete facilities, indicate the potential for substandard
housing conditions.
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element             28                                      1/24/2014

b. Age of Housing
According to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, more than 80 percent of
Marysville’s housing stock was constructed before 1980 (see Table II-19) and about one-quarter
(24.7 percent) of housing units were constructed before 1950. The age of Marysville’s housing
stock suggests the potential for deterioration, although the age of housing by itself is not a
definitive measure of housing condition. Many communities have a sizeable amount of housing
more than 30 years old but little housing rehabilitation or replacement need. The age of housing,
when correlated with income and the proportion of rental housing, can provide a reasonable
measure of housing condition. Neighborhoods that have high percentages of older, rental housing
and lower-income households, such as in Marysville, tend to have greater housing rehabilitation
needs.

Rental units are generally more likely to have problems than owner-occupied houses.2 Of the
2,095 housing units in Marysville with problems, as identified in the 2005–2009 American
Community Survey, 69.2 percent are rental units, even though rental units make up 60.8 of all
housing in the community. As shown in Table II-20, rental households with lower incomes are
more likely to live in these housing units; more than half (58.6 percent) of households in a unit
with problems have extremely low or very low income, and 96.2 percent have below moderate
household income. This trend is reversed among homeowners, as only 75 owner-occupied units
(11.6 percent of those with problems) have an extremely low household income, compared to
195 units (30.2 percent) with above moderate income.

  As defined by the Census, a housing unit problem is a lack of a kitchen, lack of plumbing, overcrowding (more
than 1 person per room) or overpaying (housing costs are 30 percent or more of household income).

c. Housing Condition
The connection between housing conditions and the age and tenure of housing can be confirmed
with a survey of housing conditions. In 2013, the City of Marysville conducted a survey of
housing conditions in the community. Of the 2,861 residential parcels in Marysville, 400, or 14
percent, were surveyed. The condition of housing was assessed by an exterior survey of the
quality and condition of the building and what improvements (if any) were needed. Each
structure was scored according to criteria established by the California Department of Housing
and Community Development in five categories: foundation, roofing, siding, windows, and
electrical. Based on scores assigned to the five categories, each structure was classified as being
in sound or dilapidated condition, or in need of minor, moderate, or substantial repairs (as
defined in Table II-21). Interior conditions were not assessed.

                            A building that appears new or well maintained and structurally
                            intact. The foundation should appear structurally undamaged and
                            there should be straight roof lines. Siding, windows, and doors
            Sound
                            should be in good repair with good exterior paint condition. Minor
                            problems such as small areas of peeling paint and/or other
                            maintenance items are allowable under this category.
                            A building that shows signs of deferred maintenance or which only
            Minor           needs repair or replacement of one major component, such as a
                            roof.
                            A building in need of replacement of one or more major components
          Moderate          and other repairs, such as roof replacement, painting, and window
                            repairs.
                            A building that requires replacement of several major systems and
                            possibly other repairs, such as complete foundation work, roof
         Substantial
                            structure replacement and re-roofing, painting, and window
                            replacement.
                            A building suffering from extensive neglect, which appears
                            structurally unsound and maintenance is nonexistent, is not fit for
        Dilapidated
                            human habitation in its current condition, may be considered for
                            demolition, or major rehabilitation will be required at a minimum.
Of the units surveyed, 34.5 percent (138 units) were in sound condition, with the remaining 65.5
percent (262 units) requiring at least some repairs. Of the surveyed units, 28.5 percent (114 units)
needed only minor repairs, with 35.5 percent (142 units) requiring moderate repairs. Four units
surveyed needed substantial repairs, and two were considered dilapidated. If the units surveyed
are a representative sample of housing units in Marysville, it means that of the community’s
5,019 units, 1,756 (35 percent) are in sound condition and 1,432 (28 percent) need only minor
repairs, 1,756 (35 percent) housing units require moderate repairs, 50 (1 percent) are in need of
substantial repairs, and 25 (less than 1 percent) are considered dilapidated.
The Housing Conditions Survey report made the following housing program recommendations:
   The City of Marysville should conduct housing rehabilitation within the city for both owners
    and owner-investors when funds are available. Of the 400 housing units surveyed, 262 units
    (65 percent) were in need of rehabilitation. In an area such as Marysville with a small
    number of housing units, it is critical to bring substandard housing units up to health and
    safety standards.
   The City of Marysville should utilize CDBG, Home Investment Partnership Program,
    program income, and other funding sources to address its health and safety hazards in
    deteriorated housing and to extend the useful life of housing structures.

C. EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
1. Overview
According to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, Marysville had 4,456 employed
people at least 16 years old. The California Employment Development Department reported that
Marysville’s December 2012 unemployment rate was 13.4 percent. In December 2012, Yuba
County had 26,178 employed people with an unemployment rate of 15.8 percent, lower than the
2012 average of 17.0 percent. High unemployment remains a chronic challenge in the county and
affects household incomes and the ability to afford housing costs. Unemployment in Yuba
County has not been below 10 percent since November of 2007. The largest economic sector in
Marysville is education, health, and social services, which employed 1,264 (28.4 percent) of all
employed community residents, according to data from the 2006–2010 American Community
Survey as shown in Table II-22. The next-largest employment field, retail trade, employed 524
people (11.8 percent). These two sectors also employed the most people in Yuba County as a
whole.

In 2008, SACOG estimated that there were a total of 8,284 jobs in Marysville. By 2020, SACOG
projects only a modest increase in the number of jobs in the community (only 237 positions
added). The number of jobs is expected to grow at a faster rate between 2020 and 2035, when
Marysville is expected to add an additional 779 jobs, as shown in Table II-23.

California’s Employment Development Department provides a summary of the number of
people employed in various economic fields and the average annual wage for each. Of the 22
categories of occupation that the department tracks, 11 saw an increase in the number of people
working in that category between the years 2001 and 2011 in the Yuba-Sutter area, which
includes Marysville. The largest increase occurred in the food preparation and serving-related
category, which grew by 470 jobs, or 15.0 percent. The largest decrease occurred in the category
of construction and extraction occupations, which lost 1,080 jobs (49.5 percent). Overall, the
Yuba-Sutter area lost 2,350 jobs between 2001 and 2011, a decrease of 6.1 percent. The average
annual income increased across all sectors, with an overall average of $42,663 in 2011. This is
an increase of $7,569 (21.6 percent) since 2001.
Table II-24 shows the California Employment Development Department’s estimates of
employment by occupation and mean annual wages for the respective fields for the Yuba-Sutter
area in 2001 and 2011. The Employment Development Department projection also estimated that
the number of people employed will increase 8.8 percent from 2008 levels, with the greatest
growth expected to occur among healthcare support and personal care occupations.
The relationship between household earnings and the ability to purchase a home is fairly simple
to determine. With the median home sale price at $137,700 at the end of 2012, a household in
Marysville will have to earn roughly $41,000 to $43,000 to afford a median-priced house under
customary loan underwriting assumptions standards.3 With many of the new employment
opportunities in the Yuba City MSA being created in lower-income support and care
occupations, many of the households with primary earners in these fields are less likely to be
able to purchase a home.

Local job creation affects the local housing market, but regional job growth can affect distant
housing markets. Furthermore, job growth in areas without adequate housing can have
significant detrimental effects on the quality of life and the local environment. With many of the
new employment opportunities being created in areas outside of Marysville, it is likely many of
city’s future residents will make the daily commute into the Sacramento region or to other areas.
The major employers in Marysville are shown below in Table II-25. Government employers

Developing housing, particularly near employment centers, can help reduce traffic congestion
and commute times, improve air quality, and places people in closer proximity to the services
they need. The availability of housing encourages a healthy economy and can support
revitalization efforts in historic downtown areas. Maryville’s current development levels
combined with geographic constraints will inherently prevent sprawling development away from
the economic center of the city. However, those same constraints may ultimately lead to more
citizens commuting to other employment centers.
Table II-26 shows that nearly half of Marysville’s workforce travels to another county for
employment. Some of this can be attributed to workers traveling to Yuba City, which is a very
short distance, but it is also possible that some of these workers are traveling farther for their
jobs, primarily to Sacramento.

Since the unemployment level is fairly high in Marysville (although lower than in Yuba County
as a whole or the City of Wheatland), residents will likely continue to commute to find higher
paying salaries (see Table II-27). The employment data suggests that Marysville does not have a
sufficient number jobs and variety of employment opportunities for its residents, who must
commute elsewhere for work.

D. SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Certain groups in Marysville encounter greater difficulty finding decent, affordable housing due
to their special needs and/or circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to one’s
employment and income, family characteristics, medical condition or disability, and/or
household characteristics. A focus of the Housing Element is to ensure that persons from all
walks of life have the opportunity to find suitable housing in Marysville.
State Housing Element law identifies the following “special needs” groups: senior households,
disabled persons, single-parent households, large households, farmworkers, and persons and
families in need of emergency shelter. This section provides a discussion of housing needs for
each particular group and identifies the programs and services available to address their housing
and supportive services needs.

1. Seniors
Senior households typically have special housing needs due to three primary concerns: (1) fixed,
often lower, incomes, (2) high healthcare costs, and (3) self-care or independent living
limitations (such as health-related disabilities). According to the 2010 Census, 1,022 households
in Marysville (21.9 percent of all households) were headed by persons age 65 years and older,
more than half of whom (56.7 percent) lived alone.
The number of people 65 years and older has declined by 9.3 percent from 2000 to 2010, a
greater decrease than for all age groups in Marysville. While the population of seniors between
the ages of 65 and 79 decreased over this period, the number of seniors 80 years old and above
has increased. These trends are illustrated in Table II-28.

The 2006–2010 American Community Survey reported that among the 1,453 residents of
Marysville who were 65 years of age or older, 128 (8.8 percent) had an annual income below the
poverty level. There was a notable gender difference as well; 10.4 percent of women 65 years or
older had incomes below the poverty level, compared to 6.4 percent of men. The poverty rate is
higher among individuals 75 years of age or older compared to those 65 to 74 years of age, as
shown in Table II-29.

Among the 1,022 senior-headed households in Marysville, 614 were owner-occupied and 408
were renter-occupied, according to the 2010 Census. Compared to 2000, the number of owner-
occupied senior-headed households has decreased while the number of renter-occupied
households increased, mirroring the trends seen in the community at large. Because of physical
and/or other limitations, senior homeowners may have difficulty in performing regular home
maintenance or repair activities, which may be of particular concern for homeowners. In
addition, because many seniors have fixed and/or limited income, they may have difficulty
making monthly mortgage or rent payments. The 2010 Census reported that 67 percent of senior
householders living alone (388 householders) were women. Therefore, elderly women may be
especially in need of assistance.

Various programs can help meet the needs of seniors, including but not limited to congregate
care, supportive services, rental subsidies, shared housing, and housing rehabilitation assistance.
For the frail elderly or those with disabilities, housing with features that accommodate
disabilities can help ensure continued independent living. Elderly with mobility/self-care
limitations also benefit from transportation alternatives. Senior housing with these
accommodations can allow more independent living.
According to the California Department of Social Services, as of February of 2013 there were
two licensed care facilities for seniors are located in Marysville: Prestige Assisted Living Facility
and Sunrise Garden. These facilities provide a total of 120 beds for persons age 60 and above. A
major affordable housing development for seniors in Marysville is the 100-unit Buttes Christian
Manor, open to low-income seniors at least 62 years old.
2. Persons with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities typically have special housing needs because of their fixed or limited
incomes, the lack of accessible and affordable housing that meets their physical and/or
developmental capabilities, and the higher health costs associated with their disabilities. A
disability is defined broadly by the Census Bureau as a physical, mental, or emotional condition
that lasts over a long period of time that makes it difficult to live independently. The Census
defines six disabilities: sensory, physical, mental, self-care, go-outside-home, and employment
disability. While the American Community Survey cannot accurately estimate the number of
Marysville residents with a disability in recent years, figures are available for all of Yuba
County. According to the 2008–2010 American Community Survey, 10,507 individuals (15.2
percent of county residents) have a disability, including 42.9 percent of people 65 years of age or
older. Ambulatory difficulties are the most common form of disability in Yuba County, as 5,691
individuals (54.2 percent of the county’s disabled population) have such a disability.
Disability data is available for Marysville for the year 2000. As shown in Table II-31, 2,695 people
(24.9 percent of the noninstitutionalized civilian population) reported at least one disability.

The 2000 Census reported that among the noninstitutionalized civilian population, there were

To meet the unique housing needs of the disabled, the City offers and participates in various
programs. Through the Yuba County Housing Authority, disabled households may receive rental
assistance to help them afford housing in the community. Also, the City offers home
improvement grants, which can be used to make upgrades/modifications to ensure accessibility.
In addition, the City’s building code requires new residential construction to comply with the
federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires a minimum percentage of units
in new developments to be fully accessible to the physically disabled, as well as with California
Title 24 accessibility requirements.

Living arrangements for disabled persons depend on the severity of the disability. Many persons
live independently with other family members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons
may need special housing design features, income support, and in-home supportive services for
persons with medical conditions.
Many disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional living
environment. However, more severely disabled individuals require a group living environment in
which partial or constant supervision is provided by trained personnel. The most severely
affected individuals may require an institutional environment in which medical attention and
therapy are provided within the living environment. According to the California Department of
Social Services, Marysville is home to five adult day-care facilities with a combined capacity of
114 beds. (Adult day-care facilities are facilities of any capacity that provide programs for frail
elderly and developmentally disabled and/or mentally disabled adults in a day-care setting.)
3. Persons with Developmental Disabilities
Senate Bill (SB) 812 requires the City of Marysville to discuss the needs of individuals with a
developmental disability in the special needs housing analysis. A developmental disability, as
defined in Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, is a disability that originates before
an individual is 18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and
constitutes a substantial disability for the individual, including mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
epilepsy, and autism. This includes disabling conditions closely related to mental retardation, or
requiring treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation, but does not
include other handicapping conditions that are entirely physical in nature.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently in a conventional
housing environment, although more severely disabled individuals may require a supervised
group living environment. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are available. Because developmental
disabilities appear during childhood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services provides community-based services to
approximately 243,000 individuals with developmental disabilities and their families through a
statewide system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two community-based
facilities. The City of Marysville is serviced by the Alta California Regional Center in
Sacramento, which provides a point of entry to services for people with developmental
disabilities. The center is a private nonprofit community agency that contracts with local
businesses to offer a wide range of services.
As of November 2012, the Alta California Regional Center provided services to 17,127 people
across six counties; 250 of these people lived in Marysville. Table II-26 summarizes the number
of Marysville residents being served by age group. Program Two under Goal One addresses the
needs of the developmentally disabled in Marysville.

4. Farmworkers
Although the city does not have a large resident farmworker population within its boundaries,
Marysville is located in an agricultural region that employs many farmworkers. According to the
2006–2010 American Community Survey, there were 82 Marysville residents (less than 1
percent of the city’s total population) employed in farming, forestry, and fishing occupations.
The 2007 Agricultural Census reported 2,364 farmworkers in Yuba County, including 1,851 who
had been working for over 150 days.
Farmworkers traditionally are defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farmworkers work in the fields, processing
plants or providing support activities on a year-round basis. When workloads increase during
harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal or migrant labor.
Although Marysville itself contains no agricultural land, there are several orchards adjacent to
the city to the north. Some of the leading crops farmed in Yuba County are orchard crops, which
have a high demand for seasonal labor. Needs of seasonal farmworkers fluctuate throughout the
year as well as from year to year and are generally greater at harvest time. Seasonal farmworkers
are more often men without families or living away from their families. Some of the appropriate
housing options for seasonal farmworkers include short-term housing options or SROs.The need
for seasonal labor, however, does not necessarily translate to a need for migrant farmworker
housing. Many of the farmer migrants who moved from state to state or from Mexico to
California to pursue agricultural employment have now become permanent residents. As such,
the housing needs of farmworkers are primarily addressed through the provision of permanent
affordable housing, rather than migrant farm labor camps. Their housing needs would be the
same as other lower-income households and large families who are in need of affordable housing
with three or four bedrooms. To comply with the California Employee Housing Act (Health and
Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6) and to address the needs of local farmworkers, the
City has proposed additional requirements in Goal One, Program Two to allow employee
housing for six persons or fewer by right without discretionary review in all zones allowing
single-family residential development. The program also allows employee housing up to 12 units

and with 36 beds in all zones where agricultural uses are allowed. This program also proposes to
allow SROs with a conditional use permit in the C-2 and C-3 zones.
5. Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households with children, particularly female-headed single-parent households,
often require special consideration and assistance as a result of their greater need for affordable
housing, accessible day care, health care, and a variety of other supportive services. Female-
headed single-parent households also tend to receive unequal treatment in the rental housing
market. Moreover, because of their relatively lower household incomes, such households are
more likely to experience difficulties in finding affordable, decent, and safe housing.
According to the 2010 Census, there were 836 female-headed families in Marysville, comprising
30.7 percent of all families in the community; 69.3 percent of female-headed families had
children under the age of 18. Although the overall number of families in Marysville declined by
4.3 percent from 2000 to 2010, the number of female-headed families increased by 13.4 percent.
This increase was seen for female-headed families with and without children.

Female-headed families are generally at an increased risk of being under the poverty line.
According to the 2006–2010 American Community Survey, 33.5 percent of female-headed
families were under the poverty line, compared to 18.4 percent of all families. Female-headed
families with children under 18 years old were the most likely to be in poverty, with 40.3 percent
under the poverty line, as shown in Table II-35.

Battered women with children comprise a subgroup of female-headed households that are
especially in need. In the Marysville area, a number of social service providers and emergency
housing facilities serve women in need, including A Woman’s Friend, Casa de Esperanza, and
the Salvation Army.
6. Large Households
Large households are defined as households having five or more members residing in the home.
These households constitute a special need group because of an often limited supply of
adequately sized, affordable housing units. Because of rising housing costs, families and/or
extended families are sometimes forced to live together under one roof. The 2010 Census
reported 478 large households in Marysville, comprising 10.2 percent of all households. Similar
to all of Marysville, a majority of large households (59.2 percent) rent their home.
The number of large households in Marysville has declined by 4.8 percent since 2000, according
to the 2000 and 2010 Censuses. This decreased occurred among the rental population, as the
number of large families owning their house remained stable.

The housing needs of large households could be met by larger units with more bedrooms.
Because larger units typically cost more, lower-income large households may reside in smaller
units, likely resulting in overcrowding. To help address overcrowding, the City is working to
develop housing opportunities for larger households to relieve overcrowding and is promoting
affordable ownership housing opportunities (such as first-time homebuyer and self-help housing
programs) to help renters achieve homeownership.
7. Homeless
Most families become homeless because they are unable to afford housing in a particular
community. Beyond the need for housing, they are certainly likely to have other needs, such as
support services and increased incomes. Nationwide, about half of those experiencing
homelessness over the course of a year are single adults. Most enter and exit the system fairly
quickly. The remainder essentially lives in the homeless assistance system or in a combination of
shelters, hospitals, the streets, jails, and prisons. There are also single homeless people who are
not adults, including runaway and “throwaway” youth (children whose parents will not allow
them to live at home).

the bi-county community and facilitate connecting these individuals and families to appropriate
services. (2) Documented the number of homeless in the community (point in time count) each
year, and their demographics. (3) Provided two events per year that provide homeless with a hot
meal and music in a relaxed setting, the ability to learn about available services from agencies
who set up tables at the event, and provide haircuts, dental/toiletries kits, and other free
amenities. (4) Sponsored a homeless awareness event (Homeless Summit) once per year, with
information on the documented need, agencies who serve the homeless, and testimonials from
homeless persons. (5) Became the springboard for the establishment of the R.E.S.T. rotating
shelter supported by 12–16 community churches. (6) Promoted an online directory of service
providers in Sutter and Yuba counties at MHA’s website, the Network of Care
www.sutter.networkofcare.org or www.yuba.networkofcare.org. SYHC has a committee
working toward developing a 10-year plan to address homelessness in the community.
No local count of the homeless population has been attempted in Marysville specifically, in part
because homeless individuals avoid being counted and their numbers are often difficult to gauge
accurately. The 2013 Homeless Count for the Yuba City/Marysville/Sutter area reported 813
homeless individuals, 736 of whom (90.5 percent) were sheltered, 61 were considered
chronically homeless, 38 were veterans. The people counted represented 157 families. 194
homeless children were counted in the area. The number of homeless individuals in the area has
increased somewhat since the last count, up 25.2 percent from 2011. The count identified 282
homeless individuals in the City of Marysville.
Because the facilities listed above are the primary homeless shelters for the Marysville-Yuba
City region, the users are from throughout the region. Essentially, Marysville provides homeless
services and facilities for the entire two-county area. The level of use of the facilities indicates
that there is a need in the Yuba-Sutter region for additional capacity for homeless facilities and
services. However, there is no information to suggest that Marysville needs additional homeless
facilities or supportive programs to serve the needs of its own resident homeless population.
Goal One, Program Three proposes to allow emergency shelters by right in the M-1 zone.
8. Extremely Low-Income Households
Households in the extremely low-income category have special housing needs because they are
unlikely to find market-rate housing that is affordable at any price. This section outlines the
number and percentage of extremely low-income households and actions that the City may take
to better serve them. Extremely low-income households may be homeless or in danger of being
homeless because of their inability to find appropriately priced housing. The extremely low-
income category focuses on those households that make less than 30 percent of the area median
income of $59,400. This equates to $17,800 for a family of four.
According to the 2005–2009 American Community Survey, there were 1,360 extremely low-
income households in Marysville, of which 68 percent were renters overpaying on housing
(about half were spending at least half their income on housing costs). Because of these cost
burdens, extremely low-income households may require specific housing solutions, including
subsidies, housing with supportive services, single-room occupancy units, shared housing, or

other solutions. The City has a range of housing and supportive services programs that could
assist these households, including participating in the Sutter-Yuba Homeless Consortium,
pursuing grants for and promoting the use of state and federal housing programs, assisting
eligible households in applying for various private, state, and federal sources of funding for
housing rehabilitation and home repairs, preserving federally subsidized rental housing, and
participating in various health and human services–related programs.

E. ANALYSIS OF ASSISTED HOUSING PROJECTS AT RISK
1. Analysis of Assisted Rental Housing Projects At Risk of Conversion
Existing rental housing that receives governmental assistance is a significant source of affordable
housing that should be preserved, to the extent feasible. The loss of such rental units reduces the
availability of housing affordable to very low- and low-income households. It is far more cost-
effective to preserve existing affordable housing than to replace it with newly constructed units,
unless housing has reached a substantial level of deterioration.
This section of the Housing Element identifies publicly assisted rental housing in Marysville,
evaluates the potential of such housing to convert to market rates within 10 years of the
beginning of the current planning period (2013), and analyzes the cost to preserve or replace
those units. Resources for preservation/replacement of these units and housing programs to
address their preservation are described in Section IV of the Housing Element. Goal Four,
Program One proposes actions for the City to continue to preserve affordable rental housing and
prevent at-risk units from converting to market rate.
The conversion of assisted affordable housing to market-rate rents can occur because the United
States Congress, in establishing various housing programs, allowed owners to prepay their 40-
year mortgages after 20 years and to terminate, or “opt out,” of their contracts prior to expiration.
Congress has established several programs to encourage rental property owners to maintain their
funding and the affordability of their rental units. These programs have induced many owners to

 keep their units affordable and have made it possible for other organization to purchase,
 refinance, and preserve many other affordable rental projects.
 Table II-39 lists publicly assisted multifamily rental housing projects in Marysville. There are
 four projects containing 332 rental units with affordability restrictions assisted through a
 combination of government programs. These programs include HUD Section 8 (project-based),
 federal HOPE tax credits, the California Low Income Tax Credit Program, and HUD Section
 202. There are several other assisted rental housing projects with Marysville zip codes and
 addresses, but these are located outside the city limits in the unincorporated community of Linda.

2. Loss of Assisted Housing
Affordability covenants and deed restrictions are typically used to maintain the affordability of
publicly assisted housing, ensuring that these units are available to lower-income households in
the long term. Over time, the City may face the risk of losing some of its affordable units due to
the expiration of covenants and deed restrictions. If market rents continue to increase, property
owners may be inclined to discontinue public subsidies and convert the assisted units to market-
rate housing.
Risk was assessed based on information from the California Housing Partnership Corporation
(CHPC), the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the California Low
Income Tax Credit Committee staff, and information provided by the property managers of some
properties. CHPC data indicates the federally assisted 100-unit Buttes Christian Manor is
potentially at risk of conversion to market-rate housing when affordability controls expire in
May 2015. Buttes Christian Manor is considered high risk, which indicates that a property may
convert to market rate within five years. Moderate risk is assigned to projects expected to expire
within 10 years of the start of the planning period (October 31, 2013). Low risk indicates that a
property cannot convert to market rate for at least 10 years. Although projects with agreements
expiring within 10 years of the beginning of the planning period are required by law to be listed,
these units may not actually convert.
Although Buttes Christian Manor’s affordability status may expire within the next few years, it is
considered to be at low risk of conversion because the project is owned by a nonprofit
organization and funded under a federal program with no prepayment option. Nonprofit owners
have a public purpose to develop, own, and maintain affordable housing. They have no or little
incentive to remove current rental restrictions by terminating their Section 8 contracts or
prepaying their mortgages. Some owners may prepay their mortgages in order to bring new
capital into their projects. However, they are unlikely to opt out of their Section 8 contracts.
The following is an analysis of the preservation and replacement options of the Buttes Christian
Manor affordable housing project.
3. Preservation and Replacement Options
a. Overview
To maintain the existing affordable housing stock, the City can either preserve the existing
assisted units or facilitate the development of new units. Depending on the circumstances of at-
risk projects, different options may be used to preserve or replace the units. Preservation options
typically include: (1) transfer of project to nonprofit ownership; (2) provision of rental assistance
to tenants using non-federal funding sources; and (3) purchase of affordability covenants. In
terms of replacement, the most direct option is the development of new assisted multifamily
housing units. These options are described below.
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element              51                                        1/24/2014

b. Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a nonprofit housing provider is generally one of
the least costly ways to ensure that at-risk units remain affordable for the long term. By
transferring property ownership to a nonprofit organization, low-income restrictions can be
secured indefinitely and the project would become potentially eligible for a greater range of
governmental assistance. Although Buttes Christian Manor is already owned by a nonprofit
corporation, it could potentially be acquired by another nonprofit agency to maintain the
affordability of units.
The current market value of the project was estimated using information from multifamily sales
listings in Yuba County. The average cost to purchase a multifamily development was $79 per
square foot. The average size of a unit was 960 square feet and the average cost to buy a unit was
$75,706. There are 100 units at risk of converting to market rate within 10 years in Yuba County.
If these were purchased, the estimated cost of acquiring these would be $7,570,625.
c. Rental Assistance
Rental subsidies using non-federal (state, local, or other) funding sources can be used to maintain
affordability of the 100 at-risk affordable units. These rent subsidies can be structured to mirror
the federal Section 8 program. Under Section 8, HUD pays the difference between what tenants
can pay (defined as 30 percent of household income) and what HUD estimates as the fair market
rent (FMR) on the unit. In Yuba County, the 2013 fair market rent is determined to be $634 for a
one-bedroom unit and $812 for a two-bedroom unit (the two types of units in the Buttes
Christian Manor project).4
The feasibility of this alternative is highly dependent upon the availability of other funding
sources necessary to make rent subsidies available and the willingness of property owners to
accept rental vouchers if they can be provided. As indicated in Table II-40, the total cost of
subsidizing the rents for all 100 at-risk units is estimated at $42,334 per month or $508,011
annually.

  Fair Market Rent is determined by HUD for different jurisdictions/areas across the United States on an
  annual basis.
  2013 Area Median Household Income (AMI) limits based on 2013 Income Limits from the California
  Department of Housing and Community Development. In Yuba County, the median family income in 2013
  was calculated to be $59,400 for a family of four. The income limit for an extremely low-income
  household was $12,500 for a one-person household and $14,250 for a two-person household.
  Affordable cost = 30% of household monthly income minus estimated utility allowance of $100 for a one-
  bedroom unit and $150 for a two-bedroom unit.
 d. Purchase of Affordability Covenants
 Another option to preserve the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide an incentive package
 to the owners to maintain the projects as affordable housing. Incentives could include writing
 down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance and/or supplementing the Section 8 subsidy
 received to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on whether the complex is too
 highly leveraged. By providing lump sum financial incentives or ongoing subsidies in the form
 of rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to the owner, the City can ensure that some or all of
 the units remain affordable.
 e. Construction of Replacement Units
 The construction of new affordable housing units is a means of replacing the at-risk units should
 they be converted to market-rate units. The cost of developing housing depends on a variety of
 factors, including density, size of the units (i.e., square footage and number of bedrooms),
 location, land costs, and type of construction. Assuming an average construction cost of
 $240,733 per unit, it would cost approximately $24 million (excluding land costs) to construct
 100 new assisted units.5 Including land costs, the total costs to develop replacement units will be
 significantly higher.

 Improvement Program (CHIP), April 24, 2013.

Based on this average, construction of replacement units would cost approximately $24 million,
assuming an average unit size of 960 square feet and accounting for land cost, government fees,
and other costs. The cost of constructing replacement units far exceeds the cost of the other two
alternatives.
f. Cost Comparisons
The above analysis attempts to estimate the cost of preserving the at-risk units under various
options. The cost of acquiring the Buttes Christian Manor project and transferring ownership to
nonprofit organizations is high ($7.6 million). In comparison, the annual costs of providing rental
subsidies required to preserve the 100 assisted units are relatively low ($508,000). However,
long-term affordability of the units cannot be ensured in this manner. The option of constructing
100 replacement units is very high ($24 million, excluding land costs) and constrained by a
variety of factors, including growing scarcity of land, rising land costs, and potential community
opposition. The best option to preserve the at-risk units appears to be the purchase of
affordability covenants.
4. Organizations Interested in Preserving Assisted Rental Housing
The preservation of affordable rental housing at risk of conversion to market-rate housing can be
assisted by nonprofit organizations with the capacity and interest in acquiring, managing, and
permanently preserving such housing. The California Department of Housing and Community
Development maintains a list of such interested nonprofit organizations. Several have expressed
an interest in preserving affordable rental housing in the Yuba-Sutter area. These organizations
include:
   Mercy Housing California, 3120 Freeboard Drive, West Sacramento, CA 95691; (916) 414-
    4400
   Christian Church Homes of Northern California, Inc., 303 Hegenberger Road, Suite 201,
    Oakland, CA 94621; (510) 632-6712
   Community Housing Improvement Program, Inc., 1001 Willow Street, Chico, CA 95928;
    (530) 891-6931
F. OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Utility-related costs can directly impact the affordability of housing in Northern California.
However, Title 24 of the California Administrative Code sets forth mandatory energy standards
for new development and requires adoption of an “energy budget.” In turn, the home building
industry must comply with these standards, while localities are responsible for enforcing the
energy conservation regulations.
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element             54                                        1/24/2014

There are many ways to meet or exceed state energy standards, including:
   The use of passive solar construction techniques that require proper solar orientation,
    appropriate levels of thermal mass, south-facing windows, and moderate insulation levels.
   The use of higher insulation levels in place of thermal mass or energy-conserving window
    orientation.
   The use of active solar water heating in exchange for less insulation and/or energy-
    conserving window treatments.
Other examples of energy saving construction techniques are locating homes on the northern
portion of the sunniest location of building sites; designing structures to admit the maximum
amount of sunlight into the building and to reduce exposure to extreme weather conditions;
locating indoor areas of maximum usage along the south face of the building and placing
corridors, closets, laundry rooms, power core, and garages along the north face; and making the
main entrance a small enclosed space that creates an air lock between the building and its
exterior, orienting the entrance away from winds, or using a windbreak to reduce the wind
velocity against the entrance.
Site planning techniques, the use of landscaping, and the layout of new developments can also
reduce energy consumption associated with residential development through reductions in
heating and cooling needs, opportunities to use non-motorized vehicles for transportation, and
reductions in energy inputs to the development of housing.
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents
and also participates in several other energy assistance programs for lower-income households,
which help qualified homeowners and renters, conserve energy, and control electricity costs.
These include the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program and the Relief for
Energy Assistance through Community Help (REACH) Program.
The CARE Program provides a 15 percent monthly discount on gas and electric rates to income-
qualified households, certain nonprofits, facilities housing agricultural employees, homeless
shelters, hospices, and other qualified nonprofit group living facilities.
The REACH Program provides one-time energy assistance to customers who have no other way
to pay their energy bill. The intent of REACH is to assist low-income customers, particularly the
elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and unemployed, who experience severe hardships and are
unable to pay for their necessary energy needs.
Marysville’s General Plan contains a policy in the Circulation and Scenic Highways Element to
promote pedestrian convenience through requirements that connect residential development with
commercial, shopping, and employment centers. By encouraging development patterns that

The City’s Zoning Code, Subdivision Code, or other codes and ordinances do not contain
implementing regulations to promote or require energy conservation in new development, except
for compliance with state energy conservation standards. The City’s design review guidelines
applicable in the historic preservation overlay zone and Redevelopment project areas (which
comprise about 34 percent of the city’s territory) promote the use of traditional architectural
styles and construction techniques that reduce cooling and heating needs for historic buildings.
Goal Six, Program One and Goal Seven, Program One address energy conservation and historic
preservation efforts pursued and supported by the City.
G. FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS
1. Overview
State law (California Government Code Section 65584) provides for councils of governments to
prepare regional housing allocation plans that assign a share of a region’s housing need to each
city and county. In the six-county Sacramento area, the Sacramento Area Council of
Governments (SACOG) is the council of governments authorized under state law to identify
existing and future housing needs for the region. SACOG adopted a new regional housing
allocation plan called the Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) on September 20, 2012. This
plan covers the period from January 1, 2013, through October 31, 2021.
SACOG’s methodology is based on the regional numbers supplied by the California Department
of Housing and Community Development (HCD). The numbers produced by HCD are provided
to SACOG in the form of a regional goal number, which is then broken into income categories.
SACOG is mandated to distribute the numbers to Sacramento area jurisdictions by income
categories.
The methodology used to determine the future need considers the expected growth in number of
households, the need to achieve ideal vacancy rates, the need for more housing opportunities,
and compensation for anticipated demolition. An “avoidance of impaction” adjustment is applied
to the preliminary allocation figure to avoid further concentration of low-income units in
jurisdictions that have more than the regional average.
The RHNP allocation is a minimum needs number—cities and counties may plan for, and
accommodate, a larger number of dwelling units than the allocation. The City must, however,
use the numbers allocated under the RHNP to identify measures (policies and ordinances) that
are consistent with these goals. While the City must also show how it will accommodate these
units to be built, it is not obligated to build any of the units itself or finance their construction.
The RHNA for the current 2013–2021 planning period and for the previous 2006–2013 planning
period are presented below. Because the City did not adopt a Housing Element during the
previous period, the City must identify adequate sites to meet the current and previous RHNA
allocations. Marysville’s share of regional housing needs during the previous planning period
totaled 137 new units. Table II-41 provides the detailed breakdown of units by income category
for the previous planning period. The RHNA for the current planning period totals 72 new units.
Table II-30 provides a breakdown of Marysville’s share of the regional housing need by the

affordability level/income category: extremely low, very low, low, moderate, and above
moderate. Extremely low-, very low-, and low-income categories are often referred to as a group
as lower-income. Through this Housing Element, the City is required to demonstrate the
availability of adequate sites to accommodate these new units.

2. Options for Complying with the Adequate Site Requirement
State law requires jurisdictions to demonstrate that “adequate sites” will be made available over
the planning period (2013–2021 for the SACOG region) to facilitate and encourage a sufficient
level of new housing production. Jurisdictions must also demonstrate that appropriate zoning and
development standards, as well as services and facilities, will be in place to facilitate and
encourage housing.6 To that end, the Housing Element must inventory land suitable for
residential development, including vacant and underutilized sites (if appropriate), and analyze
the relationship of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites.
In complying with the adequate sites requirement, jurisdictions can take credit for the number of
new units built during the 2006–2013 and 2013–2021 planning periods toward the RHNA. New
housing units include either those built (issued a certificate of occupancy) or approved since
January, 1, 2006 (the beginning of the 4th Housing Element cycle).
The following discussion identifies how the City may provide for a sufficient number of sites to
facilitate housing production commensurate with the 2006–2013 and 2013–2021 RHNA
numbers. In evaluating the adequacy of sites to fulfill the RHNA by income level, HCD assesses
a jurisdiction’s development potential by zoning district and corresponding density level. The
assumption is that density can reduce the per-unit cost of development and therefore the sales
price or rent of the housing developed.
3. Progress Toward Meeting Housing Needs
An important component of the Housing Element is the identification of sites for future housing
development and evaluation of the adequacy of these sites in fulfilling Marysville’s share of
regional housing needs as determined by SACOG. Between January 1, 2006, and June 2013, 42
housing units were completed and 1 housing unit was approved but not yet under construction
(see TableI-43). Twenty of the units were market rate. Three of them were built through the
Youth Build Program and sold to households in the moderate income category. Another three
were built by Youth Build, sold and deed restricted for low income households. Three units were
rehabilitated through the County Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) and deed restricted
for 15 years for low-income households. The remaining 14 low-income units were part of the
Wickes Werley House project which rehabilitated units then deed restricted them for low-income
households. Finally, the two low-income units approved since January 1, 2013 are being built by
Habitat for Humanity and will be sold to low-income households with covenants placed on the
title to restrict the units at affordable to low-income households.
After considering units constructed and approved, the City’s remaining housing allocation to be
accommodated under the SACOG Regional Housing Needs Plan is 176 housing units: 8
extremely low-income units, 9 very low-income units, 0 low-income units, 62 moderate-income
units, and 94 above moderate-income units. Table II-43 summarizes the status of housing units
provided or approved since January 2006 and the units available in the current land inventory.

A. RESOURCES
1. Available Land to Accommodate Housing
a. Overview
Marysville is primarily a built-out city with few large parcels of undeveloped land. Most
residential development will occur on relatively small parcels (although there are several
properties of more than 1 acre remaining in the city) or through the reuse of underutilized
properties. Over the past decade, much of Marysville’s residential development has occurred
through planned developments, projects on vacant commercial properties and small residential
infill lots, and the renovation and conversion of historic commercial buildings to residential use.
Over the past several years, the City has seen interest and inquiries among home builders in
using small, infill lots, even those commercially zoned, for housing.
The fact that the city is constrained by levees impedes the normal process of annexation to
develop new housing opportunities. With the County continuing to allow residential
development to urban standards, it is likely that at some point the city will no longer be able to
provide additional housing. As the number of available sites decline in the city, the rate of
conversion to housing or commercial use will also decline.
b. Definition of Adequate Sites
To determine whether Marysville has sufficient land to accommodate its share of regional
housing needs for all income groups, the City must identify “adequate sites.” Under state law
(California Government Code Section 65583[c][1]), adequate sites are those with appropriate
zoning and development standards, with services and facilities, needed to facilitate and
encourage the development of a variety of housing for all income levels.
c. Relationship of Zoning Standards to Adequate Sites
The extent to which the City has adequate sites for housing affordable to lower-income
households will depend, in part, on zoning standards, particularly the maximum allowed density,
parking, building coverage, height, and setback standards. The adequacy of sites will also depend
on whether the City grants exceptions or variances to these requirements to reflect the challenges
of building on small, irregularly shaped parcels, thereby reducing development costs and
increasing development capacity. The feasibility of producing affordable housing on small lots
will also depend on developers’ ability to obtain favorable financing terms and subsidies. The
City has provided financial assistance to affordable housing projects in the past in the form of
direct subsidies for project development and pre-development assistance (feasibility and design
studies).
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element             61                                      1/24/2014

The combination of a sufficient supply of vacant land suitable for residential development, the
City’s flexible zoning standards, allowances for housing on commercial properties and a history
of approving housing on commercial properties, planned development overlay provisions, a
history of granting exceptions and variances, and willingness to provide financial assistance
demonstrate that Marysville can accommodate its remaining share of regional housing needs on
sites available within the existing city limits.
Many of the sites identified by the City with residential development potential are located on
properties zoned for commercial or manufacturing use. Because of the small parcel sizes typical
in Marysville, the types of commercial and manufacturing uses prevalent in the city on these
small parcels, and the mixed nature of land uses in many neighborhoods, even properties
designated for commercial or manufacturing use may be appropriate for infill housing.
Additionally, the commercial areas in the downtown (primarily zoned C-2) allow residential uses
by right on upper floors of buildings. Marysville’s situation is very different from most
communities, in which commercial and manufacturing zoning often implies land uses that are
incompatible with residential land uses.
d. Land Inventory
As part of the 2013 Housing Element update, an analysis of the residential development potential
in Marysville was conducted. A parcel-specific analysis of vacant and underutilized sites within
the existing city limits was performed. Based on the analysis, the City concluded that it could
accommodate 445 additional housing units on vacant properties.
For the previous planning period, the City must show that it can accommodate an additional 10
housing units affordable to low-income households and 127 housing units affordable to above
moderate-income households. For the current planning period, the City must show it can
accommodate an additional 20 housing units affordable to low-income households and 52
housing units affordable to above moderate-income households. The land use inventory and the
City’s estimate of residential development potential are based on the following assumptions:
   Parcels in residential zones can be developed at 80 percent of the maximum densities allowed
    in each of the respective zones.
   Parcels in zones without maximum allowable residential densities have historically
    developed at a range of densities between 24 and 35 units per acre. The analysis uses 29 units
    per acre as a reasonable assumption for the parcels in these zones appearing in the land
    inventory (C-2, C-3, and M-1).
   The PD zone has been used almost exclusively for multifamily residential development in
    Marysville. The two remaining PD-zoned parcels are located in an area of the city with other
    PD sites developed as multifamily housing. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the
    remaining two sites will also be developed for multifamily housing.
Based on these three assumptions, the City can meet its remaining share of regional housing
needs for lower-income households (267 units). Table III-1 lists vacant and underutilized parcels

2. Administrative and Financial Resources
a. Administrative Resources
Described below are public and nonprofit agencies that have been involved or are interested in
housing activities in Marysville. These agencies play important roles in meeting the housing
needs of the community. In particular, they are or can be involved in the improvement of the
housing stock, expansion of affordable housing opportunities, preservation of existing affordable
housing, and/or provision of housing assistance to households in need.
i. Chico Housing Improvement Program (CHIP)
CHIP is a nonprofit organization that has been providing self-help affordable housing for low-
income individuals and families since 1973. The majority of the funding for technical assistance
to implement CHIP is provided by the USDA’s Rural Development 523 Program. Using this
funding, CHIP in turn organizes and supervises groups of households in the building of their own
homes. In addition to assisting with self-help housing, CHIP also builds and manages affordable
rental properties.
ii. Habitat for Humanity Yuba/Sutter
Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit, faith-based organization dedicated to building affordable
housing and rehabilitating homes for lower-income families. Habitat for Humanity builds and
repairs homes with the help of volunteers and partner families. Habitat homes are sold to partner
families at no profit with affordable, no-interest loans. Volunteers, churches, businesses, and
other groups provide most of the labor for the homes. Government agencies or individuals
typically donate land for new homes. Habitat has completed one home in Marysville, one in
Olivehurst, and six in Yuba City. They are currently working on two homes in Marysville and
one in Olivehurst, and are planning to build two additional houses in Marysville.
iii. Mercy Housing California (MHC)
MHC is a nonprofit developer that develops affordable housing for families, seniors, formerly
homeless persons, individuals with HIV/AIDS, and persons with chronic mental illnesses and
physical impairments. With the assistance of public and private funding, MHC builds housing to
meet community needs. The types of housing developed include multi-unit rental apartments and
single-family homes, single-room occupancy apartments for formerly homeless adults, and
handicapped-accessible units for individuals with physical impairments. MHC was involved in
the development of three new single-family homes in the 12th and I streets neighborhood and
also operates a multifamily development in Yuba City.

iv. Yuba County Housing Authority
The Yuba County Housing Authority administers the Section 8 rental assistance program for the
entire county. As of April 2013, 136 Marysville households received Section 8 assistance from
the Housing Authority. Countywide, 393 households are receiving Section 8 assistance, with 874
households on the waiting list for assistance (355 of whom are in the Marysville area).
b. Financial Resources
Marysville has access to a variety of existing and potential funding sources available for
affordable housing activities. They include programs from local, state, federal, and private
resources and are summarized in Table III-2. Described below are the three largest housing
funding sources the City of Marysville can use for housing production, rehabilitation, or
preservation: Community Development Block Grant grants, Home Investment Partnership
Program grants, and Redevelopment set-aside funds.
i. Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Grants
Marysville is not an entitlement city and therefore is not eligible to receive annual CDBG
funding. The City does have a CDBG Income Reuse Plan if the opportunity to receive funding
becomes available in the future.
The City has made efforts when eligible to pursue CDBG grant funding opportunities. In 1998
and 2002, the City received CDBG Planning and Technical Assistance Grants to assess the
housing rehabilitation needs of multifamily housing in the downtown core area.
In 1999, the City received a $500,000 grant for housing rehabilitation to reconstruct four housing
units in the city’s CDBG target areas. Under the City’s Program Income Reuse Plan, Marysville
uses income generated from loan repayments and other sources related to its CDBG grants to
provide additional housing rehabilitation and other program assistance.
In 2001, the City was awarded a CDBG grant for $500,000 for the Wicks-Werley House
renovation and contributed to the project $140,000 of program income received from previous
CDBG grants. The City received several additional CDBG grants through 2009.
ii. HOME Investment Partnership Program Funds (HOME)
Federal HOME funds can be used for activities that promote affordable rental housing and
homeownership for lower-income households. Such activities include building acquisition, new
construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer
assistance, and tenant-based assistance. A federal priority for the use of HOME funds is
preservation of at-risk housing stock. In recent years, the City of Marysville has been able to
secure HOME funds through the State to offer a home rehabilitation program for property
owners and a program for first-time homebuyers.

B. CONSTRAINTS
1. Governmental Constraints
a. Overview
Local policies and regulations can impact the price and availability of housing and, in particular,
the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and
exactions, permit processing procedures, and other factors may constrain the maintenance,
development, and improvement of housing. This section discusses potential governmental
constraints as well as policies that encourage housing development in Marysville.
State and federal regulations also affect the availability of land for housing and the cost of
producing housing. Regulations related to environmental protection, prevailing wages for
publicly assisted construction projects, construction defect liability, building codes, and other
topics have significant, often adverse impacts on housing cost and availability. Perhaps one of
the greatest constraints to the production of housing affordable to lower-income households is
the chronic shortage of state and federal financial assistance for such housing.
While Marysville recognizes that constraints exist at other levels of government, the City has
little or no control over these regulations and no ability to directly mitigate them. This section of
the Housing Element therefore focuses only on policies and regulations adopted by the City that
can be mitigated by the City.

b. Land Use Policies
The Land Use Element of the Marysville General Plan, last updated in 1985, contains policies
for guiding development. Land use policies in the General Plan are implemented through several
types of ordinances, including the Zoning and Subdivision ordinances. Zoning regulations
establish the amount and distribution of land for different uses within the city, while subdivision
regulations establish requirements for the division and improvement of land.
The General Plan has three residential land use designations: low density (1–12 units per acre),
medium density (up to 24 units per acre), and high density (up to 48 units per acre). These
designations permit a variety of housing types and densities for urban residential use. The
Redevelopment Element provides for land uses consistent with Redevelopment area plans, which
could include housing and residential/mixed-use projects in commercial portions of the
Redevelopment area.
The City has adopted zoning standards for these General Plan categories that include four
residential zones and four commercial zones allowing residences with a use permit. Table III-3
summarizes the General Plan land use categories and corresponding residential zones.

iv. Historic Preservation Overlay Zone
The City has established a historic preservation overlay zone (Title 18, Chapter 18.94 of the
Marysville Municipal Code) that covers most of the city east of A Street (see Figure III-1). The
purpose of the overlay zone is to protect, enhance, and perpetuate sites, structures, and areas with
historic or architectural significance. Development activities within the historic preservation
overlay zone are subject to review by a three-member subcommittee of the Planning
Commission, which also functions as the Historic Preservation Commission. This subcommittee
is called the Architectural Review Board.
The board’s role is to ensure that projects are consistent with the City’s Design Review Manual
(described later in this section). Projects subject to review by the board include any exterior work
on any structure within the district. In carrying out its responsibility, the board considers the
architectural style, design, arrangement, texture, materials, and colors of existing buildings and
proposed modifications. The time required for board review does not impose an additional
constraint on the reuse or modification of existing buildings or sites because:
   Meetings are conducted as needed.
   Permits for minor modifications can be approved through an administrative process by staff.
    Minor modifications include normal repairs and maintenance, repainting, the addition or
    removal of awnings and other decorative devices, and the application of exterior materials of
    different type, color, or texture than currently in use.
The historic preservation design guidelines have the potential to increase costs for the
rehabilitation or conversion of historic buildings because of the added cost of maintaining the
historic character of a structure in the use of materials and construction techniques. The City has
mitigated the cost impact by confining the design review process to building exteriors. This
leaves property owners with the flexibility to make necessary modifications and use cost-
effective construction techniques in the interior of buildings.
d. Analysis of Residential Zoning Standards
The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily
through its Zoning Ordinance. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the Marysville
General Plan. The Zoning Ordinance also helps preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods.
Marysville has four residential zones:
   R-1, for single-family structures
   R-2, for two-family structures
   R-3, for three- and four-family structures
   R-4, for multiple-family structures
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element               84                                      1/24/2014

Minimum lot sizes for the city’s residential zones are 6,000 square feet for interior lots and 7,000
square feet for corner lots. Permitted building heights range from 35 feet in the R-1 zone to 50
feet (four stories) in the R-4 zone. The City does not regulate lot area per dwelling unit in the R-3
or R-4 zones, so the permitted residential density is based on the General Plan land use standards
of up to 24 units per acre (R-3) and 48 units (R-4) per acre. The Planned Development (PD) zone
also allows residential development.
The City also permits multiple-family residential uses in commercial zones and industrial zones
with a use permit. The City imposes height limits of between 35 and 85 feet in its commercial
zones and, under certain circumstances, yard requirements. Other than these requirements, there
are no development standards (such as lot coverage, floor area ratios, or lot area per dwelling
unit) for residential uses in commercial zones that limit the potential density of residential
projects in such zones.
Table III-4 summarizes the relevant residential standards for both single-family and multifamily
development.
i. Standards Affecting Residential Density
Marysville developed primarily before the advent of suburban development standards in the
1960s and beyond. Nearly half of the city’s housing stock was constructed prior to 1960. As a
consequence, the city is laid out primarily in a grid pattern, and residential lots are typically
small. The majority of older homes were built with small yards, a high percentage of lot
coverage, and limited on-site parking.
Residential Density. The city’s traditional development pattern is reflected in its zoning
standards. Permitted residential densities range from up to 7 dwelling units per acre in the R-1
zone to 48 dwelling units per acre in the R-4 zone.
Yards and Setbacks. The City does not restrict lot area per dwelling unit for multifamily zones.
Yard/setback requirements are modest, in fact lower than typically required for similar small,
built-out communities.

for corner lots). The minimum lot size provides a reasonable standard for facilitating a variety of
housing types and sizes. Smaller lots of record that do not meet minimum lot area or width
requirements may be developed if created before the present zoning standards for lot size were
adopted by the City.
Although Marysville’s zoning standards do not constrain the City’s ability to accommodate its
housing needs, the size and configuration of most remaining vacant lots create challenges to
achieving maximum development potential. The City has used the exceptions process for
recorded lots and its variance procedure to permit at least one residential unit on every lot of
record. For further analysis of the constraints imposed by the city’s small, infill lots, please see
the section on vacant land inventory.
Building Coverage. The City imposes reasonable, but not excessive, upper limits on building
coverage. In the R-3 and R-4 zones, between 50 percent and 60 percent of a lot may be occupied
by main buildings. The building coverage limit does not include enclosed parking or other
accessory structures, unless part of the main building. Therefore, building coverage requirements
do not impose a constraint on residential development.
Building Height. The City’s height limits do not constrain a property owner’s ability to achieve
the maximum densities allowed under the City’s General Plan because the zoning standards
allow building heights between 35 and 50 feet. In the R-1 and R-2 zones, buildings may be two
and a half stories. In the R-3 and R-4 zones, buildings may be three to four stories.
Allowances for Persons with Disabilities. The City permits certain projections and structures
within yard and setback areas. Among the allowances are facilities for access to residential
structures by persons with disabilities. For example, ramps or lifts for handicapped accessibility
are permitted within yard and setback areas. Such requests are approved administratively unless
the nature of the request triggers major design review in the historic preservation overlay zone
(see discussion of design review process below).
Occupancy Standards. The City does not regulate occupancy of residential units or distinguish
between related and unrelated individuals for permitting of residential uses. For the purposes of
“single-family,” “two-family,” and “multiple-family” housing, Chapter 18.04 of the City’s
Zoning Ordinance, Definitions, defines “family” as “an individual or group of individuals
occupying a dwelling and living together in which each resident has access to all parts of the
dwelling and where the adult residents share expenses” (Section 18.04.180).
Siting of Community Care Facilities, Group Homes, and Other Group Care Housing. The
City permits community care facilities and other special needs housing in all residential and
commercial zones. The City’s definition of community care facilities includes a wide range of
non-medical shelter facilities with supportive services for children, adults, families, and persons
with disabilities. Examples include family homes, group care homes, day-care centers for
children or adults, foster care homes, and community centers and private clubs in which care is
provided. Facilities of six or fewer persons are allowed by right in all residential zones, in the
C-3 and C-H zones, and by use permit in all other zones. Facilities of seven or more persons are
allowed by right in the R-3, R-4, C-3, and C-H zones and by use permit in all other zones.
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element             89                                        1/24/2014

Although not listed in Table III-4, the City also allows community care and group home facilities
with a use permit in its manufacturing zones. Uses permitted by right (that is, uses not needing a
use permit) may also include supportive services by right which are associated with the principal
residential use.
The use permit process does not require a lengthy approval process, and conditions imposed on
group care facilities are reasonably related to impacts of use, not the residents of these facilities.
The use permit process balances the need for reasonable regulation of group care facilities and
flexibility in their location. The use permit process is discussed later in this section.
Neither the General Plan nor the Zoning Ordinance regulates the siting or location of group care
facilities based on proximity to other such facilities.
ii. Parking Standards
Parking Ratios. The City’s parking requirements for residential districts vary by housing type
and, in the case of multiple-family housing, unit size. Parking standards for residential uses are
the same regardless of occupancy (that is, regardless of whether a dwelling unit is used as a
group home or community care facility). Two spaces are required per dwelling unit in the R-1
and R-2 zones, while 1.5 spaces or one space per 600 square feet of unit space (whichever is
greater) are required in the R-3 and R-4 zones. Rooming or boarding houses must provide one
parking space per two occupants.
Institutional facilities have different parking standards than dwelling units, however. Institutional
uses must provide one parking space for every three occupants, while uses such as nursing
homes and convalescent hospitals must provide one parking space for every four licensed beds.
These parking requirements do not appear to constrain the location of institutional uses in
Marysville based on the number of uses currently operating in the city.
The City’s parking ratios are reasonable in relation to the likely demand for parking from
different residential uses. These ratios do not act as a constraint to achieving residential densities
otherwise permitted by the City’s zoning standards except, potentially, on some small, infill lots
(see vacant land inventory for further discussion of constraints imposed by such lots). The
maximum parking required for most multiple-family dwelling units is two or fewer spaces since
most multiple-family units contain 1,200 square feet or less.
Location of Parking. Parking must be provided within the buildable portion of the lot, that is,
outside the yard/setback areas. However, up to two of the required parking spaces may be
provided in the front yard on the driveway of a property. This allowance for two parking spaces
in the front yard serves to mitigate the potential constraint of the required location of parking for
small, infill lots.
Parking Improvement Standards. Parking may be covered or uncovered. The City’s
improvement standards do not add significant cost to the development of housing because
parking may be uncovered.
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element               90                                        1/24/2014

Parking Reductions. The Zoning Ordinance does not provide specific exceptions for reduced
parking or allow reduced parking for housing in commercial areas. The City has granted
variances from parking requirements for small lots, housing proposals in the downtown area, and
special needs housing (such as senior housing) when an applicant can show a reduced parking
need. Because the City’s parking requirements are relatively low, the use of the variance
procedure appears to be adequate to mitigate the potential constraint of required parking.
iii. Density Bonuses and Concessions/Incentives
To achieve affordable housing through density increases, the City implements the State’s density
bonus program (Government Code Section 65915) through Chapter 18.97 (Density Bonuses) of
the Zoning Ordinance.
Assembly Bill (AB) 2280 amended the State’s density bonus program. AB 2280 became
effective in September 2008. The bill instituted several changes to the density bonus law. Most
notably, the bill amended the timing for density bonus requests, clarified density bonus
requirements for senior housing, and instituted a 10 percent across the board increase in the
percentage of affordable units that must be included in a project to qualify for incentives. The
City’s zoning requirements have not been updated for consistency with AB 2280. Program One
under Goal Two proposes to bring the City into compliance with current state density bonus law.
iv. Allowance for Housing and Shelter Alternatives
State housing law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites through appropriate
zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various types of housing for
all economic segments of the population. This includes single-family housing, multiple-family
housing, manufactured housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters, and transitional and
supportive housing, among others. While the City permits alternative forms of housing in most
zones, several types of housing (as noted below) are not listed or defined in the Zoning
Ordinance.
Secondary Living Units. A secondary living unit (or second unit) is a separate dwelling unit that
provides complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons. Marysville permits
attached second units in R-1 zones by right, subject to compliance with zoning and parking
standards. Second units are automatically permitted in the R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones.
Detached second units are permitted when the lot is at least 10,000 square feet in size. In
addition, a detached second unit cannot be larger than 40 percent of the living area of the primary
unit or larger than 1,200 square feet (whichever is smaller). Goal One, Program Six is proposed
to require further Zoning Ordinance amendments for second units to comply with state law and
to facilitate second unit production.
Mobile/Manufactured Homes. Mobile homes or manufactured housing offer an affordable
housing option to many low- and moderate-income households and are permitted in the R-1 zone
on permanent foundations. Only those factory-built homes constructed to the standards of the
National Mobile Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 qualify for placement on
foundations. The City imposes the same standards on mobile homes as site-built homes with
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element            91                                         1/24/2014

regard to setbacks, placement, yards, parking, and other zoning requirements. The City
additionally requires that mobile homes contain nonmetallic siding, be at least 20 feet wide, have
roof overhangs of at least 1 foot, have roofing material customarily used for site-built homes, and
have maximum finish floors no more than 25 inches above grade. These standards do not impose
a constraint on the placement of mobile homes or unreasonable cost burdens on mobile home
owners, since new factory-built homes normally comply with the City’s requirements with little
or no modification.
The City’s historic practice has been to allow the placement of mobile homes or manufactured
housing on permanent foundations in any zone that permits single-family homes. Chapter 18.88
of the Zoning Ordinance, which regulates the placement of manufactured housing, only refers to
such housing with respect to the R-1 zone. A minor change to Chapter 18.88 could clarify any
confusion regarding whether manufactured homes may be placed on permanent foundations in
other zones on small lots that can only accommodate one dwelling unit. This change is proposed
in Goal One, Program Two in the Housing Strategy Section of this Housing Element.
Mobile Home Parks. The City’s historic practice has been to interpret the Zoning Ordinance to
permit mobile home parks wherever mobile homes on permanent foundations are allowed. The
Zoning Ordinance does not specifically list mobile home parks as a permitted use in any zone,
however. A minor change to the Zoning Ordinance could clarify the status of mobile home
parks.
Other Housing Types. The Zoning Ordinance does not define farmworker housing or list this
type of shelter as a permitted use in any zone. The Zoning Ordinance does define rescue
missions, which are permitted in specified commercial and industrial zones and have historically
provided overnight shelter for homeless individuals, as well as emergency shelters and
transitional housing, as shown in Table III-4. Marysville’s Zoning Ordinance also has a
provision for Planned Development (PD) districts, which allow any use or combination of uses
subject to an approved development plan (see the section below on flexibility in development
standards).
Renting of Rooms. As noted in Table III-4, the City permits the renting of rooms and the
provision of board. The renting of rooms or the provision of board for up to four persons is
permitted in any residential zone as an accessory use. Boarding houses as a primary use of land
that involve the provision of board for profit for three or more persons are allowed with a use
permit in the R-3 and R-4 zones.
v. Allowances for Persons with Disabilities
As described above, the City provides a wide range of options for the location of community
care facilities, group homes, and institutional care facilities. Community care facilities and group
homes are permitted in all residential zones, while institutional care facilities are permitted in
commercial and manufacturing zones.
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element              92                                        1/24/2014

vi. Agricultural Zoning
The City of Marysville has an agricultural combining district that is used on a limited basis,
typically in conjunction with residential zoning. The purpose of this district is to allow small-
scale animal husbandry, livestock farming, and the sale of agricultural products produced on-site.
This combining of zones was created at a time in the city’s history when there was significant
undeveloped land. With only four vacant properties in the city of 1 acre or more that do not have
approved development applications (see Table III-1), it is unlikely that any significant
agricultural activities of the type that require seasonal farm labor will take place within the
current city limits and generate a need for farm labor housing. However, to comply with the State
Employee Housing Act (Health and Safety Code Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6), the City has
proposed additional requirements in Goal One, Program Two to allow employee housing by right
without discretionary review in all zones allowing single-family residential development and to
allow employee housing up to 12 units or 36 beds in all zones allowing agricultural uses.
vii. Flexibility in Development Standards
The Zoning Ordinance contains a provision for planned development districts, generally on 5
acres or more. The currently mapped PD zone in the city has been developed over the years, with
the last development an 18-unit townhouse project on 1.15 acres approved in 2002. There are
currently two larger parcels left in the PD zone, which will likely be developed as multifamily
housing.
Any land use allowed in a residential, commercial, or M-1 district is permitted in a PD zone
subject to the approval of a use permit. If the planned development will create individual parcels
within the development, the minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet. The PD district allows
buildings of up to 35 feet (2.5 stories). Parking requirements are based on the proposed uses and
are generally the same as required for uses in the underlying zone (See MC 18.60). Yard and
setback requirements are similar to those for residential zones.
The PD zone includes a use permit requirement; however several developments have been
approved utilizing existing PD development, while allowing site design flexibility. The PD
district provides developers with an opportunity to create projects that vary from the strict
application of the City’s zoning standards, are creative, and better meet the development needs of
the City. Due to the small amount of large vacant parcels, the minimum size requirement of 5
acres means that planned developments are a limited option within the current city limits. The
height limit of 35 feet further restricts the feasibility of using planned developments for high-
density multifamily housing that could be affordable to low- and moderate-income households.
An application for a residential development on PD zoned site shall include, at a minimum, the
following information and accompanied by the corresponding filing fee:
(a) A map or maps showing:
       (1) Topography of the land including contour intervals as required by the board of zoning
       adjustment;
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element              93                                     1/24/2014

      (2) Proposed basic street system and lot design;
      (3) Areas, if any, proposed to be dedicated or reserved for parks, playgrounds, parkways,
      school sites, public or quasi-public buildings and other such uses;
      (4) Areas proposed for commercial uses, off-street parking, multiple and single-family
      dwellings and all other uses proposed to be established within the district;
      (5) Proposed locations of buildings on the land;
      (6) General elevations or perspective drawings of all proposed buildings and structures
      other than single-family residences;
      (7) General plans for storage and disposal of waste material;
      (8) Tentative plans for fire protection facilities;
      (9) Other data and information which ad necessary.
In approving the use permit for residential development in the PD zone, the planning
commission must make written findings that the proposed development is in accordance with the
objectives of the zoning ordinance and the purposes of the PD zone in which the site is located;
and that the proposed development is not detrimental or injurious to the people, property, and
improvements in the neighborhood.
The use permit requirements have not proven to be a constraint on housing development on PD
zoned sites and the lack of development on the remaining sites is likely a result of the recent
economic downturn.
The City also has a Planned Unit Development provision, which is intended to provide flexibility
in the regulations for the underlying zone to allow “diversified and innovative development
designs.” These provisions may be applied to developments of any size.
viii. Nonconforming Uses
The City allows residential property owners to continue nonconforming residential uses and to
make needed repairs or alterations to maintain the residential uses. Needed repairs or alterations
may include building modifications needed for accessibility by persons with disabilities.
Nonconforming residential uses may also be expanded or reconstructed so long as the
modifications do not increase the existing nonconformity or cause a conforming aspect of a use
to become nonconforming with zoning standards. As noted previously, modifications to
buildings or the construction of structures such as access ramps needed for accessibility by
persons with disabilities is not considered by the City to be an increase in nonconformity or the
creation of a new nonconformity.
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element              94                                     1/24/2014

e. Off-Site Improvement Standards
Site improvements are an important component of new development and include roads, water,
sewer, and other infrastructure necessary to serve the new development. Improvement
requirements are regulated by the City’s Subdivision Ordinance. Within the existing city limits,
off-site improvement requirements are typically limited because the infrastructure needed to
serve infill development is already in place. Where off-site improvements are required, they
typically relate to local improvements to existing facilities to accommodate higher-density
development or to repair or replace aged infrastructure.
i. Street Improvements
Requirements typically having the greatest impact on housing cost are street improvement
standards. The cost of providing streets for new residential developments, in turn, is primarily
influenced by the required right-of-way width, pavement width, and pavement improvement
standards.
Table III-5 summarizes that City’s right-of-way and pavement requirements for the hierarchy of
streets. The right-of-way and pavement requirements allow for slightly narrower streets in
residential areas than in many communities. Minimum pavement widths of 50 feet or more for
secondary streets and 40 or more feet for minor streets are more common among local
jurisdictions. The City does not require alleys for new residential development, but does permit
alleys according to the minimum improvement standards in the Subdivision Ordinance.
Required street improvements include cubs, gutters, and sidewalks of at least 4 feet in width. The
minimum sidewalk improvement standard is consistent with accessibility requirements for
persons with disabilities and is not excessive in light of the need for ensuring minimum
pedestrian access in residential areas. Planting strips may be required for secondary or major
streets, but are not required for minor streets that serve the immediate neighborhood only.

             Source: Marysville Subdivision Ordinance, Section 17.28.030
ii. Drainage Requirements
The City requires developers to pay the entire cost of all on-site storm drainage, up to a 24-inch-
diameter drainage line, plus catch basins and other on-site drainage facilities that may be needed.
The City also requires developers to pay a pro rata share of the cost of area-wide drainage
facilities. There are no drainage impact fees within the existing city limits (see next section on
permit and development impact fees).
iii. Sanitary Sewers
Marysville requires developers to install sanitary sewer lines that connect to the City’s sewer
system. Septic tanks and other on-site sanitary systems are not allowed except in cases of
physical or economic hardship. Developers may also be required to pay a pro rata share of sewer
trunk lines or improvements to existing lines serving a larger area.
iv. Water Lines
Developers are required to install water mains and fire hydrants according to a plan approved by
the City Engineer and Fire Chief. Developers may also be required to pay for a pro rata share of
water trunk lines or improvements to existing lines serving a larger area.
f. Permit and Impact Fees
Requiring developers to construct site improvements and/or pay pro rata shares toward the
provision of infrastructure, public services, and school facilities will increase the cost of
developing homes and the final sales price or rent of housing. However, payment of fees is
necessary to maintain an adequate level of services and facilities, and more importantly, to
protect public health, safety, and welfare. Based on a review of fees in neighboring jurisdictions
and discussions with local developers, development fees in Marysville are very reasonable and
generally much lower than most other cities in the region.
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element                  96                                  1/24/2014

The City of Marysville collects development fees to cover the costs of providing the necessary
services and infrastructure related to new development. The school district collects additional
fees to pay for facilities. The City does not require pro rata payments for off-site extension of the
water, sewer, and storm drain systems, but does require a sewer connection fee reflecting the
increased capacity requirement for the wastewater treatment facilities. It does require the
developer to construct all internal streets, sidewalks, curb, gutter, affected portions of off-street
arterials, and other standard conditions. New residential construction will either occur as infill on
scattered lots throughout the central part of the city, and the infrastructure and public services
and facilities are already in place.
Table III-6 identifies the typical development fees for single-family and multifamily housing.
Note that impact fees for schools are set by the State and by the school district. Excluding
building permit and inspection fees, total fees for a small single-family home total less than
$6,000, including a State-mandated school fee of $2,568 (equivalent to 43 percent of the entire
fee) or about 8 percent of the construction cost (excluding land, land preparation, and other
development costs) of a new home. The fees for a small multifamily unit total about $3,600,
including a State-mandated $1,284 school fee (equivalent to 36 percent of the entire fee) or 10
percent of the construction cost. The City does not charge any other planning or development
impact fees. These fees are very low compared to most other cities in the Sacramento region and
do not represent a significant financial constraint to new housing development.

g. Development Permit Procedures
i. Project Approval Time Frames
Development review and permit processing are necessary steps to ensure that residential
construction proceeds in an orderly manner. However, the time and cost of permit processing and
review can be a constraint to housing development if they place an undue burden on the
developer.
The permitting and review process for residential projects in Marysville includes an optional pre-
application review meeting, submittal of the application, a review for completeness by Planning
Department staff, review by the Design Review Board (subcommittee of the Historic
Preservation Commission) and other City agencies, and review and approval by the Planning
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element                  98                                             1/24/2014
Commission and, if necessary, the City Council. However, the time necessary for review
depends on the complexity of the project and whether an exception from development standards,
existing land use, or operating conditions is requested. As an example, the time period necessary
for environmental review may vary substantially depending whether an environmental impact
report (EIR) or a negative declaration is required or the project is exempt from environmental
review. For those projects that involve multiple requests, all the applications are processed
concurrently whenever possible.
Because most residential development projects in Marysville are relatively small (1 to 20 units)
and located on vacant infill parcels or sites being reused, the permit review process is much less
complex than in communities in which residential development occurs primarily through large,
master planned or specific planned developments. Few residential projects require an EIR, which
greatly reduces the total time required for project approval. In most cases, these projects are
exempt from any environmental review. Most residential projects can be approved in as little as
30 days (for a single-lot development) to as much as six months (for a single-family subdivision
involving a tentative and final map). Therefore, the time frames for review and approval of
residential applications do not constitute a significant constraint. Between 30 and 60 days of the
time required to approve more complex projects is due to Planning Commission review and
approval.
Examples of the typical time from submittal of a complete application to final planning
approvals are summarized below based on three residential developments approved by the City
within the past 12 months. These three projects represent the typical range of zoning,
subdivision, design review, public works, and other approvals necessary for infill or reuse
projects in the city. In recent years, reductions in staffing have extended the approval times
beyond normal. However, the City is considering changes in its review process to again reduce
those time frames. Table III-7 summarizes typical time frames for various planning approvals.

ii. Architectural and Design Review
Proposals involving new development or exterior modifications to buildings in the Design or
historic preservation overlay zones (which comprise about 34 percent of the city) require design
review. Minor modifications of buildings involving work that does not significantly change the
character or appearance of a building may be approved through a staff-level review. Other
projects require review by a subcommittee of the Historic Preservation Commission that serves
as the City’s Architectural Review Board (ARB). Most proposals for modifications to existing
buildings fall within the definition of minor modifications, including modifications to improve
accessibility to persons with disabilities, and are relatively easy and quick to approve. Staff and
Historic Preservation Commission decisions may be appealed to the Planning Commission.
The general criteria for design review are:
   Compliance with applicable planning policies and zoning standards.
   Compatibility of proposed project design with buildings in the vicinity.
   Consideration of architectural factors such as building height and bulk in relation to nearby
    buildings, color and materials, site layout and building orientation in relation to open areas,
    and the appropriateness of signs, exterior lighting, and graphics.
   Compatibility of site improvements, landscaping, and other features with other parcels in the
    vicinity.
The City’s design review policies, as stated in the Design Review Manual, focus on the
restoration and preservation of the original historic and architectural character of buildings and
the compatibility of architectural styles, materials, building massing and articulation, and colors
of new buildings to existing buildings in a neighborhood. The City does not require expensive or
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element             100                                      1/24/2014

time-consuming design or construction techniques in new residential development, nor does the
City use the design review process to reduce the allowable number of dwelling units otherwise
allowed under the Zoning Ordinance.
Design review policies can add to the cost of rehabilitating and/or converting historic buildings
for residential use, due to the City’s preference to restore the original design elements of a
historic building or use new elements consistent with the original. The City can mitigate this
additional cost by providing financial assistance for the preservation of significant buildings that
will be used for housing or assisting property owners in obtaining state or federal funds. The City
has provided this type of assistance in the past through its façade improvement program and the
use of state and federal grants for which the City has applied.
The City can also offset the cost by approving exceptions or variances that allow a property
owner to construct more dwelling units and/or less parking. The City has done the latter in one
recent project by reducing parking requirements for the conversion of a historic building to 16
residential units.
The City design review policies include:
   Uncovering and restoring or matching original façade design details.
   Restoring original design or configuration of first-floor storefronts.
   Coordinating the design of new exterior parts or elements of a building with the original.
   Proper repair and maintenance of original brickwork.
   Use of windows and window treatments similar to, or compatible with, the original window
    design.
   Restoration and maintenance of cornices.
   Selection of colors consistent with the original period/architecture of the building and
    compatible with surrounding buildings.
   Restoration or replacement of doors in a style similar to, or compatible with, the original
    period and architecture of the building.
The design review process that requires ARB review is estimated to take up to 6 to 8 weeks for a
typical project. Minor design review by City staff or the ARB can be completed within 14 days.
The required ARB review and public hearing occur concurrently with other ARB reviews. In
most cases, developments require only one review by the Architectural Review Board. Fees to
cover the cost of design review are typically less than $100 per unit for a multi-unit project and
do not significantly add to the cost of residential development. Therefore, the City does not
consider design review to represent a significant financial or time constraint to the provision of
affordable housing.

In two examples of residential projects that required design review, a 16-unit conversion
approved in March 2002 and an 18-unit townhouse project approved in August 2002, the City
required the following:
    Submittal of site plan, building elevations, and landscaping plan to show consistency of the
     building configuration, massing, fencing design, and articulation with surrounding uses.
    Approval of exterior colors, materials, window/door types and treatments, and lighting
     fixtures.
While these examples are somewhat out of date, they still represent the current design review
process at the City.
iii. Use Permits
Chapter 18.72 of the Marysville Municipal Code regulates the granting of use permits by the
City. The City has one process and set of standards for projects that require use permits,
including community care facilities for seven or more persons, institutional group homes, and
other housing and shelter alternatives that require use permits. The City has not established a
separate process for the approval of such uses or separate criteria that are imposed on these uses
but not on other uses of a similar nature.
Use permits are approved by the Planning Commission and may be revocable, conditional, or
valid for a specified time period. The Planning Commission conducts a public hearing prior to
making a decision on a use permit application. The Planning Commission’s decision may be
appealed to the City Council. The criteria for approving use permits are nonspecific and require:
    Consistency with the objectives of the Zoning Ordinance and the purpose of the district in
     which a use is located.
    Compliance with the zoning standards of the district in which a proposed use will be located.
    Finding that the proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety, morals, comfort,
     and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use
     or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements.
The City’s use permit process, while typical of many communities, does not specify the
conditions under which a particular use may be permitted. A review of the City’s implementation
of the use permit process suggests that conditions imposed on applicants reflect compliance with
zoning standards, hours of operation, creation of noise or other off-site impacts, site access,
signage, transportation of clients, and other off-site issues. The lack of specificity creates the
potential for inconsistent or arbitrary decisions, which could be reduced through specific criteria
in the Zoning Ordinance. To differentiate between uses requiring full Planning Commission
review and those that can be reviewed at the staff level Goal Two, Program Five is proposed to
establish procedures for an administrative use permit (AUP).

iv. Process for Requesting Reasonable Accommodations
The City has established a process whereby individuals with disabilities may request reasonable
accommodations for compliance with zoning, subdivision, and building standards. Through the
City’s customary application process, a person with disabilities may request a use permit
(described above), a permit to continue or expand a nonconforming residential use, or a permit to
construct accessibility improvements within a yard or setback area. The City publishes
information on its permit procedures in the form of brochures that are available at the permit
counter at City Hall. City staff are available at the permit counter to answer questions about
procedures for special accommodations under the City’s Zoning Ordinance. Goal 2, Program Six
proposes to amend the City’s Zoning Ordinance to include specific standards for a reasonable
accommodation procedure.
h. Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Marysville has adopted the Uniform Building Code (UBC), which establishes
standards and requires inspections at various stages of construction to ensure code compliance.
Although these standards and the time required for inspections increase housing production costs
and may impact the viability of rehabilitation of older properties that are required to be brought
up to current code standards, the intent of the codes is to provide structurally sound, safe, and
energy-efficient housing. The City has not adopted amendments to the code that could affect the
ability of persons with disabilities to make accessibility modifications.
The City’s Building Department is responsible for enforcing both state and City regulations
governing maintenance of all buildings and property. Most code enforcement complaints
affecting housing are related to the city’s older housing stock located primarily in one of the
city’s Redevelopment project areas.
The City recognizes the unique needs of persons with disabilities and seeks to accommodate
those needs through its approach to code enforcement. The greatest challenge to achieving this
balance is in the restoration or conversion of historic buildings. By their nature, older buildings
were not constructed for accessibility to persons with disabilities or for use as group homes with
supportive services. Building modifications and upgrades over the years often made these
buildings less accessible or less suited to the needs of persons with disabilities.
The City allows property owners great latitude in making interior modifications to historic
buildings to increase their accessibility and utility for persons with disabilities. In its approach to
design review, the City also allows property owners to make exterior modifications to increase
accessibility.
i. Environmental, Infrastructure, and Public Service Constraints
Environmental factors and a lack of necessary infrastructure or public services can constrain
residential development in a community by increasing costs and reducing the amount of land
suitable for housing construction. This section summarizes and analyzes the most pertinent
constraints to housing in Marysville.
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element              103                                         1/24/2014

Water Service
Water service in the city is provided by the California Water Service Company (CWS) through
13 wells. These wells have a design capacity to deliver 6,400 gallons of water per minute with a
storage capacity of 250,000 gallons, which is sufficient to meet recent demands of 223 gallons
per person per day. Within the current city limits, the CWS has adequate pumping, delivery, and
storage capacity to serve existing users and projected demand from increased residential and
commercial demand. Factoring in a 20 percent reduction in per-capita water use under Senate
Bill X7-7, groundwater supplies should be sufficient to meet future demand.
Drainage and Flood Control
Marysville is located at the confluence of the Yuba and Feather rivers and is entirely surrounded
by a series of levees that provide 500-year flood protection. Within the existing city limits,
stormwater runoff drains into three retention areas: detention basins located at 2nd and F streets
and 17th and Hall streets, and a series of connected lakes, East Lake, Ellis Lake, and North Ellis
Lake. Marysville’s existing community-wide drainage and flood control system is sufficient to
accommodate future development and redevelopment within the current city limits. Property
owners must provide on-site drainage improvements and contribute a pro rata share of the cost of
off-site drainage if required by the proposed projects.
Sewer Service
Within the current city limits, wastewater treatment is provided by a secondary system with
capacity of approximately 1.7 million gallons per day (mgd). This capacity is sufficient to handle
average daily and dry weather flows of around 1.3 mgd with excess capacity to accommodate
Marysville’s future housing needs between 2013 and 2021. Occasionally, wet weather demand
exceeds the maximum treatment capacity, but not with enough frequency to pose a constraint to
future residential development. The City will be connecting to a regional wastewater treatment
facility located at Linda County Water District in 2015. The City is allowed to send 1.8 mgd dry
weather flow to the regional plant, which will allow additional capacity for growth.
Developers must contribute a pro rata share of the improvement or replacement cost of trunk
lines serving proposed projects. The City charges a connection fee to pay for such upgrades.
Within the current city limits, environmental, infrastructure, and public services are not
constraining factors to accommodating the City’s regional allocation under the SACOG Regional
Housing Needs Plan. Although older facilities need regular maintenance and upgrading, the cost
of maintenance and upgrades is paid through user fees, impact fees, and pro rata contributions by
developers. The City’s water and sewer processing and distribution facilities are adequate to
accommodate 445 additional dwelling units within the current city limits.

2. Non-Governmental Constraints
a. Availability of Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race/ethnicity of
the applicants. This applies to all loan applications for home purchases and improvements,
whether financed at market rate or with government assistance.
Tables III-8 and III-9 summarize the disposition of loan applications submitted to financial
institutions for home purchase and home improvement loans in Marysville. Included is the
percentage of loans that are approved and denied by applicants of different income levels. The
status of “other” loans indicates loan applications that were neither approved nor denied, but
were not accepted by the applicant, or those applications that were withdrawn by the applicant.
i. Home Purchase Loans
In 2011, 891 households applied for conventional loans to purchase homes in the Yuba City
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which includes Marysville: 12 percent of applicants were
very low-income households, 22 percent were low-income households, 11 percent were middle
income, 9 percent were moderate income, and 45 percent were above moderate–income
households. Approval rates varied with income, and 65 percent of all loans were approved. Very
low-income households were the least likely to be approved with an approval rate of 59 percent,
while above moderate-income applicants had an approval rate of 68 percent.
During the same period, 1,481 applications were submitted for the purchase of homes in the
Yuba City MSA through government-backed loans (e.g., FHA, VA). While above moderate-
income households made up a majority of applicants for conventional loans, most government-
backed loan applicants (31 percent) were low-income households. Very low-income households
comprised 14 percent, moderate-income households made up 20 percent, and above moderate-
income households were 23 percent of applicants. The approval rate for government-backed
loans was 71 percent and also varied with income; 66 percent of very low-income households
were approved, compared to 74 percent of above moderate-income households receiving
approval.

To address potential private market lending constraints and expand homeownership and home
improvement opportunities, the City of Marysville offers and/or participates in a variety of
homebuyer and rehabilitation assistance programs. Such programs assist lower- and moderate-
income residents by increasing access to favorable loan terms to purchase or improve their
homes. Section IV of the Housing Element provides more detailed information on the type and
extent of programs available.
b. Cost of Land
A key factor determining housing cost is the price of raw land and any necessary improvements.
The price of residential land in Marysville is directly affected by the city’s inability to expand
geographically. A review of property listings on Zillow.com (in March of 2013) indicates that
residential land costs in the Marysville area vary significantly by location and site characteristics.
Of the five parcels of land for sale at the time of review, three were located in rural areas and two
in more urbanized locations. The three rural listings were larger and less expensive, ranging from
about 1 million to 2.3 million square feet in size and from $150,000 to $500,000, or $0.06 to
$0.52 per square foot. The two urban parcels were much smaller and cost significantly more,
with a cost of over $8 per square foot in both cases. Land write-downs can be used by
Redevelopment agencies to support the development of affordable housing in exchange for
affordability controls.

   c. Construction Cost
   i. Single-Family Homes
   Many factors can affect the cost of building a single-family house, including the type of
   construction, custom versus tract development, materials, site conditions, finishing details,
   amenities, square footage, and structural configuration. These factors create a wide variation in
   construction costs, from as little as $75 per square foot for basic construction to as much as $400
   for high-quality custom construction. A basic, 1,200-square-foot starter home could be
   constructed in Marysville for as little as $100,000. Including land cost of about $48,000 for a
   6,000-square-foot lot in an urbanized area, permit and development impact fees of roughly
   $8,000, site preparation, and other miscellaneous costs, the minimum cost of producing a 1,200-
   square-foot single-family home in Marysville is estimated to be between $150,000 and $160,000.
   Table III-10 compares construction costs for a 1,200–square-foot home, a 1,700-square-foot
   home, and a 2,000-square-foot home.

ii. Multifamily Construction
Although there has been little recent multifamily development in Marysville, contacts with
multifamily housing developers in the region indicate that construction costs for multifamily
housing units, excluding land and site preparation development costs, fees, and related expenses,
are approximately $125 per square foot. As noted in Section II, in the subsection titled Analysis
of Assisted Housing Projects At Risk, the average cost of replacing a rental housing unit,
including all costs related to construction, land development, fees, and builder profit, is estimated
to be $240,733. Table III-11 compares costs for various sizes of multifamily units.

A. EVALUATION OF PAST ACHIEVEMENTS
This chapter documents the City’s achievements under the 2003 Housing Element with respect
to the actions and objectives contained in the element, describes the relative success of the City’s
efforts to implement the 2003 programs, and contains recommendations for program changes to
address current and projected needs and state requirements between 2013 and 2021. The review
of the City's previous Housing Strategy is provided in Table IV-1 on the following page.
Given Marysville’s limited financial, staff, and land resources, the City has made good progress
in addressing much of its affordable housing needs and accommodating its share of regional
housing needs under the SACOG Regional Housing Needs Plan. The City must still make
significant progress in the following areas, which are the focus of the updated Housing Element:
    a. Continue to address the challenges of providing housing on small, infill sites and
         underutilized properties.
    b. Continue to improve housing conditions through a combination of financial incentives for
         rehabilitation and code enforcement, including rehabilitation through the Neighborhood
         Stabilization Program.
    c. Provide housing opportunities for a variety of special needs groups including seniors,
         those in need of group quarters housing and single-room occupancy units, the disabled,
         and homeless.

 Goal One: To Provide for the City’s Regional Share of New Housing for All Income Groups
 Program One: Adequate Sites for Housing, in Particular Rental Housing
Description. The City contains approximately 5 acres of vacant land zoned for residential use, 3.4 acres of land zoned for
commercial/manufacturing use, and 6.1 acres of land zoned for planned development (see Chapter III, Available Land to
Accommodate Housing). Most of the land is designated in the City's General Plan for medium to high density residential use or
permits medium to high density residential uses, and could accommodate up to 271 dwelling units. There is also an abundance of
buildings within the downtown area that could accommodate significant housing. Although at the present time, zoning does not
appear to constrain the development of affordable housing, the size and configuration of existing vacant lots in the City is a
potential constraint.
Proposed Actions. To ensure the that small size of most parcels does not constitute a constraint to residential development, to
encourage maximum utilization of the vacant parcels, and to encourage multifamily development on non-residential parcels
identified in Table III-1, the City will undertake the following actions:

 Program Two: Development of Sites for Special Needs Housing.
 Description. The most critical need for City involvement is to increase the availability of affordable housing and supportive services
 for special needs groups, including large families, seniors, local workers in low-wage industries (including agriculture), persons with
 disabilities, and single-parent households. Housing for these special needs groups will likely include a variety of housing types,

 including multifamily, residential care facilities (such as group homes), transitional housing, and temporary shelter. To facilitate the
 siting of housing for special needs groups, Marysville needs to refine several sections of its Zoning Ordinance to specify appropriate
 locations and conditions.
 Proposed Actions. The City will continue its current zoning practices of permitting a wide range of alternative housing and shelter
 facilities in residential and non-residential zones, including second units by right in single-family zones, residential care facilities in
 residential and non-residential zones (facilities of six or fewer by right in residential zones), boarding houses in R-4 zones, and
 apartment hotels, group care facilities, institutional group care facilities, rescue missions, and other special needs housing in non-
 residential zones. The City will also clarify and expand the types of housing and shelter options listed in the Zoning Ordinance
 through the following revisions to its Zoning Ordinance:

standards as site built homes.
Proposed Actions. The City will continue to allow
manufactured homes on land zoned for residential
use, subject to the same development standards as
site built housing, according to the requirements of
state law. Marysville will provide information at the
City’s permit counter regarding the standards for
manufactured homes and post information on the
City’s web site regarding allowance for manufactured
homes.
Goal Two: Encourage the Provision of Affordable Housing
Program One: Density Bonuses and Other Incentives
Description. Density bonuses provide a developer with additional dwelling units in exchange for the provision of housing affordable
to low- and moderate-income households. State law provides that if a developer proposes to include at least 20 percent of the
dwelling units in a project at rents/prices that are affordable to low-income households, or 10 percent of the dwelling units in a
project at rents/prices that are affordable to very low-income households, the local jurisdiction must permit a 25 percent density
bonus and offer other development incentives. Affordable housing providers have not made extensive use of density bonuses in
Marysville because the maximum densities permitted by the City are relatively high in relation to the size and configuration of
available sites (up to 24 units per acre in the R-3 zone, up to 48 units per acre in the R-4 zone, and no upper limit on dwelling unit
density in nonresidential zones). The City has, instead, focused on regulatory and financial incentives, such as approving exceptions
and variances to zoning standards to financially assisting affordable housing projects, to increase the feasibility of producing
affordable housing.
Proposed Action. The City will offer a 25 percent density bonus, if needed to facilitate the construction of housing affordable to
lower-income households, for any project in which at least 20 percent the units are affordable to low-income households and/or at
least 10 percent of the units are affordable to very low-income households. In addition, the City will offer the following incentives to
projects meeting the above criteria:

agency applicant. The City will also consider
providing financial support through the MCDA and/or
staff support in providing needed information for
funding requests to increase the likelihood of
receiving state or federal funding. To promote its
application assistance efforts, a representative of the
City will meet annually and additionally during the
year as needed, with nonprofit and for-profit
affordable housing providers to determine their
interest in, and plans for, constructing affordable
housing in Marysville. Based on the clients to be
served by proposed projects and the type of housing
and services to be incorporated into funding
requests, the City will assist the housing provider in
identifying the most appropriate state and/or federal
funding sources.

or mortgage credit certificates to assist low- and
moderate-income homebuyers. Because the bonds
are issued through a public agency, the investors pay
no income tax on the interest earned; the bonds carry
a lower interest rate than would otherwise be
available to the borrower. Housing financed through
tax-exempt bonds can assist both ownership and
rental housing. To use this program, a public agency
must first locate an interested developer, apply for
and receive an allocation from the California Debt
Limit Allocation Committee, and locate a bond
underwriter to assist in the issuance of the bonds.
The process typically takes one year to 18 months
from the initial application to the availability of funds
for project development/financing. Receipt of an
allocation requires a deposit by the public agency
applicant. Other, significant costs are also involved in
submitting an application. Because of the technical
complexities and costs of participating in tax-exempt
bond or mortgage credit certificate programs, many
small cities and counties pool their resources with
other public agencies and jointly participate through
a consortium.
Proposed Action. The City will determine the
feasibility of participating in a consortium with other
public agencies to take advantage of tax-exempt
bond financing or mortgage credit certificates as a

 the conversion of hotels and motels to permanent

 identified vacant properties, commercial structures,

 surrounding areas that have the greatest potential for
 the development of housing. Much of the housing
 that may be developed on these sites will require
 subsidies to ensure their long-term affordability for

 Program Three: Rehabilitation/Acquisition of Substandard Dwelling Units
 Description. The City has identified over 1,200 dwelling units in need of rehabilitation. Most of these substandard dwelling units are
 occupied by low-income households. Most low-income owners-occupants lack sufficient financial resources to obtain private
 funding for home repairs. Owners of rental units occupied by low-income households often cannot financially support repairs to
 dwelling units from the rents they can charge. The City’s program has significantly improved the condition of housing in Marysville,
 but there are still a significant number of housing units in need of rehabilitation.

Proposed Actions: The City of Marysville will seek
funding to pay for the relocation expenses of low-
income residents displaced as a result of the
condemnation or required vacation of dwelling units
due to code violations. The City will require that
displaced residents be given the right of first refusal
to return to the dwelling units upon their repair. The
City will follow the requirements of state law
regarding the demolition or conversion of dwelling
units occupied by lower-income households in the
City's Redevelopment area.

B. GOALS, POLICIES, AND PROGRAMS
This section of the Housing Element contains the City’s goals, policies, and proposed plan of
actions to implement those goals and policies. The goals and policies reflect the needs identified
in Section II and resources and constraints identified in Section III. Each proposed implementing
action contains a description of the intended action, an explanation of the responsible agency,
possible sources of funding (if applicable), the time frame during which the program would take
effect, and anticipated results. Whenever possible, the anticipated results have been expressed in
quantified terms.
The philosophy underlying the proposed policies and programs is that Marysville’s role in the
development of housing is one of the facilitator. The City can lay the planning groundwork for
housing construction, provide a favorable regulatory environment for housing, apply for
financial assistance from state and federal agencies, and use the limited amount of
Redevelopment housing set-aside funds available to support affordable housing programs.
Whether or not appropriate amount and types of housing are constructed will depend primarily
on the decisions of home builders and nonprofit housing corporations. The City can be a partner
in this process, however.

need, many of the vacant parcels in the city are less than 1 acre in size. While at the present time
zoning does not appear to constrain the development of affordable housing, the size and
configuration of existing vacant lots in the city is a potential constraint. To ensure that the small
size of most parcels does not constitute a constraint to residential development, to encourage
maximum utilization of the vacant parcels, and to encourage multifamily development on
nonresidential parcels identified in Table III-1, the City will undertake the following actions:
    a. Continue to implement an infill housing strategy based on the results of the 2004
         Downtown Strategic Plan. The infill housing strategy will consist of two components: (1)
         provide regulatory and financial incentives as described in #b and #c below to encourage
         the development of housing in the downtown area, and (2) continue applying for one or
         more state or federal planning grants to assist low-income housing providers in
         identifying specific properties, design alternatives, development costs, and funding
         sources for the conversion of residential hotels, design alternatives for infill properties,
         and the conversion of second-story commercial space to residential use.

    b. Continue to implement regulatory incentives for housing through:
             Flexible application of the Zoning Ordinance, including approval of exceptions or
              variances to zoning standards (such as minimum lot dimension, parking, yard, or
              setback requirements) when necessary to permit financially feasible residential
              development; and
             Allowance of multifamily housing in nonresidential zones through a use permit
              process, including housing in the downtown area above commercial establishments
              and the conversion of commercial structures to residential use, subject to the same
              development standards as nonresidential uses, which generally allow greater
              residential densities than in the R-3 and R-4 zones.
    c. Continue to implement financial incentives that include applications for state planning
         grants, applications for state and federal project development grants, and support of grant
         and loan applications by housing providers.
    d. Utilize the downtown parking district when appropriate and continue to implement
         strategies to ensure that housing in the downtown area can be developed with adequate
         parking throughout the district.
    e. Continue to outreach to owners of adjacent vacant properties to discuss opportunities for
         lot consolidation in conjunction with housing development proposals to increase the
         feasibility of producing housing on small, infill parcels.
    f. Inform property owners and developers of regulatory and financial incentives through
         direct contacts with housing providers in the Marysville area, the distribution of a
         brochure explaining the City’s residential property development standards at the City’s
         permit counter and posting of information on the City’s website, and mail to owners of
         record of vacant and underutilized properties.
    g. To ensure the City has enough land to meet its Regional Housing Needs Allocation
         (RHNA), continue to monitor the vacant land inventory throughout the planning period.

PROGRAM TWO: Development of Sites for Special Housing Needs
As feasible, the City will support the work of housing providers to address the housing needs of
special needs groups (including those with developmental disabilities) and will seek to assist in
meeting these special housing needs through a combination of regulatory incentives (including
those presented in Goal One, Program One), zoning standards, new housing construction
programs, and supportive services programs.
The City will continue its current zoning practices of permitting a wide range of alternative
housing and shelter facilities in residential and nonresidential zones, including second units by
right in single-family zones, residential care facilities in residential and nonresidential zones
(facilities of six or fewer by right in residential zones), boarding houses in R-4 zones, and
apartment hotels, group care facilities, institutional group care facilities, rescue missions, and
other special needs housing in nonresidential zones.
The City will also clarify and expand the types of housing and shelter options listed in the
Zoning Ordinance through the following revisions to its Zoning Ordinance:
    a. Amend Chapter 18.04 to add definitions for “farmworker housing” and “single-room
         occupancy dwelling unit” consistent with definitions for these types of shelter in state
         law, as applicable (including section 50517.5 for farmworker housing).
    b. Amend the following sections of the Zoning Ordinance to specify locations and
         development standards under which these types of shelter will be permitted, as described
         below.
             To comply with the State Employee Housing Act (Health and Safety Code Sections
              17021.5 and 17021.6), the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to treat employee
              housing that serves six or fewer persons as a single family structure and permitted in
              the same manner as other single family structures of the same type in the same zone
              (Section 17021.5). The Zoning Ordinance will also be amended to treat employee
              housing consisting of no more than 12 units or 36 beds as an agricultural use and
              permitted in the same manner as other agricultural uses in the same zone (Section
              17021.6) in zones where agricultural uses are permitted.

             Permit single-room occupancy dwelling units (SROs) with a use permit in the C-2
              and C-3 zones. SROs are one housing type appropriate for extremely low-income
              households.
    c. Amend Chapter 18.88 to comply with Government Code Sections 65852.3 through
         65852.5 to permit the placement of manufactured homes on permanent foundations in
         any zone that permits single-family homes. Additionally, per Government Code Section
         65852.7, permit mobile home parks (including condominium and cooperative parks)
         wherever mobile homes are allowed on permanent foundations, subject to the same
         zoning and parking standards as other residential uses in those zones.
Administration/Funding: Planning Department
Funding: General Fund
Time Frame: Amend Zoning Ordinance within two years of Housing Element adoption.
PROGRAM THREE: Emergency Shelters
Pursuant to Senate Bill 2 (SB 2), the City will allow emergency shelters as a permitted use (by
right) in the Light Industrial (M-1) zone without a conditional use permit or other discretionary
review (except for design review). Emergency shelters will be subject only to development and
management standards that apply to residential or commercial development in the M-1 zone (per
(Government Code Section 65583(a)(4)). There are 12 sites available in the M-1 zone totaling
7.7 acres. Sites in the M-1 zone are located in areas of the city close to transit and services.
Administration/Funding: Planning Department
Funding: General Fund
Time Frame: Amend Zoning Ordinance within one year of Housing Element adoption.
PROGRAM FOUR: Transitional and Supportive Housing
To comply with SB 2, the City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to treat transitional housing and
supportive housing as a residential use and only subject to those restrictions that apply to other
residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone. The amendments will apply to the R-1,
R-2, R-3, R-4 zones and all other zones that allow residential dwellings. For example,
transitional housing located in a single family home must be treated the same as other single
family homes in the same zone. The City will include in its Zoning Ordinance separate
definitions of transitional and supportive housing as defined in Government Code Sections
65582(f), (g) and (h).

PROGRAM FIVE. Homeless Services
The City of Marysville will continue to cooperate with homeless shelter providers to meet the
needs of individuals and families without permanent housing. In addition, the City will support
the development of transitional housing facilities to assist such persons in returning to permanent
housing. This program consists of the following actions:
    The City will allow for the expansion of existing homeless facilities and the siting of
     transitional housing facilities under its Zoning Ordinance (see Program #2, Goal 1).
     Homeless/transitional housing facilities have, in the past, been permitted in multifamily and
     commercial zones, although not specifically defined or named as such in the City’s Zoning
     Ordinance.
    The City will meet with homeless shelter and service providers to determine future siting
     needs and the appropriate locations for such facilities.
Administration: Planning Department
Funding: General Fund, permit fees
Time Frame: Current and ongoing, 2013–2021; meet with homeless service providers annually
beginning in first half of 2014.
PROGRAM SIX: Second Dwelling Units
Amend Chapter 18.90 to allow detached second dwelling units by right in all residential zones.
Reduce the minimum lot size for detached second units from 10,000 to 7,000 square feet.
Promote the use of second units through an information flyer available at City Hall and a note
included in the City's utility bill.
Administration: Planning Department
Funding: General Fund, permit fees
Time Frame: Amend the Zoning Ordinance within two years of Housing Element adoption.
Produce flyers and post on the City’s website by March 2014; distribute notice annually through
utility billing and maintain copies on a continuous basis at the City’s permit counter.

Goal Two:          Encourage the Provision of Affordable Housing
POLICIES
Policy One:        Make effective use of state and federal programs and work with
                   nonprofit and for-profit developers to make use of those
                   programs for which the developer must be the applicant.
Policy Three: Provide density bonuses to home builders proposing to include a
                   minimum specified percentage of low- and moderate-income
                   dwelling units within residential developments.
Policy Four:       Work with nonprofit organizations to identify potential projects
                   and sources of funding to develop low- and moderate-income
                   housing.
Policy Five:       Support the Yuba County Housing Authority in its pursuit of
                   funding to maintain and expand the supply of subsidized housing
                   for low-income households.
PROGRAMS
PROGRAM ONE: Density Bonuses and Other Incentives
The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to comply with amendments to Government Code
Section 65915. The City will continue to offer a density bonus if needed to facilitate the
construction of housing affordable to extremely low, very low and low-income households. In
addition, the City will offer the following incentives to projects meeting the above criteria:
   Approve exceptions to, or variances from, the City’s zoning standards appropriate to the site
    conditions and physical/financial circumstances of the proposed project.
   Continue expedited staff review and scheduling of public hearings for projects that require
    Planning and Historic Preservation Commission review.
Administration: Planning Department
Funding: General Fund, permit fees
Time Frame: Amendments to the Zoning Ordinance to comply with state density bonus law will
be made within two years of Housing Element adoption. The additional City incentives will be
available on an ongoing basis as projects qualifying for density bonuses are proposed.

PROGRAM TWO: Pursue Funding Under State and Federal Programs
The City will provide assistance in preparing funding applications for affordable housing
projects serving extremely low, very low and low-income households that require a public
agency applicant. The City will also consider providing financial support through staff support in
providing needed information for funding requests to increase the likelihood of receiving state or
federal funding. City staff is available to meet with nonprofit and for-profit affordable housing
providers to determine their interest in, and plans for, constructing affordable housing in
Marysville, including developing infill sites or converting nonresidential buildings. Based on the
clients to be served by proposed projects and the type of housing and services to be incorporated
into funding requests, the City will assist the housing provider in identifying the most
appropriate state and/or federal funding sources.
Administration: Planning Department, City Administrator, Finance Department
Funding: Various state or federal programs, depending on the clients to be served and the type
of housing to be provided. May include Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and
HOME programs (federal funds administered by the State of California for non-entitlement cities
and counties), the Multifamily Housing Program, California Housing Finance Agency programs
(such as HELP), tax-exempt bond financing, low-income housing tax credits, the Federal Home
Loan Bank Affordable Housing Program, USDA and other funding for farmworker housing, and
various other US Department of Housing and Urban Development programs for special needs
groups.
Time Frame: Annual contact with affordable housing providers, 2013–2021; additional contacts
as needed to discuss project-specific issues.
PROGRAM THREE. Encourage the Production of Housing for Large Families
To address the needs of large families, the City will seek commitments from developers to
include three- and four-bedroom dwellings in project designs for extremely low, very low, and
low-income serving rental housing, except for housing projects specifically designed for seniors
or single adults. This provision will be incorporated into revised Design Review Guidelines. To
increase the financial feasibility of meeting those needs, the City will consider additional tax-
increment funding for large family housing units.
Administration: City Manager, Finance Department
Funding: General Fund
Time Frame: 2013–2021, through pre-application meetings for affordable housing projects that
request City assistance.
PROGRAM FOUR. Joint Effort with Yuba County and Nonprofit Organizations
The City will seek the assistance of the County (including Yuba County Housing Authority) and
nonprofit housing organizations to identify and secure funding sources to develop vacant

properties and to rehabilitate and convert nonresidential buildings to residential use. To
implement this program, the City will meet with representatives from the Housing Authority and
other County organizations to provide information on potential sites and housing development
proposals that would be appropriate for the use of housing vouchers in conjunction with state or
federal new construction or rehabilitation subsidies.
Administration: Planning Department, City Administrator
Funding: General Fund
Time Frame: Conduct initial meetings with the Housing Authority and nonprofit organizations
between April and October 2014. Meet annually thereafter.
PROGRAM FIVE. Administrative Use Permit
In order to facilitate expedited review and be efficient with City resources, the City proposes to
amend Zoning Ordinance Chapter 18.72 to add an administrative use permit (AUP) process to
the Zoning Ordinance. Review under this permit will be at the staff level based on the
regulations and standards in the Zoning Ordinance and will not be considered discretionary. The
City will consider what types of applications will be considered under the AUP during
implementation of this program. Uses allowed with an AUP will be listed in the Zoning
Ordinance sections for applicable zones.
Administration: Planning Department
Funding: General Fund
Time Frame: Amend Zoning Ordinance within two years of Housing Element adoption.
PROGRAM SIX. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
The City will continue to provide a process whereby individuals with disabilities may request
reasonable accommodations for compliance with zoning, subdivision, and building standards.
The City will amend the Zoning Ordinance to include a reasonable accommodation ordinance to
provide exception in zoning and land use for housing for persons with disabilities. Applicants
may request an administrative use permit to continue or expand a nonconforming residential use
or to construct accessibility improvements within a yard or setback area.
The administrative use permit review process will include application of the following decision-
making criteria:
   The request for reasonable accommodation will be used by an individual with a disability
    protected under fair housing laws.
   The requested accommodation is necessary to make housing available to an individual with a
    disability protected under fair housing laws.

    The requested accommodation would not impose an undue financial or administrative burden
     on the City.
    The requested accommodation would not require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the
     City's land-use and zoning program.
    The requested accommodation would reduce barriers and increase visitability on the site.
The City publishes information on its permit procedures in the form of brochures that are
available at the permit counter at City Hall and on the City’s website. City staff are available at
the permit counter to answer questions about procedures for special accommodations under the
City’s Zoning Ordinance.
Responsibility: City Council, Planning Commission, Community Development Department
Funding:           General Fund
Time Frame:        October 2014
PROGRAM SEVEN. CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT MONITORING
Biennially monitor the conditional use permit process to evaluate its potential constraint on
multifamily development in the PD zone. The evaluation will address approvals and denials,
number of submittals or lack of submittals, length of approval, cost and any reductions in the
initially proposed number of units. In addition, the City will gather and consider input from
developers including non-profits. If it is determined that the CUP process poses a constraint to
the development of housing affordable to lower-income households, the City will take necessary
steps to remove or mitigate the constraint such as replacing the CUP process or other similar
action. The City will report on the results of this program through the annual progress report,
required pursuant to Government Code Section 65400.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Funding:           General Fund
Time Frame:        Initial Review in 2014, with biennial review thereafter.
Goal Three.        Improve/Conserve the Existing Supply of Housing
POLICIES
Policy One:        Provide property owners with assistance to inspect and identify
                   code violations in residential buildings.
Policy Two:        Continue to apply for state and federal assistance for housing
                   rehabilitation for low-income households. Rental housing that is

                   repaired with government assistance will remain affordable to
                   lower-income households for a specified period of time.
Policy Three: Require the abatement or demolition of substandard housing that
                   is not economically feasible to repair and which represents a
                   health and safety threat.
Policy Four:       Seek, through code enforcement, the private rehabilitation of
                   substandard dwelling units and provide financial assistance, when
                   available, to owners of dwelling units occupied by lower-income
                   households. In applying this policy, the City will seek to avoid the
                   displacement of lower-income households.
Policy Five:       Periodically survey housing conditions to maintain a current
                   database on housing repair needs.
PROGRAMS
PROGRAM ONE. Code Enforcement and Abatement
The City will initiate appropriate code enforcement action on dwelling units that are so
substandard that they represent an imminent threat to health and safety. The City will require that
property owners comply with building code standards or remove such housing units. If
necessary, the City will abate the unsafe building. These actions will be taken only in the most
extreme cases in which the owner of the dwelling units is unable or unwilling to make necessary
repairs, in which repairs are not feasible, or in which the dwelling unit has been abandoned. In
the interest of preventing properties from falling into disrepair, the City can assist property
owners in addressing building and zoning code deficiencies by providing inspection services.
While most code enforcement actions will occur on a complaints basis and focus on seriously
substandard structures that represent a health or safety threat, some property owners may be
interested in voluntary inspections. The City will, on a request basis, arrange for an inspection of
residential properties’ building code violations that should be corrected. A more comprehensive
voluntary building code inspection would be performed by the Building Department for an
inspection fee that covers the cost of this service.

PROGRAM TWO: Rehabilitation/Acquisition of Substandard Dwelling Units
To encourage private rehabilitation efforts, the City will undertake the following actions:
The City will apply for and/or assist eligible households in applying for various private, state,
and federal sources of funding for housing rehabilitation and home repairs, which would include
the correction of health and safety hazards, weatherization, and the addition of space to alleviate
overcrowding. Owners of rental properties who are assisted in financing the rehabilitation of
their dwelling units will be required to rent the units to lower-income households and to sign a
rent limitation agreement for specified minimum time period.
The City will work with nonprofit housing organizations to identify sources of funding and
arrange for the acquisition and rehabilitation of dwelling units that have been abandoned by their
owners, vacated for an extended period of time, or in cases in which owners are unable to or do
not wish to improve their properties. Acquisition will be by negotiated sale. Dwelling units that
are rehabilitated under this program will be rented to extremely low, very low, and low-income
households. The City will provide assistance to nonprofit organizations in identifying and
securing funds as specified in Goal Two, Program Two.
The City will maintain current information on the condition of dwelling units by periodically
updating its housing conditions database. Approximately every 5 years, the City will resurvey
housing conditions to ensure the currency of its housing conditions information.

POLICIES
Policy One:        The     City    will seek     to   preserve      the    affordable     housing
                   developments in Marysville.
PROGRAMS
PROGRAM ONE: Preservation of At-Risk Housing
The City will continue efforts to mitigate the potential loss of extremely low-, very low-, and
low-income housing units through the conversion of subsidized rental housing projects to
market-rate housing through the following actions:
Marysville 2013-2021 Housing Element             150                                      1/24/2014

     1. At least one year prior to the conversion date, the owner will be required to provide
         written notification to residents of the expected date of loan prepayment or payoff, at
         which time the owner will no longer be restricted in the level of rent that can be charged.
         The notice will also contain an estimate of rent increases at the time rental restrictions no
         longer apply. Residents moving into a housing development during this one-year period
         must also be notified in writing of the pending conversion prior to signing a rental
         agreement.
     2. Property owners will provide relocation assistance to those low-income households who
         are unable to afford rent increases.
     3. If an affordable housing project indicates it is opting out of its affordability restrictions,
         the City will ensure that affected residents receive notification of the owner’s intent and
         will provide nonfinancial assistance with relocation.
     4. The City will solicit interested nonprofit housing corporations to acquire and maintain
         such projects as low-income housing. The City will assist an interested nonprofit housing
         corporation in applying for state or federal assistance for acquisition.

Policy One:        The City will continue to provide information and referral services
                   to individuals with fair housing complaints.
PROGRAMS
PROGRAM ONE: Fair Housing Program
The City will continue its present information and referral services for equal housing
opportunity. These efforts will include contacting interest groups for distributing fair housing
materials, post and provide fair housing information in a variety of community locations such as
the library, bus stops, public counters, and post office. The City will provide published
information from state and federal agencies that investigate housing discrimination complaints.
The City will also assist individuals with complaints in contacting the appropriate agency and
filing a complaint. The City will continue to designate a point of contact at City Hall for referral
information.

Goal Seven:          Promote the Preservation of Historic Residences
POLICY
Policy One:          The City will encourage the preservation of residential buildings
                     with historic or architectural value.
PROGRAMS
PROGRAM ONE:              Document and Preserve Historic Resources
The preservation of historic resources requires proper documentation and maintenance of an
inventory of such resources. The City will undertake the following actions to document and
preserve historic resources:
    a. Maintain a list of residential structures that are of historic or architectural value. The list
         will be updated as new properties become eligible or are identified by local organizations,
         or as the status of existing properties in the inventory change. The City will provide
         copies of the inventory at City Hall upon request.
    b. To preserve historically and architecturally significant buildings, the City will undertake
         the following actions:
             When considering development or rehabilitation activities, the City will evaluate the
              potential impact of such activities on historic properties.
             The City will continue to maintain a historic preservation overlay zone and require
              Planning and Historic Preservation Commission review of significant development
              proposals and significant modifications to historic structures within the zone. The
              City will continue to provide public information on the historic district review process
              at its permit counter and will post such information on the City’s website.
             Property owners who wish to alter or convert historic structures will be required to
              follow state historic preservation guidelines.
             The City may exempt property owners from specific historic preservation
              requirements, to the extent it has the authority to do so, if such requirements would
              conflict with handicapped access, energy conservation, seismic safety retrofitting, or
              if the strict application of historic preservation requirements would impose an
              unreasonable economic hardship on the property owner. Any such decision would be
              made on case-by-case basis.

B. PUBLIC WORKSHOP LETTER
Note: Similar letters will be issued for the public meetings later in the Housing Element Update
process.
February 11, 2013
RE: Housing Element Public Workshop
Dear Interested Parties,
Residents, businesses, property owners, and other interested individuals are invited to attend a
public workshop on February 27, 2013, at the City of Marysville to discuss the City’s Housing
Element update.
Under State law, every city in California is required to adopt a Housing Element that describes
how the City can best meet the community’s housing needs. Cities in Yuba County are required
to have their Housing Elements adopted and certified by the California Department of Housing
and Community Development by October 31, 2013. PMC has been retained by the City of
Marysville to assist with the preparation of the City’s Housing Element.
One of the first steps in this process is gathering input from the community. The workshop will
seek your perspective on Marysville’s housing needs and how we can improve our housing
programs. City staff and PMC will provide an overview of what the Housing Element is and why
it must be updated.
Please join us to share your opinions and learn about this important topic. The workshop will be
held at 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday February 27, 2013, in the Council Chambers, City Hall, 526 C
Street, Marysville. If you have any questions, please contact me at (530) 749-3902.
Sincerely,
David Lamon
City Services Director
City of Marysville

D. DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT REVISIONS IN RESPONSE TO
    INPUT RECEIVED ON THE PUBLIC REVIEW DRAFT HOUSING
    ELEMENT
   Information from the 2013 homeless count was obtained and included in the draft in response
    to several comments requesting updated homeless count information.
   Information was provided about the St. John's Episcopal Church Loaves & Britches Program
    and was included in the draft.
   Incentivization of maintenance of existing and creation of new barrier free housing for those
    with disabilities and consideration of visitability requirements in all new construction and
    when rehabilitating housing units was requested. Criteria related to barrier free features and
    visitability were added to Program Six, Goal Two.
   In response to a comment stating that sites listed in the land inventory for lower-income
    residential development don’t allow residential by-right, a note clarifying that residential uses
    are allowed by right on upper floors in the downtown commercial areas was added to the
    draft.
   In response to a request that more information be provided about why the units constructed
    or approved since 2006 are listed in the respective income level categories, details about
    income category assignments for units constructed or approved since 2006 were added to the
    draft.
   A comment was made that available data on number of farmworkers was not used including
    USDA Agricultural Census, California Agricultural Workers Survey. Information from the
    USDA Agricultural Census was included in the Public Review Draft. The additional data
    sources referenced were reviewed and none of them included Yuba County or Marysville
    specific data. No change was made to the draft in response to this comment.
   To respond to a comment requesting that farmworker needs be more adequately addressed,
    additional text was added regarding the needs of seasonal farmworkers and appropriate
    housing types for this special needs group.
   In response to a request for additional policies addressing farmworkers, funding sources
    including one specific to Farmworker housing were added to Program Two, Goal Two
    “Pursue Funding Under State and Federal Programs.” Farmworker Needs are also addressed
    by Program Two, Goal 1.
   A comment noted that there aren’t any implementation programs addressing female-headed
    households in the Public Review Draft. The City supports a variety of housing types through
    its zoning code regulations and through the zoning code amendments proposed in this draft
    Housing Element. The type of infill affordable housing most common in Marysville in recent
    years includes a small number of units and does not present opportunities for onsite amenities

    for female-headed households with children. No change was made to the draft in response to
    this comment.
In addition to the comments referenced above several more minor editorial comments were
received and addressed. The remainder of the comments received were reviewed and no changes
were made either due to limited City resources to include additional programs or because they
were already sufficiently addressed in the Public Review Draft Housing Element.

                          APPENDIX B: STATE REQUIREMENTS
The California legislature adopted requirements in 1980 for the contents of housing elements
(California Government Code Sections 65580 to 65589.5). Among these legislative requirements
is the mandate that housing elements consist of an identification and analysis of existing and
projected housing needs and a statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and programs
for the preservation, improvement, and development of housing. Although state law regarding
housing elements requires communities to address the needs of all residents, particular attention
in the housing element law is devoted to the needs of extremely low-, very low-, low-, and
moderate-income households. Specifically, state law requires housing elements to:
   Identify adequate sites to facilitate and encourage housing for all income levels.
   Remove governmental constraints to housing production, maintenance, and improvement.
   Assist in the development of adequate housing for lower- and moderate-income households.
   Conserve and improve the condition of existing affordable housing.
   Promote housing opportunities for all persons.
The contents of a housing element, as mandated by state law, include:
   An assessment of housing needs that includes an analysis of population and housing
    characteristics, employment and population projections, special housing needs, subsidized
    rental housing at risk of conversion, future housing construction need (regional housing
    allocation), and opportunities for energy conservation.
   An analysis of constraints (governmental and non-governmental) to the maintenance,
    improvement, or development of housing for all income levels.
   An inventory of vacant and underutilized sites by zoning category and general plan land use
    designation, with an assessment of the availability of public facilities, and services to those
    sites.
   A housing strategy containing an evaluation of past program achievements, goals, and
    policies, and an eight-year schedule of implementing actions with quantified objectives.

                                                           APPENDIX C: DATA
                                              SOURCES AND THEIR USE
A variety of local, regional, state, federal, and private sources of information were used to
prepare the 2013–2021 Housing Element. As required by state law (Government Code Section
65584), the principal source of information used to determine future housing construction need is
the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) Regional Housing Needs Plan, adopted
September 2012. Other principal sources of information included the US Census Bureau, the
California Department of Finance, the California Employment Development Department, the
City of Marysville, the County of Yuba, the Yuba-Sutter Economic Development Agency (a
local nonprofit organization serving special needs populations), and local real estate and property
management firms. Due to differences in surveying techniques, numbers may differ slightly
depending on the source.

                               APPENDIX D: INCOME DEFINITIONS
The following definitions are used to define income levels:
     Extremely Low Income: < 30 percent of the Yuba County median income
     Very Low Income: 31 to 50 percent of the Yuba County median income
     Low Income: 51 to 80 percent of the Yuba County median income
     Moderate Income: 81 to 120 percent of the Yuba County median income
     Above Moderate Income: More than 120 percent of the Yuba County median income
Each year, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates median
family incomes for each urban area and county in the country. Based on the estimate, HUD
revises its guidelines for income levels by household size. The California Department of Housing
and Community Development uses these federal income guidelines to define income levels by
household size in California. Table D-1 contains the 2013 income guidelines.

 Notes:
 Yuba County Median: $59,400. Higher income limits apply to families with more than eight persons. For
 all income groups, the income limits for families larger than eight persons are determined as follows: for
 each person in excess of eight, add 8 percent of the four-person income limit base to the eight-person
 limit, and round the answer to the nearest $50. For example, the nine-person very low-income limit for
 Yuba County is $41,600. ($29,700 x .08 = $2,376; $39,200 + $2,376 = $41,576; $41,576 rounded =
 $41,600)

                                                    APPENDIX E: GENERAL
                                                        PLAN CONSISTENCY
State law requires that the Housing Element contain a statement of “the means by which
consistency will be achieved with other general plan elements and community goals” (California
Government Code Section 65583[c][6][B]). This requires an evaluation of two primary
characteristics: (1) an identification of other General Plan goals, policies, and programs that
could affect implementation of the Housing Element or that could be affected by the
implementation of the Housing Element; and (2) an identification of actions to ensure
consistency between the Housing Element and affected parts of other General Plan elements. The
Marysville General Plan (adopted 1985) contains several elements with policies related to
housing. A review of the other General Plan elements demonstrates consistency with all other
policies and programs. The City will maintain this consistency in the future by ensuring General
Plan amendments are evaluated for consistency with all other General Plan elements. Due to the
passage of AB 162 relating to flood protection in 2007, the City may be required to amend the
Community Safety and Seismic Safety Element and the Open Space, Conservation and
Recreation Element of the General Plan. If amendments are needed, the Housing Element will be
amended to be consistent with these elements.
