To aid the development of park space, the National
Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) published the
Recreation, Park and Open Space Standards and Guide­

standards. According to this document a park system

A High Level of Park Use in Glendale
Nearly four out of five respondents (79 percent) reported
that someone in their household had used a park in

compared to 26 percent for nonusers. Nearly half of park
users had lived in the area 10 years or less versus 30
percent for nonusers. Park users had larger households,
the average park user household consisted of 2.95 people
compared to 2.04 people for nonusers. Similarly, these
households had a significantly stronger presence of young
children; 44 percent had a child age 17 or under living in
the household compared to 12 percent for nonusers.
Park users had a somewhat higher household income
than nonusers. Almost one-third (32 percent) had an
annual household income of $50,000 or more compared
to 24 percent for nonusers. Household income as a
determinate of park use may be misleading since parks
are more available in the higher income neighborhoods
throughout the city.
Residential Development Patterns Dictate Park Use
Park use is strongest in areas that have a predominately
multiple family urban form. In area G (western Glen­
dale), 90 percent of the households had used a Glendale
park, followed by areas J and K (southern Glendale),
where 84 percent in each area had used a park. This may
be due to the fact that multiple family housing develop­
ments generally have less open space than traditional
single family developments. The survey results support
this contention in that the areas of highest park use are in

  indicated that non-park users did not express any greater
  dissatisfaction with the parks than the park users.
  Park Expansion Supported
  Seventy-one percent of respondents felt it was "very" or
  "somewhat" important to expand current parks or pro­
  vide additional developed park land. This expansion was
  most supported in the southern portion of the city (Map
  6.3). When asked if they would be "very" or "somewhat"
  likely to support providing additional funds for parks, 49
  percent said they would be opposed, 43 percent said
  they would not oppose and 8 percent were undecided.
  Survey respondents were presented with four ways in
  which park improvements could be funded (Table 6.2).
  These were developer fees, city issued bonds, an addi­
  tional tax to all Glendale households, and a benefit
  assessment fee imposed on specific neighborhoods. SeIl­
  ing bonds or charging land developers were the most
  acceptable way in which park acquisitions and improve­
  ments could be financed. Seventy percent agreed
  "strongly" or "somewhat" with issuing bonds while 63

2.	       Acquisition and Development of Specialized
          Park Facilities
This option relies on locating specialized park facilities
to meet some facility needs traditionally sited at commu­
nity and neighborhood parks. These specialized park
facilities are designed to serve two needs: 1) to function
as a community or neighborhood park for the immedi­
ately adjacent neighborhoods, and, 2) provide special­
ized recreation needs for much or all of the city. Ex­
amples of a specialized facility would be a swimming
pool, or a soccer or baseball field complex. These special­
ized recreation facilities are often more efficient at meet­
ingrecreation demand since the facilities are often lighted
and can be operated for longer periods of the day.

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION
Reversing a long trend, the population in the City of
Glendale fell to 191,719 in 2010. This was a
decrease of 3,254 people from the total of 194,973
found in the 2000 Census. It is unclear why the
population fell, though it is likely related to the
poor economic conditions felt throughout the
country in the last part of the previous decade.
Having been the third largest city in Los Angeles
County for decades, Glendale is now the fourth
largest city in Los Angeles County. This is in part
due to the increase in the City of Santa Clarita’s
population as a result of annexations. Despite the
fall in population, Glendale continues to be attractive to new residents and businesses with its
central location near downtown Los Angeles, a major airport, four major freeways, three
hospitals and an excellent school system.
The purpose of this Housing Element revision is to identify the City’s existing and projected
housing needs and to establish goals and policies to guide City officials in daily decision
making in addressing these needs. The goal of providing decent, safe, sanitary and affordable
housing to current and future residents of the City is a primary focus of the Element. The
Element also emphasizes specific target groups requiring the most urgent attention in the
City, such as the elderly, lower income households and the homeless. The Housing Element
serves as a policy guideline for addressing defined issues which may arise in meeting the
housing needs of the community.
The following Vision Statement was developed in order to guide the direction of the
document:
“Housing in Glendale shall meet the needs of all segments of the community while
preserving quality of life and neighborhood identity in the context of our regional
housing obligations and established policies.”
1.1      STATE POLICY AND AUTHORIZATION
The State of California’s primary housing goal is the attainment of decent housing and a
suitable living environment for every Californian. This requires cooperative participation
between the government and the private sector in an effort to expand housing opportunities
and accommodate the housing needs of Californians of all economic levels. Counties and
cities have the responsibility to prepare and implement housing elements which, along with
federal and state programs, will move toward the attainment of the state housing goals.
Section 65302 of California’s Government Code specifies the required components of the
General Plan. Section 65583 lists the required contents of the Housing Element.
State law requires Housing Elements to be updated at least every five years to reflect the
community’s changing housing needs. Glendale’s Housing Element was originally adopted in
1975, amended in 1978, supplemented in 1981, updated in 1984 and 1989, and amended
                                                                        Chapter 1 – Introduction
                                                                                    Page 1 of 10

again in 1992. The Housing Element was updated in 2000 (covering the period from 1998 to
2005) and again in 2009 (covering the period from 2006-2014). The City has prepared the
following updated Housing Element in compliance with the State-mandated deadline of
October 31, 2013 for jurisdictions within the Southern California Association of Governments
(SCAG) region. This update covers the period of January 1, 2014 to October 31, 2021.
1.2     ORGANIZATION OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT
The City of Glendale Housing Element is comprised of the following major components:

    Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs of the Eight-Year Housing Plan (2014-2021)
    Chapter 3 – Review of Goals and Policies from the previous Housing Element (Seven-Year
                Housing Plan 2006-2014)
    Chapter 4 – Housing Needs Assessment (discusses existing and projected housing needs,
                needs of special groups, and housing unit characteristics)
    Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory (lists both land and financial resources available to meet
                housing needs)
    Chapter 6 – Constraints on Housing (including both governmental and nongovernmental
                constraints)
1.3     PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The public participation effort to create this Element is an extension of on-going housing
programs conducted by the City of Glendale, with a wide variety of public participation
opportunities. Glendale has the benefit of having an extremely active and effective Housing
Authority which is at the forefront of public housing policy. This Element builds on these long-
term, continuous public participation policy and program development efforts. Many of
these programs are identified in the following paragraphs; however, these do not take into
account the numerous interactions that Community Development Department staff has with
individual developers of housing units, tenants, state and federal housing program staff and
other agencies.
1.3.1 City of Glendale Consolidated Plan Fiscal Years 2010-2015
The City of Glendale Department of Community Development and Housing (CD&H) serves as
the lead agency to develop and coordinate activities for the FY 2010-15 Consolidated Plan.
The Consolidated Plan satisfies the requirements of the following four Community Planning
and Development (CPD) programs offered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) for which the GDCD&H administers funds: Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG); HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME); Emergency Shelter
Grant (ESG); and American Dream Downpayment Initiative (ADDI). Consistent with federal
requirements, a Community Needs Assessment and Outreach Strategy was conducted to
identify needs and establish program priorities for use of these funds.
                                                                        Chapter 1 – Introduction
                                                                                    Page 2 of 10

Citizen participation is a highly valued component of the Consolidated Plan and Annual
Action Plan preparation process. The City created a wide variety of opportunities to invite
feedback from the community. The formal Community Needs Assessment and Outreach
Strategy involved responses from approximately 1,318 residents, businesses, and community
agency stakeholders. It included two community public hearings, four community events, an
Internet survey, a Community Needs Assessment Survey. In addition, four stakeholder focus
groups were consulted, comprising 37 social service, housing and economic development
representatives. A summary of outreach activities is outlined below:
    1) One Community Public Hearing was held on September 23, 2009 at Mann Elementary
       School. The 42 attendees were divided into five citizen focus groups to identify
       community needs and priorities.
    2) Four community events were held (May 6 - Great American Cleanup; June 26 – Palmer
       Park Movie Night; July 10 – Pacific Park Movie Night) at which an interactive survey
       was administered. Approximately 226 surveys on community needs were received.
    3) An Internet community needs survey was made available on an on-going basis on the
       City’s webpage. Between May 2009 and October 20, 2009, 159 online surveys were
       completed by residents.
    4) A Community Needs Assessment Survey was mailed out randomly to about 6,000
       Glendale residents in the 91204 and 91205 zip codes. As of October 8, 2009, 853
       completed surveys were returned, representing a 14.2% response rate.
    5) A Homeless Focus Group discussion, which was attended by 13 local service and
       community agencies, plus four public agencies, was held on September 16, 2004. This
       interactive focus group discussion asked for specific needs and priorities for homeless
       programs from a social service agency provider perspective.
    6) A Youth Focus Group discussion with Glendale middle school and high school
       students was held on August 12, 2004. Twenty-five students provided direct input on
       the needs and priorities for youth services in Glendale.
The FY 2011-12 Needs Assessment process included consultation and input from community
residents, community coalitions, and social service agencies. This process included:
    1) One Public Hearing held on September 23, 2010 at Mann Elementary School that
       featured citizen focus groups who were asked to identify community needs and
       priorities concerning housing, community development, homeless, economic
       development, and citizen participation. Forty-two residents participated in the focus
       groups.
    2) A Community Needs Assessment Survey mailed out randomly to approximately 500
       Glendale residents in zip codes 91204 and 91205. As of September 23, 2010, 36
       completed surveys were received, representing a 7.2% response rate. Survey
       questions were sought to determine the level of concern and priority for social
       service, neighborhood improvement, and community facilities categories.
    3) A Community Needs Assessment Survey administered through the Department’s web
       page. Between August 1, 2010 to September 20, 2010, 31 total on-line surveys were
       completed by residents. The survey requested residents to identifY specific needs for
       social service, neighborhood improvement, and housing programs.
                                                                       Chapter 1 – Introduction
                                                                                   Page 3 of 10

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
    4) One community event (Cruise Night) on July 17, 2010 involved distributing and
        collecting Community Needs Assessment Surveys from residents participating in the
        event and providing information on Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
        programs. Approximately 74 persons completed the survey.
    5) A Senior Focus Group discussion and Senior Community Needs Survey with Glendale
        seniors held on September 15th at the Glendale Adult Recreation Center. Fifty-two
        seniors provided direct input on the needs and priorities for senior and community
        services in Glendale.
    6) An analysis of housing and population characteristics from the 2000 Census and
        updated 2007 American Community Survey.
Outreach also included extensive informal consultation with public and private agencies, City
departments, social service agencies, agency coalitions, community residents, and
neighboring cities including organizations that provide housing and supportive services to
special needs populations. Sixty-one Glendale Homeless Coalition members were consulted
regarding homeless needs and programs to address those needs. In addition, the City
consulted with its closest local unit of government, the City of Pasadena, for input on regional
community development, homeless, and housing needs. Information sharing between the
two cities led to an identification of similar community needs and dialogue regarding regional
solutions.
To encourage public participation, reasonable and timely notification of all Consolidated Plan
related meetings and comment periods were provided as follows:
         At least ten days notice was provided for all public hearings and local Consolidated
          Plan meetings.
         A community public hearing was held on April 1, 2010 at the Pacific Park Community
          Center to receive input on the proposed program funding levels and strategies.
          Attendees received information regarding strategies, priorities and objectives that
          address the housing and community development needs of low and moderate
          income households, housing market characteristics, the projected amount of funds
          the City expects to receive, the range of activities that may be undertaken, target
          areas, and the Citizen Participation Plan. Notice was given to Glendale residents
          through outreach flyers, advertisements published in the local newspaper, and on
          the City’s webpage.
         A public notice providing for a 30-day citizen comment period on the proposed
          Consolidated Plan was published in the Glendale News Press on May 10, 2010.
         The Housing Authority and Glendale City Council reviewed the proposed
          Consolidated Plan at a special joint meeting on May 25, 2010. The public was
          invited to attend the meeting and make final comments on the Plan. No comments
          were received.
         No oral or written comments were received from the public throughout the
          Consolidated Plan process.
The FY 2011-12 Community Needs Assessment and Outreach Strategy for the FY 2011-2012
CDBG, ESG, and HOME Annual Plan built upon the Consolidated Plan process identified
above. The FY 2011-2012 Needs Assessment process included consultation and input from
community residents, coalitions, and social services agencies.
                                                                       Chapter 1 – Introduction

1.3.2 Long Range Planning Public Input
An intensive city-wide Long Range Planning public input effort was conducted in early 2006
to gain the community’s insights about City Services that need improvement. There were
three sources of community input received. Eight public meetings with 356 participants, and
five supplemental meetings with 161 participants, yielded an aggregate total of 517
participants. In a telephone survey conducted by David Binder Research, 500 respondents
ranked the importance of each service Subcategory. There were a total of 91 surveys
completed on-line. A summary of findings based on the Long Range Planning goal of “A
balanced mix of housing opportunities for current and future residents” found that:
    1) Housing is generally one of the two highest priorities for improvement
    2) Improving Housing Affordability was the highest priority of all 36 subcategories
    3) Medium range priority was to improve a variety of housing (although there was some
        conflicting input regarding density and affordability versus low density/single family)
    4) Improving transit oriented development was a medium priority
    5) Downtown housing was a low priority for improvement.
Specific findings from the three sources of community input can be found on the City’s
webpage at http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/LRP_Findings.asp.
1.3.3 Housing Providers
A Housing Provider Open House by was facilitated on March 26, 2013 at City Hall. Housing
Providers received a flyer invitation and were called and encouraged to attend the open
house. This open house included an evaluation of existing Housing Element goals, priorities
and programs and discussion of appropriate program outcomes. This meeting was also
advertised to the public on the City’s website, press release and Community Development
mailing list.
1.3.4 Community Open Houses and Meetings
Past history has shown that there is limited interest in meetings limited to discussion of the
Housing Element. In order to increase public input concerning the Housing Element, Glendale
has adopted a strategy of combining presentations and opportunities to provide input on the
Housing Element with other City outreach meetings such as meeting on Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG), meetings concerning community plans, PTA meetings at
schools and at public events such as Glendale Healthy Kids day held in Pacific Park.
A Community Open House was held April 2011 at the Pacific Park Community Center to
inform the community about the Housing Element update process and proposed document,
as well as provide an opportunity for questions and comments. Notice was given to Glendale
residents through outreach flyers, advertisements published in the local newspaper, and on
the City’s webpage.
A Community Meeting was held in April 2012 at Pacific Park Community Center, aimed at
addressing the needs of low income residents. While the main focus of this meeting
concerned FY 2012-2013 CDBG funding, Community Development staff also provided
presentation and sought input concerning the Housing Element. This meeting was held in
English, Spanish and Armenian, with complete translations of the presentations, questions,
answers and comments during the meeting.
                                                                         Chapter 1 – Introduction
                                                                                     Page 5 of 10

City of Glendale, California                   H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
A Community Workshop was held at Mann Elementary in September 2012 as part of the
Annual Plan FY 2012-13 process. This meeting was advertised to the low-income community
in South Glendale and had a turn out of approximately 70 people. Break-out groups were
formed in English, Armenian and Spanish and the attendees were asked questions on a
variety of topics, including housing, transportation, and community needs with the goal of
identifying ways to improve the quality of life for residents. The Housing Element, Tropico
Station Study and South Glendale Community Plan were all discussed with attendees and the
input received considered in this Housing Element Update.
1.3.5 Other Public Participation Opportunities
The City’s draft Housing Element is available on the City’s website and public review and
comment on this document is encouraged. Public participation also was provided in the form
of public hearings by the Planning Commission and City Council. In an effort to reach
members of the public that do not often participate in housing policy development, the draft
Housing Element was made available and advertised for review and comment at a CDBG
Action Plan meeting, which targets service providers for low income residents.
1.4     SOURCES OF INFORMATION
Several sources of information provided insights into recent demographic and housing trends
that have taken place within the City. The U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS)
has updated some demographic information through random sampling on an annual basis. In
addition, 2000 and 2010 Census data were used. Current housing unit data were obtained
from the State Department of Finance, SCAG, and from City records and reports. Several
social service agencies provided data about special needs groups. The 1999 Continuum of
Care Narrative, prepared by the Glendale Homeless Coalition, provided important
information about homelessness. Data about the developmentally disabled in Glendale was
obtained from Lanterman. Data was also obtained from the Consolidated Plan Fiscal Years
2010-15 and the Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy for Fiscal Years 1994 - 1998.
Other City documents utilized include the Greater Downtown Strategic Plan, the City of
Glendale Strategic Plan, the Downtown Specific Plan and Mobility Study, the Town Center
Specific Plan, and the other elements of the General Plan and Glendale’s Municipal Code.
In addition to the sources of information listed above, evaluation and revision of the previous
Housing Element provided the base for the preparation of this document. Chapter 3
provides an in depth analysis and discussion of the results of the goals and policy objectives
and corresponding Eight-Year Action Plan programs of the previous Element. The results are
quantified where possible and demonstrate where progress in implementation was achieved.
A review of the significant achievements for each goal and policy is identified for each
program in Section 3.1. Section 3.2 reviews the effectiveness of each program identified in
the Eight-Year Action Plan. While the format of this Element reviews the implementation of
each goal, policy and program independently, Chapter 3 provides the platform upon which
this Element identifies new goals, policies and programs in Chapter 2. Chapters 3.1 and 3.2
provide the identification of the appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies based on
what has been learned from review of the previous Element and this information provides the
basis for the goals, policies and Eight-Year Action Plan programs identified in Chapter 2.
                                                                       Chapter 1 – Introduction
                                                                                   Page 6 of 10

The City of Burbank and the City of Los Angeles draft Housing Elements were reviewed by
City staff. A September 2005 study prepared by the Special Needs Housing Alliance for
Shelter Partnership, Inc., titled A Strategic Housing Plan for Special Needs Populations in Los
Angeles County provided information on various special needs population groups. Glendale
spoke with Lanterman about the number, location and needs of the developmentally disabled
living in Glendale and the Lanterman numbers appear in tables in Chapter 4. This greatly
assisted in identifying housing issues and supportive services needs for these groups. In
addition, HUD User, the HCD website, and American Factfinder provided demographic data
for the previous element and this update. The website for the Los Angeles County
Community Development Commission, the Department of Health Services Special Planning
Area provided data relative to special needs housing and supportive services for the San
Fernando Valley area (SPA 2), which includes Glendale was provided in the previous element
and remains unchanged due to the lack of funding for new studies. Preparation of the
Housing Element update is a coordinated effort of staff from Community Development
Department and staff from the Community Services and Parks Department.

1.6    SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS
The below six goals correspond to the goals set forth in the Eight-Year Plan (2014-2021). The
Eight-Year Plan can be found in Chapter 2 of this document. The bullet points highlight some
of the key findings and programs added to the Element based on review of the previous
Element, and public comments received on the Draft Element from the Housing Task Force,
the State Housing Community Development Department, service providers and community
members.

                                                                                      Page 8 of 10

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
GOAL 1 - A City with a Wide Range of Housing Types to Meet the Needs of Current
and Future Residents
      Inclusionary Zoning (see Program 2c): Glendale requires inclusionary housing for for-
       sale units in the San Fernando Road Corridor Redevelopment Project Area (SRRCRPA).
       Glendale City Council studied the option of providing an inclusionary housing
       requirement city-wide, but did not adopt a city-wide policy. Comments received from
       HCD and members of the Housing Task Force recommend that Glendale expand our
       inclusionary housing requirements to all new residential development in the City.
      Adequate sites are available in residential zones throughout the City to accommodate
       Glendale’s regional housing need (see Section 4.8).
      Small Lot Subdivision (see Program 4a) to encourage infill housing in existing multi-
       family neighborhoods. This program would enable the creation of small single-
       ownership lots that are more affordable than traditional single-family homes, yet
       would be compatible with existing neighborhoods. This program is also consistent
       with Goal 3.
GOAL 2 - A City with High Quality Residential Neighborhoods that are Attractive and
Well Designed
        Provide “Neighborhood Target Areas” to identify and initiate planning activities in
         one new area (see Program 1e.) South and Western Glendale are the neighborhood
         areas presently under study to improve the quality of life in lower income census
         tracts.
        Code Enforcement (see Program 1d) to maintain Glendale’s neighborhoods and
         housing stock.
GOAL 3 - A City with Increased Opportunities for Affordable Housing
        Continue Density Bonus Program (see Program 2a.) to encourage the private
         development of affordable housing, as well as senior housing. Glendale’s density
         bonus program has been successful in encouraging the private development of for-
         sale units affordable to moderate income households.
      Small Lot Subdivision (see Program 4a) mentioned above with Goal 1.
GOAL 4 - A City with Housing Services that Address Groups with Special Housing
Needs
        Direct City Financial Assistance (see Program 2b) to encourage the construction of
         affordable units, including units that may serve special needs populations.
        Medical Services (MS) Zone (See Program 5c) to create a zone that provides flexibility
         for supportive, special needs and transitional housing in proximity to Glendale’s
         hospitals. Glendale has three major hospitals and a new MS Zone would allow
         facilities such as, but not limited to Ronald McDonald houses, skilled nursing, assisted
         living, housing for nursing students/hospital employees and hospice. During the
         community outreach meeting with the Housing Provides, it was mentioned that the City
         should consider modifying zoning so that a residential building could accommodate a

         Homeless Services (see Program 5b) to provide services on an on-going basis
          including emergency shelters, transitional shelters, permanent supportive housing
          and homeless preventions services. There are privately run emergency shelters and
          domestic violence shelters in the City and it is anticipated that these facilities will
          continue to operate and serve Glendale residents, dependent on funding availability.
GOAL 5 - A City with Equal Housing Opportunities for All Persons
         Maintain a contract with a fair housing service provider to provide educational and
          investigative services for multi-language housing discrimination questions and
          landlord/tenant complaints to further fair housing (see Program 6a.).
GOAL 6 - A City with Housing that is Livable and Sustainable
         Expand the policy to conserve existing and future affordable units (see Program 1f.),
          such as preventing at-risk units from losing their affordability status when
          economically feasible.
         South Glendale Community Plan (See Program 7a) to continue updating the City’s
          General Plan through the development of a community plan that addresses the
          needs of South Glendale neighborhoods. The plan will include a review of land uses
          and focus on quality of life improvements, including transportation, mixed-use
          development, walkable neighborhoods, and access to jobs, parks and recreational
          opportunities.
         Transit-Oriented Development Housing Standards (See Program 7c) to incorporate
          transit-oriented development housing standards in the zoning code and implement
          them through Community Plans based on the Tropico Study which is currently in
          progress.
1.7     GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
The Housing Element of the General Plan is one component of the City’s overall long-range
planning strategy. The California Government Code requires that the General Plan contain an
integrated, consistent set of goals and polices. The Housing Element is, therefore, affected
by policies contained in other elements of the General Plan. The Housing Element has been
reviewed for consistency with the City’s other General Plan Elements and policies and
programs in this Element reflect the policy direction contained in other parts of the General
Plan. As portions of the General Plan are amended in the future, this Housing Element will be
reviewed to ensure that internal consistency is maintained.
                                                                          Chapter 1 – Introduction

CHAPTER 2 – GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS OF THE
                        EIGHT-YEAR HOUSING PLAN (2014-2021)
2.1     GOALS AND POLICIES
The California Government Code requires that Housing Elements address the following
topics:
       Identification and analysis of
        existing and projected housing
        needs of all economic
        segments of the community
       Statement of goals, policies,
        quantified objectives,
        improvement, and
        development of housing
       Identification of Adequate
        Sites for Housing, including rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, and
        emergency shelters
       Assistance in the Development of Housing for Low and Moderate Income Households
       Removal and/or Mitigation of Governmental Constraints
       Conservation and Improvement of the Existing Affordable Housing Stock
       Promotion of Equal Housing Opportunities
       Preservation of Units At-Risk of Converting to Non-Low Income Affordable Units
       Priority water and sewer services procedures for developments with units affordable
        to lower income households
2.1.1 Public Participation to Create the Eight-Year Housing Plan
Chapter 1.3 describes the public participation process for preparation of this document. The
City developed the goals and policies in this chapter in response to what was learned from
review of the goals and policies of the previous Element, the issues identified by the State,
and from public participation with local housing and service providers. These goals and
policies were further refined by public review of the draft Housing Element. The goals and
policies address a wide range of issues relating to the needs of all segments of the
community and quality of life for Glendale residents, both current and future. Chapter 3.1
identifies the results of the implementation of the previous Element goals and policies.
Several important factors affected planning and affordable housing programs since the
adoption of the previous goals and policies of the Eight-Year Housing Plan (2006-2014).
Dissolution of the Glendale Redevelopment Agency (by the State of California) caused the
loss of Redevelopment set-aside funds for new housing programs, projects, and services.
Federal HOME, CDBG, and Emergency Solutions Grants funding was reduced in amounts
ranging from 50% to 36%, depending upon the program. A state-wide drought and
                                                         Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                      Page 1 of 35

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
subsequent conservation efforts resulted in less funding for Glendale Water and Power utility
benefit programs for low income residents. The recession since 2008, resulted in a reduction
in millions of dollars of federal, state, county and other local funding for affordable housing
and services, and affected the ability of the City to meet anticipated housing goals and
timelines. The State’s elimination of inclusionary housing requirements and reduction in State
and federal affordable housing and related community development funds affected the City
of Glendale’s ability to increase the production and preservation of affordable units. In
Glendale, changes included a 50% reduction in Community Development Department staff,
as well as staff reductions in other Departments that supported Redevelopment activities. As
a result, some divisions with the new Community Development Department were reorganized
including the Housing Development and Preservation Section within the Housing Division,
and the Planning and Neighborhood Services Division. A separate Economic
Development/Asset Management division was created within the City Manager’s office.
These changes affected implementation of most of the City’s community development and
community services programs. The Community Services and Parks Department, which
operates CDBG and Homeless Programs, had significant reductions in staffing, as well.
Public participation was integral to all of these changes and occurred through various public
hearings and community meetings, all of which were televised on Glendale’s cable channel.
While drops in funding and staffing occurred, Glendale achieved success through creation
and adoption of the North Glendale Community Plan, adoption of Community Design
Guidelines, and adoption of the Greener Glendale Plan addressing municipal operations and
community activities. The City established three historic residential districts, reduced
residential parking standards in Glendale’s Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) area, and adopted
an extensive Bicycle Transportation Plan and Glendale’s Safe and Healthy Streets program to
encourage better pedestrian and bicycle environments, particularly within higher density
residential areas. Also, Glendale remains successful in building new affordable housing using
Redevelopment Set Aside Program Income funds known as Low Moderate Income Housing
Asset Funds (LMIHAF), HOME and other funding (with three new projects in the development
pipeline), as well as employing density bonus for affordable units. All of these programs
incorporated public participation, offered through various televised board and commission
meetings, and City Council hearings and actions.
2.1.2 Inclusionary Housing
In 2004, inclusionary zoning was adopted for the SFRCRPA to create a mechanism for
developers to assist in meeting the inclusionary housing production requirement within
redevelopment project areas. An inclusionary housing requirement was placed on private
developers constructing new residential units in the Project Area in order to meet the
requirement for production of housing units with Redevelopment. This requirement was to
assist the City in meeting requirements of California Redevelopment laws and the Eight Year
Housing Plan schedule. However, due to the California Superior Court decision, which was
upheld by the California Court of Appeals, Palmer vs. City of Los Angeles, 175 CAL App. 4th
1396 (2009) it was determined that inclusionary zoning for rental units (even within
Redevelopment Project areas) was not enforceable without further action by the State
legislature. Also, the status of the inclusionary requirement in Redevelopment Project Areas
specifically remains a question today, based upon the dissolution of Redevelopment by the
State. No new inclusionary housing has been produced by private developers in Glendale
since the Court of Appeals ruling.

2.1.3 Affordable Housing Request for Qualifications/Statement of Interest
The Community Development Department (CDD) maintains a process initiated in 2002 and
continued in subsequent years (when funding was available) to locate potential developers
and affordable housing sites in Glendale. Periodically, the department releases a Request for
Qualifications/Statement of Interest. This is to invite developers to provide information as to
any potential sites that they control or are interested in acquiring for possible development,
as well as provide information on any existing potential development sites owned by the
Housing Authority. Through these ongoing efforts several affordable housing development
sites were acquired by the Housing Authority or their partners, and several projects were
developed. Chapter 4.6 Assisted Units identifies the status, location, number of units, and
funding sources for various assisted affordable housing projects in Glendale.
2.1.4 Long Range Plan Public Participation
An extensive community outreach effort related to housing was conducted from January
through May 2006. Thirteen community group meetings, a telephone survey, community
leader interviews, a TV call-in show (on the City’s public access television channel), and an on-
line Web Survey were conducted. This outreach was performed to obtain community input
for developing priorities and strategies for creating a Long Range Plan for improvement in
services and identifying areas for improvement in the City. Hundreds of residents
participated in the Long Range Plan meetings, telephone survey and on-line web survey. The
input collected was distilled into concise statements that summarize “messages” from the
community. “Housing Affordability” was continually rated by the community as one of the
highest priority issues and an area in need of improvement.
2.1.5 Housing Goals and Policies of the Eight-Year Housing Plan (2014-2021)
Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of this chapter are organized into Goals, Policies and the Eight-Year
Housing Plan. A goal is intended to represent a visionary statement; it is a statement
identifying where the City should be in the future. Policies set forth a variety of directions in
order to achieve the stated goals. The Eight-Year Housing Plan (2014-2021) is the
implementation program to achieve the goals and policies for the community and includes a
timeline, projected housing production objectives, as well as anticipated funding sources.
The implementation program is a combination of both the Eight-Year Housing Plan and those
policies which set forth specific administrative action.

2.2     THE EIGHT-YEAR HOUSING PLAN IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS
2.2.1 Implementing Programs
The Housing Element describes the housing needs of the City’s current and projected
population, as well as the specific needs resulting from the deterioration of older units, lack
of affordable housing for lower income groups, and special needs for certain segments of the
City’s population. The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element address the
City’s identified housing needs. These goals and policies are implemented through a series of
housing programs that are funded and administered through a variety of local, regional, State
and Federal agencies. The following six comprehensive program strategies consist of both
programs currently in use in the City and additional programs to provide the opportunity to
adequately address the City’s housing needs:
        1) Preservation and Enhancement of Existing Housing Stock
        2) Production of Affordable Housing
        3) Rental Assistance
        4) Housing Services
        5) Fair Housing.
        6) Sustainability
A series of specific programs are identified to implement each program strategy. This
section provides a description of each housing program and future program goals. The Eight
Year Action Plan table at the end of this section (Exhibit 2-1) summarizes the objectives of
each program, the eight year projections, funding source(s), responsible agency, and
implementation time frame.
2.2.2    Program Strategy #1 – Preservation and Enhancement of Existing Housing
          Stock
Housing rehabilitation includes major efforts to improve a property and alterations aimed at
converting the type or number of units. The goal of housing preservation is to protect the
existing quality and investment in housing and to avoid a degree of physical decline that will
require a larger rehabilitation effort to restore quality and value.
Glendale, unlike many older cities, does not have an extensive problem with housing
deterioration. Less than three percent of the housing stock is defined as substandard.
However, based on the age of the housing stock, the magnitude of units in need of
rehabilitation could multiply if units are not continually maintained. The City’s Code
Enforcement program, combined with available assistance programs, will work towards
ensuring the maintenance of the housing stock.
1a. Multifamily Rehabilitation Loan Program
Program Description
The City administers a Multifamily Rental Rehabilitation Loan Program. This program is
designed to assist nonprofit and private property owners to make repairs to multi-family
                                                           Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                        Page 7 of 35

City of Glendale, California                   H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
rental housing to bring them up to safe, sanitary and secure standards, and to encourage
rental property owners to continue to provide good quality affordable housing. Eligible work
includes roof, plumbing, electrical, heating, safety improvements, exterior repairs/upkeep,
and seismic repairs.
The City offers forgivable low-interest housing rehabilitation loans to multifamily rental
property owners who provide affordable housing. The loans provide property owners of
substandard rental housing units an opportunity to rehabilitate their units with financial
assistance from the City. Loans of up to $10,000 per unit (maximum $100,000 per project)
are available. In neighborhood target areas funds are provided up to $14,500 per unit. This is
a minor rehabilitation program as rehab does not exceed 25% of the market value of the
structure.
In return for the loans, the City requires that rehabilitated units be rented to low-income
households at affordable rental rates prescribed by the City for a period not exceeding 5
years (7 years if the owner chooses a higher investment per unit). To ensure compliance with
the loan terms, the City records covenants and/or deed restrictions and performs annual
monitoring. In addition, the City forgives annual loan repayments in any year that the
property is in compliance with the loan terms regarding tenant income, rental rates, and
property maintenance.
Because of rising rents in the current housing market, it is expected that the majority of multi-
family rehabilitation loans projected for the housing plan period will be with nonprofit
organizations with a mission based interest in serving extremely low, very low, and low
income households. Due to the difficult economics of serving Extremely Low income
households, it is anticipated that the majority of these units will be Very Low income (90%)
and Low income (10%) households
Program Goals
Provide multifamily rental rehabilitation loans assisting approximately 19 rental housing units
over the 2014-2021 period.
1b. Multi-family Acquisition/Rehabilitation Loan Program
Program Description
Assist nonprofit and for profit property owners to acquire and rehabilitate existing rental
housing that may or may not currently serve extremely low, very low, and low income
households. The City records covenants and/or deed restrictions requiring that the housing
units be used to provide affordable housing for very low income households, including those
with special needs such as homeless persons and persons with disabilities. Generally, these
loans are substantial in nature and exceed 25% of the value of the structure. Therefore the
affordability covenants are for 55 years or longer and are repaid through residual receipts of
income generated by the acquired property.
Program Goals
Provide multifamily rental acquisition rehabilitation loans improving approximately 37 rental
housing units, with a commitment of 11.5% of projected affordable housing funds directly
available to the City, over the 2014-2021 period. One development project, Cypress Senior
Apartments, is currently in the development pipeline and is expected to rehabilitate 17

Housing Asset Funds, two of the major sources of funding for the Plan Period for new
housing construction, will target a minimum of 20 - 30% of this funding for Extremely Low
Income households as required by these funding sources and as financially feasible.1c.
Glendale Water & Power (GWP) Public Benefit Programs
Program Goals
GWP has set a minimum energy efficiency target equal to approximately 1.0 percent of its
annual retail sales, and reported such to the California Energy Commission (CEC) along with
other public owned utilities. In FY 11-12, GWP’s energy savings equated to 1.23% of FY 11-12
retail sales exceeding our target of 1.0 percent. Glendale Water & Power is a leader in many
aspects of the utility industry. Along with aggressive conservation efforts, for the past 10
years, GWP has been giving back to the Community through its Public Benefit Programs with
over $37 million invested since January 2000. These programs not only assist low-income
customers with their electric bills, they also provide funding and education for all customers
to invest in new technologies helping them save money and lower their energy and water
consumption.
Glendale Water & Power was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy for a $20 million
grant in April 2009. The utility was 1 of 33 public power utilities to be selected. Additionally,
GWP was selected by the CEC to receive a $1 million Public Interest Energy and Research
(PIER) grant. The total value of the Glendale electric grid modernization initiative is over $70
million. Glendale Water & Power began the project in August 2009 and completed the
installation of 85,000 electric and 33,000 water meters in September 2011. Glendale Water &
Power is perhaps one of only a handful of public utilities in the nation to implement water and
electric digital meters simultaneously. One of the goals of the Glendale - grid modernization
initiative is to serve as a model for other municipal utilities to follow in the state and across
the nation.
Program Description
State law mandates that each local publicly owned electric utility shall establish a non-by
passable, usage based charge on local distribution service of at least 2.85% of revenues to
fund investments in one or more of the following areas:
        Cost-effective services to promote energy-efficiency and energy conservation
        New investment in renewable energy resource and technologies
        Research, development and demonstration programs
        Services provided for low-income electricity customers, including but not limited to,
         targeted energy efficiency service and rate discounts.
Glendale currently promotes various programs for residential efficiency and income-qualified
electric discounts. Residential energy savings programs include: Smart Home Energy and
Water Savings Rebates; Smart Home Solar Solutions Program; Tree Power which provides
free shade trees for natural home cooling; and Residential AC Tune-Ups. Income qualified
programs include: Glendale Care program available to low income customers; Guardian for
medical equipment and space conditioning needs; and, Helping Hand to serve those with a
temporary financial emergency. Historically, GWP has concentrated its PBC expenditures in
low income, energy efficiency, and solar programs. With our move to the smart Grid, this is
changing. One of GWP’s strategic goals for FY 2012-2013 is to begin offering our customers

new programs and services that allow them to take advantage of our new smart gird
investments.
Glendale Water & Power promotes its residential programs through its customer service
center. Since everyone signing up for Glendale utility service must speak to customer service
representatives to sign up or modify service, customers of every income level can learn about
residential programs. Additionally, the City of Glendale website, brochures available at
various public venues including the City Hall campus and libraries, welcome packets mailed to
new customers, City online publications, and utility billing mailing inserts also promote
available residential utility programs. Periodically, residential programs are promoted
through advertisements in the Glendale News-Press. The City of Glendale also produces
public service announcements that run on the City’s public access cable TV channel which
promote the availability of public assistance programs. Funding for public outreach is
provided through energy efficiency programs as required by state mandate.
1d. Code Enforcement
Program Goals
The program’s goals are to:
    1) Complete compliance on 1,400 residential properties.
    2) Educate property owners and renters on their responsibility for basic unit maintenance
        and cleanliness;
    3) Bring substandard housing/property into compliance with City Code;
    4) Eliminate blight in Glendale’s neighborhoods; and
    5) Ensure a high quality of life with regard to housing for Glendale residents.
    6) Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units as further outlined in Program
        1f.
Program Description
The objective of the City of Glendale’s Code Enforcement program is to maintain compliance
with City codes for the City’s housing stock. This may mean bringing substandard properties
back into compliance through a code enforcement process. The intent of Program 1d is to
address housing stock citywide and the intent of Program 1f is to use Code Enforcement, as
well as other activities, to target conservation of existing and future affordable units. Having
housing stock compliant with City codes eliminates blight and preserves the high quality of
life in Glendale’s neighborhoods. To meet this objective, potential code violations are
identified on a proactive and reactive basis. These violations are confirmed by trained,
certified inspectors via on-site inspections. After these inspections are performed, a variety
of enforcement tools are used to achieve compliance. These tools consist of verbal warnings,
letter notifications, citations, office conferences, criminal prosecution, and abatement.
The letter notification process is the primary tool used to compel property owners to make
the necessary corrections. During this notification process, the property owner is informed of
potential assistance in the form of rehabilitation loans or grants that may be available to use
toward making the necessary corrections. In most cases, property owners are given thirty
(30) days to make the corrections, at which time a follow-up inspection is conducted.
                                                           Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                       Page 10 of 35

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
If code violations remain, a series of violation letters are sent and a Notice of Substandard
Building (in the form of a lien) is filed with the County Recorder’s Office which then informs
potential purchasers and lending institutions of substandard housing conditions on the
property. For substandard housing which is not owner-occupied, a Notice of Non-
Compliance can be filed with the State of California Franchise Tax Board which forfeits
potential tax benefits derived from ownership of the property. Continued noncompliance
leads to an office conference, prior to forwarding the enforcement case to the City Attorney’s
Office for possible legal action.
Code Enforcement and public outreach staff produce educational materials and programs to
provide information on property owner responsibilities for unit maintenance and cleanliness,
property owner responsibilities, and technical resources for specific property maintenance
issues. These programs and classes support the code enforcement officer’s efforts.
1e. Neighborhood “Target Areas”
Program Goals
The goal of neighborhood “target areas” is to improve the quality of life in South and West
Glendale, as these areas contain lower income census tracts. In the past, Glendale “targeted”
the South Glendale neighborhoods of Pacific-Edison, Adams Hill, and East Garfield. This
resulted in public improvements to schools, parks, housing, streets and other aspects of the
community that improve quality of life for residents. Glendale desires to continue to target
improvements to the Tropico Station neighborhood in South Glendale, with a focus on
developing transit-oriented development policy and programs to make this a safe walking,
biking and public transit-oriented community. It will include the development of a housing
site inventory for the South Glendale Community Plan area, which includes Downtown
Glendale and the San Fernando Road corridor. The study for the Tropico Neighborhood will
be completed by March 2014. The EIR for the South Glendale Community Plan which will
implement recommendations of the Tropico Study will be contracted by June 2014 and this
program will be implemented by the Community Development Department by June 2015.
Program Description
Quality of life factors are a major issue considered by most potential residents when
searching for a home. Quality of life factors include everything that influences a family’s day-
to-day living in a neighborhood and community. Key factors include parks and open space,
schools, neighborhood aesthetics, building density, and housing design. Creating walkable,
working-class neighborhoods that take advantage of existing public transit opportunities,
such as the Glendale Metrolink Station in the Tropico neighborhood (known as Tropico
Station) and high-capacity bus lines, will increase the quality of life in South Glendale. Target
area activities for revitalization include construction of affordable housing, parks and school
improvements, continuation of residential and commercial code enforcement programs, and
public education efforts with residents concerning neighborhood standards. Such projects
require significant public involvement in planning and implementation of these efforts. In
2011, Glendale received a Metro Grant for the purpose of studying opportunities for creating
a transit-oriented development district around the Glendale Metrolink Station in the Tropico
neighborhood of Glendale. This study includes looking at a variety of policy, public
improvement and code changes that could be implemented to encourage development and
increase the quality of life for residents of this area. Milestones include the completion of the
study and environmental review in 2015, with implementation of code changes to implement
transit-oriented development policy to follow.

1f. Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units
Program Goals
The goal of this program is to conserve the long-term affordability of the existing and future
units in Glendale. This will be accomplished by the following actions: 1) to monitor the
expiration dates of affordability restrictions, meet with property managers and property
owners 12 to 24 months prior to expiration to determine feasibility of extension of
affordability and to minimize the impact on tenants of any conversion to market rate rents; 2)
to offer public subsidy and assist in pursuing other state and federal funding to prevent
conversion of existing affordable units to market rate or replace the units, if it is not feasible
to prevent conversion; 3) to file affordable housing covenants/deed restrictions on future
publicly assisted housing projects for a minimum 45 year affordability period for ownership
units and 55 year affordability period for rental units; 4) to maintain fee title ownership of
housing development sites with a long term ground lease provided to the developer for a
minimum 56 year affordability period when feasible in order to retain local government
control and flexibility at the time of expiration of covenants; and 5) to facilitated high quality
portfolio management after project completion through annual monitoring of the physical,
financial, and occupancy restrictions of development projects with affordability restrictions.
Program Description
A community’s existing affordable housing stock is a valuable resource which should be
conserved, and if necessary, improved to meet habitability standards. The City of Glendale
has assisted in the development or substantial rehabilitation of 1,116 affordable housing units
and has approved development of 127 affordable units through density bonus provisions.
These units receive funding from several programs through the federal Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), tax credit or bond financing, redevelopment set-
aside funds and other governmental and private sources. The City has also provided short
term financing (5-15 years) for rehabilitation of privately owned rental units that provide
limited affordability for the term of the loan. Staff has reviewed the affordability expiration
dates for all sources of funding for the 26 operating rental developments and the remaining 8
multi-family rental rehabilitation loans to determine the risk of conversion to market rate
units. The results of this review are found in Chapter 4.5 Preservation of Assisted Units.
As outlined in Program 1d, Glendale will continue to use code enforcement efforts to
maintain existing affordable housing stock. Glendale’s goal is conserve at least 25 units
through code enforcement and other assistance efforts. Units conserved include “red tag”
units that have low income renters or affordable rents that are brought into code standard
and extensions of the affordability period for another 55 years for multiple family affordable
rental units. This program is on-going and is presently being implemented as shown through
Glendale efforts discussed in Chapter 4.1. This program is implemented by the Community
Development Department.
2.2.3 Program Strategy #2 – Production of Affordable Housing
New construction is a major source of housing for prospective home owners and renters.
However, the cost of new construction is substantially greater than other program categories.
Incentive programs, such as density bonus, offer a cost effective means of providing
                                                         Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                     Page 12 of 35

City of Glendale, California                   H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
affordable housing development and will be used to supplement and leverage limited
funding resources available to the City. Public sector support for new construction includes
the three programs listed below for extremely low, very low, low and moderate income
housing development.
Glendale’s Community Development Department will continue to be actively involved with
developing and promoting other affordable housing programs.                  The Department of
Community Development will continue to promote the development and ongoing provision
of affordable housing through the following activities:
       Develop local priority needs and specific objectives for effective, coordinated
        neighborhood and community development strategies in cooperation with residents,
        public and private agencies, social service agencies, City Departments, and private
        developers.
       Fund a wide range of activities by private and nonprofit developers to promote the
        development of and the preservation of affordable housing including purchasing,
        building, and/or rehabilitating affordable housing for rent or for homeownership.
       Publicize affordable housing and supportive programs by sending statements of
        interest for affordable housing to developers, property owners, service providers and
        non-profits when funding is available and issue requests for proposal for unique
        project development needs on specific sites of concern to the City.
       Provide an interdepartmental development team to assist affordable housing
        developers by streamlining the development process.
       Proactively seek partnerships with development-related non-profits such as Habitat
        for Humanity to create low-income and moderate income affordable housing.
       Proactively seek partnerships with development-related non-profits such as United
        Cerebral Palsy, Ability First and the Salvation Army to supply special needs housing
        and services.
       Provide subsidy payments for extremely low, very low, low andmoderate income
        households to obtain housing at an affordable cost in the private marketplace (i.e.
        rental subsidy payments.)
       Replace affordable housing that is displaced through redevelopment activity.
       Hold homeless fairs to connect homeless individuals with services available in the local
        community.
       Monitor ongoing affordable activities funded by the Housing Authority to ensure
        developments remain in good physical condition, contribute positively to the adjacent
        neighborhood, and are available to income eligible residents as required by
        agreements with developers.
       Maintain current housing information on the Community Development Department
        website
2a. Density Bonus Program
Program Goals
                                                         Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                     Page 13 of 35

City of Glendale, California                   H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
The City will continue to utilize density bonus incentives to encourage the development of
affordable family housing as well as senior housing. Specifically, this includes:
        Maintain outreach materials highlighting the incentive/concessions offered under the
         Density Bonus. Density bonus brochure available on-line.
        Advertise density bonus opportunities on the Community Development Department’s
         webpage
        Continue to periodically evaluate the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance for compliance
         with State law.
Glendale’s goal is one density bonus project per year (without other public funding
assistance), with a minimum of 2 units affordable to Very Low income households. This would
provide for a total of 26 Very Low income units during the 2014-2021 planning period.
However, this goal is dependent upon applications for this program.
Program Description
The Density Bonus incentives are designed to make affordable housing (both privately and
publicly sponsored) projects easier to develop. The Density Bonus Law mandates density
bonuses and other regulatory incentives or concessions for projects that provide certain
levels of affordable housing or senior citizen housing. Developers are entitled to incentives,
based on the number of affordable units they provide unless the City proves the incentives
are not necessary to make the project feasible. Density bonus laws also provide favorable
parking incentives for affordable housing developers.
Additionally, Glendale offers a density bonus incentive for lot consolidation projects where
lot widths are 90 feet or greater. The density bonus incentive for lot consolidation is
considered “by right” density and serves as the base density for the Density Bonus Program
incentive program for affordable housing. The amount of Density Bonus for affordable
housing is based on the amount by which the percentage of affordable units exceeds the
percentage established by housing type up to a 35% density bonus (See Table 30.36 of the
Glendale Municipal Code). For example, a 20,000 square foot lot in the R-1250 Zone with at
least 90 feet of lot width would be eligible for 20 units or a “by right” density of 1 unit per
1,000 square feet of lot area, rather than the 16 units or 1 unit per 1,250 square feet per lot
area for similarly zoned lots with less width. If each of these projects proposed to provide
10% of the units as affordable to lower income households, then each would be eligible for a
20% density bonus. Therefore, the project with the lot density bonus would be eligible for a
total of 24 units, with 10% or 2 units affordable to low income residents. The project without
the lot density bonus would be eligible for a total of 19 units, with 10% or 2 units affordable
to low income residents. Appendix D shows lots in the R-1250 and R-1650 zones which may
be suitable for lot consolidation density bonus.
Developers granted a density bonus enter into an Affordable Housing Agreement with the
City to ensure the continued affordability of the units. Affordable rental units are rented at
levels affordable to very low and low income tenants. Affordable rental units are subject to
annual rent adjustments based upon changes in the County median income.
Over ten new residential affordable housing projects, private as well as publicly-sponsored,
have been approved with affordable units as a result of the Density Bonus Ordinance which
was adopted in 2006. The City agrees to continue ongoing Community Development
affordable housing development activities outlined in this program which support use of
                                                        Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs

density bonus provisions, as well as promote other opportunities for creating affordable
housing.
2b. Direct City Financial Assistance
Program Goals
The eight-year goal for financial assistance from the City to new construction of affordable
units is a total of 180 new construction units with approximately 66% of funds directly
available to the City committed to rental units and 22% committed to home ownership units.
        The 2014 - 2016 period projection is 46 Extremely Low, Very Low and Low Income
         units. Two projects (one home ownership and one rental) are already funded and are
         currently in the development pipeline will be completed during this time period.
        The 2017 – 2021 period projection is another 134 Extremely Low, Very Low and Low
         Income units. This projection is based upon projected funding levels (approximately $2
         million per year), projected per units costs of $120,500 City investment per unit for
         rental units and $135,000 City investment per unit for homeownership units. This also
         assumes the Fifth & Sonora land (already owned by the Housing Authority) will be
         developed for affordable housing during this time period with no additional City
         investment required.
Program Description
The City intends to facilitate the production of affordable housing serving a wide range of
income groups through the investment of federal HOME and Low Moderate Income Housing
Asset funds that are directly available to the City, and other leveraged and competitive
funding sources. It is anticipated that approximately $1.4 million per year will be available
from these sources, although funding levels are uncertain due to the requirement that
repayment of the City loan by the Successor Agency must be approved by the State
Department of Finance in the next year and due to the uncertainty of federal spending levels
in light of sequester and deficit reduction policies over the next several years.
The type of affordable housing units produced in the later years of the plan, from 2017-2021,
will depend upon funding available directly to the City (HOME, LMIHAF, etc.), land
availability, construction costs, private and other leveraged financing available, as well as
State and federal government policies for tax credit project priorities for rental and owner
new construction affordable housing which are difficult to predict at this time.
If these components of the market remain as they are today it can be expected that the bulk
of affordable rental housing assisted by the City in those later years will be targeted to
Extremely Low (0 – 30%) and Very Low Income households (31– 50% AMI). Production of
units may vary based upon the opportunity to partner with special needs nonprofit
developers who provide supportive services “rich” rental units for Extremely Low Income
residents. Home ownership construction production will target Low Income level households
as they are best able to maintain their homes over the long term. Those projects funded
with Low Income Housing Tax Credit and Low Moderate Income Housing Asset Funds, two of
the major sources of funding for the Plan Period for new housing construction, will target a
                                                         Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                     Page 15 of 35

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
minimum of 20 - 30% of this funding for Extremely Low Income households, as is required by
these funding sources and is financially feasible.
The City will be applying for other State and federal funds as they become available to local
governments to promote affordable housing. Because federal funding availability may
fluctuate over the eight year plan period, the City will monitor “Notices of Funding
Availability” announcements, and maintain contact with housing development and technical
assistance organizations in order to obtain advice and training on how to leverage funding for
specific project areas. The City intends to actively and aggressively pursue outside resources
available directly and through developers, as described above, and pursue new resources as
they are identified to achieve a high level of leveraged funds for new housing production.
These include the Residential Development Loan Program (RDLP); the Building Equity and
Growth in Neighborhoods (BEGIN) program; the CalHome mortgage assistance program; as
well as transportation/housing and transit center development related funds from the State
and federal government. The City will also seek State and Federal monies for direct support
of housing construction and rehabilitation specifically targeted for housing for persons with
disabilities.
The City also requires and assists developer partners to apply for available leveraged funding
including the State Multi-Family Housing Program (MHP) for low cost construction loans;
Federal Home Loan Bank Affordable Housing Programs and WISH funds, private foundation
grants, New Market Tax Credits, Los Angeles County affordable housing funds, State
BEGIN/CalHome/CalHFA program funds, HUD 811 supportive housing grants, and State
Multi-Family loan programs. There are three ways in which these monies will be made
directly available for the production of affordable housing:
    1. Land Assemblage and Write Down
        The City plans to use available funds to purchase and assemble developable parcels of
        land and, if appropriate, write down the cost of land for the development of low and
        moderate income housing. The intent of this program is to assemble separate parcels
        of land in order to create a developable site for affordable housing. A ground lease or
        sale of the land to a well-qualified developer for an appropriate affordable housing
        project meeting the goals of the City’s affordable housing strategy may also be
        pursued where feasible.
        The land could be sold at a land cost reduced to the point that it could cover the
        affordability or feasibility gap of a desired affordable housing project. This has the
        potential for making an otherwise improbable project economically feasible for a
        private (usually not-for-profit) developer to build units affordable to extremely low,
        very low, low and moderate income households. As part of the land write-down
        program, the City may also assist in acquiring and assembling property and in
        subsidizing on-site and off-site improvements.
    2. Below Market Interest Rate Loans
        The City can provide construction and permanent financing to a project at below
        market interest rates using available funds. The need for such financing will be
        evaluated for each specific project. This program will be considered with other
        program incentives stated in this production strategy. Each project will be evaluated
        separately to determine the City assistance warranted to make the desired affordable

        converted to mortgage assistance loans held by the home buyers until they sell or
        transfer ownership of the affordable unit.
     3. Grants or Deferred Payment, Forgivable Loans
The City can provide grants or forgivable loans to developers of affordable housing for off-
site improvements, city fees, and certain project amenities consistent with the City’s design
standards, not paid by other funding sources. Funds for First Time Home Buyer Loans
provided through New Construction Home Ownership developments are typically provided
through a shared equity upon resale and deferred payment loan forgiven upon completion of
the 45 year loan term. The need for this financial assistance will be evaluated for each
specific project.
Once a year (as funding is available), the City will encourage the development for housing of
affordable housing by outreaching to developers to discuss the development of new housing
through the Statement of Interest process described above. During such outreach, the City
will encourage the development of special needs housing for those populations most difficult
to serve that may require supportive services with housing units: including extremely low
income, disabled (including those with developmental disabilities), and the frail elderly. As
described above the City will provide financial or in-kind technical assistance, land write
downs, expedited processing, identifying funding and grant opportunities, and provide below
market rate loans and/or grant funds to encourage such development.
2c. Inclusionary Zoning
Program Goals
Due to the lack of homeownership development in the SFRCRPA it is not anticipated that any
affordable units will be created through inclusionary zoning, unless action is taken by the
State Legislature to approve inclusionary zoning for rental units in the future.
While the Glendale Zoning Code now requires inclusionary zoning to assist in meeting
requirements for affordable housing production of for-sale units in the SFRCRPA, feasibility of
such development is limited now and may not increase in the future.
Program Description
Concurrent with the zoning changes, the City Council, Glendale Redevelopment Agency and
Housing Authority approved a policy with regard to the state-mandated inclusionary housing
requirement in the SFRCRPA. The policy requires that the inclusionary requirement could be
met through the following: on-site; off-site and inside the project area; off-site and outside
the project area; or by paying a fee in-lieu of building the units.
In cases where the in-lieu fee is paid, the Housing Authority will use the funds to develop the
requisite affordable inclusionary units. This policy will ensure that the SFRCRPA inclusionary
requirement can be satisfied within the time period specified by state law.
However, due to the California Superior Court decision, which was upheld by the California
Court of Appeals, Palmer vs. City of Los Angeles, 175 CAL App. 4th 1396 (2009) it was
determined that inclusionary zoning for rental units (even within Redevelopment Project
areas) was not enforceable without further action by the State legislature.
There is one proposed homeownership development in the SFRCRPA that would provide one
moderate income homeownership unit as a condition of meeting the inclusionary housing
                                                          Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                      Page 17 of 35

requirement, but that project has not yet received entitlements and so is not included in any
projected production at this time.
2d. Community Housing Development Organizations and other Nonprofit Housing
Organizations
Program Goals
Continue to coordinate with local nonprofit organizations and encourage the formation of
housing development corporations by interested persons in the community to facilitate the
development and improvement of low cost housing in Glendale. The City is especially
interested in the formation of CHDOs focused on the City of Glendale.
Program Description
Federal HOME funds require that at least 15% of a jurisdiction’s HOME allocation be
designated for use by Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs). A CHDO is
a nonprofit organization with either specific representation from a low income neighborhood
or low income residents on the CHDO board. The City has used CHDO funds in the past.
Unused CHDO funds accumulate with each annual HOME allocation. However, HUD requires
that the City commit all HOME funds, including CHDO reserves, within 24 months of the
annual allocation date and expend all funds within 60 months of the annual allocation date.
Two CHDOs have developed housing in the City—West Hollywood Community Housing
Corporation and the Glendale Housing Corporation.
The City will provide technical assistance to local nonprofit agencies interested in affordable
housing development, particularly organizations wanting to meet the CHDO requirements.
Incentive programs presented in this program strategy are available to both for profit and
nonprofit organizations. However, nonprofit organizations have developed most of the
affordable housing projects in the city. These organizations generally have an interest in long
term management for special needs populations or for neighborhood revitalization purposes.
Annually, staff from the Community Development Department will meet with housing and
other related nonprofit organizations from the community to identify needs, resources,
potential development opportunities, and any at-risk affordable housing units or programs.
2e. Mixed Use Standards on Transportation Corridors
Program Goals
Review and modify mixed-use development standards on existing commercial corridors to
encourage mixed-use development where appropriate.
Program Description
Glendale has been successful in creating and/or modifying zoning standards that encourage
mixed-use development with high density residential housing components in Glendale’s
Downtown Specific Plan area and along the San Fernando Road corridor. For many years
Glendale has also permitted mixed use developments with high density residential standards
in the C1, C2 and C3 commercial zones throughout the City. These zones tend to be located
                                                       Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                   Page 18 of 35

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
along major and secondary arterials, commercial highways and signature streets where transit
options may be available and where nearby goods and services encourage walking, rather
than vehicle trips. Although zoning permits mixed residential-commercial development
opportunities in these zones, relatively few privately funded mixed-use developments are
built in commercial zones. The objective of this program is to encourage development in
transportation corridors by addressing constraints such as reducing private parking
requirements and identifying area for public parking. Current zoning standards for mixed-use
developments in the C1, C2 and C3 zones will be reviewed to determine if there are zoning
standards that inhibit the addition of small scale mixed-use residential-commercial
developments in these zones. Depending on the results of the zoning review, standards in
the C1, C2 and/or C3 zones may be revised or new mixed-use zones may be proposed. This
program will be implemented by June 2017 and will be implemented by the Community
Development Department.
2.2.4 Program Strategy #3 – Rental Assistance
Rental assistance is aimed at ensuring lower income tenants do not have to pay more than 30
percent of their gross income on rent or as otherwise limited by specific programs. The City
of Glendale participates in the HUD-sponsored Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program
which provides direct rental subsidies to lower income households. This is the largest source
of affordable housing funds available to the City and total approximately $24 million per year.
3a. Section 8 Rental Housing Choice Voucher Payments
Program Goals
Continue to provide Section 8 vouchers to approximately 1,553 Glendale and 1,493 portable
vouchers, which Glendale administers on behalf of other housing agencies, to extremely low
and very low income households. The goals of the program give high priority to special
needs populations including: Victims of retaliation, homeless persons, and Veterans. The
next largest special needs groups served by Section 8 include those with multiple preferences
such as: extremely low income, disabled, and a single person over 62. As a result of the
preferences described above, those elderly, single, disabled persons of extremely low income
would receive a higher preference than other households that may be on the Section 8
waiting list. The City will continue to place a high priority on serving Extremely Low Income
household with these funds, by implementing its existing “points” preference system
prioritizing those households given Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers from the waiting list.
This system provides a preference point for Extremely Low Income persons. It also provides
a preference point for Disabled Persons, the majority of whom are Extremely Low Income.
Finally, the City will continue to comply with the program requirement that 75% of all persons
taken from the Section 8 waiting list must be Extremely Low Income. The service levels
shown below demonstrate that this income targeting has resulted in serving a large number
of extremely low income households each year.
Program Description
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program provides direct rental subsidies to extremely
low and very low income households. The subsidy amount equals the difference between 30
percent of the monthly household income and a fair market rent. Extremely Low Income
households are served disproportionately by the program. Currently the income breakdown
of those provided Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers is as follows:
     91% Extremely Low Income (from 0 – 30% of AMI),
                                                        Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                    Page 19 of 35

City of Glendale, California                   H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
        8% Very Low Income (from 31% to 50% of AMI), and
        1% Low Income (from 51% to 80% of AMI).
There are 4,868 assisted persons in households with Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. The
elderly are served disproportionately by the program. The age breakdown for these persons
is as follows:
        36% Non Elderly Household Members, and
        64% Elderly Household Members.
Due to Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program funding reductions at the federal level,
future funding levels are uncertain and the number of vouchers provided may have to be
reduced.
2.2.5 Program Strategy #4 – Increase Homeownership Opportunities
4a. Small Lot Subdivision
Program Goals
The goal of this housing program is to find options for promoting infill development within
multi-family neighborhoods. Glendale provides a lot width density bonus in multi-family
residential zones that reward developers that combine residential lots into larger multi-family
projects. However, there are a number of stand alone “widow and orphan” lots in multiple
family zones where combining lots is not an option. Costs of developing multi-family housing
on single lots may not be cost effective for a small increase in density (generally one or two
units). However, permitting small lot subdivisions of limited scale for the purpose of
constructing new single-family homes within multi-family neighborhoods may be an option for
increasing home ownership opportunities, replacing older housing stock and increasing
neighborhood investment.
Program Description
This program will evaluate the potential for allowing small lot development within the multi-
family zoned areas in Glendale. The program would include reviewing and amending the
City’s Subdivision Ordinance (Title 16) and Zoning Ordinance (Title 30) to allow the creation
of small lots for single-family home development within multi-family zones. Small lot
subdivisions are recognized by the State Department of Housing and Community
Development as a best practice for creating homeownership opportunities that are more
affordable than traditional single-family homes. Small lot developments are high density and
have an urban character, giving them the potential to be compatible in multi-family zones
which tend to be walkable and where residential developments tend to be taller, with less
open space and less on-street parking than traditional single-family neighborhoods. Glendale
will begin study of small lot development in 2013, with implementation to follow.
2.2.6 Program Strategy #5 – Housing Services
In addition to programs designed to increase the availability and adequacy of the City’s
affordable housing stock, it is important that services are available that ensure the efficient
utilization of the housing stock. The City currently offers housing services targeted at
Glendale’s largest special needs group, the elderly. The proposed set of programs expands
this focus to include housing services for lower income households and the homeless.
                                                       Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs

5a. Care Management Services
Program Goals
Continue to provide case management services to 160 seniors annually.
Program Description
The City, through the Community Services and Parks Department, provides case
management services to elderly residents in their homes and at the City’s Adult Recreation
Center. The purpose of case management services is to allow seniors to remain independent
in the community as an alternative to institutionalization. Staff at the Center helps to
coordinate housing services for seniors, such as in-home care and relocation assistance.
Seniors are matched with the appropriate agencies in the community to receive needed
assistance, such as the County for special circumstance relocation assistance. The City
provides case management services to 160 seniors each year.
Case management is currently funded through federal CDBG funds and City General Funds.
5b. Homeless Services
Program Goals
Continue to work with the Glendale Homeless Coalition on an ongoing basis for the Plan
period to support existing programs that have demonstrated effectiveness. And, as funding
is available, work to expand these services and facilities.
Emergency Shelters
       Provide 40 year round emergency shelter beds and 10 year round domestic violence
        crisis shelter beds and serve a combined total of 250 persons annually (2,000 for the 8
        year period).
Transitional Shelters
       Provide transitional housing through 116 beds for persons in families, serving 122
        persons annually (976 persons over the 8 year period.)
Permanent Supportive Housing
       Provide access to permanent supportive housing to 50 homeless households with
        disabilities through the Shelter plus Care Program.
       Provide stable housing for persons with special needs through permanent supportive
        housing. Continue to provide 22 slots for unaccompanied adults.
       Provide stable housing for families with special needs through Chester Street
        Permanent Supportive Housing Program. Continue to provide 18 beds for persons in
        families.
Case Management and Supportive Services
       Continue implementation of the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS)
        program. All funded agencies are using HMIS on a 100% basis.
                                                         Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Homeless Prevention Services
      Provide homeless prevention services through case management, advocacy, and direct
       financial assistance to households at risk of homelessness to help them maintain/obtain
       housing. Serve 200 families annually (1,600 for the 8 year period.)
Street Outreach
      Provide street outreach services to the chronically homeless street population in
       Glendale and connect clients to the Continuum of Care.
Domestic Violence Programs
      Provide safe emergency housing as part of a year round 10 bed domestic violence
       shelter and serve a combined total of 60 persons annually (480 for the 8 year period.)
Support Services
      Provide Medical Discharge Counseling services to homeless persons being discharged
       from Glendale Adventist Medical Center to address emergency needs and link them to
       homeless services under the local preference for homeless families.
Program Description
The City of Glendale has estimated in the January 2013 count that there are 299 homeless
persons in Glendale on any given night. Many of these are individuals and families with
special needs requiring attention, such as substance abuse, mental illness, physical disabilities
or domestic violence.
The Continuum of Care is comprised of outreach and assessment, emergency, transitional
and permanent housing, and homeless prevention activities. In addition, a variety of
supportive services are linked to housing programs that address the problems that contribute
to homelessness:        domestic violence, substance abuse, physical and mental health.
Supportive services designed to provide enhanced employment opportunities, to assist
veterans, and to facilitate placement in, and maintenance of, permanent housing are also
offered.
With the City’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Emergency Solutions
Grant (ESG) programs, and through the aggressive pursuit of competitive funding
opportunities provided by HUD, including the Supportive Housing Program (SHP), many
components of the continuum of care are in place.
5c. Medical Services (MS) Zone
Program Goals
Create a new Medical Services (MS) Zone to encourage a variety of uses supportive or
dependent on medical uses in close proximity to hospitals, including supportive services,
special-needs and transitional housing.
Program Description
The City of Glendale has three hospitals which greatly influence the character of the
neighborhoods in which they are located. Currently, all hospitals are zoned for C3-

Commercial Services, a zone aimed at providing for general commercial activities. Hospitals,
however, share characteristics that are not typical of general commercial activities, and could
benefit from having distinct standards. In addition, the presence of a hospital often creates
demand for housing related to hospital workers including nursing students and visiting
doctors. There is often a demand for special-needs housing, convalescent homes, senior
housing, temporary housing for patient families (Ronald McDonald house) and housing with
supportive services in areas nearby hospitals. The City will adopt a Medical Services (MS)
zone to accommodate a variety of commercial and residential activities that support
hospitals.
5d. Developmental Disabilities Housing Services
Program Goals
Work with nonprofit groups serving persons with developmental disabilities in the Glendale
area and with the Lanterman Regional Center to educate, inform, and assist disabled person
in locating and maintaining housing in Glendale.
Program Description
Develop an informational brochure and other outreach methods that will provide information
on City and other agency/organization housing and supportive services for the
developmental disabilities community.                Provide housing-related training for
individuals/families through workshops and other identified outreach methods. This program
will be implemented by the Community Development Department Housing Division by June
2015.
2.2.7 Program Strategy #6 – Fair Housing
The City of Glendale worked to implement a fair housing strategy consistent with State and
Federal law. Since 1982, the City made a commitment to develop and update a Fair Housing
Plan that insures equal housing opportunities for all residents, regardless of age, race,
religion, national origin, physical condition, marital status, or sex. In 2010, the Fair Housing
Analysis of Impediments Plan was updated. Furthermore, the City contracts annually with a
fair housing provider for fair housing services to Glendale residents.
6a. Fair Housing Plan
Program Goals
Continue to implement the 2010-2015 Fair Housing Analysis of Impediments to Housing
Choice (AI) and implement its recommendations. Review and update the AI for 2015 - 2020.
Continue to contract with a fair housing service provider for multi-language fair housing and
landlord/tenant services to an average annual 1,000 Glendale residents per year. Services
include: discrimination complaint education, enforcement and legal services, landlord/tenant
counseling, and education/outreach. Update Policies and Procedures for Fair Housing in light
of the new proposed (June 29, 2013) Fair Housing Rule and the final adoption of any rule
changes for federal grantees, such as the City of Glendale.
Program Description
The City’s Fair Housing Plan addresses actions to affirmatively further fair housing. One
strategy to further fair housing practices has been an increase in education and outreach for
                                                          Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs

both renters and rental property owners. The City coordinates semiannual community fair
housing workshops. The workshops are made available under a CDBG contract with the
Housing Rights Center to serve City residents with fair housing education, conciliation,
mediation, and resolving tenant/ landlord disputes. Residents who feel discriminated against
by rental property owners, rental property managers, real estate agents, or loan and credit
agents are also referred to the Council to get information and assistance with their
discrimination claim. Services through the Housing Rights Center are available in English,
Spanish, and Armenian, the three primary languages in Glendale, as well as others.
2.2.8 Program Strategy #7- Sustainability
The State passed AB32 in 2006 and SB375 in 2007 to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions through a variety of methods, including local long-term planning. The State
identified guidelines for local government compliance. As a result, the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) prepared a combined Regional Transportation Plan and
Sustainable Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS) to provide coordinated transportation and
housing with GHG reduction targets for the SCAG region. To comply with AB32 and SB375
State mandates, Glendale received a grant and prepared the three-part Greener Glendale
Plan consisting of the following:
        Greener Glendale 2010 Report identifying the status of Glendale GHG reduction
         efforts;
        Greener Glendale Plan for Municipal Operations identifying GHG emissions,
         programs, strategies and targets for GHG reduction for actions under the direct
         control of the City of Glendale; and,
        Greener Glendale Plan for Community Activities identifying programs, strategies and
         targets for GHG reductions for activities occurring within the City of Glendale, but
         outside control of the municipality.
The Greener Glendale Plan was completed in 2012 and provides the basis for the following
housing-related programs which further Glendale’s sustainability efforts. These programs,
along with the Glendale Water and Power Public Benefits programs, the Tropico Station
neighborhood target area, and Mixed-Use Standards for Transportation Corridors (See
Programs 1c, 1e, and 2e) are consistent with Greener Glendale Plan policies for increasing
efficiencies in government operations and furthering green community efforts related to
urban design, energy, water, urban nature and transportation.
7a. South Glendale Community Plan
Program Goals
Continue with the realignment of Glendale’s General Plan Land Use Element from a citywide
view of land uses to a community focus on land uses within neighborhoods. In November
2011, Glendale adopted the North Glendale Community Plan, the first of several community
plans, to focus future land use planning to reflect individual neighborhood character. This
program to prepare Community Plans to reflect neighborhood characteristics will continue,
with the creation of the South Glendale Community Plan.

This program includes a review of existing neighborhoods, identification of areas to maintain,
enhance and transform and an identification of changes necessary to implement the plan. A
necessary and integral part of developing the South Glendale Community Plan is the
preparation of an environmental impact report at a program level. The South Glendale
Community Plan area includes the neighborhood “target area” Tropico Station
neighborhood, and one purpose of this program will be to incorporate transit-oriented
development principles (See Program Strategy #1, Target Areas) into the South Glendale
Community Plan. The South Glendale Community Plan is presently under preparation and
will be adopted in 2015 as funding allows.
7b. Permit Streamlining
Program Goals
Due to the State elimination of Redevelopment Agencies, the City began a major staff
reduction and reorganization in 2012. Community Development was particularly hard hit, with
major funding reductions and over a 50% reduction in staffing. This program aims at
studying and revamping Glendale’s development entitlement process in order to realign
licensing, permit and development processing requirements with new and long-term staffing
and budgetary constraints and mandatory state and federal processing timeframes.
Program Description
This program includes a review of Glendale’s entitlement processes for the purpose of
identifying opportunities to reduce or eliminate redundant review processes. This program
includes the potential for changes to development codes and the General Plan to increase
the number of projects subject to approval by staff and the Director of Community
Development and to reduce the number and need for public hearings where other
opportunities are provided for public input into the decision-making process. This program is
on-going.
7c. Transit-Oriented Development Housing Standards
Program Goals
Complete the existing study of the grant-funded Tropico Station neighborhood to identify
policies and programs to create a transit-oriented neighborhood. Review and implement
transit-oriented development (TOD) study recommendations in the South Glendale
Community Plan and in the zoning code as they relate to zoning locations and standards for
residential development.
Program Description
This program includes continuation of the Tropico Study and implementation of appropriate
transit-oriented development recommendations related to housing. Appropriate policy
recommendations would be incorporated into the South Glendale Community Plan to ensure
transit-oriented policies become part of Glendale’s General Plan. Zoning standards would
also be reviewed to encourage transit-oriented development, including housing, based upon
recommendations of the Tropico Study. This program is on-going and will be implemented
following approval of environmental review for the South Glendale Community Plan.
7d. Greener Glendale Climate Adaptation Plan

2.3      CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE GENERAL PLAN
The Elements which comprise the Glendale Comprehensive General Plan are required by law
to be internally consistent. Together these elements – Land Use, Housing, Open Space and
Conservation, Circulation, Safety, Seismic Safety Noise, Air Quality, Community Facilities,
Historic Preservation, and Recreation provide the framework for development of those
facilities, services and land uses necessary to address the needs and desires of the City’s
residents. To ensure that these needs are clearly addressed throughout the General Plan, the
elements must be interrelated and interdependent. This section examines the relationship of
the Housing Element and its policies to the other elements of Glendale’s General Plan.
The Housing Element is most closely related to the Land Use Element, which establishes the
location, density and type of residential uses permitted in Glendale. This update to the City’s
Housing Element reflects changes made to the Land Use Element when it was
comprehensively revised in 2011 in response to the creation and adoption of the North
Glendale Community Plan and the Greener Glendale Plan. The Greener Glendale Plan is a
sustainability document prepared in three phases, addressing baseline conditions and
programs in 2010, municipal operations in 2011 and community activities in 2012. The
Greener Glendale Plan, prepared in compliance with AB 23 (2006) known as the Global
Warming Solutions Act and SB 375 (2008) known as the Sustainable Communities and Climate
Protection Act, blends policies and programs for housing, transportation, urban design,
energy efficiency, water conservation and urban nature to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
(GHG). This Housing Element bases the calculation of residential development potential on
the most recent update to the Land Use Plan. The policies and proposals of the Housing
Element are entirely consistent with those set forth in the Land Use Element.
The Open Space and Conservation and Recreation Elements set forth policies for the
preservation and protection of the City’s natural environment through the conservation of
significant open space areas, acquisition of land for parks and recreation, and restriction of
development in hazardous areas. The updated Housing Element is consistent with these
policies in that the Element does not propose the utilization of land for housing, or create
additional intensities of usage not called for in the Land Use Element.
The Circulation Element directs the development of an integrated system of streets to carry
the flow of traffic generated by adopted land uses. At the same time, the element seeks to
minimize the adverse environmental and aesthetic of the road network and traffic on sensitive
land uses such as housing. In 2011 Glendale amended the Circulation Element to include
complete streets policies. In 2013 the City adopted an updated Bicycle Transportation Plan
                                                          Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                      Page 32 of 35

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
to augment Circulation Element policies related to bicycles and pedestrians. By establishing
a network of complete streets, bikeways, pedestrian ways and equestrian trails which link the
City’s various scenic, historic and environmental/open space amenities, the Element attempts
to create a satisfying living environment for the City’s residents. The Circulation Element is
based on the distribution and intensity of land uses established by the Land Use Element, as
is the updated Housing Element.
The Community Facilities Element designates locations of public facilities such as schools,
emergency service facilities, parks, and public structures. Since the revised Housing Element
does not propose any major new development not called for in the Land Use Element, no
inconsistencies exist between the Community Facilities Element and the updated Housing
Element.
The Safety Element identifies the City’s inherent geologic and seismic hazards and indicates
appropriate actions in response to these and other hazards in Glendale. The Safety Element
recommends goals, policies, and programs to guide the development and protection of
residences and their occupants. The revised Housing Element does not make any
recommendations which are inconsistent with the intent of this element.
The Noise Element contains policies to reduce the impacts of noise on the City’s residents.
Residential development in areas with high noise is discouraged unless adequate noise
attenuation features are included in project designs which reduce noise to acceptable levels.
The updated Housing Element does not propose any new areas for residential development
not identified in the Land Use Element, and no new areas of potential conflict between
residences and noise generators are created. The utilization of greenbelts and open space,
along with the enforcement of noise attenuation standards established in the Building Code,
will serve to protect new residential development from potential noise conflicts.
The Historic Preservation Element identifies those structures and sites recognized as having
historic significance. While some structures have been officially recognized by Federal and
State agencies, the focus of the City’s element is on local relevancy. The Historic
Preservation Element establishes guidelines for the preservation of these sites and buildings,
including several historic residences. The updated Housing Element contains no goals or
policies in conflict with the intent of the Historic Preservation Element.
2.4     CONSISTENCY              WITH       THE       CALIFORNIA          ENVIRONMENTAL
        QUALITY ACT
An initial study and negative declaration were prepared for this project in accordance with
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Comments received during the public
comment period were addressed in the final negative declaration prepared for this project. It
is a requirement that the final negative declaration be approved prior to adoption of the
update to the Housing Element.
2.5 CONSISTENCY WITH THE GLENDALE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY
        IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
AB x1 26 as amended by AB 1484 (2011) dissolved redevelopment agencies as of February 1,
2012. All ongoing redevelopment activities were suspended at that time and successor
agencies were appointed to wind down the affairs of redevelopment agencies. The Glendale
                                                           Chapter 2 – Goals, Policies and Programs
                                                                                       Page 33 of 35

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Successor Agency (GSA) is responsible for that wind up in the City of Glendale. The GSA has
been working cooperatively with the Glendale Housing Successor Agency (Housing Authority
of the City of Glendale) to complete several affordable housing developments and housing
related enforceable obligations outstanding at the time of dissolution of redevelopment.
The Housing Assets of the Glendale Redevelopment Agency were transferred to the Housing
Authority of the City of Glendale. Program income resulting from the investments of
Redevelopment Set Aside funds in prior years, such as loan repayments, are now assets of
the Housing Authority and are called Low Moderate Income Housing Asset Funds (LMIHAF).
Expenditure of those funds is limited to those eligible uses permitted by California
Redevelopment Law. However, there is some dispute as to the continuing obligations of the
Housing Successor Agencies to track and report the expenditures of LMIHAF and to meet
other requirements of Redevelopment Law for expenditure of funds, including targeting
funds proportionally to low/moderate income households as reflected in local RHNA
affordable housing percentages or US Census senior/family ratios in the community. Pending
legislation (SB133) seeks to assert specific obligations for expenditures of those funds;
however, this legislation has not been passed into law and does not apply at this time.
2.6 QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES 2014 - 2018
Government Code Section 65583b requires identification of quantified objectives for five
years, and the term of this Housing Element is eight years. Exhibit 2-2 shows the quantified
objectives that establish the maximum number of housing units by income category that can
be constructed, rehabilitated and conserved over a five year period, from 2014 through 2018.
Those units projected for extremely low income, very low income, low income, and moderate
income are assisted units with funded (but not entitled), entitled, or projects under
construction with housing units will remain affordable for a period of time. Two above-
moderate income units are located within the three projects with direct financial assistance
and 345 above-moderate income units are within 2 density bonus assisted projects. Another
934 above-moderate income units are found in private projects not linked to financing with
affordability requirements. The entitled or in construction units are described in Exhibit 4-36.
Section 4.6 of the Housing Element contains a list of the five assisted housing projects with
their anticipated timeframes for development and affordability restrictions.
Section 4.5 Preservation of Assisted Units identifies affordable units which are at risk of
conversion to market rate units during the timeframe for this element. As explained in
Section 4.5, the City studied the degree of risk for conversion of units with affordability
restrictions to market rate units and identified the manner in which the City will assist in the
preservation of existing units. It was noted that 209 units with short term affordability
restrictions as a result of multi-family rehabilitation loans to private owners have a high
likelihood of conversion to market rate units during the years 2014 - 2018, with no additional
housing units having a high likelihood of conversion in plan years 2019 - 2021. It is not
anticipated to be financially feasible to retain these units as affordable units beyond the
expiration of loan agreements due to the gap between the required affordable rents and
market rate rents for comparable units in Glendale. As noted in the Fiscal Analysis in Chapter
4, the most cost effective method of replacement of affordable units is through construction
of new units, rather than conservation of existing affordability contracts. For this reason,
Exhibit 2-5 does not identify conservation or preservation of units within the 2014-2018 time

owner has interest in continuing with this program and if funding becomes available.
Exhibit 2-2 reflects five-year goals for these programs.

CHAPTER 3 – REVIEW OF GOALS AND POLICIES FROM THE
PREVIOUS ELEMENT
The State of California requires that each local government update their Housing Element not
less than every five years. An important component of this
revised Housing Element is the evaluation of the previous
Housing Element. It is important to determine if the
housing needs have changed, if the goals and policies are
still relevant, and if the programs were effective. These
questions were systematically considered as part of the
Housing Element update. This section of the Housing
Element update provides a review of the previous goals,
objectives and implementation measures to assess the
progress that the City has achieved since the 2006-2014
Housing Element was adopted.
3.1      GOALS AND POLICIES OF THE PREVIOUS ELEMENT
3.1.1 GOAL 1 - A City with a Wide Range of Housing Types to Meet the Needs of
Current and Future Residents
Policy 1.1
Provide a variety of residential development opportunities in the City through the zoning of
sufficient land with a range of densities.
Review
The Land Use Element of the General Plan provides multiple categories of residential uses.
Glendale provides two categories of single family density and four categories of multiple
family densities. In addition, Glendale provides a variety of mixed use opportunities in areas
covered by the Downtown Glendale Specific Plan, Town Center Specific Plan, San Fernando
Road Redevelopment Project Area, and along commercial corridors.
The Zoning Ordinance provides seven different residential unit densities and a variety of
development standards consistent with the densities prescribed by the Land Use Element.
Special zoning categories in the Zoning Code allowing residential uses include a planned
residential development overlay zone, a horse overlay zone and medical services zone. The
medical services zone expands opportunities for special needs housing in proximity to
hospitals. The IMU, IMU-R and SFMU zones provide for mixed use opportunities along a wide
swath of southwestern Glendale, much of which borders the City of Los Angeles. The
Downtown Specific Plan and Town Center Specific Plan areas provide additional mixed use
residential opportunities. Mixed use zones expand the residential capacity of the City by
providing opportunities for higher density residential uses in areas previously reserved for
commercial and manufacturing uses.
In 2006, the California Department of Housing and Community Development’s director and
other representatives visited Glendale to review the City’s innovative approach toward mixed
use zoning and its encouragement of more predictable, higher quality, higher density
development through its Downtown Specific Plan and San Fernando Road Rezoning

                                                                                    Page 1 of 44

programs. This is a successful model for mixed-use and has shown to encourage new mixed-
use high density residential applications since its adoption. The City will continue to
encourage mixed use developments where appropriate and as identified through these
programs and will incorporate new mixed use policies in the new element.

under construction, and entitled affordable housing projects can be found in Section 4.6 and
Exhibit 4-26. Section 4.6 describes the various affordability levels and funding sources for
each assisted project.
In addition to the number of housing units constructed, Exhibit 3-1 includes a tally of the
number of housing units which are under construction or entitled. An additional 26 units
affordable to very low income households and 1,279 units affordable to above moderate
income households are under construction or have been entitled. These affordable units
which are under construction or have been entitled have conditions of project approval which
require the recording of affordability restrictions, including monitoring and compliance
requirements by Glendale’s Community Development and Housing Department, prior to
occupancy. The number of housing units built or in the development process affordable to all
income levels demonstrates the City’s commitment to promoting the development of a wide
range of housing types.
Policy 1.2
Assure that affordable housing is dispersed throughout the City while recognizing the
potential for the integration of market rate and affordable units within individual projects.
Review
During the period of the 2006-2014 Housing Element, the City assisted with the development
of numerous affordable and special needs housing projects. Direct financial assistance was
provided for construction of 277 new rental units and 76 ownership units. Density bonus
projects with affordable units mixed among market rate units built or under construction
include Broadway Lofts (Elevé), Triangle Project, Geneva Habitat of Humanity, Kenwood
Habitat for Humanity and the Metro Loma Project. Several of these projects are located in
South Glendale because that area is zoned to accommodate higher densities because of
proximity to transportation corridors and flat lands. However, efforts are made to disperse
                                                               Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies

affordable housing throughout the City and the two Habitat for Humanity developments are
located in the 134 Freeway corridor, which is within the City’s geographic center. The City
has been successful in assisting development of affordable housing throughout the urbanized
“City core”, in areas not impacted by steep slopes. The City will continue this policy.
Policy 1.3
Provide higher density residential development in close proximity to public transportation,
services and recreation.
Review
Glendale has been successful in concentrating higher density developments in the Downtown
Specific Plan and San Fernando Road Corridor areas. The adoption of the San Fernando Road
rezoning in 2004 amplified the number of residential units that could be built within close
proximity to the Glendale Metrolink Station. In 2012 SCAG began funding of a study to look
at transit oriented development standards around the station, building on the 2004 San
Fernando Road re-zoning efforts. Glendale’s past zone changes resulted in greater residential
capacities along portions of San Fernando Road, Los Feliz Road and Colorado Boulevard
which are critical public transportation roadways. The adoption of the Mobility Study and the
Downtown Specific Plan in 2006 further explored linkages between land use policy and public
transportation by centering density for future high density mixed use development along the
City’s major downtown arterials. The City has been successful in implementing this policy and
will continue to do so.
Policy 1.4
Continue to promote residential/mixed use development, including live-work units in
appropriate locations.
Review
A variety of residential zones are available in diverse parts of the city although it should be
recognized that higher density developments must be located where they can be supported
by the necessary infrastructure, including the street system. The City has rezoned downtown
Glendale and the San Fernando Road corridor to promote mixed-use zoning. These efforts
raised allowable densities along certain transportation corridors and in downtown Glendale
and increased the predictability of receiving greater residential densities in those areas. The
adoption of the San Fernando rezoning in 2004 and the Downtown Specific Plan in 2006
provided for mixed use opportunities in industrial areas, including provisions for live-work
units. The City has been successful in its implementation of this policy and will continue to
encourage residential/mixed use development in appropriate locations.
Policy 1.5
Encourage the development of residential units in the downtown area and along appropriate
commercial corridors.
Review
The Downtown Specific Plan and Town Center Specific Plans were successful in encouraging
high density residential development in the downtown area. Mixed-use zoning was
successful in encouraging high density residential development in South Glendale along the
                                                            Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies
                                                                                     Page 6 of 44

San Fernando Corridor. Additionally, Glendale commercial zones C1, C2, C3 and CH allow
mixed use development to occur along commercial corridors throughout the City. The City
will continue to implement this policy.
Policy 1.6
Continue to monitor local, state and federal regulations, ordinances, departmental processing
procedures and fees related to their impact on housing costs.
Review
City staff monitors local, state and federal regulations, ordinances and departmental
processing procedures and fees related to housing. The City revised its design review board
procedures in 2009, and again in 2013 to reduce the time and requirements for development
review. The City has formed a permit streamlining taskforce which is in the process of
making further revisions to Glendale’s development process, including elimination of one of
the City’s design review boards. Additionally, this policy is embodied in the policy direction
and distribution of land use densities in the Land Use Element of the General Plan. Residential
land uses are distributed so as to provide economical construction and living opportunities.
For example, higher density residential zones are located near bus service and freeway
access to bring residents in proximity to transportation. Residential uses are permitted in
commercial zones at high residential densities in areas where services are available that can
accommodate new development. Expanded housing opportunities in the downtown were
adopted through the Downtown Specific Plan and Mobility Study and the Town Center
Specific Plan. Housing opportunities were also expanded along the San Fernando Road
corridor through the implementation of mixed use standards. The City has been successful
implementing this policy by allowing residential uses in commercial zones and through
adoption of specific plans.
Policy 1.7
The City shall explore the feasibility of establishing additional housing trust funds as a means
of developing additional affordable housing.
Review
The City has established a housing trust fund as a result of inclusionary zoning requirements
in the San Fernando Road Corridor Redevelopment Project Area (SFRCRPA). Fees may be
contributed to the fund by residential developers in the area in-lieu of development of onsite
affordable units. No fees have been collected to date, although inclusionary housing units
have been developed on site as part of affordable housing developments. Due to the
California Superior Court decision, which was upheld by the California Court of Appeals,
Palmer vs. City of Los Angeles, 175 CAL App. 4th 1396 (2009) it was determined that
inclusionary zoning for rental units (even within Redevelopment Project areas) was not
enforceable without further action by the State legislature. It does apply to new
homeownership units, but homeownership development in the SFRCRPA has not yet proven
feasible. Legislation has been introduced in the State Legislature to permit inclusionary rental
housing programs, but no action has been taken to date. The City will continue to implement
this policy as it applies to homeownership development and it is incorporated in Chapter 2 as
Policy 1.7.
                                                              Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Policy1.8
The City shall continue to promote the consolidation of small lots for residential development
through the lot width density bonus program.
Review
The City will continue to maintain density incentives for combining small lots for residential
development through the lot width density bonus program. This has been an effective
method for encouraging the development of new market rate units at by-right densities up to
40 units per acre, which are considered affordable densities. In addition, the City allows the
by-right density for lot width density bonus to be combined with density bonus for
affordability provisions in accordance with SB1818 (Zoning Code Chapter 30.36- Density
Bonus). Allowing the combination of the lot width density bonus and affordability density
bonus has been effective in entitling new developments in South Glendale. However, due to
the economy, many of the housing developments that received entitlements from Glendale
and other cities in the region did not proceed to a construction phase. When the economy
recovers, it is envisioned that the current zoning and incentives will allow developers to
return with similar housing development proposals. The City will continue to implement this
policy.
Policy 1.9
Encourage flexibility in the Zoning Ordinance to promote a wide range of housing types.
Review
The Zoning Code allows flexibility to develop a wide range of housing types and densities.
Single-family, multi-family, mixed use, live-work and a wide variety of special needs housing
are permitted under the code. In 2013, Glendale adopted a Medical Service (MS) zone, which
encourages land uses that support hospitals. The MS Zone encourages assisted living,
residential congregate care and convalescent facilities in proximity to Glendale Adventist
Medical Center hospital, with the potential for the two other hospitals in Glendale to request
similar zoning in the future. This policy has been successfully implemented. The City will
continue to implement this policy.
3.1.2     GOAL 2 - A City with High Quality Residential Neighborhoods that are
            Attractive and Well Designed
Policy 2.1
Implement the Downtown Specific Plan and the Town Center Specific Plan.
Review
The Glendale Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) and Mobility Study were adopted in 2006. The
DSP provides a comprehensive form-based planning tool for downtown, based on existing
neighborhood characteristics and opportunities for improvement. The Town Center Specific
Plan, adopted in 2005, was encompassed within the Downtown Specific Plan. The Town
Center Specific Plan provides for shopping opportunities and open space as identified in the
Greater Downtown Strategic Plan. The City was successful in implementing this policy
through adoption of the DSP and the Town Center Specific Plan. The City will continue to
implement this as Policy 2.1 in Chapter 2.
                                                           Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies

City of Glendale, California                 HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Policy 2.2
Retain the quality and prominent characteristics of existing neighborhoods while improving
those in need of change through neighborhood and community planning. Monitor the effects
of growth and change.
Review
The City continues to weigh development proposals in residential neighborhoods through
use of staff review and Design Review Boards. In November 2011 the City adopted
Comprehensive Design Guidelines to aid in design review. Additionally, the City prepared
the North Glendale Community Plan and several specific plans including the Town Center
Specific Plan and the Downtown Specific Plan. These community plans and specific plans
provide for in depth planning within a limited area of the City. The City is presently working
on the South Glendale Community Plan. Since this policy requires on-going implementation,
the City will continue this housing policy.
Policy 2.3
Continue to utilize the City’s code enforcement program to bring substandard units into
compliance with City codes and to improve overall housing conditions in Glendale.
Review
The Neighborhood Services Division coordinates an ongoing program of code enforcement,
with backup assistance from the Building and Safety Division and other enforcement
agencies. The City Attorney’s office assists the Neighborhood Service Division to pursue
prosecutions where administrative enforcement activities do not produce the required
results. Between 2006 and 2013, the City was proactive in bringing properties into
compliance through the Code Enforcement Program. In 2012, 27,000 field inspections were
completed and 1,900 cases were initiated by Neighborhood Services staff. Glendale was
successful in implementing its Code Enforcement Program; deterioration of existing housing
decreased. The City will continue this housing policy.
Policy 2.4
Continue existing residential rehabilitation programs which provide financial and technical
assistance to lower income property owners and property owners providing affordable units.
Review
The single family owner and multi-family residential rehabilitation programs were developed
to assist low income homeowners and rental property owners who rent units at an affordable
rent in order to preserve an aging housing stock of units serving low-income households. The
rental rehabilitation program also provided short term (5-15 years) of housing affordability
restrictions.
From 1998 to 2005, the terms and conditions of both loan programs changed in response to
a changing housing market and increasing construction and materials costs. Maximum loan
amounts were increased and loan terms were reduced in order to address the cost of basic
repairs and to make the loans more attractive to private property owners.
Since 2000, the rental rehabilitation program became increasingly difficult to market to
private property owners due to the increasing gap in affordable rents required by the loan
program and the market rate rents the owners could obtain without the program.

Due to the loss of Redevelopment Set Aside funds the single family owner rehabilitation
program was terminated in 2011.
Policy 2.5
Promote increased awareness among property owners and residents of the importance of
property maintenance to long term housing quality.
Review
The Code Enforcement Program focuses on education, resorting to punitive action only when
necessary. There is a citizen advisory board (the Committee for a Clean and Beautiful
Glendale) in place that conducts programs which address the importance of property
maintenance. Additionally, the City uses newspaper articles, flyers, a website, online
newsletter, twitter and community meetings as part of its outreach efforts.
Policy 2.6
Educate property owners in the need to design and use materials consistent with the
character of the residence and neighborhood.
Review
The Design Review Boards and staff regularly advise property owners on the need for new
and remodeled buildings to be compatible with existing neighborhoods and for materials to
be consistent with building style and architecture. Design Review Board (DRB) meetings are
held every Thursday afternoon and are open to the public. All DRB meetings are televised on
the City’s channel GTV6 and are archived for 24-hour viewing on the City’s website.
Prospective applicants may also discuss design review issues with city planners at no charge
during public counter hours 7am – 12pm weekdays or over the phone during all regular city
work hours.
The Historic Preservation Commission and the historic planner regularly advise property
owners on the benefits afforded to owners of historic resources and make them aware of
their responsibility to maintain their properties. In 2006, the City adopted Design Guidelines
for Historic Districts, an illustrated, user-friendly document which will give guidance to
property owners on a wide range of maintenance, building improvement and building
addition projects. The Design Review process also fulfills the intent of this policy for
structures not designated in the Glendale Register of Historic Resources.
The City has been successful in implementing this housing policy. However, this is an on-
going effort and will continue to require substantial effort on the part of the City and
residents to ensure its success. This housing policy will be continued. Additionally, review of
this policy has shown that there is a need for additional tools to assist the public in creating
designs that are compatible with existing development and neighborhoods. New housing
policies have been added in Chapter 2 relating to development of design guidelines for
residential uses and to provide guidance to the Design Review Boards concerning visual
appeal of residential neighborhoods.
Policy 2.7
Encourage the preservation of historic resources in a manner sensitive to historic design and
promote the development of historic districts through standards contained in the Historic
Preservation Ordinance and by the activities of the Historic Preservation Commission.
                                                             Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Review
The Historic Preservation Commission has been active in encouraging the preservation of
historic resources. Since 2006, the City has adopted five residential historic districts: Ard
Eevin Highlands, Cottage Grove, North Cumberland Heights, Rossmoyne and Royal
Boulevard. As of May 2013, Brockmont Park is under study for historic district status.
Policy 2.8
Develop design guidelines for residential uses including the use of high quality materials, site
planning and other standards.
Review
In November 2011, the City adopted Comprehensive Design Guidelines which provide design
direction for a variety of residential uses throughout the City of Glendale. The
Comprehensive Design Guidelines include direction for incorporating high quality materials,
proper site design, scale, massing, landscaping and other standards.
Policy 2.9
Ensure the variety and visual appeal of residential development in Glendale through the
Design Review process.
Review
Glendale has Urban Design staff who review new development for compliance with various
City design guidelines and make recommendations to various development review and
approval bodies, including the City Council, Housing Authority, two Design Review Boards,
Historic Preservation Commission, the Director of Community Development and Planning
Hearing Officers. In 2011, the City adopted Comprehensive Design Guidelines to aid the
community, developers, decision-makers and staff in the creation, review and approval of
residential projects that are compatible with the various neighborhoods in which they are
located. In late 2008, the City also decided to re-organize its General Plan Land Use Element,
shifting emphasis upon neighborhood and community planning, rather than city-wide land
use. As a result of this shift, the Community Development Department and resident advisory
committee created the North Glendale Community Plan which incorporates neighborhood
descriptions, neighborhood-based development policies, design guidelines and public
improvements.
Policy 2.10
Respect scale, historic continuity, and a sense of community in new residential development.
Review
In 2011 the City adopted the North Glendale Community Plan, an update to the City’s
General Plan which included the study of residential neighborhoods throughout the
Crescenta Valley portion of Glendale. This Community Plan includes a broad historic context
that recognizes the importance of past actions in establishing today’s communities. As a
result of this study, residential neighborhoods were described and architectural guidelines
established which, in part, are based on preserving the historic character of residential
neighborhoods. Community Development staff are currently drafting the South Glendale
Community Plan and will eventually establish community plans throughout the City in order to
ensure that Glendale’s Land Use Element reflects the character of individual neighborhoods.

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Policy 2.11
Consider “target areas” as a strategy to foster safe, sanitary and secure housing; to expand
public open space; and to provide a catalyst for neighborhood improvement.
Review
The City has determined that using target areas for neighborhood revitalization is a better
strategy to foster improved housing and high quality neighborhoods of all types, including
those with a significant percentage of renters. This tool has become a method of preserving
and improving existing neighborhoods, rather than a tool only for increasing home ownership
opportunities The City has had success in implementing this program in the Pacific Edison,
Adams Square and East Garfield Neighborhoods. However, there are still neighborhoods
that need improvements. In 2013 the City began a study of the Tropico Station neighborhood
around the Glendale Historic Train Station in order to identify transit-oriented policies and
programs that can be implemented to improve this neighborhood. The City will continue to
maintain this housing policy as Policy 2.11 in Chapter 2 so that neighborhood improvements
may continue.
3.1.3 GOAL 3 - A City with Increased Opportunities for Home Ownership
Policy 3.1
Continue to offer home ownership education, counseling and marketing programs.
Review
A program was in operation since 2001 that provided 6 home buyer education classes each
year with approximately 30 people attending each class. Two classes were provided each
year in foreign languages – one in Armenian and one in Spanish. These classes provided
consumer protection advice, basic budget and mortgage underwriting and real estate
information to fire time home buyers. The classes connected home buyers with lenders,
realtors, credit counseling agencies, and other resources for further assistance beyond that
provided in the class. The City has successfully implemented this policy. However, with the
loss of Redevelopment Set Aside funds, this program was terminated in 2011.
Policy 3.2
Provide additional home ownership assistance such as mortgage revenue bond finances and
mortgage interest write-downs, and facilitate private partnerships for home ownership
opportunities.
Review
The use of City funds to implement a second mortgage down payment assistance program
proved to be not feasible. The program proved to have limited feasibility in the 2006-2014
housing market, especially following the 2007 housing market crash and resulting home
purchase credit crunch. The program was terminated in 2011 due to this issue and due to the
loss of Redevelopment Set Aside funds. However, partnerships with nonprofit developers,
including Heritage Housing Partners and San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity in order to
create new construction home ownership units were successful during the eight year review
period and resulted in the construction of 76 new affordable home ownership unit. However,
the City will include a policy to use these tools for development and include them within
Policy 3.2 in Chapter 2

City of Glendale, California                 HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Policy 3.3
Maximize funding to increase homeownership such as through regional collaboration and by
seeking additional Federal, State and private funding opportunities.
Review
Partnerships with nonprofit developers permitted leveraging of outside resources to make
homeownership development feasible during a challenging housing market characterized by
rapidly decreasing home prices and a credit freeze by banks to first time home buyers.
Additional resources were brought to Glendale through the Heritage Housing Partners Doran
Gardens project including a $4.8 million in below market interest rate construction loan from
California Housing Finance Agency, $18 million in New Market Tax Credits (in partnership
with the City of Pasadena, Clearinghouse CDFI, Chase Bank), and $5.2 million in State of
California BEGIN grant funds.
Glendale participated in the Mortgage Credit Certificate program. This program is marketed
and managed by Los Angeles County, but encountered the same difficult home ownership
market as the First Time Homebuyer Program. Some home buyers in Doran Gardens were
able to use this program.
San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity projects leveraged significant investments from the
Carpenters Union, Disney Corporation, several private foundations, individual contributions
of time, labor, and materials and sweat equity from the home buyers. Down payment
assistance loans were provided to the individual home buyers from the Federal Home Loan
Bank WISH Program and the State of California CalHome Program.
The City will continue to maintain this as Policy 3.2 for all types of affordable housing
development in Chapter 2, as these financing tools may become more flexible or usable in
Glendale in the future.
Policy 3.4
Review subdivision standards with Zoning Ordinance and Specific Plan standards to minimize
barriers to affordable homeownership.
Review
During the plan review period, Glendale conducted a review of the parking standards within
the Downtown Specific Plan. The Downtown Specific Plan standards were modified to allow
reduced parking for residential units because of the high availability of walking and transit
opportunities within the DSP area in 2011. While the DSP standards allowed for reduced
parking, the City’s subdivision ordinance required two parking spaces per residential unit for
new condominiums (home ownership units). In order to encourage creation of new
homeownership opportunities, in July 2013, the City Council adopted an ordinance modifying
subdivision standards to reduce the parking requirements for condominiums in the DSP area.
Policy 3.5
Assist qualifying tenants displaced by conversion of apartments to condominiums to obtain
any assistance for which they may be eligible including first right of refusal to purchase a unit
and mortgage and/or down payment assistance through first time home buyers programs.

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Review
California state law requires tenant assistance for qualifying tenants displaced by conversion
of apartment into condominiums, including first right of refusal to purchase a unit. Due to
budget constraints, the City no longer provides direct assistance for down-payment
assistance for first time home buyers. However, the City does participate with local lender
education programs (Policy 3.1) to encourage first-time homeowners to enter the housing
market. Should funding become available in the future, the City will resume this program.
3.1.4    GOAL 4 - A City with Housing Services that Address Groups with Special
          Housing Needs
Policy 4.1
Encourage both the private and public sectors to produce or assist in the production of
housing for special needs groups such as: the handicapped, the elderly, large families, single-
parent households, and formerly homeless.
Review
During the Plan period, eight new construction or acquisition/rehabilitation affordable rental
projects, and three single family affordable home ownership projects have been completed in
Glendale through public/private partnerships that are providing 376 new affordable housing
units. In addition, there are five new residential construction projects which will provide
another 89 affordable units.
These developments provide a broad range of housing, including: condominium units for sale
to large low or moderate income families needing three or more bedrooms; rental units for
low or moderate income tenants who are extremely low income, or who have large families
and need three bedroom units; affordable rental units limited to seniors only; affordable
rental units that provide a preference for veterans of the US Armed Forces; permanent
housing for the formerly homeless. A facility that will provide emergency shelter and
supportive services to the homeless was constructed during the Plan period. An affordable
housing facility for developmentally disabled individuals was constructed using SB1818
incentives and waivers. See Chapter 5 for a list of affordable housing developments and the
population each development will serve.
In 2006, the City modified its zoning code to provide by-right opportunities for development
of domestic violence shelters and emergency shelters in various zones throughout the City.
Program 5f in the 2006-2014 element noted that the City’s requirement for emergency
shelters to have conditional use permits if located within 300 feet of residential properties be
eliminated in the IND Zone. The City modified its zoning so that emergency shelters are
permitted by right in the IND and MS zones. The City has implemented this housing policy as
demonstrated by the number of projects built or approved and by modification of the zoning
code. The City will maintain this housing policy.
Policy 4.2
Promote the development of very low, low and moderate income housing by allowing

moderate income residents.

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Review
The City adopted Chapter 30.36 of the Glendale Municipal Code to implement changes to
the California Government Code relating to density bonus programs to assist the production
of housing for low and moderate income households. This includes housing for elderly
residents. During zoning code revisions in 2006, the requirement for a conditional use permit
to allow the City to evaluate the compatibility of senior projects with the surrounding
neighborhood was eliminated in all zones where multiple family residential uses are permitted
uses. The Downtown Specific Plan also allows density bonus incentives for affordable
provisions. Glendale also provides for density bonus for lot width, which can be combined
with density bonus for affordability to provide greater options for developers of affordable
housing projects. The City will maintain this housing policy. Density bonus developments
providing 40 affordable units were constructed or entitled during the review period.
Policy 4.3
Continue to provide programs to enable people to find or remain in affordable housing, such
as Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers.
Review
Ongoing programs for affordable housing are in operation. These include the Section 8
Housing Choice Voucher program. However, the short term rental assistance programs
including the Section 8 Moving Assistance Grant, the Dwelling Repair Grant program to assist
Section 8 voucher holders and other supportive service clients to locate and move into a unit,
the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, and the Low Income Family Employment Rental
Assistance Program were terminated in 2011 due to the loss of Redevelopment Set Aside
funds. The Section 8 program has significantly increased the number of households it serves
in Glendale through cooperation with other Housing Authorities to administer their vouchers
in Glendale. The First Time Home Buyer resale down payment assistance program was
terminated in 2011 due to the loss of Redevelopment Set Aside funds, although the City
continues to a direct financial assistance program to developers of new construction
affordable home ownership units. Actual households assisted are found in the review of the
Eight Year Housing Plan. The City will continue to maintain this housing policy.
Policy 4.4
Amend the Zoning Ordinance as appropriate to facilitate the development for special needs
groups and individuals, such as locating housing and populations near appropriate services.
Review
The Glendale Municipal Code was amended in 2006 to allow senior housing by right in all
zones where multiple family residential uses are permitted. Senior housing is also a
permitted use in the SFMU and a conditional use in the IMU-R mixed use zones. Zoning code
amendments in 2006 added Glendale Municipal Code Chapter 30.36 that provides density
bonus incentives in accordance with state law for senior, as well as affordable housing. The
City has implemented this housing policy. However, the City is presently considering
simplifying housing definitions in the Zoning Code, by creating broader housing categories to
accommodate a wider range of housing types and locations. Modifications to housing
definitions will be presented to Planning Commission and City Council concurrent with
consideration of this Housing Element.

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Policy 4.5
Continue to offer housing and supportive services to special needs groups such as the elderly
and homeless to enable independent living.
Review
The City operates a Care Management Services Program for low and moderate income senior
residents. The program provides case management services to assist this special needs
group to maintain an independent living situation. Supportive services for homeless and
formerly homeless persons are provided and coordinated through the Glendale Continuum of
Care, a network of local social service agencies and other providers working together to
eliminate homelessness, as described in Policy 4.9, which follows. There are 60 affordable
housing units in three developments and three group homes that are designed for and
provide some supportive services for developmentally disabled persons.            One of these
apartment buildings was developed during the Eight Year Plan period. The City will continue
to implement this policy.
Policy 4.6
Review the Zoning Ordinance and local Building Code to offer incentives and/or remove
restrictions to encourage the development of residential units that are accessible to
handicapped persons or are adaptable for conversion to residential use by handicapped
persons.
Review
Glendale has modified provisions in the Zoning Code to allow Administrative Exceptions for
certain building improvement that do not meet the Zoning Code in order to allow residents
to enjoy and stay in their homes. Such changes include allowing ramps and guardrails within
required setbacks. In addition, in 2010 the City adopted a Reasonable Accommodation
Ordinance in accordance with state law. The City has granted reasonable accommodation
request as most requests are reasonable and serve existing residents. One request was
partially denied because some of the buildings on the property were constructed illegally and
a portion of the request was not related to accommodating persons with a handicap. The
City will continue to implement this policy.
Policy 4.7
Continue to offer a handicapped grant program to assist with the addition of handicapped
accessibility features to existing dwellings.
Review
State law, Title 24 – State Building Standards Code, California Code of Regulations, also
known as the California Administrative Code, now sets the standard for access by the
handicapped. These closely follow Federal regulations. The City, through adoption of the
Building and Safety Code, enforces the State Building Standards Code. The City may adopt
different standards but they must be "substantially the same requirements as are contained
in the most recent editions" of the uniform industry codes. Any deviations must be based on
findings that "such modifications or changes are reasonably necessary because of local
climatic, geologic or topographical conditions" and be approved by the California Building
Standards Commission (see Section 17922, etc., Health and Safety Code). The City will
remain in compliance with state laws relating to Title 24 and will maintain these actions.

However, the Special Accommodations Grant that provided housing rehabilitation funds and
construction oversight for persons with disabilities has been terminated due to loss of
Redevelopment Set Aside funds.
Policy 4.8
Coordinate with local social service providers to address the needs of the City’s homeless
population, including the development of service-enriched and affordable housing.
Review
This program is ongoing and the results are reported in the review of the Eight Year Housing
Plan. Due to budget and staff cuts, fewer funds and staff time will be provided to this effort
than have been allocated in the past. The City will continue this policy.
Policy 4.9
Permit the development of transitional housing for service-dependent populations in the
City’s residential zones.
Review
Glendale does permit the development of transitional housing for service-dependent
populations in the City’s residential zones. Glendale modified its definitions for one and multi
dwelling units to clarify that on-site supportive service is permitted for residents in order to
allow them to remain in their homes. The City’s definition of residential congregate living,
limited clearly allows up to six persons or one household to occupy single family residential
homes. This definition was modified in response to disability advocates. The residential
congregate living, non-medical and residential congregate living, medical definitions allow for
a variety of residential accommodations and provide for both transitional and supportive
housing opportunities in residential zones. This policy has and will continue to be
implemented.
Policy 4.10
Coordinate with social services and nonprofit organizations to assist homeowners who are at
risk of losing their homes.
Review
The City refers homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes to banking and social
services agencies that provide information to help homeowners maintain their homes. The
City no longer maintains case management or loans due to funding cuts. The City will
continue its efforts to coordinate with banking institutions and social service agencies.
Policy 4.11
Encourage the development of childcare facilities coincident with new housing development,
and consider the use of incentives.
Review
Zoning Code amendments approved in 2006 created Section 30.36.120 which provides
incentives for affordable housing developments that provide childcare facilities either on the
premises of, as part of, or adjacent to the housing development. The City will continue to
implement zoning code incentives for affordable housing developments that provide after
school and related programming for children. The City will maintain this policy.

City of Glendale, California                    HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Policy 4.12
Retain subsidized units which are at risk of conversion to market rate housing.
Review
During development of the previous Housing Element, the financing structure and expiration
dates for 18 development projects and 25 multi-family rental rehabilitation loans were
reviewed to determine the risk of conversion to market rate units. The results of this review
are found in Chapter 4, Section 4.5 Preservation of Assisted Units. However, due to loss of
funding, the City may be unable to retain subsidized units. The City will continue to maintain
this as Policy 4.12 in Chapter 2 and will assess each potential conversion independently.
3.1.5 GOAL 5 - A City with Equal Housing Opportunities for All Persons
Policy 5.1
Promote nondiscrimination of housing by implementing the recommendations of Glendale’s
Fair Housing Analysis of Impediments to Housing Choice Plan and regularly update the Plan.
Review
Glendale Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice (AI) and Fair Housing Plan
document was updated in 2012. Glendale modified zoning definitions to eliminate five of the
impediments identified in this the AI in 2013. The City of Glendale is committed to providing
adequate accessibility to housing opportunities for all of Glendale’s residents. Glendale will
continue to implement the recommendation in the AI and continue to maintain
nondiscriminatory housing policies and practices.
Policy 5.2
Continue to contract with the Housing Rights Center or other fair housing service providers
to facilitate access to services by residents seeking assistance.
Review
The City’s Community Services and Parks Department administers and monitors services
related to Fair Housing in Glendale. The City’s Analysis of Impediments was updated last
year and is regularly studied to assure that housing impediments are being properly
addressed. The City has implemented and will maintain Policy 5.2 to continue to contract
with a fair housing service provider.
Policy 5.3
Continue to provide information to the public about housing rights, responsibilities, and
opportunities including the provisions of the Glendale Just Cause Eviction Ordinance, which
outlines the legal reasons for eviction, required lease terms, and any relocation assistance
that may be due.
Review
See information for Policy 5.1. Based on the number of programs enumerated above, the
City has successfully implemented and will maintain this housing policy.

3.1.6 GOAL 6 - A City with Housing that is Livable and Sustainable
Policy 6.1
Guide and plan for resources to accommodate future housing need to prevent overcrowding
and over-utilization of existing community resources.
Review
The City successfully continued its efforts to coordinate land use and zoning regulations
pertaining to residential development to be consistent with the City’s General Plan, the
blueprint for long-term development of the City. Modification to multiple family densities
and the review of hillside development standards helped to ensure that future population
growth is within the ability of the community to provide services and community resources.
The General Plan is a document that is periodically reviewed for relevance to the community.
This is an on-going policy toward balanced development and will continue to remain a
housing policy.
Policy 6.2
Identify neighborhoods to facilitate community planning that maintain or improve their
character and quality.
Review
The City has sought to improve the quality of life within neighborhoods through
comprehensive neighborhood revitalization programs in specific target areas. Target area
activities for comprehensive revitalization include construction of affordable housing, parks
and school improvements; implementation of extensive residential and commercial code
enforcement programs; and public education efforts with residents concerning neighborhood
standards.      Such projects require significant public involvement in planning and
implementation of these efforts. In Adams Square the City created a mini-park out of a
historic gas station building and revamped the library. These renovations were based on
public outreach and community involvement that aided in determining the scope, design and
location of improvements in these areas.
The City of Glendale completed Phase One of its new neighborhood and community planning
process. It focused on the North Glendale neighborhoods in an effort to achieve the above
objectives. Based on community input, the vision for future development, as well as goals,
policies and implementation measures were created.            Single family and multi-family
neighborhoods in this area are to be maintained and improved. This project culminated in
the adoption of the North Glendale Community Plan and Comprehensive Design Guidelines.
Phase Two, the South Glendale Community Plan, is currently in process which will be followed
by a community plan in West Glendale. The City is also conducting a Tropico Study through a
METRO Grant that is looking at transit-oriented development opportunities in South
Glendale to improve this neighborhood, as well.
The City has successfully implemented this policy and will continue with Policy 6.2 in Chapter
2.

Policy 6.3
Implement the recommendations of the Open Space and Conservation Element and the
Recreation Element of the General Plan to ensure an adequate amount of public open space
and developed parkland for the needs of new and existing residential development.
Review
The City of Glendale enhanced existing policies to provide additional open space and
recreational opportunities for its residents by incorporating the above policies in the
Downtown Specific Plan, North Glendale Community Plan, and Glendale Safe and Healthy
Streets Plan. Additional parkland and facilities were developed.
Downtown Specific Plan
                                             A new planned open space system was adopted for
                                             the Downtown area, which emphasizes physical and
                                             functional linkages between neighborhoods within
                                             and around the Specific Plan area and parks. It
                                             includes a variety of Downtown parks and pocket
                                             parks, an adult recreation center (constructed), and
                                             several formal plazas. Development incentives were
                                             adopted to encourage the creation of courtyards and
                                             outdoor activity areas in conjunction with private
development. These policies are intended to create open spaces within five minute walking
distances in Downtown. In June 2013, the Glendale City Council approved it’s first “parklet”
in Downtown, where four parking spaces will be replaced with a small public space open to
the public. If it is successful, a plan will be developed to create more such spaces. Council
also approved the Glendale "Space 134" project; a concept study for a "freeway cap park"
over the 134 Freeway from Central Avenue to Glendale Avenue. The freeway cap park would
connect the community to the City's civic, cultural, and business core through public open
space and pedestrian and bike friendly trails. As Downtown Glendale moves forward with the
18-hour workday, by promoting the opening of restaurants, bars and nightlife opportunities
in the City’s new Arts & Entertainment District, Space 134 will become a key component in
furthering that vision. In June 2013 the Westside Urban Forum recognized Glendale’s
proposed Space 134 project with a design award that recognizes projects that demonstrate
excellence in addressing the issues of planning for and building a livable future.
North Glendale Community Plan
                                       The North Glendale Community Plan is based on the
                                       vision which includes protecting open space, advocating
                                       sustainable and responsible development and a variety of
                                       recreational      opportunities   while     recognizing     the
                                       connection with the mountains.
                                                                 Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies

Glendale Safe and Healthy Streets Plan
                The goal of the Glendale Safe and Healthy Streets Plan is to make Glendale a
                better, safer place to walk or ride a bike, which includes providing more
                connection to parks.
Implementing the above policies, the following parks and facilities were constructed or
improved:
Adult Recreation Center
                              As part of the 3.16 acre Central Park Complex, a new Adult
                              Recreation Center (ARC) was completed in 2010 to meet the
                              needs of the community’s expanding senior citizen population. It
                              includes a 19,100 square foot Adult Recreation building and
                              provides assembly areas, game rooms, a gymnasium, a full
                              commercial kitchen and a dining hall for patrons.
Trails
                                             The Citywide Trails Master Plan was completed in
                                             2008. It established guidelines for multi-purpose
                                             (pedestrian, bicycle, equestrian) trail development,
                                             trailhead design, public access to open space and
                                             park areas, signage, and volunteer programs. New
                                             trail maps with proposed improvements for the San
                                             Rafael Hills, San Gabriel Mountains (Deukmejian
                                             Wilderness Park) and the Verdugo Mountains were
                                             approved. The San Rafael Hills “Mountain Do” and
                                             “Catalina Verdugo” trails opened to the public on
June 1, 2013. The Mountain Do Trail is a 1,825 foot ADA accessible trail with two rest areas
where walkers and the mobility impaired can move off the trail into landscaped areas
containing appropriate native plantings, benches, picnic tables, ADA accessible outdoor
fitness equipment, and interpretive signage. The Catalina Verdugo Trail is an 8,929 foot
multi-use trail is specifically designed to accommodate people of moderate physical fitness
and skills.
Deukmejian Wilderness Park and Le Mesnager Barn Renovation
                                  Three phases of this project were completed, including
                                  construction of a paved entry road, Park Center area with
                                  parking, restrooms, picnic facilities, an amphitheater for
                                  outdoor classes, walking paths, a small vineyard, extensive
                                  low-water landscaping, and trails. The current Phase IV project
                                  includes a programming study to determine what uses will be
                                  made of the historic barn and barn renovation (including
                                  seismic upgrades). Additional funding must be identified to
complete the renovation.

Glendale Narrow Riverwalk
                             Phase 1 of the Glendale Narrows Riverwalk was completed in
                             December 2012. It provides ½ mile of landscaped recreational trail
                             along the north bank of the Los Angeles River across from Griffith
                             Park. It includes a small entry park for hikers and bicyclists, a
                             separate staging area for equestrians, another small park area for
                             walking and picnicking, enhancement of wildlife habitat in the river
                             channel, and educational and interpretive exhibits.
Glendale Heritage Gardens
                   Completed in 2010, this project included the preservation and reuse of the
                   existing 1913 historically significant bungalow at 141 S. Cedar Street and a
                   mini-park (Cedar Mini Park). Cedar Mini Park is a half-acre site that serves a
                   community within a quarter mile radius of the park, at an estimated
                   population of 5,273 people. The park is situated in a high density area that
                   has a large number of multiple family developments. It was designed as a
                   facility to supply area residents with an inviting garden like setting
                   compatible to the Arts and Crafts period, with walking path, spaces for
                   relaxation, socialization, and picnics, and recreational activities that cater to
                   the community’s youth.
Glendale Civic Auditorium Soccer Rink
June 2013 noted the grand opening for the indoor soccer rink at the Glendale Civic
Auditorium (upper level). The project was a cooperative effort between the City and
community in order to meet the needs of the underutilized Civic Auditorium and soccer
players. Glendale has three soccer fields that accommodate more than 4,000 youth soccer
players. The Indoor Soccer rink is available for field time and reservations Monday through
Thursday and Friday-Sunday based on availability.
The City has been active in obtaining public open space, in developing parklands, and in
seeking funding for parkland maintenance. However, the City still remains deficient in
developed parkland. The City will continue to maintain this policy.
Policy 6.4
Review and amend as appropriate existing residential zoning standards to require adequate
on-site open space and recreational amenities in new developments.
Review
Multiple family zoning standards adopted by Council in 1990, which required an increased
amount of private open space and recreational amenities in multiple family residential
projects, are still in effect. In addition, the Downtown Specific Plan was adopted in 2006,
which contains open space policies. An example of these policies can be found in Sections
5.1.4 and 5.1.5, which are parkland acquisition and smaller open space policies that
encourage the establishment of a comprehensive program to obtain new open space
locations in downtown Glendale. These policies encourages creation of one large open space
of at least one acre and the establishment of public plazas, courtyards, fountains, pocket

parks and other smaller spaces to enhance the larger open spaces. Figure 5-A, of the
Downtown Specific Plan shows how the network of open space opportunities can be
integrated into the existing fabric of downtown Glendale. Each residential project is required
to provide a minimum 140 square feet of outdoor open space per unit. In 2007, the City
adopted a development fee to address impacts to parks and recreation programs from new
development to offset the costs of additional residents upon parks. The City adopted
Comprehensive Design Guidelines in November 2011. They include multi-family residential
and mixed-use design guidelines, which address yards and usable open space in new multiple
family and mixed-use projects. The City will maintain this housing policy as Policy 6.4 in
Chapter 2 and continue implementing the appropriate multi-family and mixed-use design
guidelines.
Policy 6.5
Require residential projects to preserve major ridgelines, secondary ridgelines, blue line
streams, indigenous trees and other significant environmental features.
Review
Over the past few decades, the City purchased hillside open space in order to preserve major
and secondary ridgelines and blue line streams. These purchases prevented the spread of
urban sprawl into these areas, and encouraged the development of infill lots within the City
core. Due to funding constraints, the City no longer has a budget set aside to purchase tax-
defaulted vacant hillside lands for open space purposes. However, the City does continue to
review proposed open space donations from the public and generally accepts such land
donations when adjacent to other City open space. Additionally, the Santa Monica
Mountains Conservancy has purchased conservation easements for some open space
properties in Glendale, whereby the property owner receives payment and tax breaks in
exchange for leaving the property as undisturbed open space with native vegetation.
In 1993, the City adopted a major hillside development program which resulted in the
expansion of the preservation of ridgelines. The preservation of secondary ridge-lines,
blueline streams and a greater amount of open space were incorporated into the City’s
regulatory process. Between 2001 and 2007, the City continued to study and make changes
to hillside standards periodically. The implementation of this housing policy remains an
ongoing effort in the Planning Department work program. This housing policy will continue
as Policy 6.5 in Chapter 2.
Policy 6.6:
Practice neighborhood-based planning through meaningful public participation.
Review
The Glendale City Council approved a community plan program for the development of four
community plans, based on geographic neighborhood areas. Phase 1, the North Glendale
Community Plan, was completed in 2009. It consists of seven geographic areas and includes
a “Vision,” Public Improvements, and Design Guidelines to guide future development. This
community plan was based on community input and utilized a task force made-up of
community members. The South Glendale Community Plan (Phase 2) is in process.

Policy 6.7
Continue implementing the Glendale Water and Power’s (GWP) energy and water savings
programs for residents, which encourage conservation of nonrenewable resources in concert
with the use of alternative energy sources and reduced housing costs.
Review
The City of Glendale has undertaken one of the most aggressive energy and water
conservation programs in the country through the “Smart Grid” program. With Smart Grid,
every single-family housing unit in the City received new electric and water meters so that
they may monitor real-time energy and water savings. In addition, the City maintains public
benefits programs with aid residents of all incomes, including low income and special needs
residents. In 2009, Glendale Water and Power adopted a policy giving priority service for
new development for low-income households, as required by the previous housing element.
Policy 6.8
Continue providing brochures and technical assistance that promotes the use of energy
conservation features in new and existing dwellings.
Review
Glendale Water and Power and Community Development continue to provide brochures and
technical assistance to promote energy conservation features in new and existing
development. In March 2011, the City of Glendale adopted Green Building Standards that
exceed the Cal Green minimum requirements in order to promote greater energy
conservation in new dwellings. This information is provided to the public through the City’s
Community       Development        Department       website     at    the     following      link:
http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/planning/building_and_safety_division.asp.
Many of these standards such as cool roofs, low flow toilets, etc. can be installed in older
homes,     as     well.       Glendale     Water     and    Power     maintains    a     website
http://www.glendalewaterandpower.com which promotes every efficiency programs which
operate through this utility. In addition to these City websites, the City uses other electronic
media such as the City Connection electronic newsletter to publicize various City efforts,
including conservation.. The City will continue to implement this policy.
Policy 6.9
Continue promoting energy and resources efficiency by implementing the City’s residential
recycling, bulk item collection, household hazardous waste, backyard composting, chopper
rebates, Christmas Tree Recycling, electronics recycling, recycling drop-off and worm
composting services/programs.
Review
Glendale Water and Power has extensive public benefit programs which promote energy and
resource efficiency. In 2010 the City began a citywide Smart Grid program to promote energy
efficiency and water conservation. Grant funding for this Smart Grid program included the
creation of the City’s Greener Glendale Plan, a sustainability plan with programs identified to
reduce greenhouse gases, recycling, composting, waste reduction strategies and other
actions consistent with sustainability. The Greener Glendale Plan included participation from
all City departments and many private companies and individuals. The City will continue to
implement this policy.

Policy 6.10
Encourage the use of sustainable building practices in residential developments.
Review
The City complies with Title 24 Building Code requirements for energy efficiency. Additional
programs are offered by Glendale Water and Power to promote energy efficiency and
conservation including Smart Home Energy & Water Saving Rebates, the Smart Home Solar
Solutions Program, Peak Hogs incentives for apartment owners to replace old, inefficient air
conditioning units and reduce tenant electric bills and smart home refrigerator recycling. The
City has also has a tree shade program offering free shade trees to aid in natural cooling of
residential units.
For low income residents, the city offers the Cool Care program which is a refrigerator
replacement and recycling program. The program helps reduce low income energy bills by
replacing old energy inefficient refrigerators with brand new money saving Energy Star
models. Low income seniors and disabled persons are eligible for the Senior Care Program
which provides monthly electric bill discounts to qualifying households.
The City adopted Comprehensive Design Guidelines in November 2011. They include multi-
family residential and mixed-use design guidelines, which address site planning in new
multiple family and mixed-use projects.           Site planning involves a careful analysis of the
opportunities and constraints of the site, including building location, solar design, yards and
usable open space, garage location and driveways, landscape design (including hardscape),
walls and fences, and retaining walls.
Policy 6.11
Provide opportunities for residential locations and design that encourage transit, pedestrian,
bicycle, and other mobility options.
Review
The Downtown Specific Plan was approved by City Council in November 2006. It is a mixed-
use, urban design plan that establishes the desired physical vision for Downtown Glendale. It
sets the physical standards and guidelines as well as land use regulations, and directs policies
for economic development; streetscape improvements; transportation development; parking;
pedestrian amenities; open space and land use; preservation of cultural resources; and public
art. The Downtown Mobility Study was adopted by City Council on March 6, 2007 and
complements the Downtown Specific Plan. It focuses on establishing transit and pedestrian-
friendly policies within the Downtown Specific Plan area and was developed to accommodate
expected growth in downtown Glendale, achieving Glendale's vision of a vibrant multi-use
downtown, without significantly increasing auto congestion or impacting quality of life. It
gathers under a single umbrella the full range of best-practices to reduce auto congestion
and promote multi-modal transportation. Each of these - free bus shuttle, parking benefit
districts, in-lieu fees, and transit-priority streets, among others - is tailored to the physical
vision articulated by the Downtown Specific Plan.
The Safe and Healthy Streets Plan (a collaboration of the Los Angeles County Bicycle
Coalition and the City of Glendale), was adopted in 2011. The goal of the Glendale Safe and
Healthy Streets Plan is to make Glendale a better, safer place to walk or ride a bike. It
includes providing more connections to parks.

City of Glendale, California                 HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
3.2 REVIEW OF THE EIGHT YEAR HOUSING PLAN
3.2.1 Implementing Programs
The Housing Element describes the housing needs of the City’s current and projected
population, as well as the specific needs resulting from the deterioration of older units, lack
of affordable housing for lower income groups, and special needs for certain segments of the
City’s population. The goals and policies contained in the Housing Element address the
City’s identified housing needs. These goals and policies are implemented through a series
of housing programs that are funded and administered through a variety of local, regional,
State and Federal agencies. The following seven comprehensive program strategies were
applied during the 2006-2014 Housing Element Period to address the City’s housing needs:
         1) Preservation and Enhancement of Existing Housing Stock
         2) Production of Affordable Housing
         3) Rental Assistance
         4) Increased Ownership Opportunities
         5) Housing Services
         6) Fair Housing.
         7) Sustainability
A series of specific programs were identified to implement each program strategy. This
section provides a restatement of each housing program and program goals.
Accomplishments are then provided. The Eight Year Action Plan table at the end of this
section (Exhibit 2-1) summarizes the objectives of each program, the eight year projections
and accomplishments, funding source(s), responsible agency, and implementation time frame.
Unless otherwise stated, these programs are on-going and have been implemented in
accordance with the 2006 – 2014 Plan. For purposes of “counting” accomplishments, the City
of Glendale evaluates affordable housing accomplishments on a fiscal year basis. This review
covers the years FY 2005/06 through FY 2012/13.
In June 2011 two laws related to Redevelopment were signed into law by the Governor. One
law dissolved Redevelopment Agencies, while the second provided for a “voluntary
alternative redevelopment program” (VARP) that exempted redevelopment agencies from
dissolution if they agreed to certain annual payments.     Glendale agreed to enter into the
VARP program.         However, a legal challenge filed by the California Redevelopment
Association and League of Cities challenged the dissolution of Redevelopment as
unconstitutional and worked its way through the State Court system for six months after the
laws were passed. On December 29, 2011 the California Supreme Court upheld the law
dissolving Redevelopment Agencies and struck down the VARP program.               During this 6
month period expenditures of Redevelopment Set Aside funds and production and
conservation of affordable housing slowed significantly and uncertainty in the affordable
housing market was a major limitation as only previously executed enforceable contracts for
activities funded with Redevelopment Set Aside were permitted to continue until the
Redevelopment issue was resolved.           Even these agreements were stalled due to
complications with title issues and commitments of leveraged and private funding in the
                                                           Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies

City of Glendale, California                   HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
uncertain environment. Following the California Supreme Court decision Redevelopment
Agencies were finally dissolved as of February 1, 2012. Only “wind-up” activities of
previously committed and contracted projects were permitted to be completed through the
Redevelopment Successor Agency and the Housing Successor Agency.                     All eligible
Redevelopment Set Aside Housing Assets were transferred to the Housing Successor
Agency, the Housing Authority of the City of Glendale, on February 1, 2012 with final
approval of the specific list of assets transferred provided by the California Department of
Finance in February 2013.
Redevelopment Set Aside funds, second only to Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, were
the largest source of community development and housing funds available to Glendale.
Federal grants to the City for community development and affordable housing were cut as
well during this time period. In the last four years, since the 2010/11 grant year federal
community development grants to the City were cut. The Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) grant for community development programs and services was cut by 49%. The
Emergency Solutions Grant for homeless programs was cut by 45% and the Supportive
Housing Program was cut by 5 – 8%. The HOME program for affordable housing was cut by
50%.
The cumulative loss of Redevelopment and federal community development and affordable
housing funds since 2011, midway through the Eight Year Plan Period, has severely impacted
the ability of the City to meet the affordable housing production goals set out in the 2006-
2014 Housing Element. Several programs have been terminated due to reduced direct
assistance dollars for services and reduced administrative funding (resulting in substantial
staff cuts). These program changes are noted below. Nevertheless, the City was able to
meet many of the goals set out to improve housing conditions and quality of life in the City
also as noted below.
3.2.2   PROGRAM STRATEGY # 1 - PRESERVATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF EXISTING
                                       HOUSING STOCK
1a. Rehabilitation Loan and Grant Programs
Single Family Rehabilitation Loan and grant Program
Program Goals
The City intends to provide 320 loans/grants over the 2006/7-2013/14 eight year period.
This program was terminated due to the loss of Redevelopment Set Aside funds.
Review
In years 1 - 7 the City provided loans to rehabilitate 178 single family homes. The City did
not meet its target for rehabilitating single family units. The single family rehabilitation loan
program was terminated on February 1, 2012.
Multifamily Rental Acquisition and/or Rehabilitation Loan Program
Program Goals
Provide multifamily rental acquisition and/or rehabilitation loans assisting approximately 40
rental housing units over the 2006-2014 period.
                                                             Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Review
For the eight year review period the City provided Multi Family Rehabilitation loans to
rehabilitate 47 units. The City exceeded its goal and will continue to operate this program on
a limited basis.
1b. Handicapped Grant Program
Program Goals
Provide approximately 16 handicapped grants over the 2006-2014 period. The program was
renamed to be the “Special Accommodation Loan Program.”
This program was terminated due to the loss of Redevelopment Set Aside funds.
Review
The program goal was met. In years 1 - 7 before the program was terminated the City
provided 17 Special Accommodation grants to rehabilitate units of persons with disabilities.
1c. Glendale Water & Power (GWP) Public Benefit Programs
Program Goals
GWP has adopted an energy efficiency goal of 1.0% of annual retail sales through 2017 in
accordance with California Energy Commission requirements. In FY 2005-2006 GWP energy
savings reached 0.77% of our five year average load, ranking us among the best in the
country, and in line with the targets set for California. The City anticipates continuing the
Smart Home Energy and Water Savings Surveys, Smart Home Solar Solutions, Peak Hogs and
Tree Power programs, while adding new programs to help meet the 1.0% annual goals. The
City intends to maintain the capability to provide Smart Home Energy Audits and Smart
Home Energy and Water Savings Surveys/Rebates at current levels which would be 1,300
surveys and 5,200 rebates per year through 2014. However, as participation in GWP
programs are demand driven, no numerical targets are identified. As in the past, when
opportunities arise for Glendale to participate in energy and water efficiency programs, such
programs will be explored.
Program Description
State law mandates that each local publicly owned electric utility shall establish a non-by
passable, usage based charge on local distribution service of at least 2.85% of revenues to
fund investments in one or more of the following areas:
       Cost-effective services to promote energy-efficiency and energy conservation
       New investment in renewable energy resource and technologies
       Research, development and demonstration programs
       Services provided for low-income electricity customers, including but not limited to,
        targeted energy efficiency service and rate discounts.
Glendale promotes 12 programs for residential efficiency and income-qualified electric
discounts. Residential energy savings programs include: Smart Home Energy and Water
Savings Survey; Smart Home Energy and Water Savings Rebates; Smart Home Solar Solutions
Program; Tree Power which provides free shade trees for natural home cooling; Peak Hogs
which provides incentives to apartment owners to replace old refrigerators with energy

efficient models; and, Smart Home refrigerator recycling. Income qualified programs include:
Senior Care program available to those 62 and over; Cool Care to receive an Energy Star
refrigerator; Guardian for medical equipment and space conditioning needs; and, Helping
Hand to serve those with a temporary financial emergency.
Glendale Water and Power promotes its residential programs through its customer service
center. Since everyone signing up for Glendale utility service must speak to customer service
representatives to sign up or modify service, customers of every income level can learn about
residential programs. Additionally, the City of Glendale website, brochures available at
various public venues including the City Hall campus and libraries, city publications such as
the City Views newsletter which is distributed to each household in the City four times a year,
and utility billing mailing inserts also promote available residential utility programs.
Periodically, residential programs are promoted through advertisements in the Glendale
News-Press. The City of Glendale also produces public service announcements that run on
the City’s public access cable TV channel which promote the availability of public assistance
programs. Funding for public outreach is provided through energy efficiency programs as
required by state mandate.
1d. Code Enforcement
Program Goals
The program’s goals are to:
    1) Complete compliance on 1,400 residential properties.
    2) Educate property owners and renters on their responsibility for basic unit maintenance
        and cleanliness;
    3) Bring substandard housing/property into compliance with City Code;
    4) Eliminate blight in Glendale’s neighborhoods; and
    5) Ensure a high quality of life with regard to housing for Glendale residents.
The objective of the City of Glendale’s Code Enforcement program is to maintain compliance
with City codes for the City’s housing stock. This may mean bringing substandard properties
back into compliance through a code enforcement process. Having housing stock compliant
with City codes eliminates blight and preserves the high quality of life in Glendale’s
neighborhoods. To meet this objective, potential code violations are identified on a
proactive and reactive basis. These violations are confirmed by trained, certified inspectors
via on-site inspections. After these inspections are performed, a variety of enforcement tools
are used to achieve compliance. These tools consist of verbal warnings, letter notifications,
citations, office conferences, criminal prosecution, and abatement.
Code Enforcement and public outreach staff produce educational materials and programs to
provide information on property owner responsibilities for unit maintenance and cleanliness,
property owner responsibilities, and technical resources for specific property maintenance
issues. These programs and classes support the code enforcement officer’s efforts.
Review
This program continues to be implemented. Even though staff was reduced during the
recession, the Neighborhood Services Program remains a key division in the City.
Neighborhood Services has completed compliance on over 1,400 residential properties and
                                                             Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies
                                                                                    Page 29 of 44

City of Glendale, California                 HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
actively responds to code enforcement complaint. Programs such as graffiti removal and
neighborhood clean-ups such as the Foothill Boulevard Clean-Up are successful in improving
neighborhoods and quality of life. Community Gardens are a recent addition to their
responsibilities and have been well-received by the public and have made desireable areas
out of abandoned lots that previously were a source of blight. Additionally, Neighborhood
Services regularly conducts public outreach in coordination with other divisions of the
Community Development Department.
1e. Neighborhood “Target Areas”
Program Goals
The goal of neighborhood “target areas” is to identify and initiate planning activities for one
new target neighborhood in southern or western Glendale and complete the ongoing Adams
Square Revitalization Project and the East Garfield Neighborhood Improvement Project.
Review
The program goals for completion of affordable housing and public works improvements
component of the one existing East Garfield target area plan were completed. While State
Park grant funds were received for the parks component (E Maryland Mini Park) of the target
area plan, due to staff cutbacks, implementation has been delayed. Also due to funding
cutbacks the goal of adoption of an additional target area has been delayed. As shown in
Chapter 2 , the emphasis of this policy has shifted to improvements to transit, transportation,
and transit related development of the Tropico neighborhood in Southern Glendale.
1f. Conservation of Existing and Future Affordable Units
Program Goals
The goal of this program is to conserve the long-term affordability of the existing and future
units in Glendale. This will be accomplished by the following actions: 1) to monitor the
expiration dates of affordability restrictions, meet with property managers and property
owners 18 to 24 months prior to expiration to determine feasibility of extension of
affordability and to minimize the impact on tenants of any conversion to market rate rents; 2)
to offer public subsidy and assist in pursuing other state and federal funding to prevent
conversion of existing affordable units to market rate; 3) to file affordable housing
covenants/deed restrictions on future publicly assisted housing projects for a minimum 45
year affordability period for ownership units and 55 year affordability period for rental units;
and 4) to maintain fee title ownership of the land with a long term ground lease provided to
the developer for a minimum 56 year affordability period.
Review
The goals of this program were met. Annual monitoring of affordable housing units was
completed each year during the eight year review period. This included a review of the
affordable housing database to determine if units were at risk of losing long term or short
term affordability in the next 18 to 24 months.
Property owners and residents of Multi-family rental units that were at risk of losing short
term affordability covenants were notified in advance of this risk and provided referrals for
other affordable units if requested.

Financial restructuring and rehabilitation of two projects with upcoming expiration of
affordable housing covenants, Casa de la Paloma and Palmer House senior apartments, were
completed and affordable housing covenants were extended another 55 years. More
information on at risk units is provided in Chapter 4 Preservation of at Risk Units.
Long term affordable housing covenants were filed on all new construction and
acquisition/rehab affordable housing (56+ years for rental and 45 for ownership) and density
bonus (30 year) projects completed.
1g. Multi-family Design Guidelines
Program Goals
Create multi-family design guidelines for the development of multi-family housing.          Begin
public participation by 2009. Adoption by December 2010.
Review
The program goal was met. In November 2011, the City adopted Comprehensive Design
Guidelines which provide design direction for a variety of residential uses throughout the City
of Glendale. The Comprehensive Design Guidelines include direction for incorporating high
quality materials, proper site design, scale, massing, landscaping and other standards.
3.2.3 PROGRAM STRATEGY #2 - PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
2a. Density Bonus Program
Program Goals
The City will utilize density bonus incentives to encourage the development of affordable
family housing as well as senior housing.
       Maintain outreach materials highlighting the incentive/concessions offered under the
        Density Bonus. Density bonus brochure available on-line.
       Advertise density bonus opportunities on the Community Development Department’s
        webpage
       Continue to periodically evaluate the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance for compliance
        with State law.
Glendale’s goal is one density bonus project per year (without other public funding
assistance), with a minimum of 2 units affordable to lower income households. This would
provide for a total of 16 low income units during the 2006-2014 planning period. However,
this goal is dependent upon applications for this program.
Review
The City met the program goals in the following manner:
       Over ten new residential affordable housing projects, private as well as publicly-
        sponsored, have been approved with affordable units as a result of the Density Bonus
        Ordinance which was adopted in 2006.
       Creation of outreach materials highlighting the incentive/concessions offered under
        the Density Bonus by July 2009. Have density bonus brochure available on-line and in
        City offices (Permit Services, Planning, Community Development and Housing).

City of Glendale, California                 HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
     Advertised density bonus opportunities on the Planning Department’s webpage
     Advertised in “City Views” (distributed to 77,000 households)
     Promoted in Public Service Announcement on GTV6
     Conducted a community workshop with developers and property owners to explain
      the density bonus process, as well as obtain feedback on the program effectiveness
      and potential improvements.
     Periodically evaluated the City’s Density Bonus Ordinance for compliance with State
      law.
     The Density Bonus incentives as applied by the City were been designed to make
      affordable housing (both privately and publicly sponsored) projects easier to develop.
      The Density Bonus Law mandates density bonuses and other regulatory incentives or
      concessions for projects that provide certain levels of affordable housing or senior
      citizen housing. Developers are entitled to incentives, based on the number of
      affordable units they provide unless the City proves the incentives are not necessary
      to make the project feasible. Density bonus laws also provide favorable parking
      incentives for affordable housing developers.
     Additionally, Glendale continues to offer a density bonus incentive for lot
      consolidation projects where lot widths are 90 feet or greater. The density bonus
      incentive for lot consolidation is considered “by right” density and serves as the base
      density for the Density Bonus Program incentive program for affordable housing. The
      amount of Density Bonus for affordable housing is based on the amount by which the
      percentage of affordable units exceeds the percentage established by housing type
      up to a 35% density bonus (See Table 30.36 of the Glendale Municipal Code). For
      example, a 20,000 square foot lot in the R-1250 Zone with at least 90 feet of lot width
      would be eligible for 20 units or a “by right” density of 1 unit per 1,000 square feet of
      lot area, rather than the 16 units or 1 unit per 1,250 square feet per lot area for
      similarly zoned lots with less width. If each of these projects proposed to provide
      10% of the units as affordable to lower income households, then each would be
      eligible for a 20% density bonus. Therefore, the project with the lot density bonus
      would be eligible for a total of 24 units, with 10% or 2 units affordable to low income
      residents. The project without the lot density bonus would be eligible for a total of
      19 units, with 10% or 2 units affordable to low income residents. Appendix D shows
      lots in the R-1250 and R-1650 zones which may be suitable for lot consolidation
      density bonus.
     Developers granted a density bonus have entered into an Affordable Housing
      Agreement with the City to ensure the continued affordability of the units and
      Affordable Housing Covenants have been recorded that run with the land during the
      30 year affordability term. Eleve at 200 W. Broadway is a market rate residential
      development with density bonus and entitlements is in lease up and will provide 14
      Very Low income units. 313 W. Camden is a market rate residential development
      with density bonus and entitlements is entering the plan check process and will
      provide 4 Very Low income units. Camden Triangle at 3900 San Fernando Road is a
      market rate residential development with density bonus is now under construction
      and will provide 22 Very Low income units.

2b. Direct City Financial Assistance
Program Goals
The eight-year goal for this program is a total of 451 new construction units completed with
approximately 75% being rental units. This housing production was broken out by the five
year planning period 2006-2011 and the remainder of the planning period from 2012-2014.
       The 2006-2011 period projection is 305 units as follows: 19 extremely low income
        units (0 – 30% AMI), 180 very low income units (31 – 50% AMI), 51 low income units
        (51 – 80% AMI), 38 moderate income units (81 – 120% AMI), and 17 below market rate
        workforce income level units (121 – 165% AMI). Seven projects currently in the
        development pipeline will be completed during this time period.
       The 2012 – 2014 period projection is 146 units: Only one project is currently in the
        development pipeline that will be completed during this time period. Based upon this
        one project it is expected that 7 will be extremely low income units, 42 will be very
        low income units, 22 will be low income units and the remainder is unknown at this
        time.
Review
The program goal was not met as 376 affordable rental units were completed with an
investment of $55 million dollars of direct financial assistance (with commitments of $9.3
million dollars made for future additional 64 units to be completed after the eight year review
period). This level of development missed the goal by 75 units. A total of 277 of the 376
units were rental units (74%) which missed the goal for rental units by 1%. Completion and
commitment of funding was significantly delayed and reduced by the dissolution of
Redevelopment and reduction in federal HOME funds.
The level of affordability of the completed units is as follows: 26 Extremely Low Income; 221
Very Low Income; 72 Low Income; and 57 Moderate Income.
2c. Inclusionary Zoning
Program Goals
Use inclusionary zoning to assist in meeting requirements for affordable housing production
in the SFRCRPA. Inclusionary units produced or in-lieu fee collections will depend upon
actual housing production in the redevelopment project area. The State requirement is that
15% of the units developed or substantially rehabilitated in a project area by public or private
entities other than the Housing Authority must be affordable to low-and moderate-income
persons and households. Of those units, 40% must be affordable to very low-income
households. (The Housing Authority has a policy of not developing housing on its own.)
As described in Chapter 2, due to the California Superior Court decision, which was upheld
by the California Court of Appeals, Palmer vs. City of Los Angeles, 175 CAL App. 4th 1396
(2009) it was determined that inclusionary zoning for rental units (even within Redevelopment
Project areas) was not enforceable without further action by the State legislature. Also, the
status of the inclusionary requirement in Redevelopment Project Areas specifically remains a
question today, based upon the dissolution of Redevelopment by the State. No new
inclusionary housing has been completed by private developers in Glendale since the Court
of Appeals ruling.

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Review
The program goal (as complicated by the dissolution of Redevelopment and the Palmer case
decision) was been met. Each housing development in the SFRCRPA provided 15% of the
units as affordable units. Of note, however, is the fact that all residential development in the
SFRCRPA during the review period was 100% affordable housing that received direct
financial assistance from the City.
2d. Community Housing Development Organizations and other Nonprofit Housing
Organizations
Program Goals
Continue to coordinate with local nonprofit organizations and encourage the formation of
housing development corporations by interested persons in the community to facilitate the
development and improvement of low cost housing in Glendale. The City is especially
interested in the formation of CHDOs focused on the City of Glendale.
Review
The program goal was met. During eight year review period the City partnered with several
nonprofit groups including San Gabriel Valley Habitat for Humanity, Salvation Army, Glendale
Housing Corporation, Ascencia, Heritage Housing Partners, and the YMCA of Glendale.
Continued outreach to other nonprofit developers for future projects is ongoing. However,
no new CHDO’s have been developed that focus on the City. West Hollywood Housing
Development Corporation and Glendale Housing Corporation are CHDO’s that continue to
operate affordable housing developments in the City. This will continue to be a need that will
be addressed in the 2014-2021 Housing Element.
2e. Residential Mixed Use
Program Goals
Encourage the integration of residential, commercial and retail uses in projects in the
downtown as well as provide opportunities for mixed use in industrial areas. Since the
adoption of these programs a number of mixed use projects are under construction, including
the Americana at Brand (Town Center Specific Plan) with 338 residential units. Additional
mixed use projects have received entitlements, but with changes in the market, it is not clear
whether these projects will be constructed. At this time, the large mixed use projects under
construction are residential-retail. While the interest in mixed use is positive, the number of
mixed use projects to be accomplished is dependent upon developer interest. No specific
numerical unit goal is estimated.
Review
The goal was met. The City encouraged mixed use development in downtown and in the San
Fernando Road Redevelopment Project Area. The City extended all valid, active development
entitlements for an additional two years, extending approvals of many large scale mixed use
developments. Building permits were issued for the ICIS mixed use project at 524-550 W
Colorado (186units and 8,300sf commercial). Legendary Tower at 300 N Central (80 units,
including 8 live-work) was approved.

3.2.4 PROGRAM STRATEGY #3 - RENTAL ASSISTANCE
3a. Section 8 Rental Housing Choice Voucher Payments
Program Goals
Continue to provide Section 8 vouchers to approximately 1,600 Glendale and 1,300 portable
vouchers, which Glendale administers on behalf of other housing agencies, to very low
income households. The goals of the program give high priority to special needs populations
including: Victims of retaliation, homeless persons, and Veterans. The next largest special
needs groups served by Section 8 include those with multiple preferences such as: extremely
low income, disabled, and a single person over 62. As a result of the preferences described
above, those elderly, single, disabled persons of extremely low income would receive a
higher preference than other households that may be on the Section 8 waiting list.
Review
The goal has been met. During the eight year review period, Section 8 Housing Choice
Vouchers have been offered each year in the approximate amounts described in the goal.
Gradually the number of Glendale vouchers has reduced slightly and the number of portable
vouchers has increased slightly due to the nature of the federal funding requirements. The
current vouchers provided are 1,553 Glendale and 1,493 portable vouchers, which Glendale
administers on behalf of other housing agencies, to very low income households.
The current income breakdown of recipients is:
       91% Extremely Low Income (from 0 – 30% of AMI),
       8% Very Low Income (from 31% to 50% of AMI), and
       1% Low Income (from 51% to 80% of AMI).
The elderly are served disproportionately by the program. The age breakdown is as follows:
     36% Non Elderly Household Members, and
     64% Elderly Household Members.
3b. Short Term Special Needs Rental Subsidy
Section 8 Dwelling Repair, Moving Assistance Grants, Low Income Family Employment and
Rental Assistance Program (LIFERAP) and Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP)
Section 8 Dwelling Repair and Moving Assistance Grants assisted households relying on
Section 8 rental assistance to locate appropriate units at an affordable price. As the rental
market became more expensive and Section 8 rental assistance remained stable, it became
increasingly difficult to find safe, sanitary and secure housing for an affordable price. These
two programs provided assistance to these renters and incentives to property owners to
participate in the program. Households assisted by these two programs were typically
extremely low-income (less than or equal to 30% of area median income) senior citizens.
LIFERAP and ERAP were two rental assistance programs designed to assist working families
and to prevent homelessness. These programs were intended to increase family self-
sufficiency and reduce the need for future public assistance.
All of these programs were terminated due to the loss of Redevelopment Set Aside funds.

City of Glendale, California                HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Program Goals
Provide five Section 8 Dwelling Repair Grants, five Moving Assistance Grants, five temporary
Emergency Rental Assistance Grants with case management, and 100 LIFERAP Grants with
case management to qualifying households annually during the eight year housing plan
period (for a total of 150 grants).
Review
These program goals were met. In years 1 – 7 before the program was terminated there
were 245 grants that assisted households with special rental assistance during the eight year
review period.
3.2.5 PROGRAM STRATEGY #4 - INCREASED HOME OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES
4a. First Time Home Buyer (FTHB) Mortgage Assistance Program
For the resale home purchase program, the first deed of trust was to be provided by a
designated participating lender. The City required that the home buyer provide a down
payment and qualify for a first mortgage loan from a conventional lender.
For new home ownership construction units, the City’s provided direct financial assistance to
the developer and that assistance converted to a second trust deed securing the City’s
investment in the home. Redevelopment Set-Aside funds, BEGIN, CalHOME, CalHFA,
federal HOME and ADDI funds were used for these development-related FTHB loans as
described in Program Strategy #2 above.
The resale home purchase down payment assistance program was terminated due to the loss
of Redevelopment Set Aside funds.
Program Goals
The program goal was unknown at the time the 2006-2014 Plan was developed due to
housing market conditions at the time. The program goal for construction of new affordable
homeownership units with mortgage assistance is found in Program Strategy #2 above.
Review
This program proved to not be feasible. The resale home purchase downpayment assistance
program proved to have limited feasibility in the 2006-2014 housing market, especially
following the 2007 housing market crash and resulting home purchase credit crunch. In years
2006 – 2012, before the program was terminated, no (0) households were assisted through
this program.
4b. Home Ownership Education, and Marketing
Program Goals
Continue to provide a home ownership education and marketing program available to
residents interested in home ownership. The program, through a collaborative partnership
with lending institutions, nonprofit organizations, and credit organizations, focuses on
providing information on home ownership strategies, credit counseling and a review of
affordable lending programs. The 2006-2014 goal is to provide 48 classes serving 1,520
people overall, with 6 classes serving 190 on an annual basis including classes in Armenian
and Spanish languages.
                                                          Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
This program was terminated due to the loss of Redevelopment Set Aside funds.
Review
This goal was met. In years 1 – 7 before the program was terminated there were 39 FTHB
Education classes, including Spanish and Armenian language classes, provided to 1,689
people.
c. Condominium Conversion Assistance
Program Goals
While condominium conversions have slowed in recent years, recent applications for
conversions in Glendale would indicate they may again increase in the future. The assistance
goals for FTHB mortgage assistance on converted units will be directly related to the level of
future conversion activity and the home ownership housing market.
Review
This program proved to be not feasible. Due to the continuing downturn in the economy
especially impacting home ownership developments, no applicants for condo conversions
were received during the eight year review period. As a result no (0) FTHB loan applications
for renters to become owners of converted units were received nor approved.
3.2.6 PROGRAM STRATEGY #5 - HOUSING SERVICES
5a. Care Management Services
Program Goals
Continue to provide case management services to 200 seniors annually (1,600 in the plan
period). 712 seniors were served during the eight year review period. The level of services
provided was initially 200 seniors annually, but services were reduced as funding from Los
Angeles County was eliminated. The City used CDBG and General Funds to replace the Los
Angeles County support, but there was a gap and reduction of services during the transition.
Level of services provided in the eighth year were 160 seniors served annually.
5b. Homeless Services
Program Goals
Continue to work with the Glendale Homeless Coalition on an ongoing basis for the Plan
period to support existing programs that have demonstrated effectiveness. And, as funding
is available will work to expand these services and facilities. The ability to provide services
and meet goals during the eight year plan period were challenged by the rapidly reducing
availability of federal funds and private donations to nonprofit providers during the eight year
plan period.
Emergency Shelters
       Provide 40 year round emergency shelter beds and 10 year round domestic violence
        crisis shelter beds and serve a combined total of 270 persons annually (2,160 for the 8
        year period).
     Review
     This goal was met. In years 1 – 8 served 2,592 persons.

Transitional Shelters:
       Provide transitional housing through 112 beds for persons in families and 10 beds for
        single individuals, serving 122 persons annually (976 persons over the 8 year period.)
       Provide transitional housing through 25 beds for chronically homeless adults.
    Review
    This goal was not met. In years 1-8 there were 723 persons served.
Permanent Supportive Housing
       Provide access to permanent supportive housing to 43 homeless households with
        disabilities through the Shelter plus Care Program.
       Provide stable housing for persons with special needs through permanent supportive
        housing. Continue to provide 8 slots for unaccompanied adults.
       Complete development and implementation of an SHP/HOME funded project to serve
        4 families and a second SHP funded project to serve 8 unaccompanied persons. Serve
        30 unduplicated persons annually (240 persons for the 8 year period.)
    Review
    This goal was met. In years 1-8 there were 345 persons served.
Case Management and Supportive Services
       Provide supportive services in the areas of outreach and assessment, mental health,
        health, employment veterans/issues, substance abuse, life skills and housing placement
        to 1,040 unduplicated persons annually (8,320 for the 8 year period).
       Provide case management for homeless households who receive Section 8.
       Expand participation by homeless service providers in the Homeless Management
        Information System in order to facilitate an unduplicated count of homeless persons in
        Glendale and their needs.
       Provide Medical Discharge Counseling services to homeless persons being discharged
        from Glendale Adventist Medical Center to address emergency needs and link them to
        homeless services under the local preference for homeless families.
    Review
    The precise number of persons served goal was not been met, but the range of services is
    greater than was originally proposed and the majority of the services were started
    midway through the eight year plan period. In Years 5 – 8 there were 5,103 persons were
    served. Programs have been expanded to include a substance abuse services, an
    employment program, an Access Center, and the Street Outreach Team is now included
    in this category.
Homeless Prevention Services
       Provide homeless prevention services through case management, advocacy, and direct
        financial assistance to households at risk of homelessness to help them maintain/obtain
        housing. Serve 200 families annually (1,600 for the 8 year period.)

    There was no specific goal for this program.      In years 1-8 there were 2,399 persons
    served.
Street Outreach
      Provide street outreach services to the chronically homeless street population in
       Glendale and connect clients to the Continuum of Care.
    Review
    There was no specific goal for this program. In years 1-6 there were 2,035 persons
    served. The program was revised in year 7 and counts are incorporated in other
    programs.
Domestic Violence Programs
      Provide safe emergency housing as part of a year round 10 bed domestic violence
       shelter and serve a combined total of 270 persons annually (2,160 for the 8 year
       period.)
    Review
    Services for this program are included in the Emergency Shelter Services count as shown
    above. The 10 bed facility described in this program is still in operation.
5c. Reasonable Accommodation Procedure
Program Goals
Adopt a written reasonable accommodation procedure, post online, and distribute at public
counters by December 2009. The Housing Task Force identified a need to accommodate
minor changes to zoning standards where necessary to allow persons with disabilities to
continue to use their existing units and to make development of housing for disabled persons
feasible, both economically and physically. Additional comments received from Shelter
Partnership expressed additional concerns that the scope of a reasonable accommodation
procedure should be broader than zoning standards such as siting and procedural
requirements.
Review
This goal was met. The study of this concern was completed and the Reasonable
Accommodation Ordinance was adopted on May 18, 2010. In 2011 there were 3 requests
received – 2 were approved and 1 was under review. In year 2012 there were 2 requests
approved. The written reasonable accommodation procedure has been posted online and
copies are made available to the public at the Permit Services and Planning Department
counters.
5d. Water and Sewer Service Priority for Housing Affordable to Lower-Income Households
Program Goals
Adopt a policy that grants priorities for service allocations to proposed developments that
include housing units affordable to lower-income households as required by state law. This
program will be implemented by April 2009. Senate Bill 1087 requires water and sewer
providers to establish a process for granting priority service allocation to proposed
developments that include housing units affordable to lower-income households.

This goal was met. In June 2009, Glendale Water and Power adopted a water and sewer
service priority policy for housing projects affordable to lower-income households. This
policy remains in effect.
5e. Zoning for Compliance with California Welfare & Institutions Code Section 5120
Program Goals
Adopt zoning to ensure that in any zone in which hospitals or nursing homes are permitted,
mental health treatment programs, either residential or non-residential, are permitted in
accordance with California Welfare & Institutions Code Section 5120. The provisions of
California Welfare & Institutions Code Section 5120 provides that in any zone in which
hospitals or nursing homes are permitted, mental health treatment programs, either
residential or non-residential, are permitted.      This program addresses discrepancies in
Glendale’s zoning code to ensure compliance with this state law.
Review
This goal was met. Zoning definitions and changes to Glendale’s permitted use charts have
been adopted to address this program. Mental health treatment programs fall under the
category of medical services in Glendale’s Zoning Code permitted use charts. Nursing homes
fall under the category of residential congregate living, medical in Glendale’s Zoning Code
permitted use charts. In the C3 and MS zones, hospitals are permitted, as are medical
services and residential congregate living, medical. Hospitals are not permitted in any other
zone. Medical Services is a permitted use in all zones that permit Residential Congregate
living, medical. Therefore, Glendale has ensured that in any zone where hospitals or nursing
homes are permitted, mental health treatment programs, either residential or non-residentail,
are permitted in accordance with California Welfare & Institutions Code Section 5120.
Glendale is in compliance with Program 5e.
5f. Zoning for Compliance with SB 2
Program Goals
Adopt zoning to ensure compliance with SB2 requirements relating to transitional housing or
supportive housing. Additional zoning review and modifications may be necessary to ensure
that transitional or supportive housing provisions in SB2 are also adequately addressed. This
program will include elimination of the 300 foot setback from residential zones requirement
for emergency shelters that is presently in the Zoning code and will permit transitional or
supportive housing subject to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the
same type in the IND zone. Emergency shelters will be a permitted use in the IND zone and
may occupy an existing building in the IND zone without discretionary approvals such as a
conditional use permit. Design review may be required for façade remodels and is required
for construction of new buildings in the IND Zone, regardless of use. Zoning code
amendments identified in zoning for compliance with California Welfare and Institutions Code
Section 5120 (Program 5e), in consistent definitions for residential and institutional uses
related to housing and supportive services (Program 5g), and in constraints on housing for
people with disabilities (Program 6b) may be included with these zone changes.

City of Glendale, California                  HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021
Review
This goal was met. In accordance with SB2, Glendale amended its zoning ordinance in 2008 to
permit emergency shelters by right in the IND zone. In accordance with SB 2, Glendale
amended its zoning ordinance in 2008 to permit emergency shelters by right in certain zones.
The distance limitation requirement for a conditional use permit for emergency shelters in the
IND zone was removed so that emergency shelters are a permitted use throughout the IND
zone. Additionally, Glendale established a Medical Service (MS) Zone to support hospital
and hospital related uses. Emergency shelters are a permitted use within the MS Zone. In
2010 the City approved a new location and building for PATH Achieve to provide an access
center for services to the homeless at 1851 Tyburn and 1948 Gardena Avenue. The City
provided $2 million funding assistance for the project. Thus, the City has demonstrated that
not only does the City provide zoning that permits emergency shelters, it actively encourages
them in Glendale in order to meet local need.
5g. Consistent Definitions for Residential and Institutional Uses Related to Housing
Program Goals
Adopt amendments to the Zoning Code to clarify definitions of residential and institutional
uses related to housing. Provide appropriate action such as adoption of amendments to the
zoning code or adoption of procedural changes by December 2010. This will clarify the
various zoning code definitions related to residential and institutional land uses related to
ensure predictability in describing various housing types in order to eliminate conflicts and
ambiguity in definitions and zoning practice which may be caused by overlapping definitions.
Although past practice has shown Glendale to be supportive of a wide variety of housing
types and living arrangements, amendments and modifications to zoning definitions will
ensure consistency in describing housing types and in zoning implementation. Under this
program, the City will clarify that Single Room Occupancy (SRO) is considered the same as a
hotel and note the areas where hotel uses are permitted. While Glendale does not have
specific residential uses called transitional housing and supportive housing, the code does
provide for a wide variety of housing types that serve these needs including, but not limited
to, multi-family residential, boardinghouses or lodging houses, domestic violence shelters,
senior housing, retirement and rest homes. The City will amend the code to clarify the uses
that serve as transitional and supportive housing, only subject to those restrictions that apply
to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. Zoning code amendments
identified in Program 5f and Program 6b may be included with these code amendments.
Review
This goal was met. Glendale adopted revised housing definitions and simplified its permitted
use charts for all residential, commercial, industrial, mixed use and the MS (Medical Service)
Zone. These changes have eliminated overlapping housing definitions. These changes also
allow for greater flexibility for housing choices. Additionally, Glendale added SRO to the
definition of hotel and motel. The City did remove all distance qualifiers for emergency
shelters as directed in the previous housing element. Transitional and supportive housing
definitions have been added to the Zoning Code and the code has clarified which uses may
serve as transitional and supportive housing. The Zoning Code permitted use charts
demonstrate that transitional and supportive housing are subject to the same restrictions that
apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. Therefore, Glendale has
met the requirements for this program.

3.2.7 PROGRAM STRATEGY #6 - FAIR HOUSING
6a. Fair Housing Plan
Program Goals
Continue to analyze the 2005 Fair Housing Analysis of Impediments to Housing Choice (AI)
and implement its recommendations. Review and update the AI beginning in 2010. Continue
to contract with a fair housing service provider for multi-language fair housing and
landlord/tenant services to an average annual 1,000 Glendale residents per year. Services
include: discrimination complaint education, enforcement and legal services, landlord/tenant
counseling, and education/outreach.
Review
This goal was met. The City’s Fair Housing Analysis of Impediments Plan was updated and
adopted in 2012. The strategy to further fair housing practices through an increase in
education and outreach for both renters and rental property owners has been accomplished.
During the 8 year review period the City coordinated semiannual community fair housing
workshops. The workshops were made available under a CDBG contract with the Housing
Rights Center to serve City residents with fair housing education, conciliation, mediation, and
resolving tenant/landlord disputes. Multi-language fair housing and landlord/tenant services
were provided to 9,072 Glendale residents during the eight year review period. Services
included: discrimination complaint education, enforcement and legal services, landlord/tenant
counseling and education/outreach.
Residents who felt discriminated against by rental property owners, rental property
managers, real estate agents, or loan and credit agents were referred to the Housing Rights
Center to get information and assistance with their discrimination claim. Services through the
Housing Rights Center were available in English, Spanish, and Armenian, the three primary
languages in Glendale, as well as others. Home Buyer Education classes were provided in
years 1 through 7 as described in Program 4b. Home Ownership Education, and Marketing,
above. These provided significant consumer protection and fair rights information in each
session to 1,539 participants during the plan period.
The number of affordable housing units and special needs supportive housing were increased
during the eight year plan period, as described above. The City has been successful in
addressing issues identified in the Analysis of Impediments and maintains a contract for fair
housing services as evidenced by the participation of Glendale residents in fair housing and
landlord/tenant services.
6b. Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Program Goals
Identify constraints on housing for persons with disabilities posed by zoning code definitions
for housing types and conditional use permit (CUP) requirements. Clarify zoning definitions,
standards, and/or policies to ensure that they do not violate federal and state fair housing
laws or violate state constitutional privacy rights with regard to housing for persons with
disabilities. Provide appropriate action such as adoption of amendments to the zoning code
or adoption of procedural changes by December 2010.

Review
This goal was met with amendments to the City’s Zoning Code definitions and permitted use
charts.
3.2.8 PROGRAM STRATEGY #7- SUSTAINABILITY
The State passed AB32 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. State guidelines are still in
development for how local jurisdictions are to comply. At this time, Glendale intends to
comply with these requirements which may impact housing programs. However, these
impacts are unknown at this time.
7a. Compliance with AB32
Program Goals
Continue to monitor State requirements for implementation of AB32. This will be an ongoing
program. The program will implement State requirements of AB32 to reduce greenhouse
gases.
Review
This goal was met. The City received an energy efficiency and water conservation grant in
order to develop the Greener Glendale Plan. The City completed a greenhouse gas
inventory in accordance with AB32 in March 2011. The plan was adopted in June 2011.
More information can be found at www.GreenerGlendale.com.
7b. Review Housing Standards for Multi-modal Transportation Options
Program Goals
Study housing location and design that supports multi-modal transportation options,
including transit, mass transit, pedestrian, bicycle and other mobility options. Implement
study by 2010. Study housing development standards to provide flexible options in lieu of
required parking in order to satisfy mobility goals. Parking requirements often increase the
cost of housing. Reductions in required parking may result in more affordable, sustainable
housing opportunities.
Review
This goal was met. Parking modifications pursuant to the City's mobility study are under
public review by the Planning Commission and Transportation and Parking Commission in
February 2011, with Council adoption anticipated prior to summer 2011.                   Parking
modifications include reduced parking requirements in downtown and mixed-use buildings.
3.3   DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PROPOSED ACTIONS & ACCOMPLISHMENTS
The City succeeded in accomplishing, and in many cases greatly exceeded, the goals
established in the previous Housing Element. These accomplishments are described above
and identify the differences between proposed actions and the program goals. In summary,
the City budget identifies the funds used to accomplish housing programs. The economic
recession has restricted the City’s ability to fund many housing programs because of funding
reductions at the state and federal level. Additionally, our local economy has also suffered a
                                                            Chapter 3 – Review of Goals & Policies

recession which limits private housing development and also lowers funds available to the
City’s General Fund to aid affordable housing projects.
While the City continues to seek additional funding for new housing programs and
developments, funding availability in the future is uncertain. However, as can be seen in
program 7a above, the City was able to receive grant funding for the Greener Glendale Plan
and was able to complete that housing program, although a funding source was not
identified at the start of the term of the previous Housing Element. Similarly, the City has
received a METRO grant for the Tropico Study which is presently being used to identify
transit-oriented improvements. The City does anticipate that the economy will improve over
the planning period (2014-2021) and is hopeful that we will be able to restore programs that
have been reduced or eliminated due to the recession.

CHAPTER 4 – HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
4.1 EXISTING HOUSEHOLD CONDITIONS
The Bureau of the Census defines a
household as all persons who occupy a
housing unit, which may include
single persons living alone, families
related through blood or marriage,
and unrelated individuals living
together.      Household information
such as household composition,
household size, and household income
provides the necessary base for the
analysis of housing needs in a
community.         Information in the
chapter relies on 2000 and 2010 Census data and is supplemented with data from American
Community Survey (ACS), produced by the U.S. Census Bureau, and other sources.
4.1.1 Composition
According to the 2010 Census, there were 72,269 households in Glendale. Renters comprised
61.9 percent of the households and homeowners 38.1.
Families represented 69.3 percent of the City’s households in 2010 compared to 67.7 percent
of all households in the County. The proportion of nonfamily households, a portion of which
are elderly, dropped from 32 percent in 2006 to 30.7 percent in 2010. This growth in family
households may reflect the in-migration of ethnic groups into Glendale with more traditional
family groupings as well as the high cost of housing.

            Source: 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census, 2006 ACS
4.1.2 Age Composition
The median age in Glendale was 39.8 in 2010, compared to 34.8 in the County, 35.2 in
California, and 37.2 in the United States. The median age in Glendale reflects the City’s large
elderly population and its traditionally higher priced housing stock deterring first time home
buyers and young families. The median age in Glendale was higher (41.2) in 2006 compared
to the median age in 2010 (41).
                                                                      Chapter 4 – Housing Needs Assessment

4.1.3 Race and Ethnicity
Exhibit 4-3 describes the racial and ethnic composition of Glendale residents in 2000 and
2010. The majority of the City’s residents described their race as White in 2010 (71.1
percent), a much larger proportion than County-wide (50.3 percent). From 2000 to 2010, the
proportion of people that described themselves as White increased by 12,266 people. The
second largest ethnic group in the City consists of persons of Hispanic origin, representing an
estimated 17.4 percent of the City’s 2010 population. A somewhat surprising finding is that
the number of people with a Hispanic background decreased substantially from 2000 to 2010—
38,452 people in 2000 versus 33,414 in 2010, a decrease of 5,038 people. Asian populations
represent a small increase between 2000 and 2010, from 16.2 to 16.4 percent of the
population. African Americans constitute 2,573 people in 2010 compared to 2,468 in 2000.
African Americans, American Indians and “Other” racial groups make up the smallest
proportion of Glendale’s population, comprising an estimated 1.7 percent of the city’s 2010
population. This represents no significant change from 2000.

    4.1.4 Non-European Ancestral Groups
    Within these broader categories of racial and Hispanic origins, Glendale’s population is
    comprised of dozens of ancestral groups. While the majority of Glendale residents described
    their primary ancestral group as being one of many European identities, the two largest
    ancestral groups in 2010 were Armenian at 34.1 percent of the City’s population and Mexican
    at 10.0 percent of the City’s population. The third largest non-European ancestral group was
    Korean, which represented 5.4 percent of Glendale’s population in 2010.
    4.1.5 Size
    Household size is an important indicator identifying sources of population growth, as well as
    overcrowding in individual housing units. Average household size in Glendale was 2.59 persons
    in 1990, 2.68 persons in 2000 and 2.63 in 2010. The decrease in household size in the past
    decade is largely attributable to continued falling birth rates which are part of a national
    trend. It may also be partly attributable to continued housing construction while the
    population in the city fell.

4.1.6 Overcrowding
The Census defines overcrowded households as units with more than one person per room,
excluding bathrooms, hallways and porches.                      Overcrowding reflects the inability of
households to buy or rent housing which provides reasonable privacy for their residents.
According to figures from the 2009 SCAG Existing Housing Needs Data Report, 0.09 percent
(6,548 units) of the occupied housing in Glendale was considered overcrowded as shown on
Exhibit 4-4. Compared to 2000 when the incidence of overcrowding in Glendale was
approximately 23.7 percent, overcrowding has decreased significantly. Exhibit 4-4A shows
that 1,611 of the units or 2.3 percent were considered extremely overcrowded (1.51 or more
persons per room) compared to 4.7 percent for the County.

4.1.7 Household Income
Household income is an important factor with respect to housing affordability. While upper
income households have more discretionary income to spend on housing, low and moderate
income households are more limited in the range of housing they can afford. The presence of
a large number of low and moderate income households in a region where housing costs are
high is indicative of a high level of housing overpayment.
Glendale’s median household income in 2010 was $53,980, whereas median family income
was slightly higher at $59,777 (see Exhibit 4-5). According to the 2010 Census data,
household incomes in Glendale were 1.63 percent lower than the County and family incomes
1.8 percent lower. There are wide variations in income levels among nearby jurisdictions.

As shown in Exhibit 4-9, the proportion of Low Income and Moderate Income households in the
City decreased slightly between 2000 and 2009—from 15 to 14.7 percent, and from 17.1 to
16.6 percent, respectively (the 2009 data is a 5-year average from the American Community
Survey from 2005-2009). The proportion of Extremely Low/Very Low Income households
increased slightly from 25.8 to 27 percent, while the proportion of Above Moderate Income
households decreased slightly from 42.1 to 41.7 percent. The Above Moderate Income
households represent the largest number of households in the City of the four groups, and
represent approximately 58.3 percent of all households. California has identified a category
for Extremely Low Income based on an assumption that half of those

4.1.8 Household Income by Tenure
According to the 2010 Census, 27,535 housing units in the City were owner-occupied and
44,734 were renter-occupied. As illustrated in Table 4-10 (using data from the 2000 Census),
when renters and homeowners are compared, a significantly greater proportion of the City’s
renters fall within the Very Low (11.9 vs. 1.5 percent), Low (9.6 vs. 2 percent), and Moderate
(11.2 vs. 2.9 percent) Income ranges. It is likely that all of the Extremely Low Income
households are renters. Almost 32.0 percent of the City’s homeowners are in the Upper
Income range, compared to 29.0 percent of renter households. This relationship illustrates
that as household incomes rise, people generally choose to purchase their own homes.

4.1.9 Overpayment
A household is considered to be overpaying for housing if it spends more than 30 percent of its
gross income on housing. Severe housing cost burden occurs when a household pays more than
50 percent of its income on housing. The prevalence of overpayment varies significantly by
income, tenure, household type, and household size.
As shown in Exhibit 4-11, 58.8 percent of all renter-occupied households and 36.1 percent of
all owner-occupied households in Glendale were burdened by housing overpayment. In the
County as a whole, the figures are 53.3 and 45.3 percent, respectively. The problem is
especially acute for households with annual incomes less than $35,000. Over 98 percent of
renters in Glendale with annual incomes of less than $20,000, and over 95 percent of renters
with annual incomes of between $20,000 and $34,999, suffered from housing overpayment.

The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) provides detailed information on
housing needs by income level for different types of households. Detailed CHAS data based on
the 2010 Census is displayed in table 4-11a below.
As shown below in Table 4-11a, 35.6 percent of renter-occupied households and 17.3 percent

of owner-occupied households in Glendale were burdened by housing overpayment. In
general, overpayment disproportionately affects lower income households. While 52.9
percent of all households were burdened by overpayment, the figure jumps to 78.3 percent of
lower income households. Further, lower income renter households comprised 93.8 percent of
all renter households that were overpaying for housing. This emphasizes the affordability gap
between market rents and affordable housing costs for lower income households.
Overpayment can affect extremely low income households to an even greater degree. In
2010, approximately 14,510 extremely low-income households resided in Glendale, with
12,250 renters and 2,260 owners. Most (87.1 percent) extremely low-income households are
in overpayment situations, and 78.4 percent of extremely low-income households paid more
than 50 percent of their income toward housing costs.

4.2 GROUPS WITH SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Certain segments of the population may have a more difficult time finding decent, affordable
housing due to special circumstances. In Glendale, these “special needs” households include
the elderly, disabled persons, large families, female-headed households, persons with
HIV/AIDS and the homeless as depicted in Exhibits 4-12 and 4-13. Los Angeles County Health
Department and Service Planning Area (SPA) boundaries are used in compiling statistics for
special needs populations, including those not tracked through census data such as
emancipated youth. A map showing the Los Angeles County Heath Department SPA areas can
be found at the website: http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/chs/spa2/index.htm. Glendale is
included in SPA 2.
In September 2005, the Strategic Housing Plan for Special Needs Populations
(http://www.shelterpartnership.org/Common/Documents/studies/StratPlan3.pdf.pdf)                         was
prepared by the Shelter Partnership, Inc. with information from the Special Needs Housing
Alliance, with members including the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family
Services, Community and Senior Services, Health Services Office of AIDS Programs and Policy,
Mental Health, Public Social Services, as well as the Community Development Commission,
Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, Office of Education and Probation Department. The
characteristics and considerations for various special need populations identified in this
report related to housing are included and referenced herein. Barriers to accessing and
maintaining housing for special needs identified in this report are included in Chapter 6.

4.2.1 Physically Disabled and Developmentally Disabled
Physical disabilities can hinder access to housing units of typical design as well as limit the
ability to earn adequate income. The proportion of individuals with disabilities increases with
age. According the 2010-2015 City of Glendale Consolidated Plan, an estimated 42,481
Glendale residents had work disabilities, mobility and/or self-care limitation in 2000,
comprising 21.7 percent of the City’s population. The higher percentage of persons with a
disability in Glendale is in part, attributed to Glendale’s higher proportion of persons aged 65
year and older (15.6 percent) compared to the nation (13 percent).
Housing opportunities for persons with disabilities can be maximized through the provision of
barrier-free housing. In addition, the City assisted in the funding of several housing projects
with 78 apartments specifically for the disabled, including: Maple Park and Ivy Glen
Apartments (owned by Ability First - formally known as the Crippled Children’s Society),
Hamilton House, Alma House and David Gogian House, owned by the Glendale Association for
the Retarded), and Casa de la Amistad (owned by Glendale Housing Corporation, a subsidiary
of United Cerebral Palsy of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties.)
The new Housing Element law identifies that the City is specifically required to address
housing needs for the developmentally disabled with mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
epilepsy, autism and any disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental
retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental
retardation, but not other handicapping conditions that are solely physical. Lanterman
Regional Center provides services to the developmentally disabled population in Glendale.
The following two tables (Exhibit 4-14 and 4-15) identify 1,249 active cases for the
developmentally disabled population in Glendale. A conversation with Karen Ingram, Director
of Community Services at Lanterman Regional Center revealed that the developmentally
disabled population also has limited housing opportunities that vary based on the type and
level of the developmental disability. There is a great need for affordable housing and
supportive services for this population which tend to be low income due to the inability of
many developmentally disabled persons to hold fulltime jobs. The disability information
reflects clients that may have multiple diagnosis which results in substantially higher numbers
than the 1,249 living in Glendale. The “Other Disabling Condition” count includes a few
clients who are under three years old and do not have a diagnosis yet. As noted above,
Glendale has provided subsidized housing opportunities for housing for both the physically
disabled population and developmentally disabled population.
With the recent changes in Glendale’s permitted use charts, residential congregate living
categories provide great flexibility in allowing a variety of housing types to meet the needs of
the physically and developmentally disabled populations. In addition, Glendale’s residential
zoning definitions were modified to clearly allow permit residents of multi family units to
have assistance so that they may stay in their homes should they become disabled. Due to
the City’s financial constraints, City funding for future development of housing projects is
uncertain and unlikely, unless a grant or other gift of funds occurs. However, Glendale will
continue to provide zoning standards that allow densities in excess of 35 DU/ac, density bonus
for affordable housing and parking incentives for affordable housing that will encourage
private developers to build housing for physically and developmentally disabled populations in
Glendale.

The Strategic Plan for Housing Needs identifies that nearly one in five people have mental
illness according to the National Council on Disability. Of these, a subpopulation of about
5.4% of adults in the United States have a serious mental illness (SMI), a term that generally
applies to mental disorders that interfere with some level of social functioning. “Nearly half
(2.6%) of those with SMI have been identified as having severe mental illness, which includes
                                                                     Chapter 4 – Housing Needs Assessment
                                                                                                Page 15 of 52

schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other severe forms of depression….Local studies
conducted in the City and County of Los Angeles have found the prevalence of severe mental
illness, such as schizophrenia, major depression, or bipolar affective disorder to range from
30%-50% (of the homeless population).”
The Strategic Plan for Housing Needs notes that those “with severe and persistent mental
illness are typically uninsured and require and intensive amount of services and resources for
effective mental health treatment.” Additionally, many of the homeless mentally ill persons
are likely to have serious medical problems, including malnutrition, diabetes, liver disease,
neurological impairments, and pulmonary and heart disease. Thus, health insurance is a
critical factor in providing the mentally ill access to health and mental health treatment.
Those with severe mental illness are frequently unable to work and need access to affordable
housing opportunities. Supportive services such as mobile crisis services have helped to
reduce hospital visits and voluntary and involuntary institutional care for persons with mental
illness. Supportive housing opportunities are also critical for serving this population.
Section 4.6 identifies existing and proposed assisted housing developments in Glendale which
serve the needs of disabled populations. The demand for affordable housing to serve the
needs of disabled populations is greater than the supply of units.
4.2.2 The Elderly
The special needs of many elderly households result from their lower, fixed incomes, physical
disabilities, and dependence needs. Glendale’s elderly population (residents over 65 years of
age) represents 15.6 percent (29,918 persons) of the City’s population, and 24.1 percent of
the City’s households.
Many persons in this population are in need of affordable housing since many are on fixed
incomes. Housing with supportive services including assisted living facilities and residential
congregate care facilities are also needed.
Section 4.6 identifies existing and proposed assisted housing developments in Glendale which
serve seniors. The demand for affordable senior housing projects exceeds the available
supply, evident by the lack of vacancies in senior housing units for low income elderly.
4.2.3 Female-Headed Households
Female-headed households tend to have low incomes, thus limiting housing availability for
this group. According to data from the 2010 Census, 12.3 percent (8,908) of the households in
Glendale are female-headed households. Of these households, approximately 34 percent
(3,054) had children present. According to data from the 2011 American Community Survey,
approximately 16.8 percent of the female headed households with children had incomes
below the poverty level. This population has a need for affordable housing. For those female
headed households with children, access to affordable childcare and health care are
particular needs.
4.2.4 Large Families
Large families and households are identified as groups with special housing needs based on
the limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing units. Large households often
consist of multiple families sharing a residence out of economic necessity. Overcrowding of
                                                               Chapter 4 – Housing Needs Assessment
                                                                                       Page 16 of 52

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
smaller dwelling units accelerates unit deterioration. In addition, large families often have
difficulty finding rental units which qualify for Section 8 housing assistance as many larger
units exceed maximum rent limits. Many landlords are also reluctant to rent to large
families.
There were 7,004 households with five or more members, representing 9.7 percent of the
City’s total households (2010 Census). Of these, 3,123 were in owner-occupied and 3,876 in
renter-occupied housing units.
For this population, a challenge is to find affordable, larger housing units. Discrimination is
another factor which may affect this population. Access to services such as affordable child
care, recreation facilities, health care and public transportation are concerns of this
population.
The City assisted in the development of five affordable rental developments that contain a
percentage of three bedroom units, and eight new homeownership developments with three
or four bedroom units that serve large low and/or moderate income households.
4.2.5 Persons with HIV/AIDS or Related Diseases
The Los Angeles County Health Department reports there are approximately 542 residents of
Glendale with AIDS (Exhibit 4-12). The National Commission on AIDS estimates that between
one-third and one-half of all people infected with AIDS are either homeless or are in imminent
danger of becoming homeless. Approximately 542 AIDS infected persons in Glendale may be
in need of supportive housing (The City of Glendale Consolidated Plan Fiscal Year 2010-2015).
The Strategic Plan for Housing Needs identifies that the San Fernando Valley SPA has 19% of
the County population, but only 14% of the population with AIDS. A major need facing this
population is health care, particularly medical insurance. Persons living with AIDS are
supported through a variety of networks in Los Angeles County, including the federal Ryan
White CARE act and the federal Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA).
Housing needs of this population include adult residential facilities (ARFs), congregate living
health facilities providing 24 hour care, HIV/AIDS substance abuse residential rehabilitation
services and inpatient detoxification services, residential care facilities for the chronically ill
and hospice care.
4.2.6 Persons with Drug and/or Alcohol Addiction
It is estimated by the National Institute of Alcoholic Abuse and Alcoholism that there are
approximately 12,000 people in Glendale with substance abuse problems. Some of these
individuals may need either supportive housing or are already homeless. Housing needs for
this population include emergency shelter, transitional housing and supportive housing
including substance abuse residential rehabilitation services and inpatient detoxification
services.
4.2.7 Emancipated Youth
In 2005, the Los Angeles County the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS)
estimated that there are approximately 1,800 youth emancipating from child welfare
supervised foster care every year in Los Angeles County. Abuse or neglect is the primary
reason children enter foster care. In October 2004, the Los Angeles County Probation
Department reported approximately 1,560 youth in placements: group care, foster care or
                                                             Chapter 4 – Housing Needs Assessment
                                                                                     Page 17 of 52

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
relative care. It is unknown how many of those youth are in Glendale, however, the trends
for Los Angeles County are assumed to apply in Glendale. Statewide, the number of youth in
foster care is growing, thus so are the needs for housing this population. Service needs of the
emancipated youth population are identified as health care (including pregnancy,
immunizations, and mental health), poverty, and education. According to the Strategic Plan
for Housing Needs, “the economic well-being of former foster youth, at least two to four
years after emancipation, appears adequate at best, and more closely resembles those 18 to
24 year olds living below the poverty line than those in the general population.”
According to the Strategic Plan for Housing Needs, “youth in out-of-home care in Los Angeles
County are placed in a variety of settings, including emergency shelters, kinship care, foster
family placements, and group care. Thus, there is a need for these types of housing. In
2004, it was estimated by the DCFS that for out-of-home placements, approximately 42% were
placed with relatives, 25% in Foster Family Agency certified homes, 15% in foster family
homes, 8% in guardian homes, and the remainder in group homes. Once out of the child
welfare system, the immediate housing need for emancipated youth is transitional housing,
with support services including education, job placement, medical care and mental health
care. Studies cited in the Strategic Plan for Housing Needs note that youth homelessness for
emancipated youth and those emancipating from dependency programs are often caused by
“the lack of affordable housing and supportive services (especially primary care), a decrease
in incomes for poor families, general instability for poor families, and substance abuse and
domestic violence.”
4.2.8 Workforce Housing
“Workforce Housing” generally refers to housing for middle income families, such as teachers,
policemen, and nurses, who make up the bulk of the working population. This group tends to
be priced out of the ownership housing market due to the high cost of housing, but their
incomes generally do not qualify under Federal or State guidelines as lower or moderate
income households. Workforce Housing is sometimes defined as households with incomes of
120 to 165 percent of the County Median Income.
Glendale investigated this issue and documented the increasing gap between median
household incomes and the affordability of rental and ownership units in Glendale. Due to
the lack of affordable housing funds targeted to this income group it is difficult to address
their housing needs. One strategy would be to develop joint use affordable housing in
conjunction with other city and community operations, such as hospitals, colleges, libraries,
etc. The recently completed Doran Gardens project investigated the feasibility of serving
workforce housing through the use of New Market Tax Credit subsidies (see Section 4.6
Location and Information on Assisted Units) and determined it was not workable at this time
because of the need for additional leveraged funding that would not serve this income group.
The City recognizes the need to provide housing for this group which is the majority of
Glendale’s working population, but funding for such groups is very limited.
4.3     THE NEEDS OF THE HOMELESS
Throughout the country, homelessness has become an increasing problem. Contributing
factors include the general lack of housing affordable to low and moderate income persons,
increases in the number of persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level, reductions in
public subsidy to the poor, and the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill.

4.3.1 Number of Homeless
In a point-in-time count study conducted in January 2012, the Glendale Homeless Coalition
estimated that there are 293 homeless persons in the City on any given night. The survey
found that 45% of homeless persons on any given night are single adults while 43% are persons
in families; 12% did not disclose their family composition. Veterans make up 5% of homeless
persons. According to this survey, 6% of the City’s homeless are children. The survey found
that 11% of homeless persons have problems of substance abuse, 5% are dually diagnosed
(suffering from both mental illness as well as substance abuse), and 20% of homeless persons
are mentally ill. Forty-two (14%) persons identified themselves as being homeless due to
domestic violence. Out of 293 unduplicated homeless persons enumerated
154 (52%) meet the definition of a “chronically homeless individual/family” with a disabling
condition who have either been continuously homeless for a year or more or have had at least
four episodes of homelessness in the past three years.

4.3.2 Persons “At-Risk” of Becoming Homeless
People “at-risk” of becoming homeless include very low income individuals and families who,
because of a number of barriers, are in immediate threat of becoming homeless. Among the
risk factors to becoming homeless are poverty and high housing costs. In terms of sub-
populations, seniors, those who are released from correctional institutions, and emancipated
youth from the foster care system are especially vulnerable to becoming homeless.
The number of households “at-risk” for homelessness is directly related to poverty rates.
According to the Economic Roundtable’s report Homelessness in Los Angeles, approximately
one quarter of Los Angeles County residents with incomes below 50 percent of the poverty
threshold become homeless at some point during the year. According to 2000 Census data,
for the City of Glendale as a whole, the total number of persons below poverty level was 15.5
percent, an increase of approximately 1 percent from the 1990 Census. However, the poverty
rates for southern Glendale are significantly higher. In zip codes 91204 and 91205, the
poverty rates are at 23 percent and 25.6 percent respectively. Although public assistance
benefits do provide some help for those in poverty, General Relief benefits are usually
inadequate for a person to maintain housing. According to a separate report by the Economic
Roundtable, over half of the individuals who receive General Relief experience homelessness.
Another indicator of those “at-risk” of becoming homeless is the percentage of income paid
for housing or rent. Because the housing costs in Glendale are higher than many other Los
Angeles communities, housing cost burden is a significant issue for Glendale households. As
shown in Exhibit 4-11, a significant fraction of households are considered overburdened by
housing costs. The problem is most acute for renters. Many of these persons are rent
burdened and are at-risk of becoming homeless if a financial emergency or job loss occurs.
Glendale service providers reported that another obstacle facing the homeless “at-risk”
population is underemployment or unemployment because of shifts in the local economy and
a lack of viable job skills. Without the appropriate skill development, low-income households
are restricted to low paying jobs without opportunity for advancement. Furthermore, some
individuals and families are unaware of, or ineligible for, the job training and employment
assistance resources available in the community. Other prevalent issues among the homeless
“at-risk” population include lack of transportation and affordable childcare. These present
difficulties in obtaining and sustaining employment.
4.4      HOUSING UNIT CHARACTERISTICS
4.4.1 Housing Growth
Glendale’s 1990 housing stock of 72,114 units increased to 73,713 by 2000, and to 74,812 by
2010. Comparing the residential growth rates of Glendale with nearby jurisdictions, the City’s
1.4 percent increase in housing units during the 2000-2010 period is comparable to the
housing growth experienced in La Canada Flintridge and South Pasadena. The growth rate for
Burbank, Los Angeles City, and Pasadena was higher (Exhibit 4-17). The County as a whole
also experienced a higher rate of growth than Glendale, indicating that the City’s residential
growth rate for the last seven years is less than that occurring in the region.

    4.4.2 Housing Type and Tenure
    Since 1970, the City’s composition of single and multi-family units reversed, so that multiple
    family units are now the predominant housing type, representing 61 percent of the City’s
    2013 housing stock (Exhibit 4-20). This trend reflects the limited amount of vacant land
    available for lower density development in Glendale. Single family residential development
    occurred almost exclusively in the City’s mountainous areas at very low densities, whereas
    multi-family development occurred in much of the City’s flatland areas primarily through the
    conversion of single family and lower density residential land uses.

    The tenure distribution (owner versus renter) of a community’s housing stock influences
    several aspects of the local housing market. Residential mobility is influenced by tenure,
    ownership housing evidencing a much lower turnover rate than rental housing. Housing
    overpayment, while faced by many households regardless of tenure, is far more prevalent
    among renters. Tenure choices are primarily related to household income, composition, and
    age of the householder.
    For the past several decades, Glendale has been a predominately renter-occupied community
    where approximately 61 percent of the housing units are rentals. Although this situation is
    influenced by many factors, much of this can be traced to the significant amount of
    condominium and multi-family unit development that occurred in Glendale. Though
    condominiums are a form of home ownership, many condominiums are used as rental units.
                                                                           Chapter 4 – Housing Needs Assessment

Approximately 20 percent (9,336) of all multi-family units are currently under condominium
ownership. Many condominium units were created through the conversion of apartment units
to condominiums. Between 1998 and 2005, the City lost 546 rental units, which were
converted to condominiums. Market demand toward the end of 2004 and in 2005 showed high
interest in condominiums, resulting in a dramatic increase in conversion applications during
that timeframe. However, in 2005, enforcement of Municipal code provisions requiring
converted buildings to be consistent with the current General Plan densities resulted in a
slowdown in conversion applications.
Of note is a trend toward implementing conversions approved decades earlier. In 2006, the
City “lost” a total of 222 units in two buildings that were approved for conversion in the
1980s. A 126-unit building at 1717 N. Verdugo Road was approved for conversion in 1981, yet
the units were not offered for sale until 2007. Similarly, a 96-unit building at 3220 Altura
Avenue was approved for conversion in 1983, yet the units were not offered for sale until
2007. It is likely that there are similar buildings elsewhere in Glendale. However, since the
Department of Real Estate has oversight over the sale of units, the City is unable to
determine when units in a building will be offered for sale.
The City’s condominium conversion ordinance was adopted in late 1978 and requires a 180-
day eviction notice for existing tenants. It offers the right of first purchase to existing
tenants and provides reimbursement of moving expenses up to $500 to displaced occupants,
consistent with state law. Additionally, the City adopted a Just Cause Eviction ordinance
which also provides for assistance for those displaced through conversion of apartment rental
units to condominiums. However, the Just Cause ordinance does not address evictions of
renters from individually-owned condominium units.
4.4.3 Vacancy Rates
Vacancy rates indicate the amount of supply or demand for available housing stock in a
community. High vacancy rates relative to other communities indicate that there is low
demand for the community’s housing stock and that there is abundant housing supply. Low
vacancy rates indicate that demand is high and that housing supply is relatively scarce.
According to the 2010 Census, the vacancy rate for ownership units was 1.2 percent while the
vacancy rate for rental housing was 6.8 percent. In comparison, the 2000 Census reported
the vacancy rate of 0.9 percent for ownership units and 1.9 percent for rental units. The
continued low vacancy rate for for-sale housing indicates that there is still a high demand for
such housing. The greater vacancy rate for rental housing may indicate that finding an
apartment in Glendale is becoming easier for some households.
Glendale Water and Power has an independent measure of vacant units and in April 2013, it
determined that there were 981 “inactive electric accounts” indicating a very low overall
vacancy rate of only 1.35 percent for single and multi-family units.
4.4.4 Age and Condition of Housing Stock
Homes built prior to 1940 account for 23.2 percent of the housing stock. Although 39.4
percent of Glendale’s housing was constructed between 1940 and 1969, another 37.4 percent
was built since 1970 (see Exhibits 4-21 and 4-22). Almost as much housing was built in the
1980’s alone as in all the years before World War Two. Production has fallen dramatically
since then, with only 2,199 dwelling units added to the City since 2000. Due to the
diminishing supply of vacant land in Glendale, new residential development was and

continues to be accommodated by the replacement of older single family homes with higher
density developments, as permitted under zoning.
The accepted standard for when housing needs major rehabilitation is when the housing is 30
years old. With more than 62 percent of Glendale’s housing stock built prior to 1970, and an
additional 29.4 percent built between 1970 and 1989, continued housing maintenance is
necessary to prevent widespread housing deterioration in the City. Fortunately, many of the
older residences are well maintained single family homes and not in need of significant
rehabilitation. In some cases, these homes are a part of potential historical districts.
Unfortunately, many apartments built in the 1980’s were poorly constructed in terms of
workmanship and maintenance is beginning to be deferred.
Approximately 1,529 units of the City’s occupied housing units (71,509) are in substandard
condition (2006-2010 American Community Survey, Dept. of the Census). Substandard housing
condition is defined by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as
housing units lacking complete kitchens or bathrooms. Some of these units are undoubtedly in
need of replacement. To address the deterioration of the housing stock, a limited property
rehabilitation program is made available to multi-family property owners. Reduction in
available State and federal funding has eliminated single family home rehabilitation program
that provided loans to those lower and moderate income home owners in need of home
improvements.

4.4.5 Housing Costs
According to information from the American Community Survey, in 2011, the median value of
housing in Glendale was $624,100 compared to $325,700 in 2000. As illustrated in Exhibit 4-
23, the value of for-sale housing in Glendale in 2011 was 30 percent higher than the County
median ($478,300), and nearly 22 percent more than the City of Los Angeles ($513,600). The
median home values in Burbank ($596,500) and Pasadena ($638,400) also exceeded the
County median. Only La Canada Flintridge (more than $1 million) and South Pasadena
($834,400), relatively small cities, had more expensive housing than Glendale. Home values
increased significantly during the past decade. It appears that the data from the Census
Bureau may not reflect the drop in home values from the recession of the past decade—the
data may lag current home values by some years.

In an effort to update housing sales information, sales data for single-family homes and
condominiums in the City was collected from DataQuick, a real estate data research firm, in
2012. This information is significantly different from the above Census information (Exhibit 4-
23), and reflects the value of homes sold within the year reviewed. Not all homes or prior
home values may be reflected in the Census data.
In the 2012 DataQuick annual report, the median home price in Glendale was only $440,000, a
2.2-percent increase from the median price of DataQuick’s $429,000 median home price in
2011. Generally, DataQuick shows that Glendale home prices are trending upward again after
the great drop in prices since 2007. In 2012, home prices in Glendale were higher than many
nearby communities. Housing prices in Glendale in 2012 were higher than in Burbank
($429,000), Los Angeles ($365,000), and Los Angeles County ($330,000), but were lower than
Pasadena ($510,000) and much lower than La Cañada/Flintridge ($1,082,500).
Home prices in Glendale varied considerably depending on location in the City. DataQuick
published reports only break out median home prices by zip code, instead of census tract.
The table below displays these median sales prices of single family homes and condominiums.
Single family home prices ranged from a low of $307,000 to a high of $705,000 in ZIP Codes
91204 and 91207 and condominium prices ranged from $210,000 to $323,000 in ZIP Codes
91205 and 91208, respectively.
Higher priced homes in Glendale tend to be located north of the 134 Freeway, especially
within hillside areas. Single family home prices ranged from $500,000 to $615,000 and
condominiums were $339,000 to $332,000 within ZIP Codes 91201 and 91202 in northwestern
Glendale. The highest priced homes in Glendale in 2012 were located in northern Glendale
adjacent to La Cañada Flintridge near the Verdugo Mountains, in ZIP Codes 91208 and 91207.
Median home prices in this area ranged from $647,000 to $705,000 for single family homes
and $279,000 to $323,000 for condominiums.

There is a significant range of prices within each category based upon the type of unit for
rent at this time. For instance there are numerous units for rent in condominium complexes
within the 2 bedroom multi-family apartment category at 1717 N. Verdugo Road during the
snapshot period. In addition, there are numerous new construction, upscale, high end
apartments for lease (all at once) in the ICIS (314 W. Colorado) and Eleve (200 E Broadway)
developments in all multi-family unit categories. These initial leases are pushing median
rents up especially in the studio and two bedroom apartment range.
Rents for single family homes varied quite significantly based on size, amenities and location.
The median rent for all single-family homes was $2,622 per month. Rents ranged from a
median price of $2,299 for a two bedroom home up to $3,475 for a three bedroom home.

financing assistance for new construction or acquisition/rehab with long term affordability
restrictions. These developments contain 1,052 affordable housing units. Another five density
bonus developments were completed that provide 101 affordable units.
Until recently, the long term affordability restrictions for three properties were slated to
expire in the next ten year period (2014 – 2024). These included Casa de la Paloma, Park
Paseo, and Maple Park apartments. They are all owned by nonprofit developers. Two of the
properties are owned by a developer listed on the CHPC list of “qualified entities” that should
be considered by local governments as developers/property owners who are considered
qualified to assist in the preservation of affordable rental housing.
Recently, the City and the developer of Casa de la Paloma worked collaboratively to apply for
and receive 4% Credit/Bond funding for Casa de la Paloma from the California Tax Credit
Allocation Committee (CTCAC). The proceeds were slated for substantial rehabilitation of the
projects (167 senior, very low income units). In exchange for the proceeds, the developer
entered into an agreement with CTCAC on extending the affordability covenants on the
building for 56 years (to 2067). This has solved the affordability preservation of this project.
Following that, the same developer approached the City to conduct similar negotiations on
their second project noted above, Park Paseo. Negotiations have been initiated and are
ongoing. City staff hopes to reach a similar agreement within the next two years that would
also preserve the affordable units in this project for a new 56 year term.
An analysis of the risk of these units converting to market rate housing is described in Section
4.5.3 below.
As part of the affordable housing program, short term affordability restrictions (from 5 to 15
years) were placed on various rental units as part of the Multi Family Rehabilitation Loan
Program. Over the years, most of those restrictions were released and the units returned to
market rate units. However, they do remain in place today on seven privately owned multi-
family rental buildings that received moderate to minor rehabilitation loans and currently
restrict affordability of 125 privately owned units and 84 single room occupancy units (SRO)
with the nonprofit YMCA of Glendale.
A review of these rental developments was conducted in order to describe the degree of risk
for these units to lose affordable housing designations during the 10 year analysis period of
2014-2024, and to describe the manner in which the City could assist in the preservation of
assisted units. The majority of the development projects with long term affordability
restrictions were financed with layered financing structures. As one funding layer expires,
others may still exist. As a result, projects that have one layer of financing expire may not be
at risk of converting to market rate rental rates immediately, but may only be able to provide
smaller affordability subsidies over time.
A financial analysis is provided for those developments that are “At Risk” of conversion to
market rate during the next 10 years to determine the most appropriate method of
replacement of units with a “HIGH” level of risk. Appendix E identifies local public agencies,

managerial capacity to acquire and manage at-risk projects.
4.5.1 Inventory of “At-Risk” Units from 2014 - 2024
Long term affordability covenants with the City and with other funders range from 20 to 75
years measured from completion of project construction. The length of covenants depends
upon requirements in effect at the time of development and the source of funding. The
affordable housing developments listed here are only those developments that have expiring
affordability covenants from 2014 – 2024. None of these developments have expiration dates
within the next five years, which would require additional analysis in this report.
This list was developed through a review of the affordable housing portfolio database of
projects assisted by the City of Glendale, and a review of the California Housing Partnership
database of multi-family affordable units in the City of Glendale.
4.5.2 Projects with Recently Extended Affordability Covenants
Palmer House Senior Apartments (555 Palmer Street) operated by Be.group provides 22
units of affordable housing to Low and Very Low income senior citizens. Palmer House was
scheduled to expire within the 10 year time period, but in the last two years their project
financing has been restructured and affordability covenants have been extended beyond the
2024 time period. Glendale invested 20% Redevelopment Set Aside Funds (when they were
still available) for Palmer House at the time of the tax credit investors exit. Funds were also
provided to assist in rehabilitation/energy efficiency capital improvements to the building
and extension of affordable housing covenants to these properties for another 55 years.
Casa de la Paloma Senior Apartments (133 S. Kenwood Street) operated by Be.group
provides 166 units of affordable housing to Very Low income senior citizens. Casa de la
Amistad was scheduled to lose its HUD 221(d) 3 affordability covenants in 2019, within the 10
year review period. Due to the refinance and completion of rehabilitation of the building
using tax exempt revenue bonds in 2013, the affordable housing covenants were extended for
another 55 years until 2068. The project continues to receive a Section 8 project based rental
assistance grant through 2019, which is funded annually.
4.5.3 Projects with Long Term Affordability Covenants Expiring 2014 - 2024
Park Paseo Senior Apartments
123 S. Isabel Street – owned by Be.group, nonprofit developer
96 units serving Low and Very Low Income Seniors
Assistance Type: HUD 202 Capital Advances and Rental Subsidies for Very Low Income Elderly
with Supportive Services Funding, CDBG for initial building construction.
Constructed in 1984 with a 40 year affordability period
Expiration Date - 2024
Risk of Conversion: Low
Be.group owns this building, as well as Casa de la Paloma and Palmer House. The latter two
projects are described above. In fact the property owner, Be.group (formerly known as

City of Glendale, California                       H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Southern California Presbyterian Housing), is listed as a “qualified entity” by the State as a
potential partner for rescuing and preserving affordable housing at risk of conversion.
Be.group is a nonprofit organization that is mission driven with a strong operating record.
Their REAC ratings of physical property conditions of their properties are at the highest level.
Be.group recently restructured financing and extended affordability on its Palmer House
senior apartments as described above. Be.group is reviewing options for obtaining an infusion
of capital (such as 4% tax exempt revenue bonds) to rehabilitate and improve energy
efficiency for an aging Park Paseo, just as it did for Casa de la Paloma. This would extend out
affordability covenants for another 55 years.
One element of increased risk described by the property owner is the possibility HUD project
based rental subsidies for operations may be reduced or eliminated by the federal
government. Park Paseo has a Section 8 project based rental assistance contract that is
funded annually. Annual grants for HUD 202 projects have been reducing in length of term
and in amount. They were previously funded for 5 years, then 3, and now on an annual basis.
These reductions have created cash flow issues and reductions in services. Without rental
subsidies it would not be feasible to serve the large number of extremely low income
residents who have lived at Park Paseo for decades. However elimination or reduction of
rental subsidies to tens of thousands of very low income senior citizens across the country
would be difficult politically.
Another element of increase risk is the difficulty of providing housing to an increasingly frail
group of residents with limited supportive services. Be.group is looking at partnerships
through the Affordable Care Act to increase medical and referral services to residents who
wish to age in place or must be transferred to assisted-care senior housing.
Despite increased risks for loss of affordability, based upon the strength of the nonprofit
property owner, the high quality of their asset and property management and their ability to
transition through the end of HUD subsidies on other similar senior citizen buildings in an
effective manner, this development is not classified as high risk for conversion at this time.
Maple Park Apartments
711 E. Maple Street – owned by Ability First, nonprofit developer
25 units serving Very Low Income the Developmentally Disabled
Assistance Type: HUD 811 Capital Advance and Rental Subsidies for Very Low Income Disabled
Persons with Supportive Services Funding, CDBG for initial building construction.
Constructed in 1984 with a 40 year affordability period
Expiration Date: 2023
Risk of Conversion:    Moderate
One risk to continued affordability is the degree of commitment of the nonprofit owner to
providing affordable housing. The property owner, Ability First, is first and foremost a
provider of services to disabled persons. Owning affordable properties with supportive
services is an ancillary part of their mission. They have stated their interest in returning to
their core mission of providing supportive services and are investigating selling their
affordable housing portfolio to another affordable housing provider, although no action has
been taken to accomplish that to date. Lower than desirable REAC inspection ratings of the
physical conditions at the property are a symptom of some of the management challenges at
                                                              Chapter 4 – Housing Needs Assessment
                                                                                      Page 30 of 52

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Maple Park. With a revived commitment to providing affordable housing or a transfer of
ownership to another nonprofit devoted to housing, this risk would be reduced.
Another risk is reduction of supportive services and resident referrals from the Lanterman
Center, a nonprofit service center for persons with developmental disabilities. The
Lanterman Center has experienced a significant loss of State funding and has reduced their
services to affordable housing providers. Due to this reduction in coordination with
Lanterman, Ability First is facing increased challenges to place and support disabled persons
in their affordable housing units, including Maple Park. Increased support to the network of
service centers by the State does not appear likely. This risk is likely to continue and
affordable housing providers will likely need to increase their supportive services capacity
through private fundraising.
Another risk is the possibility that federal funding will not be available in the future to renew
annual operating grants for HUD 811 project based rental subsidies to this and other similar
housing developments. Over time these project based subsidies were provided through 20
year agreements. These were reduced to 5 year, then 3 year, and are now provided on an
annual basis which creates uncertainty and cash flow issues for affordable housing owners.
Without these subsidies it would not be feasible to serve the large number of extremely low
income residents at Maple Park. If HUD 811 subsidies are further reduced or eliminated it
would create a national crisis in affordable housing as the HUD 811 program now provides
rental assistance to 24,571 disabled households. The political dilemma that would be posed
by reducing or eliminating assistance to a large number of disabled persons makes this risk
less likely.
Based upon the fact that this is a nonprofit owned building with HUD 811 rental subsidies
serving one of the most difficult to serve populations (extremely low income disabled
persons), the risk of conversion of the apartments to market based ownership upon expiration
of the HUD and City affordability covenants is not classified as High at this time. Program
financing such as 4% tax exempt revenue bond financing will be available to help address
issues of conversion to market rate faced by this project.
4.5.4 Projects with Short Term Affordability Covenants Expiring in 10 Years
Private for Profit Affordable Rehabilitated Units – Short Term Affordability Covenants
The City offered a multi-family housing moderate rehabilitation program to scattered
apartment sites within the community with shorter term affordability restrictions (5 to 15
years) largely through the use of 20% Redevelopment Set Aside funds to private, for profit
property owners. This program was most active in the late 1990’s. The rehabilitated units
were restricted to rents affordable to low and very low income residents as required by the
Redevelopment Set Aside and HOME programs. The majority of these rehabilitation loans are
now expiring. In a rising housing market there is no interest on the part of private property
owners to extend the affordability covenants on these properties. And there is no interest by
new private property owners to take out these loans as they are able to find private financing
to rehabilitate units in order to attract much higher income tenants, which increases the long
term value of their properties over time.
Currently 7 multi-family rehab loans to private owners of 94 rental units are restricting rents
to affordable levels for 5 to 15 years, depending upon the amount of investment per unit or
per building. During the ten year review period of 2014 to 2024 all of the remaining 91 for-
profit affordable units are expected to lose affordability and will no longer be rent restricted.
                                                               Chapter 4 – Housing Needs Assessment
                                                                                       Page 31 of 52

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
The City has a procedure to notify tenants of these units 6 months in advance of the possible
loss of affordability of their units and to work with property owners, if possible, to limit
future rent increases to these residents for a period of time after the restrictions expire.
These units are located at:
     512 S. Glendale – 31 units – 2013 expiration
     1000 E. Chevy Chase – 4 units – 2013 expiration
     505 S. Central – 11 units – 2013 expiration
     332 W. Lomita – 14 units – 2013 expiration
     512 S Glendale – 31 units – 2013 expiration
     107 Dryden – 28 units – 2015 expiration
     532 Acacia – 6 units – 2015 expiration
Total: 125 units
Risk of Conversion: High
The City will attempt to replace the loss of these units through construction of new units,
application of density bonus provisions which provide additional affordable housing units, or
acquisition/rehabilitation of other units with long term affordability covenants. Shown below
is an analysis of these costs. While investment per unit will be greater than is required for
the moderate rehabilitation loans with short term affordability restrictions of the Multi-
Family Rehabilitation program, the term of affordability will be longer on replacement units
and a greater assurance of the physical and financial condition of the units will be possible
over time with long term affordability restrictions.
Nonprofit Affordable Rehabilitated Units – Short Term Affordability Covenants
The City also offered Multi-Family Rehabilitation loans to nonprofit affordable housing
property owners with shorter affordability terms.
Glendale Association for the Retarded (GAR) received two rehabilitation loans through this
program, as did the YMCA of Glendale as described below. The affordability covenants for
the group homes have recently expired on these group homes, but the units remain affordable
as the property owner, GAR retains the units as part of its mission to provide affordable units
to developmentally disabled persons.
The YMCA of Glendale, operates a single room occupancy building (SRO) for men and that was
improved through a Multi-Family Rehabilitation loan with affordability restrictions that will
expire within the ten year time period 2014 – 2024. The SRO building serves a low and
moderate income population interested in living in a Single Room Occupancy Unit. By its
nature it will likely continue to serve this tenant population in the future, unless the YMCA
determines it wishes to convert the building to another use, sell it, or operate it as market
rate housing (albeit with low rents). The building itself has limited function as a market rate
apartment building due to limitations on the physical size of the units, lack of full kitchen and
bath serving each units, and lack of residential amenities and parking. Also, the building is a
historic structure with complicates any proposed demolition of the building.
The YMCA has increasingly relied upon rental income for operations of the organization. The
City has limited funds available to assist in preservation of the building’s affordability in the
future. Efforts are being made to leverage funds for the YMCA through a redevelopment of its
entire site that may assist in restructuring financing for the SRO building, and perhaps
                                                               Chapter 4 – Housing Needs Assessment
                                                                                       Page 32 of 52

retaining affordability of the units. The City is assisting the YMCA is receiving Requests for
Proposals for redesign of its physical campus which includes recreational, community center,
and market rate housing and affordable housing components.
Based upon the need for generating operating revenue for the property owner and the
challenges for finding an affordable housing partner who would be committed to the physical
renovation and supportive services that would be necessary to operate the SRO building as a
long term affordable housing resource, the risk of conversion of these units to market rate
units (even though rent rates would likely be low cost) is High.

Financial Analysis Comparing Replacement and Preservation Efforts to Preserve Affordable
Units
To estimate the public assistance cost required to replace the 209 rehabilitated Very Low,
Low and Moderate Income affordable rental units with long term affordability covenants that
are at High Risk to be lost by 2024, staff undertook the following analyses:
       A review of the costs estimates, and local public assistance costs, for a new 9% Low
        Income Housing Tax Credit (Tax Credits) project; and
       An estimation of the costs and financial gap associated with an acquisition and
        substantial rehabilitation project.
4.5.5 New Construction: 9% Tax Credits
A developer and the Housing Authority recently executed an Affordable Housing Agreement
for a 44-unit Veterans Village project that will serve Low and Very Low Income households. It
is important to note that this project has an affordability period of 75 years, which is
significantly greater than the 55 year time frame of most 9% tax credit projects. The project
is subject to prevailing wage requirements imposed by the State of California. The sources
and uses of funds for the project are summarized in the following table:
EXHIBIT 4-26 SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS PER UNIT - VETERANS VILLAGE
           Development Costs                                             $351,457
           Outside Funding Sources
             Mortgage, Developer Equity/Fees            $51,629
             Tax Credit Equity                          179,374

                                                                                      Page 33 of 52

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
           Total Outside Funding Sources                                  $231,002
           Gap Filled by Housing Authority (City)                         $120,455
As can be seen in the preceding table, the available outside funding sources paid for
approximately 66% of the project costs. This left 34% of the costs to be funded with City of
Glendale Housing Authority assistance. If the 209 at-risk Low and Very Low Income Units can
be replaced in a 9% Tax Credit project, it can be assumed that the local public assistance
costs would fall in the range of $120,455 per unit.
This equates to $25.2 million in local public assistance for 75 years of affordability of the
209 at-risk units.
4.5.6 Acquisition and Substantial Rehabilitation of Existing Rental Units
A developer and the Housing Authority recently executed an Affordable Housing Agreement
for the developer to purchase an existing market rate 18-unit building, rehabilitate it to
moderate rehabilitation standards, and convert it to a senior citizen affordable housing
development (Cypress Senior Apartments).           It will serve Low and Very Low Income
households.
This project has some unique characteristics that may apply to other Glendale
acquisition/rehab projects as described below:
       1. This project does not meet the requirements required for RHNA credit, as the
            project does not require substantial rehabilitation per RHNA guidelines established
            by HCD. The rehabilitation costs are at the moderate level and fall within the
            $77,000 per unit range. Because of the age of Glendale multi-family housing in
            Glendale, largely constructed in the 1980’s and 1990’s, this degree of
            rehabilitation may apply for other similar projects. Nevertheless because of the
            financial structure of the project, the affordability covenants do apply for 55
            years.
       2. The pertinent apartment project inventory in Glendale consists largely of projects
            with fewer than 20 units. It is financially less feasible to pursue Tax Credits for
            small projects, and thus, local public assistance is needed to bridge the majority of
            the financial gap. The Housing Authority is therefore providing a greater level of
            permanent financing for the project than would be typical in a 9% tax credit
            project.
An example of sources and use of funds for an acquisition/moderate rehabilitation project is
presented in the following table:
EXHIBIT 4-27 SOURCES AND USE OF FUNDS PER UNIT - CYPRESS SENIOR
                  APARTMENTS
           Development Costs                                              $231,987
           Outside Funding Sources

                                                                                       Page 34 of 52

              Tax Credit Equity                         $132,514
            Total Outside Funding Sources                                $151,569
            Gap Filled by Housing Authority (City)                       $ 80,418
As shown in the table, the local public assistance share of the costs decreases substantially
when an appropriate building requiring moderate level rehabilitation is found, a motivated
for profit developer is located, the 9% tax credit investment is obtained, and the affordability
period is 55 years instead of 75 years. Finding an appropriate existing building and developer
is key in this case.
In this case, the necessary local public assistance is 34% of the project costs. If the 209 at-
risk Very Low Income Units are replaced through an acquisition/substantial rehabilitation
project meeting these requirements, the local public assistance is estimated at $80,418 per
unit. This translates to approximately $16.8 million for 209 units.
4.5.7 Financial Analysis Findings
The financial analysis indicates that the most financially efficient method for replacing the
209 at-risk Very Low, Low, and Moderate Income units is the Acquisition/Rehabilitation
option. This option could potentially be funded with Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset
Funds
(program income from former 20% Redevelopment Set Aside funds), federal HOME Program
funds, and competitive project based affordable housing funds available from other State,
federal, and County affordable housing funders.
Despite the feasibility, there may be occasions and projects where new construction of units
are desired in place of Acquisition/Rehabilitation for other programmatic or policy reasons.
These will be selected on a case by case basis.
4.6      LOCATION AND INFORMATION ON ASSISTED UNITS
Exhibit 4-28 shows the location of all housing projects which are in operation, or have
received either funds/funding commitments or density bonuses with entitlements from the
City. Of these 43 housing developments, one is under construction and four are proposed.
One is permanent housing for the formerly homeless located in a nearby city. These projects
provide dwellings at/or below market rate rents or sales prices and/or special needs housing.

4.7.1 Population Growth
Urban sprawl has caused many metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles and San Diego to
extend outward from central cities. The City of Glendale is a member of the Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG), which is the council of governments for this
region. According to SCAG, there are three components of growth. The primary factor of
growth remains natural increase, which is the difference between the number of births and
the number of deaths. A second component is internal migration within the United States,
which is the number of persons moving to the region from other parts of the country less
those moving out. Third, is immigration or the number of new persons moving to the region
from other countries.
Southern California, which includes Imperial, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Los
Angeles, Orange, Ventura, and Santa Barbara counties, grew from 17,410,446 persons in 1990
to 21,626,497 persons in 2010, representing a 24 percent increase in population. Between
1990 and 2010, the population of the eight county area grew by over four million people.
Los Angeles County grew by nearly one million people in the 20 years between 1990 and 2010,
which was significantly slower growth than in the past. For example, the population of the
County increased by nearly 1.4 million people in the 1980’s alone. In addition, growth in Los
Angeles County was surpassed by Riverside County (Exhibit 4-29).

From 2010 to the year 2035, Glendale’s population is expected to grow by another 18,057
people. The estimated average annual growth rate of approximately 0.38 percent is much
slower than the average annual growth of 2.5 percent that the City experienced during the
1980-1990 period. Factors which may influence future growth in Glendale include the
availability of land for development, the price of housing, interest rates and the overall
economy.

Growth in the City is expected to be concentrated in the southern and western area as shown
in Exhibit 4-32. These areas are predominantly multi-family zoned. Development is likely to
consist of the replacement of single family homes by apartments and condominiums, leading
to increased development densities.

4.7.2 Employment
Approximately 100,777 residents in Glendale were employed in 2010 (Exhibit 4-33). This level
of employment represents a labor force participation rate of 69 percent for males and 60
percent for females. Unemployment in Glendale was high in 2010, with 14 percent of males
and 12 percent of females actively looking for work. These proportions were comparable to
total county-wide level of 12.4 percent. The 2010 high unemployment rate was mostly due to

Most jobs in Glendale are in the educational, professional and retail sectors, comprising
nearly 50 percent of the City’s employment opportunities. The entertainment industry is
expected to dominate future job growth, as evidenced by recent development activity by
DreamWorks, ABC7 and Disney in the San Fernando Road corridor area. This is further
reinforced by trends occurring in the region especially in the San Fernando Valley and
surrounding communities. Based on the significant increase in office development in the City,
the Finance, Insurance and Real Estate sectors are expected to continue to provide a
significant number of jobs in the City, as will other service sectors.
Employment statistics reveal that a relative balance exists between the types of jobs
performed by Glendale residents and the types of employment opportunities available in the
City. Exhibit 4-34 displays the areas of the City where employment growth is anticipated.
Generally, it is expected to be concentrated in Downtown Glendale and along the San
Fernando corridor. Employment in these areas is dominated by retail trade, services and light
industry.
In 1992, the San Fernando Road Corridor Redevelopment Project Area was established to ad-
dress the declining industrial area along San Fernando Road and surrounding areas. The plan
proposes approximately 4.97 million square feet of new development. In 2006, the City
approved the Glendale Downtown Specific Plan to provide direction for growth and
revitalization of the downtown area. Approximately 1.7 million square feet of commercial
space (retail, office, hotel, theater) and approximately 3,980 housing units are anticipated,
primarily within the boundary of the current Redevelopment Project Area. This growth will

4.8       REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT (RHNA)
State law requires that jurisdictions provide their fair share of regional housing needs. The
State of California Department of Housing and Community Development (Department) is
required by State law to determine the statewide housing need for a projected period of
time. The current planning period is January 1, 2014 through June 30, 2021. In coordination
with the Department, local governments and councils of government are charged with making
a determination of their city or region’s existing and projected housing need, as a share of
the statewide housing need.

 Planning Period (2014-
 2021)
 Sources: SCAG 2011
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) prepared the Regional Housing
Needs Assessment (RHNA) in 2011, which defined the housing need allocation for each
member local government in southern California, including Glendale. As a result of this
process, SCAG determined that the City of Glendale’s total construction need is 2,017 housing
units for this planning period (Exhibit 4-35). This total construction need is divided by SCAG
into housing construction need by income level. For Glendale, this need was determined to
be 508 units of very low income housing, 310 units of low income housing, 337 units of
moderate income housing and 862 units of above moderate income housing (see page 81 of
this chapter for income group definitions). The intent of the future needs allocations by
income group is to relieve the undue concentration of very low and low income households in
a jurisdiction and to help allocate resources in a fair and equitable manner.
Units are classified based upon the income group required to occupy the unit under an
identifiable affordable housing program. Extremely Low Income units are occupied by
households from 0-30% Area Median Income. Very Low Income units are occupied by
households from 0-50% Area Median Income for Los Angeles County (AMI) and this total is
inclusive of Extremely Low Income. Low Income units are occupied by households from 51-
80% AMI. Moderate Income units are occupied by households from 81-120% AMI. Income 121%
AMI and greater is considered above moderate income.
Glendale identified a need for workforce housing, which Glendale defines as from 121%-165%
AMI. Although not defined by HUD, workforce housing was identified as a housing need by the
Housing Task Force and is included in the discussion of housing needs in Section 4.2.
Assisted housing projects are identified in Section 4.6 which includes a listing of the funding
sources for each development and years of affordability. Since the actual dollar amounts of
the income levels vary by household size and by changes in the area median income, the
actual dollar amounts vary year-by-year. Current AMI and income levels applicable to
Glendale can be found on the State of California Housing and Community Development
Department website at www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/hrc/rep/state/incNote.html or on the Federal
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website at www.huduser.org/datasets/il.html. The

HUD website also includes income limits for the HOME program, the funding source for many
of the assisted units constructed in Glendale.
Affordable rents are determined based upon the affordable housing program funding source
used to finance the unit. An affordable rent is considered to be 30 percent of the monthly
adjusted gross income. Monthly adjusted gross income is annual income less deductions
allowed by the regulations divided by twelve. The HUD website referenced above provides
links to current rental assistance programs and rental limits based on income levels for
affordable housing programs such as the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program.
The RHNA is not a mandate to construct 2,017 housing units. According to the SCAG
publication titled Housing Southern Californians (June 1999), the targets “...are intended to
assure that adequate sites and zoning exists to address anticipated housing demand during
the planning period and that market forces are not inhibited in addressing the housing needs
of all economic segments of a community.”
The RHNA total construction need figure is based on a number of statistical variables,
including household growth, vacancy rates, replacement needs, income distribution and
growth forecasts. Consideration of indicators such as the number of low income households
overpaying for housing, severe overcrowding, housing tenure, and current vacancy need are
also part of this determination. The allocation of these units by income level, which is also
termed the “fair share” distribution, is based on the median income level of the County of
Los Angeles and the existing income structure of each city within the County.

CHAPTER 5 – RESOURCE INVENTORY
Resources for meeting existing and projected
housing needs consist of land (both vacant and that
with a potential for redevelopment), public services
and utilities, and funding from local, State and
Federal sources, as well as private financing.
5.1     LAND INVENTORY
This section evaluates the potential for additional
residential development which could occur under the
City’s current General Plan and zoning. Generally, the
emphasis for potential residential growth has shifted
from vacant and underutilized land to specified areas
along major transportation corridors with commercial services, with the capacity for higher
densities. This is evidenced by the adoption of the City’s Mixed-use Zoning programs, which
were implemented by zoning amendments in October 2004 for the San Fernando Road
Corridor Redevelopment Project Area. The Downtown Specific Plan, adopted in October
2006, also promotes a shift in development towards downtown sites. The availability of
public services and facilities to accommodate potential residential growth is also evaluated.
5.1.1 Residential Development Capacity
Exhibit 5-1 provides a breakdown of the number and type of additional residential dwelling
units that could be constructed on residentially zoned properties in Glendale under the
current General Plan. These figures were derived from two primary sources: the City’s
Geographic Information System (GIS), and a study prepared in 1993 in accordance with
existing zoning provisions regarding hillside development. The 1993 study identified vacant
lots in the R1R (Restricted Residential) zone and estimated the development potential of
vacant, unsubdivided hillside properties in the ROS (Residential Open Space) zone. All
figures were amended to reflect the changes in zoning acreages for those categories affected
by the recent Parks rezoning in 2005.
The residential zones in Glendale, as shown in Exhibit 5-1, are Residential Open Space (ROS),
Restricted Residential (R1R), Low Density Residential (R1), Moderate Density Residential (R-
3050), Medium Density Residential (R-2250), Medium High Density (R-1650) and High Density
Residential (R-1250). The residential zones in Glendale reflect corresponding land use
densities in the General Plan Land Use Element. The zones and maximum densities outside
the Downtown Specific Plan area correspond as follows:
                                                                  Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                    Page 1 of 25

        R1             Low Density Residential                                      8 DU/acre
        R-3050         Moderate Density Residential                                 14 DU/acre
        R-2250         Medium Density Residential                                   19 DU/acre
        R-1650         Medium-High Density Residential                              26 DU/acre
        R-1250         High Density Residential                                     35 DU/acre
The City of Glendale General Plan Land Use Element provides a lot width density bonus in
the medium, medium high and high density residential zones. This benefit is by-right for
developments with 90 feet or greater frontage, whether or not multiple lots are actually
combined. Therefore, some single lot developments have taken advantage of this provision,
including many corner lots. The rationale behind providing an incentive to combine lots was
to encourage developers to avoid creating “orphans”, or small single-family homes remaining
isolated mid-block among larger development complexes. Since Glendale’s development
code allows for multi-family residential development at the densities zoned, the lot width
density bonus was not created to spur development, but rather to address neighborhood
compatibility and visual impacts in neighborhoods in transition.
The maximum densities of multifamily zones with lot width densities of 90 feet or greater are:
        R-2250 Medium Density Residential            24 DU/acre
        R-1650 Medium-High Density Residential 33 DU/acre
        R-1250 High Density Residential              40 DU/acre
The City’s Downtown Specific Plan provides for relatively large multiple dwelling complexes
at a density of 35 to 60 DU/acre. Mixed-use development areas allow densities ranging from
35 to 100 DU/acre. The Downtown Specific Plan is a design-based code with densities
dependent upon individual site location and project characteristics. For example, up to 35
DU/acre is available to sites abutting a single-family zoning district designation; up to 87
DU/acre is available to sites abutting a multi-family zoning district, while the highest allowable
density is available to sites abutting nonresidential zoning districts. Residential development
(mixed-use or free-standing) at even higher densities may be permitted in the downtown area
when certain criteria are met, such as for affordable housing. Since the Downtown Specific
Plan is a design, rather than density-based document, bonuses are for additional floors and
height, not any designated density.
5.1.2 Realistic Residential Capacity
Single Family: Lot characteristics from the GIS are based on data from the Los Angeles
County Assessor’s Office as well as a land use analysis prepared by the City. For the
purposes of this analysis, only residentially zoned land with development potential was
evaluated. Development potential was defined as either vacant land or underdeveloped
land. Vacant single family lots at least 5,000 square feet in area in the R1 zone were
identified by the GIS. It was estimated that between 40 and 100 more homes could be
constructed on R1 land. In the R1R and ROS zones, only vacant lots of at least 7,500 square
feet in area, with road access, and not owned by a government agency were considered to
have development potential. Based on these criteria, it is estimated that there could be
                                                                     Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                       Page 2 of 25

City of Glendale, California                 H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
between 350 and 400 more homes on lots in the R1R and ROS zones. However,
development constraints in hillside areas such as ridgelines, steep slopes, unstable slopes,
seismic hazards, drainage problems, and street access could limit development potential for
many of the existing lots. Additional analysis concerning residential zone constraints and
impacts upon adequate sites can be found in Section 6.1 under the heading Zoning Code
Regulations as a Housing Constraint and Section 6.2 under the heading Environmental
Constraints and Adequate Sites Inventory.
Multi-Family: In the multi-family zones, the GIS was used to identify both vacant and
underdeveloped lots a on a lot by lot basis. Only vacant lots of at least 5,000 square feet of
land area were considered to have development potential. Underdeveloped land included
lots where the existing number of units on each lot was less than or equal to half the
maximum number that could be built. Based on these factors, and based on a feasible level
of development, there is enough vacant and underdeveloped land in the City to support
approximately 2,780 additional dwelling units on multi-family zoned properties. Additional
analysis concerning residential zone constraints and impacts upon adequate sites can be
found in Section 6.1 under the heading Zoning Code Regulations as a Housing Constraint and
Section 6.2 under the heading Environmental Constraints and Adequate Sites Inventory.
5.1.3 Realistic Development Capacity on Small Sites for Housing Affordable to
        Lower Income Households
The existing subdivision pattern in Glendale has generally resulted in small residential lots,
typically between 5,000 and 7,500 square feet. To encourage development of larger multi-
family projects, Glendale relies on provisions in the zoning code which promote lot
consolidation through by-right density bonus for projects with frontage 90 feet or greater.
Frontage may be on more than one street. A concern was raised by the State Housing and
Community Development Department that affordability is encouraged when projects sites
achieve significant size and densities, which may not be achieved on single-lot residential
development.
Appendix D shows the potential for lot consolidation to encourage affordable housing in the
R-1250 and R-1650 Zones which have by-right densities of 30 dwelling units to the acre or
greater. Within the R-1650 Zone there is a potential for lot consolidation on 43 sites. Those
43 sites without lot consolidation would permit up to 521 additional residential units. With
lot consolidation the number of potential by-right units on those sites increases to 688 units.
Of the potential 688 by-right units, 260 would be within projects of 20 units or greater.
Density bonus provisions in Glendale’s Municipal Code (Section 30.36.060) allow for up to an
additional 10-35 percent minimum density bonus above lot consolidation densities for
projects which are designated affordable consistent with provisions of SB1818. Appendix D
provides a conservative example of the consolidated lot capacities for affordable units
assuming a minimum 20 percent density bonus which would be applicable if 5 percent of the
bonus units were affordable to very low income residents or 10 percent were affordable to
low income residents. Column 4 of Appendix D shows that the R-1650 Zone has the potential
for encouraging up to 843 units on consolidated lots, and up to 522 units within projects of
20 units or greater.
Potential for lot consolidation in the R-1250 zone also demonstrates capacity and
encouragement of affordable housing development. Within the R-1250 Zone there is
potential for lot consolidation on 32 sites. Those 32 sites without lot consolidation would
                                                                 Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                   Page 3 of 25

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
permit up to 509 additional residential units. With lot consolidation the number of potential
by-right units on those sites increases to 669 units. Of the potential 669 by-right units, 417
would be within projects of 20 units or greater. As noted above, density bonus provisions in
Glendale’s Municipal Code (Section 30.36.060) allow for up to a 10-35 percent minimum
density bonus above lot consolidation densities. Appendix D shows an example of the
capacities for units on R-1250 consolidated lots based on a 20 percent density bonus.
Column 4 of Appendix D shows that the R-1250 Zone has the potential for encouraging up to
812 units on consolidated lots, and up to 570 units within projects of 20 units or greater.
Thus, by-right densities in the R-1650 Zone and R-1250 Zone depicted in Appendix D clearly
show availability of an adequate number of housing sites and at densities that would
encourage the construction of by-right affordable housing. Appendix D shows that total
potential for units with by-right densities of 30 units per acre or greater on consolidated lots
is 1,357 units, with by-right densities increasing to 1,655 units assuming a modest 20 percent
density bonus for affordable projects. The total potential number of units with by-right
densities of 30 units per acre or greater on consolidated lots with at least 20 units per site is
677 units, with by-right densities increasing to 1,092 units assuming a modest 20 percent
density bonus for affordable projects. As noted in Chapter 3, Exhibit 3-1, RHNA
Construction Need and Income Distribution 2008-2021, Glendale has a need for 818 units of
low income housing. Based on the capacity analysis displayed in Appendix D and the low
income housing need identified in Exhibit 3-1, Glendale has the capacity to accommodate at
least 1,092 affordable units on sites with a capacity for at least 20-unit developments.
Additionally, it should be noted that Glendale’s code does not have provisions which limit the
amount of density bonus that can be granted for affordable projects and has recently granted
100 percent density bonuses for affordable projects such as for the Garfield project.
Exhibit 3-1 shows a need of 337 units for moderate income households. There is a greater
opportunity to meet that need on smaller, higher density zoned lots. With rising affordability
levels comes greater flexibility for zoning to provide housing capacity on smaller sites. While
it is recognized that lower income residential projects benefit from larger unit capacities on
each site, moderate income developments can be accommodated in smaller projects.
Glendale has participated with Habitat for Humanity on projects such as for-sale
condominiums with projects with as few as three units on single lots (1833 Gardena Avenue
and Pacific Avenue 4-lot). Housing affordable to moderate income households can be
accommodated on single lots, (as well as on consolidated lots) with capacities for fewer total
units. As per state assumptions, adequate sites located in the R-1250 and consolidated sites
in the R-1650 Zones have by-right densities of 30 dwelling units per acre and are presumed to
be suitable for development of affordable housing.
In addition to the zoning capacities in the R-1250 and R-1650 zones, Glendale permits by-
right development of residential units above the first floor at densities of 34 units per acre, or
up to 44 units per acre on sites with 90 feet of frontage or greater. Residential capacity in
commercial zones is discussed elsewhere in this chapter. Glendale also permits by-right
development of residential units in mixed-use zones and in redevelopment areas. Residential
capacity in mixed-use zones and redevelopment areas (Downtown Specific Plan area and San
Fernando Road Redevelopment Project area) is discussed elsewhere in this chapter.
Glendale also has staff dedicated to promoting the development of affordable housing,
particularly on small lots. The Housing Division of the Glendale Community Development
Department actively seeks partnerships with affordable housing developers and actively

affordable housing developments in Chapter 4, Glendale’s Housing Authority and Community
Development Department (CDD) is responsible for encouraging affordable housing
development throughout Glendale on a variety of lot types and sizes. Since the Glendale
CDD is a budgeted department and the Housing Authority has designated duties to oversee
housing and services, particularly related to affordable housing, these entities have not been
included in Chapter 2 as housing programs. However, the ongoing efforts of staff in the
Community Development Department and the various programs undertaken by CDD staff
are integral to facilitating new development, maintenance and monitoring of affordable
housing and affordable housing contracts.           An example of CDD staff encouraging
development of affordable housing on small lots are partnerships with San Gabriel Habitat for
Humanity which developed three detached single-family condominiums on Gardena Street on
what was previously one single-family residential lot.

A detailed listing of all sites that are zoned for residential development and have the
potential to add residential units is attached in Appendix A, along with a map showing the
location of those sites. As can be seen from Exhibit 5-1, residentially-zoned land alone has the
capacity to meet the City’s RHNA.
5.1.4 Vacant Land
Only limited potential exists in the City for the development of vacant, unsubdivided
property. In the flatter areas of the City, few vacant, residentially-zoned lots of any
significant size remain. The vast majority of the remaining vacant land in the City is in our
mountains, which are both biologically and environmentally sensitive areas. The average
slope of projects in the mountains is estimated at approximately 60 percent. Much of this
land is restricted to low density development or has been zoned for open space. The
environmental constraints of the unsubdivided privately held properties preclude
development of a substantial number of housing units.
About 12-14 percent of the dwelling unit potential on residentially-zoned land could be
satisfied in the single family residential zones and would be concentrated predominately in
the City’s mountainous communities. Much of this would be in previously subdivided lots.
The high cost of developing in mountainous terrain renders infeasible the majority of the
City’s vacant land for lower cost housing. The greatest potential for affordable housing
development is in the higher density residential zoning categories (i.e. R-3050, R-2250, R-
1650 and R-1250).
Additional capacity is also available in the City’s mixed-use zoning categories (SFMU, IMU-R
and DSP). However, these are not included in the available sites inventory, because
determining how these sites might be developed would be too speculative, since
development in mixed-use zones does not require housing development.
5.1.5 Underdeveloped Land
The greatest potential resource for residential development in Glendale is in the
“underdeveloped” areas of the City. A portion of the City’s higher density residential
acreage (R-3050, R-2250, R-1650 and R-1250 zones) is currently developed at less than
maximum capacity, such as with single family dwellings and duplexes. These lower-density
residential uses typically are redeveloped when it becomes economically feasible to increase
the intensity of use allowed in the zone by acquiring the improved site, demolishing the
existing units, and constructing new, higher density units. Glendale’s four multifamily zones
permit significant increases above single family densities, thereby increasing the economic
viability of recycling existing lower density developments with higher density apartments and
condominiums. Glendale’s population growth in the 1980’s in particular was fueled by the
                                                                   Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                     Page 6 of 25

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
recycling of underutilized lots into higher density multifamily apartments and condominiums.
Land recycling such as this continues and demonstrates that the redevelopment of parcels by
the private sector is economically feasible.
Between 1980 and 1990, Glendale’s population expanded by over 40,000 individuals. Growth
between the 1980’s and 1990’s was accommodated, for the most part, by the redevelopment
of underutilized properties in the multiple family residential zone categories. During the
1980’s and 1990’s, over 10,500 dwelling units were added to the City. Growth slowed
dramatically in the past decade. According to date from the California Department of Finance
and the American Community Survey, it appears the population in Glendale peaked at over
200,000 sometime in the mid 2000’s, and then fell to 191,719 in 2010. The decline of the
housing market experienced around the country was also felt in Glendale, with a total of 444
housing units built between 2006 and 2012.
The City completed several rezoning programs during recent years. In 1986, the City
performed a comprehensive rezoning program in which all residential land use categories
were reevaluated. This resulted in both changes of zones and the development of new
standards. A further rezoning strategy also occurred in 1991, resulting in the refinement of
the City’s multiple family zoning standards. As a result of these two programs, the zoning
distribution represents an accurate portrayal of the land use patterns in the City. Areas with
a concentration of economically viable single family units were zoned either single family or in
the lowest category of multiple family zoning. Also, as a result of these zoning efforts, the
underutilized properties in the multiple family zones are generally those that do not have a
high economic value as a single family or duplex use. Therefore, the total development
potential expressed in Exhibit 5.1 is an accurate representation of viable development
potential of this type of property.
Approximately 29-30 percent of the dwelling unit potential is contained in the Medium
Density Residential Zone (up to 19 units/acre), 22-23 percent in the Medium High Density
Residential Zone (up to 26 units per acre), and another 20-21 percent in the High Density
Residential Zone (up to 34 units/acre). While it is unlikely that all underdeveloped sites will
convert to higher densities, a significant potential for intensification exists. This potential for
recycling in Glendale will serve to provide adequate sites to meet the majority of the City’s
identified housing needs. In terms of providing affordable housing, the 2,423 housing units
that could be built in the Medium Density, Medium High Density and High Density zones
provide a significant contribution to the stock of housing which, combined with City
incentives, can be priced within lower income groups’ range of affordability. These zones
have the greatest potential to provide future affordable housing.
5.1.6 Residential Capacity in Commercial Zones
It should be noted that Exhibit 5-1 does not reflect several factors related to housing in the
City. First, it does not show residential development potential in commercial and mixed-use
zones and in the Downtown Specific Plan area. Nearly all of Glendale’s commercial zones
permit residential development by right in accordance with the R-1250 zone standards,
provided that such development is above the first floor. A few mixed-use projects have
already been built in the City, indicating a level of acceptance for such housing and the
potential for the creation of more. The City is actively promoting commercial corridors as the
                                                                     Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                       Page 7 of 25

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
preferred location for new multi-family development because such locations are near public
transit lines and near the services residents need. Also, there has been interest expressed by
the development community in building residences downtown.
According to information from the County Assessor’s office, and City land-use surveys, there
are approximately 2,700 existing dwelling units in commercial zones (Exhibit 5-2). This
represents approximately 3.7 percent of all residential units in the City. It is difficult to
estimate the development potential of residential units on other commercially zoned
properties, but it could be expected to increase in the future since acceptance of and interest
in mixed-use commercial/residential projects has been increasing. At a minimum, it is
anticipated that several hundred additional residential units could be expected to be
developed in commercial zones.

5.1.7 Residential Mixed-use Development Potential
As a built-out city, Glendale recently established innovative ways to provide housing
opportunities for its residents. As residential land has become increasingly scarce and traffic
congestion a constant battle, the mixed-use and transit-oriented development concept
became a viable option for Glendale. Mixed-use development has been permitted for years
in most Commercial zones in Glendale as noted previously, but few mixed-use projects were
built. To facilitate mixed-use and transit-oriented development, the City adopted several
mixed-use zones, which were incorporated in a new zoning chapter of the Glendale Municipal
Code (Chapter 30.14 – Mixed-Use Districts). Additionally, the Downtown Specific Plan makes
greater provision for housing than previous zoning.
                                                                   Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory

As shown in Exhibit 3-1 in Chapter, 3, between January 1, 2008 and August 2, 2013, a total of
2,436 units were completed, under construction, approved or in the development review
process within the mixed-use zoning districts, including 19 extremely low, 205 very low, and
40 low-income units. Section 4.6 also provides information about projects receiving some
form of City assistance to promote affordability.
5.1.8 Redevelopment Areas
Development in the mixed-use zone includes development within the Central Glendale
Redevelopment Project Area and the San Fernando Road Corridor Project Area.
Redevelopment Agencies were dissolved as of February 1, 2012 (see discussion in Chapter
2.5.) Between January 1, 2008 and August 2, 2013, approximately 2,411 housing units were
completed, under construction, approved, or in the development-review process in the two
redevelopment project areas (Exhibit 5-3). Residences are permitted uses within these
project areas in certain zones subject to specific development standards.

Central Glendale Redevelopment Project Area
The Glendale Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) is an urban design plan, adopted in October
2006, which sets the physical standards and guidelines, and allows a variety of housing types
in the downtown core. It is fundamentally a mixed-use district. The Plan consists of a variety
of different neighborhoods or districts and encompasses most of the Central Glendale
Redevelopment Project Area. The intent of the Plan is to preserve the aspects of each
district, which provide its special character, while improving the attractiveness and livability of
the Downtown area. One of the goals of the Plan is to respond to the recent market interest
in downtown housing. Residential development is allowed by right within most of the 221
acre Plan area with a potential for approximately 4,000 additional residential units.
Approximately 5.5 acres of land that was residentially-zoned is included within the DSP area.
The development potential on these sites is equal to or greater under the DSP than under the
previous zoning.
                                                                     Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory

San Fernando Road Corridor Redevelopment Project Area
Three mixed-use zoning districts were adopted in October 2004 as part of the San Fernando
Road Corridor rezoning program. Two of the districts include residential development. The
zoning districts are:
    1) IMU-R Industrial/Commercial-Residential Mixed-Use Zone - The IMU-R zoning district
        is applied to areas appropriate for a mix of commercial, industrial and residential
        activities and provides for a full range of goods and services to the community located
        along portions of industrial/commercial thoroughfares, in conformance with the
        General Plan. This district allows for a mix of commercial and residential or stand-
        alone land uses. Residential use is only allowed with a Conditional Use Permit.
    2) SFMU Commercial/Residential Mixed-Use Zone - The SFMU zoning district is applied
        to areas appropriate for a mix of commercial and residential activities in conformance
        with the General Plan. This district allows for a mix of commercial and residential or
        stand-alone land uses.
Based on community input while the rezoning program was being developed, staff
conservatively estimates that approximately 1,000-2,000 housing units could be developed in
the San Fernando Corridor Redevelopment Project Area.
As noted in Chapter 2.5, AB x1 26 as amended by AB 1484 (2011) dissolved redevelopment
agencies as of February 1, 2012. Past redevelopment activities resulted in the conversion of
some of the City’s affordable housing stock. Pursuant to Community Redevelopment Law
that was in effect before the dissolution of Redevelopment by the State, the Redevelopment
Agency was required to assist all families and persons who were displaced by an Agency-
assisted project from housing facilities in a project area. Loss of affordable residential units
were tracked and replaced on a 1 for 1 unit replacement basis as required by State law. In
fact there were an excess of replacement units created during the term of the
Redevelopment Agency in this area. Displaced tenants were also provided with financial
relocation assistance as required. There are no remaining enforceable obligations of the
Successor Agency to the Redevelopment Agency or the Housing Successor Agency that will
result in an additional loss of residential units in the project area.
5.1.9 Inclusionary Housing Program
As described in Section 2.1 of Chapter 2, the City adopted an inclusionary housing
requirement in 2004. However, due to the California Superior Court decision, Palmer vs. City
of Los Angeles, 175 CAL App. 4th 1396 (2009) it was determined that inclusionary zoning for
rental units (even within Redevelopment Project areas) was not enforceable without further
action by the State legislature. Also, the status of the inclusionary requirement in
Redevelopment Project Areas specifically remains a question today, based upon the
dissolution of Redevelopment by the State. No new inclusionary housing has been produced
by private developers in Glendale since the Court of Appeals ruling.
5.1.10 Surplus Lands
                                                                       Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                       Page 10 of 25

City of Glendale, California                   H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Another potential source for housing development in some cities is surplus governmental
properties. While the City has purchased significant acreage of vacant land in the
mountainous portions of Glendale, limited accessibility, environmental concerns and deed
restrictions renders this land unsuitable for residential development. The City does not
currently own any other lands which it considers surplus nor has the City identified any State
or Federally controlled land which can be described as surplus and available for acquisition.
No other governmental agencies have surplus sites available for housing within the City.
5.1.11 Residential Development Potential Compared with Glendale’s Housing Needs
As indicated in Chapter 4, Section 6, the RHNA prepared by SCAG identified a future housing
need for Glendale of 2,017 units to be developed during the planning period for this Housing
Element (2014-2021). Combining the residential, commercial and mixed-use development
potential on vacant and underutilized lands, it is estimated that approximately 10,000
additional units could be developed in the City. This indicates that the City’s General Plan and
zoning provide for a residential development capacity adequate to accommodate the City’s
share of regional housing needs.
In terms of development opportunities for lower income households, approximately 73-75
percent of potential residential growth is allocated to higher density housing (Medium,
Medium High and High Density Residential zones), which have the potential to meet the need
for 1,155 housing units in the Extremely Low, Very Low, Low, and Moderate Income
categories identified by SCAG as Glendale’s future housing need. Mixed-use zones provide
additional capacity for development of housing for various incomes including Extremely Low,
Very Low, Low Income households. Exhibit 5-1 demonstrates capacity for new units in
residential zones, including capacity that encourages affordable housing development,
Exhibit 5-2 demonstrates capacity for new units in commercial zones and Exhibit 5-3
demonstrates capacity for new units in redevelopment areas where mixed-use zoning is
prevalent.
The City’s R-1250 Zone has a by-right density of 35 dwelling units per acre (and up to 44
dwelling units per acre with the by-right lot width bonus). As shown in Exhibit 3-1, this zone
is suitable for development of housing for lower income households as demonstrated by the
development of the Kenwood Habitat and Doran Gardens projects. This zone has the
capacity to accommodate 688 additional dwelling units, not including the potential for
additional units for developments qualifying for lot width density bonus or for additional units
applicable to affordable projects under SB1818 provisions for density bonus (included as
Chapter 30.35 of the Glendale Municipal Code).              See Appendix D concerning lot
consolidation and previous discussion for analysis of realistic capacity for lot consolidation in
the R-1250 Zone. As discussed in Chapter 6.1 under City Zoning Regulations as Housing
Constraint and shown in Appendix B nearly half (6 of 13) of the residential projects in the R-
1250 zone approved between 1998 and 2005 took advantage of the lot width density bonus
and added by-right units. Since the allowable density is over 30 units per acre, this zoning
capacity in the R-1250 Zone is assumed to be suitable for development of housing for lower
income households.
The R-1650 Zone has a by-right density of 26 units per acre (and up to 32 units per acre with
the by-right lot width bonus). As shown by Exhibit 3-1, this zone is also suitable for
development of housing for lower income households as demonstrated by the development
of the Palmer Habitat project which is located in the R-1650 Zone. This zone has the capacity
                                                                   Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                    Page 11 of 25

to accommodate 755 additional dwelling units, not including the potential for additional units
for developments qualifying for lot width density bonus or for additional units applicable to
affordable projects under SB1818 provisions for bonus densities (included as Chapter 30.35
of the Glendale Municipal Code). See Appendix D concerning lot consolidation and previous
discussion for analysis of realistic capacity for lot consolidation in the R-1650 Zone. As
discussed in Chapter 6.1 under City Zoning Regulations as Housing Constraint and shown in
Appendix B about 20 percent of the residential projects (3 of 14) in the R-1650 zone
approved between 1998 and 2005 took advantage of the lot width density bonus and added
by-right units.
The R-2250 Zone has a by-right density of 19 dwelling units per acre (and up to 24 units per
acre with by-right lot width bonus). As demonstrated by Exhibit 3-1, this zone is also suitable
for development of housing for lower income households as demonstrated by the
development of the Garfield Gardens and 615 Chester projects. This zone has the capacity
to accommodate 980 additional dwelling units, not including the potential for additional units
for developments qualifying for lot width density bonus or for additional units applicable to
affordable projects under SB1818 provisions for bonus densities (included as Chapter 30.35
of the Glendale Municipal Code). As discussed in Chapter 6.1 under City Zoning Regulations
as Housing Constraint and shown in Appendix B, over 20 percent (4 of 15) of the residential
projects in the R-2250 zone approved between 1998 and 2005 took advantage of the lot
width density bonus and added by-right units.
Exhibit 3-1 shows that 349 units for lower income households are currently entitled or have
been constructed since 2008. These entitlements include 19 units for extremely low income,
205 units for very low income, and 68 units for low income households. Since it is evident
that developments built or entitled show suitable zoning capacity for those uses, Glendale
needs to demonstrate capacity to entitle an additional 818 units for lower income households
to satisfy the RHNA projection. For lower income households, the R-1250 Zone has capacity
to provide 688 units of the projected need for additional entitlements. Additional units can
be accommodated in the R-1650 zone which has the potential for 755 additional units and has
demonstrated its suitability for construction of affordable units as shown in Exhibit 3-1. More
by-right residential capacity can be generated at densities above 30 units per acre if any of
the sites in either the R-1250 or R-1650 zone employ a density bonus for lot width or a
density bonus for affordable housing (Chapter 30.35 Glendale Municipal Code), or both. For
example, past trends of development using by-right lot width density bonus shown in
Appendix B demonstrate that if 50 percent of the 165 available sites in the R-1250 Zone (83
sites) and 20 percent of the available 238 sites in the R-1650 Zone (48 sites) employ a density
bonus for lot width, averaging two bonus units per project, then an additional capacity of 262
units in areas zoned above 30 units per acre is evident. This is further discussed in Chapter
6.1 under City Zoning Regulations as Housing Constraint.
Appendix D provides evidence of the potential for lot consolidation in the R-1250 and r-1650
zone to meet affordable housing needs. Total potential units with by-right densities of 30
units per acre or greater on consolidated lots is 1,357 units. Assuming a by-right 20 percent
density bonus for affordability on consolidated lots, total potential units with by-right
densities of 30 units per acres or greater is 1,655 units. As noted under discussions of density
bonus, the City’s zoning code allows for minimum 10-35 percent density bonus for
affordability, however, the City does not have a limit on the amount of density bonus that can
be granted and has granted 100 percent density bonus for affordable projects.
                                                                   Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                   Page 12 of 25

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
In addition to providing adequate sites that demonstrate capacity in residential zones to
accommodate Glendale’s regional housing need for additional housing entitlements for 526
units for lower income households, residential zoning in the R-1650, R-2250, R-3050 and
single family residential zones is sufficient to demonstrate capacity to entitle housing to
accommodate at least 280 units for moderate income households. As shown in Exhibit 4-34,
the City has a need for 337 units of housing for moderate income households. Exhibit 5-1
shows the capacity for at least 1,809 additional units to meet regional housing needs for new
residential construction for households in single family residential, R-3050 (moderate density)
and R-2250 (medium density) zones. Thus, the adequate sites analysis in Appendix A and
active entitlements shown in Exhibit 3-1 demonstrate that zoning is available to meet the
regional housing need of 2,017 units, including 818 units affordable to lower income
households and 1,199 units affordable to moderate and higher income households.
Glendale also allows construction of residential units in commercial zones to R-1250
standards, which allow by-right densities up to 35 dwelling units per acre (or up to 44
dwelling units per acre with lot width bonus). However, the focus of commercial zones
remains commercial, and residential units are allowed when located above first floor
commercial. A fully residential project in a commercial zone is subject to the approval of a
conditional use permit to ensure compatibility with neighboring uses. While there is capacity
to develop by-right housing at densities above 30 dwelling units per acre, these sites have
not been included in the adequate sites analysis because the type and number of residential
units that could be constructed on a site-by-site basis would speculative and dependent upon
an undetermined commercial component. Exhibit 5-2 provides a description of the number of
units that exist in commercial zones. Since adequate capacity to meet regional housing needs
has been demonstrated on a site specific level for residential zones, demonstration of
additional residential capacity in commercial zones on a site by site basis is not necessary or
required by state law. Therefore, Exhibit 5-2 shows zoning capacity on an aggregate level
and a site-by-site analysis, which would be highly speculative, has not been provided.
Most of the thousands of additional housing units that could be built in the mixed-use DSP,
SFMU and IMU-R zones will be at densities of 50 dwelling units to the acre or more, making
some of these units also suitable for affordable housing. Mixed-use zones are generally
located in redevelopment areas and are shown on the City of Glendale Zoning Map
(http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/planning/zoning_map/Zoning%20map%202-14-13.pdf).                   As
demonstrated in Exhibit 3-1, affordable housing projects for extremely low, very low and low
income households have been approved and constructed in mixed-use zones. Metro City
Lights, Metro Loma, 1200 San Fernando Developmentally Disabled, Glendale City Lights and
Vassar City Lights are examples of affordable housing in mixed-use zones providing units to
extremely low, very low, low and moderate income households. Residential developments in
the DSP zone have also provided opportunities for market rate units in projects such as the
Americana at Brand.
The mixed-use zones have not been included in the adequate site analysis out of concerns
similar to residential uses in commercial zones. Past practice shows that Glendale has a
strong commitment to affordable housing in mixed-use zones. However, the purpose of
mixed-use zones is to allow flexibility in uses, not only residential ones. While the SFMU Zone
allows certain residential uses by-right along certain streets, the highest and best use of a
property may not always be residential, depending on location and market conditions. The
IMU-R zone has been used for a number of residential projects, however, such use is not by-
right. Similarly, the Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) provides for a variety of incentives that
                                                                      Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                      Page 13 of 25

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
may boost residential densities, however, such analysis is highly dependent on the ultimate
design and mix of uses proposed on a site specific basis. Since adequate capacity to meet
regional housing needs has been demonstrated on a site specific level for residential zones,
demonstration of additional residential capacity in mixed-use zones on a site by site basis is
not necessary or required by state law. Therefore, Exhibit 5-3 shows zoning capacity as
approved. Speculation on numbers of residential units which could be combined with other
uses has not been provided.
However, even at these higher residential densities provided in mixed-use zones, the high
cost of land in Glendale precludes market-built affordable housing without financial
incentives. The various affordable housing incentives proposed by the Housing Element are
set forth in Chapter 2 of this document.
5.1.12 Emergency Shelters
The City permits emergency shelters by-right in the IND (Industrial) and MS (Medical Service)
zones. Additionally, Glendale’s Charter allows applicants to request use variances to allow
uses not listed as permitted or conditionally permitted in all other zones except for single-
family residential zones. Glendale’s existing emergency shelters have been approved through
various methods including by-right, by conditional use permit, and by use variance. Glendale
has sufficient capacity to accommodate the need for emergency shelters. Within the IND
Zone, there are 400 parcels totaling 300 acres, with typical site sizes ranging from 6,000
square feet to 1.5 acres. Within this zone, there are 18 vacant sites that are generally covered
by parking; however there are many sites in this area that could be redeveloped and/or
existing buildings that could be re-used. The IND zones are served by public transit (Beeline,
Metro rapid line and Metrolink Station) and most of these sites are within a quarter mile of
the San Fernando Road corridor, which offers access to many services, including the Los
Angeles County Department of Public Social Services and Glendale Memorial Hospital. Within
the MS zone, there are 44 parcels totaling 24 acres, ranging in size from 5,000 square feet to
2 acres. Presently there are 5 vacant sites in the MS zone; however, there are buildings in this
area which may be suitable for redevelopment or re-use as emergency shelters. Presently, the
MS zone encompasses the area surrounding and including Glendale Adventist Medical
Center, located near the interchange of the 134 Freeway and the 2 Freeway. This area has
convenient freeway access and is served by public transit. The MS zone allows for various
medical and by-right housing opportunities including transitional housing.
5.2     AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES
Public facility capacity is generally sufficient to meet the needs of projected growth. The
City’s Public Facilities Impact Fee was adopted to ensure that new development does not
degrade the existing level of service at parks and libraries. While public facilities and services
are already established in the City’s urbanized areas, development in the City’s hillside areas
often require service extensions, contributing significantly to the costs of development.
Potential infrastructure constraints to new development are discussed in Chapter 6, Section 3
of this report. Most services, including electrical power, water, and sewer, are available to
new development for the pro rata cost of providing services to the project.
                                                                    Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                      Page 14 of 25

City of Glendale, California                  H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Another area of concern is the strain higher density development places on the street system
in the City’s older neighborhoods. The width of many of these streets was established
according to standards for single family neighborhoods from the early 1900’s. Recycling of
lower density units to higher densities may exacerbate traffic congestion and accessibility
problems currently experienced in areas with undersized streets. However, traffic calming
principles and efforts to promote neighborhood identity are often contrary to the widening
of undersized streets. These issues need to be carefully considered during project
development. Mixed-use development also may help alleviate traffic congestion.
5.3     LOCAL EMPLOYMENT MARKET
As evaluated in Section 4 of this Housing Element, City residents are employed
predominantly in the professional services, education, retail trade, manufacturing, finance,
insurance, real estate, and health service industries. Because a relative balance exists
between the jobs performed by Glendale residents and the types of employment
opportunities available in the City, Glendale focuses on attracting businesses and industries
which maintain the urban character of the City.
Glendale continues to enjoy a healthy commercial development market. The Final
Environmental Impact Report for the Downtown Specific Plan anticipated the addition of
1,738,962 square feet of commercial and office space in the downtown. The Americana at
Brand project, analyzed in the Town Center Specific Plan, includes 475,000 square feet of
commercial floor area. The Disney Grand Central Creative Campus is authorized to add
approximately 3.5 million square feet of commercial and office space over the next 30 years.
Based on these and other projects, the City expects to add approximately 24,800 jobs by the
year 2030.
5.4     FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING
A variety of financial resources are available to facilitate the purchase, rental, and
rehabilitation of housing that is affordable.
5.4.1 Redevelopment Set-Aside and Low Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund
Redevelopment Set-Aside funds were generated to be used to build, buy, and/or rehabilitate
affordable housing for rent or home ownership or provide direct rental assistance to very low,
low and moderate income persons located both in and out of the agency boundary. With the
dissolution of Redevelopment Agencies by the State, no new funds are being set aside.
However, program income resulting from investments made with Redevelopment Set-Aside
funds will be placed into a new fund, the Low Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund
(LMIHAF). The LMIHAF was created following the dissolution of Redevelopment and is
administered by the Housing Authority. Redevelop Set-Aside loan repayments will be placed
in this fund. Also 20% of the repayment of the City loan to the Redevelopment Agency
before it was dissolved will be received by the Successor Agency and will then be placed in
the LMIHAF. Funds are to be used for monitoring and preservation of existing affordable
housing developments and for new affordable housing developments for low income
households as outlined in State law.
                                                                 Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                 Page 15 of 25

5.4.2 Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME)
The City’s 2012-2013 fiscal year funding through the HOME program was $1.03 million. The
HOME Program is administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD). The HOME Program provides formula grants to states and local governments to fund
projects that build, buy, and/or rehabilitate affordable housing for rent or home ownership or
provide direct rental assistance to lower income persons.
5.4.3 HUD Section 8 Program
The Federal Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program provides rental subsidies for eligible
tenant families. These subsidies are provided to property owners on behalf of families that
are eligible low income families at the time of their admission by the project owners to the
program. Lower income families include those families whose annual incomes do not exceed
80 percent of the median income for the area in which the project is located, adjusted for
family size, as determined by HUD at least annually.
5.4.4 Emergency Solutions Grant Program
The City receives funding through the federal Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) program. In
the 2012-13 fiscal year, funding from the ESG program was $255,394. The ESG provides
formula funding to entitlement jurisdictions for a broad range of eligible activities. These
activities include conversion, renovation, and rehabilitation of buildings to be used as
emergency shelters; operation of facilities; delivery of essential services; and homelessness
prevention. ESG funding facilitates the ability of service providers to expand available
emergency shelter capacity in order to broaden the range of services available to clients. A
wide variety of agencies and organizations may receive ESG funding to support delivery of
services for clients who are either homeless or at risk of losing their permanent housing.
Grantees, such as the City, are authorized to reallocate funds to either government or
nonprofit agencies that may deliver services directly.
5.4.5 Supportive Housing Program
The Supportive Housing Program (SHP) program is authorized by the McKinney-Vento
Homeless Assistance Act, as amended by The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid
Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009, and administered by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. SHP funds are awarded annually on a competitive basis,
with priority given to new programs or expansions which fill a gap in a local jurisdiction’s
continuum of care for the homeless and to the renewal of previously funded projects that
have demonstrated effectiveness. There are a number of eligible activities: acquisitions and
rehabilitation, real property leasing, transitional housing, permanent supportive housing and
supportive services not attached to housing. Supportive services not attached to housing
must, however, work to link homeless persons to housing. Agencies receiving funds must
provide a dollar for dollar match for funding for acquisition and rehabilitation, and partial
match for funds earmarked for the operation of housing and supportive services. Funding for
new programs is awarded for an initial period of up to one year, with the possibility of
renewal.
                                                                   Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                   Page 16 of 25

5.4.6 Shelter Plus Care Program
Also authorized by the McKinney-Vento Act (and amended by the HEARTH Act), and
administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is the Shelter Plus
Care (S+C) Program. Like SHP, S+C is awarded on a competitive basis. S+C provides
ongoing rental assistance to homeless individuals and families who are disabled, with an
emphasis on persons who are disabled as a result of substance abuse and/or mental health
issues, and HIV/AIDS. Participants are required to pay 30 percent of their income for rent
and participate in ongoing intensive case management and supportive services. HUD pays
for the additional rental costs while the supportive service component is furnished by the
local jurisdiction as a required dollar for dollar match.
5.4.7 Community Development Block Grant Program
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) monies can be applied towards housing
programs. Due to the other financial sources available to the City and limited funding for
public services and facilities typically funded by CDBG, CDBG funds are no longer used for
housing.
5.5 OTHER GOVERNMENTAL & NON-PROFIT AGENCY RESOURCES
This section is intended to serve as a resource for governmental and non-profit organizations
when assistance or advice is needed on housing projects. These organizations can provide
examples of projects/activities, expertise, and referrals to other sources of housing
assistance.

5.6      ANALYSIS OF ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
Establishment and enforcement of energy and water conservation standards and continuing
programs aimed at efficiency awareness are key factors in reducing energy and water
consumption. In addition to required compliance with the Building Code and Title 24 of the
California Code of Regulations (C.C.R.) relating to energy conservation, the City sets forth
goals and policies which encourage the conservation of nonrenewable resources in concert
with the use of alternative energy sources to increase energy self-sufficiency. Glendale also
complies with Plumbing Code requirements that have incorporated many water conservation
measures. Some conservation measures require a higher up-front cost, but result in net
savings over the life of the measures, from reduced energy and/or water consumption. In
large part, utility bill reductions through energy and water savings can be realized through
design incorporating energy conservation features. Energy conservation is, in effect, a
resource to enhance the affordability of dwelling units.
5.6.1 Investments in Energy Efficiency
                                                                 Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory

City of Glendale, California                   H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
The City of Glendale Department of Water and Power (GWP) has a strong commitment to
conserving fossil fuels for future generations as evidenced by significant investments in
energy efficiency and energy conservation programs. In 2004, the California Public Utilities
commission set a new energy saving target of 1 percent of total annual load starting in 2007
and continuing through 2014. According to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient
Economy, the programs in the best states at the time were delivering annual savings ranging
from about 0.1 percent to 0.8 percent of load. In Fiscal Year 2005-06, GWP energy savings
reached 0.77 percent of our five year average load, ranking Glendale among the best in the
country, and in line with the new targets set for California. GWP is currently working with the
Rocky Mountain Institute to inventory the energy efficiency assets available to GWP in
Glendale with an eye toward setting annual energy efficiency goals for the coming years.
Since 1999, GWP has embarked on an aggressive plan to develop and implement a wide
array of energy savings programs for all customer classes. Three GWP programs received
California Municipal Utility Association awards for innovation in energy efficiency program
development. Some program highlights include:
       Ranked 4th in total energy efficiency savings among 39 California publicly-owned
        utilities in FY 2005-06
       $2,903,160 invested in energy efficiency programs in FY 2005-06
       Over $20,000,000 invested since January 2000
       Incremental demand reductions of 2,282 kW in FY 2005-06
       Incremental coincident peak demand reductions of 1,500 kW in FY 2005-06
       Incremental energy savings of 8,463 MWh in FY 2005-06, enough to power 1,100
        single family homes for a year
       Incremental energy savings as a percent of GWP’s retail sales was 0.77 percent in FY
        2005-06
       Estimated cumulative demand reductions since January 2000 of over 12,000 kW
       Estimated cumulative energy savings since January 2000 of over 48,000 MWh,
        enough to power 6,200 single family homes for a year
5.6.2 Active Energy Efficiency Programs for Residents
Low-income Customer DSM Programs
GWP’s “Cool Care” program provides long-term electric bill discounts for low income
customers by encouraging the replacement and recycling of old, energy inefficient
refrigerators. The program has replaced and recycled 1,911 refrigerators with new ENERGY
STAR models since July, 2003. Cumulative annual demand and energy savings for
replacements to date are estimated at 103 kW and 1,322 MWh, respectively.
“Smart Home Peak Hogs” is GWP’s California Municipal Utility Association (CMUA) award
winning program that reduces peak demand while providing bill relief for primarily low-
income customers by encouraging the replacement of energy inefficient HVAC units in
apartments. Building owners can receive up to 50 percent back on the installation of a new
A/C unit. Since July 2003, this program replaced 1,297 tons of energy inefficient Peak Hogs
                                                                  Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory

in Glendale apartments.       Cumulative annual demand and energy savings for these
replacements are estimated at 366 kW and 808 MWh, respectively.
General Residential DSM Programs
“Smart Home Energy and Water Saving Surveys” reduces customer energy consumption
through comprehensive in-home energy and water saving surveys, education, and direct
measures installation. Installed energy saving measures includes compact fluorescent lights,
hot water heater wraps, and blower door tests. Since July 2001, this program provided over
6,415 audits and energy education sessions, installed over 14,667 compact fluorescent lights,
2,571 water heater blankets, and conducted 2,461 blower door tests. These installations are
producing estimated cumulative annual demand and energy savings of 1,397 kW and 4,517
MWh, respectively.
“Smart Home Energy and Water Saving Rebates” provides rebates to promote the early
retirement of approved energy and water saving appliances and devices. Over 19,100
rebates were processed since July 2001. This program is producing estimated cumulative
demand and energy savings of 2,331 kW and 4,375 MWh, respectively.
“Smart Home Solar Solutions” provides a $4.00 per watt incentive, up to 50 percent of the
installed cost, to promote grid-connected solar photovoltaic systems, plus 100 percent of the
customer cost for city permits. Systems are limited to a maximum 10 kW. This system
helped install 74 kW since September 2000. These installations are generating an estimated
208 MWh annually in clean, green power.
“LivingWise” provides funding to support participation in the LivingWise energy and water
conservation program at Glendale’s public and private schools. LivingWise provides ten
hours of intensive energy education, as well as installation of energy saving devices, and
including compact florescent light bulbs. Over 7,500 students participated in this program
since July 2001. This program is producing cumulative annual demand and energy savings
reaching 393 kW and 2,221 MWh, respectively.
“Tree Power” provides up to three free trees and arborist services to ensure that the trees
are planted correctly. When properly sited and cared for, a healthy, mature shade tree helps
provide shade that cools the home and helps reduce air conditioning use. Approximately 700
trees were planted since July 2004. These trees are expected to produce cumulative annual
demand and energy savings of 40 kW and 291 MWh, respectively.

U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED® Progams and Services
According to their website (www.usgbc.org), the USGBC “is the nation’s leading nonprofit
organization composed of corporations, builders, universities, government agencies, and
other nonprofit organization working together to promote building that are environmentally
responsible, profitable and healthy places to live and work.” Established in 1993, the Council
consists of more than 13,000 member companies and organizations. It offers LEED®
programs and services, hosts the industry’s Greenbuild International Conference and Expo
                                                                  Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory

(www.greenbuildexpo.org), and has a network of local chapters, affiliates, and organizing
groups. The vision of the USGBC “is a sustainable built environment within a generation.”
LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)
In order to implement the USGBC vision, the LEED® Green Building Rating System™ was
created.      It provides a benchmark for the design, construction and operation of high
performance green buildings by giving buildings points for meeting specified green building
criteria. There are six performance categories that are reviewed in order to promote a
whole-building approach to sustainability:
         Sustainable Site Development
         Water Efficiency
         Energy and Atmosphere
         Materials and Resources
         Indoor Environmental Quality
         Innovation and Design
There are four levels of progressive certification based on the total number of points earned
within each of the LEED categories noted above, as follow (“Certified” certification being the
minimum level and “Platinum” being the highest level of certification):
        Certified
        Silver
        Gold
        Platinum
LEED certifications can be given to all building types, commercial interiors, core & shell
developments, existing buildings, homes, neighborhood developments, schools and retail
facilities. LEED for Healthcare is currently being developed and is expected to be available
for use in early 2008. Incentives for LEED are offered at the state and local level. More
information can be found at www.usgbc.org/LEED.
Glazing
Energy efficient window glazing resists heat flow. The strategic placement of such windows
can reduce energy consumption for more efficient interior climate control. Glazed windows
on south-facing walls allow for passive solar heating by allowing direct sunlight to enter a
room and warm the space. Because the windows minimize heat flow, this warmth remains in
the building. The sun is higher in the sky during the summer. Therefore, less direct sunlight
enters the building during these months than in winter. Also, during winter weather, the
glazing minimizes the amount of heat that is transferred directly through the window to the
cooler air outside. Typically, avoidance of window placement on the west side of a building
will minimize the overheating effects of direct afternoon sun.
Landscaping
Strategically placed vegetation can help regulate the amount of direct sunlight on windows,
as well as reduce indirect heating from concrete and other hardscape materials. The
incorporation of deciduous trees and vines in landscaping plans along the south and west
                                                                  Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                  Page 22 of 25

City of Glendale, California                   H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
facing sides of buildings can buffer the heating effects of direct sun light in summer, while
allowing winter sun light to warm the building. The use of native or low-water use plants and
efficient irrigation, such as drip systems, can minimize water needs for outside landscaping.
Time clocks with multiple stations can offer options for varying water needs.
Building Design
There are several variables in the design of a residential building that can affect the energy
efficiency of the structure. The building orientation, placement and specification of windows,
and design of details, such as exterior overhead structures and roof overhangs, can affect the
passive solar performance of a building. These measures reduce the need for energy-
consuming heating and cooling system use. The installation of over-head structures such as
eaves, arbors and roof overhangs can reduce the amount of direct sunlight that passes
through windows, thus preventing overheating. An arbor directly above a south-facing
window can limit solar access in the summer and allow for passive heating in winter when
combined with deciduous vines.
Additional techniques for building design include the use of light colors for exterior paint to
reflect heat away from the building. Interior use of light colors for interior design reduces
lighting needs. GWP personnel are available to assist in energy efficient building design
upon request.
Cooling/Heating Systems
There are several energy-saving alternatives to using traditional energy sources for cooling
and heating systems that can reduce the cost of housing. Attic ventilation systems allow
rising heat to escape the building. This type of system, such as a whole-house fan, can create
an air circulation pattern that encourages the movement of cooler air to circulate through a
building with the use of traditional energy sources. Solar heating systems for swimming pool
facilities reduce energy costs. Hot water solar panels can provide solar-heated domestic
water with minimal use of natural gas or electricity. Additional energy consumption can be
reduced with the use of flow restrictors on all hot water faucets and showerheads.
Weatherization Techniques
Weatherization techniques such as insulation, caulking, and weather-stripping can reduce
energy use for air-conditioning up to 55 percent and for heating as much as 40 percent.
These techniques help to seal a dwelling unit to guard against heat gain in the summer and
prevent heat loss in the winter. Other comfort benefits include noise and dust reduction.
Efficient Use of Appliances
Most households contain a variety of appliances. Regardless of the types present, appliances
can be used in ways which increase their energy efficiency. Eliminating unnecessary
appliances and proper maintenance and use of the stoves, ovens, clothes dryers, clothes
washers, dishwashers, refrigerators, and other major appliances will keep energy costs to a
minimum. New appliance purchases of all major energy appliances should be made on the
basis of efficiency ratings. Each major appliance now carries an Energy Guide Label that
indicates its average annual energy usage. The label also compares that model’s usage to
other models of the same size. In addition, there are many state and federal sanctioned
websites with information regarding the most efficient appliances available on the market.
Efficient Use of Lighting
                                                                   Chapter 5 – Resource Inventory
                                                                                   Page 23 of 25

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Costs of lighting a home can be reduced through purchase of efficient light bulbs that
produce the most lumens per watt. New fluorescent bulb fixtures can greatly improve
lighting levels while reducing energy costs. Compact fluorescent bulbs replace existing
incandescent bulbs in average fixtures. These compact fluorescent bulbs are 10 times more
efficient and last longer than regular incandescent bulbs. Time clocks, photocell sensors, and
motion sensors for security lights and areas where lights might be left on otherwise can make
a significant reduction in lighting usage.
Load Management
The time of day when power is used can be as important as how much power is used. Power
plants must have enough generating capacity to meet the highest level of consumer demand
for electricity. Peak demands for electricity occur on summer afternoons and coincide with
higher costs for electric generation. Therefore, reducing use of appliances during these peak
load hours can reduce the need for new power plants just to meet unusually high power
demands and will reduce overall energy costs.
Glendale Water & Power (GWP), as the municipally owned utility for Glendale, offers special
Time-Of-Use rates for its customers to allow the customer to take advantage of lower costs
during off-peak hours.
Renewable Energy Development
GWP has a long history of supporting renewable energy. In 1937, Glendale became one of
the first California cities to contract with the Federal Government to purchase hydropower
from Hoover Dam, and has been generating electricity using landfill gas from Scholl Canyon
since 1994.
More recently, GWP has made long term investments in wind and geothermal generation
resources. To show continued commitment to renewable resource development GWP
adopted a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) in 2004. The GWP RPS recognizes the intent
of the Californian Legislature to encourage renewable resources, while taking into
consideration the effect on rates, reliability, financial resources, and the goal of environmental
improvement. The new GWP RPS sets an initial goal of 20 percent of its annual energy
requirements from renewable energy sources by 2017, with the additional goal of 23 percent
if it can be reached at reasonable cost.
As of May 2007, GWP provided approximately 16 percent of its energy requirements from
renewable resources on an annual basis as follows:

In addition, GWP is nearing completion of building a 261 KW solar photovoltaic generating
system on top of the new parking garage being constructed at Glendale Community College.
This will supply the campus with an average annual 390,000 KW hours of electricity for the
next 50 years. Last year, the City Council approved an 18-year agreement with an Oregon
facility to purchase 20 megawatts of wind-generated energy. With current projects
underway, it is expected that GWP’s renewable energy portfolio will shortly surpass the 20
percent goal.

CHAPTER 6 – CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING
There are several barriers which could limit new
housing development in Glendale. These
constraints, which relate to governmental,
environmental, infrastructure, and market variables
are discussed below.
6.1 GOVERNMENTAL
6.1.1 Land Use Controls/Land Use Compatibility
The Land Use Element of the General Plan and
corresponding zoning provide for a full range of
residential    types   and      densities   dispersed
throughout the City. Densities range from 0.45
units per acre on steep, mountainous terrain; up to
35 units per acre in areas designated for High
Density Residential; and up to 100 units per acre in
the      Downtown         Specific       Plan     and
Commercial/Residential Mixed Use Zones. Density bonus provisions for lot width and
affordability provide additional opportunities for increased residential densities.
Development standards are shown in Exhibits 6-1, 6-2, and 6-3 below. Standards, such as
setbacks, height limits, floor area ratios, and landscaping requirements, vary depending on
the particular zoning district.
As indicated in Exhibit 5-1, an estimated 4,417-5,107 new residential dwelling units could be
developed in the residential districts under “build-out” of the Land Use Element. The
commercial zones of the City are estimated to accommodate an additional several hundred
dwelling units. The mixed use zones, including the Downtown Specific Plan, Town Center
Specific Plan, and Commercial/Residential Mixed Use Zones, have the capacity for
approximately 4,400 additional dwelling units. This is a total capacity of approximately
10,000 additional dwelling units under existing zoning regulations. Since the Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG) estimated a future housing need at 2,017 units
in the City during the planning period of January 1, 2014 to June 30, 2021, it is apparent that
land use controls do not constrain the production of housing in the City of Glendale.

6.1.2 Housing Types, Supportive Services and Reasonable Accommodation
The City reviewed its zoning ordinance in order to clarify zoning definitions, standards,
and/or policies and to ensure that they do not violate federal and state fair housing laws or
violate state constitutional privacy rights with regard to housing and supportive services for
persons with disabilities and other special needs populations. In addition, in an effort to
minimize constraints and allow greater flexibility in the types of residential uses the City of
Glendale simplified its housing types. Having fewer, but broader, housing categories in the
zoning use charts provides the advantage of improving clarity and predictability to the way
                                                                       Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                           Page 6 of 30

City of Glendale, California                       H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
zoning is applied to housing uses. Fewer housing categories will allow greater flexibility for
zoning to accommodate new housing types and supportive services as the market changes.
Based on the 2006-2014 Housing Element (HE) Programs and the 2011-2016 Analysis of
Impediments (AI) to Fair Housing Choice, the City modified its zoning definitions as follows.
These are further described in Chapter 3 which outlines how programs in our previous
element were implemented.
Housing definitions were combined into five primary residential categories for purposes of
zoning:
      Dwelling, One Residential
      Dwelling, Multiple Residential
      Residential Congregate Living Limited (6 or fewer individuals)
      Residential Congregate Living, Non-Medical (7 or more individuals)
      Residential Congregate Living, Medical (7 or more individuals)
Both the Housing Element and Analysis of Impediments raised concerns that Glendale’s
zoning needs flexibility to allow existing residents to stay in their homes should they become
disabled. Of particular concern to disability advocates is that residents, including those in
apartments and condominiums, may need on-site assistance such as nursing care in order to
maintain independent living. Glendale’s current practice of allowing on-site services limited
to residents to occur in residential zones (HE Program 5g, AI Impediment #7) was clarified as
follow (noted in bold and italics):
Dwelling, One Residential. “Dwelling, one (1) residential” means a detached building
designed exclusively for occupancy by one (1) household. On-site support services personnel
and equipment to maintain independent living is limited to residents of the dwelling.
Dwelling, Multiple Residential. “Dwelling, multiple residential” means a building or portion
thereof designed for occupancy by two (2) or more persons or households living
independently of each other in separate units. Includes apartments, townhouses, or similar
buildings. On-site support services personnel and equipment to maintain independent living
is limited to residents of the dwelling.
The Housing Element and Analysis of Impediments raised concerns with definitions centering
on residential congregate care and residential congregate care, limited. In 2006, the City of
Glendale added definitions of “residential congregate care” and “residential congregate
care, limited” to the zoning code. The following four concerns summarize the concerns
identified in the HE and AI (HE Program 6b and AI Impediment #7).
1) The broad definition for residential congregate care may conflict with other Glendale
     zoning code definitions for one residential dwelling and boarding or lodging house,
     because single residential dwellings, residential congregate care, limited facilities, and
     boarding houses all may serve six or fewer residents, may have congregate eating
     facilities or a single kitchen, and residents may or may not pay compensation. Residential
     congregate care, limited facilities are generally found in traditional single family homes of
     up to six persons where residents typically live as a single housekeeping unit.
                                                                     Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                         Page 7 of 30

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
2) Disability advocates are concerned that, absent a definition of “family”, unrelated
    individuals living together might be seen as “residential congregate care”, which is
    currently not allowed in the R1, R1R and ROS zones. The HE and AI direct Glendale to
    include a definition of “family” in the zoning code.
3) Congregate care facilities, limited are typically located in single family homes in residential
    zones. State law requires that residential congregate care facilities licensed or not, be
    subject to the same standards as other similar uses. Requirements for congregate care
    facilities to be licensed and subject to CUP where other residential uses do not have that
    requirement may be inconsistent with the intent of state law and pose a housing
    constraint for persons with disabilities who may live in larger households in traditional
    single-family homes.
4) Residential congregate care, limited is a residential use and there is some concern with
    the use of the term “facility” which connotes an institutional use in relation to residential
    congregate care, limited.
Amendments were made to simplify housing categories in the Permitted Use Charts, along
with modifications to zoning definitions, and allow Glendale to comply with State housing
Law. Such simplifications help ensure consistency and predictability in describing housing
types and in zoning implementation. The following three definitions were included in zone
changes for the Medical Service (MS) Zone definitions and were extended to the Residential,
Commercial, Industrial and Mixed Use Permitted Use Charts. The following three definitions
describe “group” residential accommodations:
“Residential Congregate Living, Limited. “Residential Congregate Living, Limited” means a
dwelling including a common eating area, with or without on-site assistance with activities of
daily living, limited to six (6) or fewer individuals or one household. Residential Congregate
Living, Limited includes assisted living centers; boarding or lodging houses; residential
congregate care facilities, limited; retirement and rest homes; supportive housing; and
transitional housing.
Residential Congregate Living, Medical. “Residential Congregate Living, Medical” means a
residential use with or without private kitchens and including a common eating area, with or
without on-site assistance with activities of daily living and on-site assistance with counseling
or medical care, and with seven (7) or more beds. Residential Congregate Living, Medical
includes convalescent homes, extended care, skilled nursing facilities.
Residential Congregate Living, Non-medical. “Residential Congregate Living, Non-medical”
means a residential use with or without private kitchens and including a common eating area,
with or without on-site assistance with activities of daily living, and with seven (7) or more
individuals. Residential Congregate Living, Non-medical includes assisted living centers;
dormitories; fraternities or sororities; residential congregate care facilities; retirement and
rest homes; supportive housing and transitional housing. This use does not include hotels or
motels which are defined separately.”
                                                                     Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                        Page 8 of 30

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Glendale does not define dwellings in relation to families. Glendale eliminated its definition
of family years ago so as not to infringe on people’s civil rights. Disability advocates’
concerns that the lack of a definition of “family” would mean that the City would attempt to
limit unrelated individuals living in a single dwelling are unfounded. Staff could not find any
cases in Glendale where a limited definition of “family” was used against residents at a site.
Therefore, a general definition of “family” was not added to the Zoning Code (Program 6b).
Instead, the definition of residential congregate living facilities includes state requirements
for residential congregate care facilities and one household, which is consistent with state law
and avoids infringing on civil rights to live in a household of ones choosing.
The Analysis of Impediments directed that the City add a definition of “disability” or
“handicap” to the Zoning Code that is consistent with the Federal Fair Housing Act (FFHA)
definition. The following definition was added to the Zoning Code:
“Disability. “Disability” means a disability or handicap as defined by the Federal Fair Housing
Act (FFHA). Federal laws define any person with a disability as “Any person who has a
physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a
record of such impairment; or is regarded as having such impairment.”
Glendale permits single room occupancy facilities; however, they were not expressly included
in the Zoning Code. The following amendment (noted in bold and italics) was made to
reference “single-room occupancy” (SRO) in the zoning code definition for motel and hotel.
(Program 5g, Impediment #3)
“Hotel or motel. “Hotel or motel” means a building in which there are six (6) or more guest
rooms where lodging with or without meals is provided for compensation, and where no
provision is made for cooking in any individual room or suite. Single-room occupancy (SRO)
facilities are included within this definition.”
The Housing Element and Analysis of Impediments directed the City to add definitions for
transitional housing or supportive housing (Compliance with SB 2, AI Impediments #3, #7).
City definitions of housing programs were to clarify that transitional and supportive housing
are residential uses, and only subject to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses
of the same type in the same zone. The following definitions for senior housing, supportive
housing, target population and transitional housing were included the permitted use charts
under the categories of residential congregate living, limited and residential congregate
living, non-medical:
Senior housing: A development consisting of dwelling units in which each unit is restricted
for occupancy by at least one person in each household who is sixty-two (62) years of age or
older, or fifty-five (55) years or older if the development consists of thirty-five (35) units or
more. Senior housing developments are permitted in multi-family residential (R-3050, R-2250,
R-1650 and R-1250) zones, in commercial (C1, C2, C3, CH, CR) zones provided the ground
floor level is occupied by commercial uses, and in the mixed use SFMU Zone as part of a
mixed use project. Ground floor level senior housing development is conditionally permitted
in commercial (C1, C2, C3, CH, CR) zones and in the IMU-R Zone.
                                                                      Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                         Page 9 of 30

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
“Supportive Housing. “Supportive Housing” means a residential use with no limit on length
of stay, that is occupied by a target population as defined in Health and Safety Code Section
53260(d), and that is linked to onsite or offsite support services that assist the resident in
retaining housing, living independently, working in the community and improving his or her
health status. No services are provided to nonresidents unless otherwise permitted by this
Title.”
“Target Population. "Target population" means persons with Low Income having one or
more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic
health conditions, or individuals eligible for services provided under the Lanterman
Developmental Disabilities Services Act (California Welfare and Institutions Code, section
4500 et seq.) and may include, among other populations, adults, emancipated youth, families,
families with children, elderly persons, young adults aging out of the foster care system,
individuals exiting from institutional settings, veterans, and homeless people.”
“Transitional Housing. “Transitional Housing” means a residential use operated under
program requirements that call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the
assisted unit(s) to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined future point in
time, which shall be no less than six months. No services are provided to nonresidents unless
otherwise permitted by this Title. “
Reasonable Accommodation
In addition to the above housing types and supportive services, the City of Glendale adopted
a reasonable accommodation ordinance in 2010, which added Chapter 30.52 – Reasonable
Accommodation to Glendale Municipal Code. The purpose of this ordinance was to establish
a formal procedure for an individual with a disability, or developers of housing for individuals
with disabilities, to seek reasonable accommodation in rules, policies, practices and
procedures to ensure equal access to housing and to facilitate the development of housing
for individuals with disabilities as provided by the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of
1988 and California's Fair Employment and Housing Act, herein known as the "Acts".
Reasonable accommodation means providing an individual with a disability, or developers of
housing for individuals with disabilities, flexibility in the application of land use and zoning
regulations or policies, including the modification or waiver of certain requirements, when
necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.
State Employee Housing Act
Glendale complies with the State Employee Housing Act, specifically Health and Safety Code
Sections 17021.5 and 17021.6.). It treats employee housing that serves six or fewer persons
as dwelling, one unit or as residential congregate living, limited and both of these uses are
considered single-family uses and are permitted in the same manner as other single family
structures of the same type and in the same zones. Dwelling, one unit and residential
congregate living, limited, are permitted in all residential zones by right and subject to the
same development standards.
6.1.3 Other Changes Made to the Zoning Use Charts
In addition to the definitions proposed above, the Housing Element made two other
programs changes affecting the Permitted Use Charts in the zoning code as follow:
                                                                    Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                      Page 10 of 30

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Program 5e Zoning Compliance with California Welfare & Institutions Code Section 5120
Provisions of the California Welfare & Institutions Code Section 5120 mandate that in any
zone in which hospitals or nursing homes are permitted, mental health treatment programs,
either residential or non-residential, are permitted (Program 5e, Impediment #7).
Hospitals were permitted uses in the C3, CH, IMU, IMU-R, SFMU and MS zones. Residential
mental health treatment programs and nursing homes fell under the zoning category of
residential congregate living, medical. Residential congregate living, medical was permitted
in the C1, C2, C3, CH and MS zone. Facilities that offered mental health treatment programs
fell under the zoning category of medical offices and were permitted in all commercial and
mixed use zones. To meet the zoning requirements for California Welfare & Institutions Code
Section 5120, the permitted locations where residential congregate living and medical
(including residential mental health treatment programs) uses were modified. Since all
hospitals in Glendale are located in either the C3 zone or MS Zone, hospitals were eliminated
as permitted uses in the CH, IMU, IMU-R and SFMU zones. This change had no impact upon
existing hospitals and complies with state law.
Program 5f. Zoning for Compliance with SB 2
In addition to adding definitions for transitional and supportive housing, State law requires
that transitional and supportive housing be subject only to those restrictions that apply to
other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. To comply with SB2, Glendale
removed the conditional use permit requirement for emergency shelters within 300-feet from
a residential zone, so that all emergency shelters in the IND zone will be permitted uses. This
change is shown on the Permitted Use Charts and will have no impact upon existing
emergency shelters.
Parking
Parking requirements vary by the type of housing development. By consolidating the number
of housing types, parking requirements were able to be simplified to match anticipated
parking needs.
Residential Congregate Living, Limited
The parking requirement of 2 parking spaces was adopted for Residential Congregate Living,
Limited facilities, which is the typical parking requirement for these existing uses and for
single-family residences. Residential Congregate Living, Limited facilities are often referred
to as small group homes and the State considers these facilities with six or fewer residents to
be single-family uses. The State licenses these types of facilities directly, and no City
approval is needed. Residential Congregate Care, Limited facilities were required to have
one parking space per three residents. Since the number of residents is limited to six or
fewer persons, the typical Residential Congregate Care, Limited facility has a parking
requirement of two spaces per facility. Residential Congregate Care, Limited facilities (6 or
fewer residents) are typically located in single-family dwellings where a minimum of 2 parking
spaces is already required. Retirement, rest homes, convalescent and extended care facilities
have parking requirements of one space per four beds. Likewise, when limited to facilities of
6 or fewer persons, the parking requirement is currently two spaces for these facilities.
                                                                    Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                      Page 11 of 30

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Residential Congregate Living, Non-medical
Residential Congregate Living facilities (7 or more residents) are limited to non-medical uses.
A common parking requirement was adopted based on the number of residents, rather than
the number of beds (as is typical for facilities providing medical support). In the zoning code,
a key component of the definition of a dwelling unit is that the unit has its own kitchen
facilities. Individual units with kitchens are not part of the make-up of a typical Residential
Congregate Living Facility no matter how many patients are being served. The term “unit”
cannot be used in conjunction with a Residential Congregate Facility. However, since these
are non-medical uses, the parking requirement was adopted to use the same parking ratios of
1 space for every 3 residents, the same ratio used for Assisted Living Facilities.
Residential Congregate Care Living, Medical
As a residential use with a medical component, the parking was based upon the number of
beds. The adopted parking requirement is the same as for convalescent and extended care
homes of one (1) parking space per 4 beds. These facilities generally have no individual
kitchens, so having a parking requirement based upon beds reflects past practice.
The following housing definitions remain in the Zoning Code and have not been changed
since the last Housing Element.
Farm Worker Housing: According to the 2000 Census, there are approximately 118 people
employed in the “farming, fishing and forestry industries.” This represents less than 1/100th
of the City’s population. The City of Glendale has no land zoned for agricultural uses.
Furthermore, Glendale is unaware of any agricultural uses in Burbank, La Canada-Flintridge,
or in portions of unincorporated Los Angeles County or the City of Los Angeles immediately
surrounding Glendale in which farming, fishing or forestry industry is practiced which could
necessitate the need for farm worker housing in Glendale. Therefore, the City has not
identified a need for farm worker housing and such use is not identified in the Zoning Code.
Live/Work: A live/work unit is an integrated dwelling unit and working space, occupied and
utilized by a single housekeeping unit in a structure that has been modified or designed to
accommodate joint residential occupancy and work activity, and which includes complete
kitchen and sanitary facilities in compliance with applicable building standards and working
space reserved for and regularly used by one or more occupants of the unit, in addition to
any other employees. The commercial use must be one permitted by the applicable land use
tables. Live/work residential units are permitted by right in the mixed-use SFMU zone and
above the first floor on lots having frontage on San Fernando Road, Broadway and Colorado
Street, conditionally permitted in the IMU and IMU-R zones. In industrial areas, they are
conditionally permitted in the IND Zone.
Mixed-Use Development: Projects that have both residential and commercial land uses are
permitted by right on certain properties in the Commercial/Residential Mixed Use (SFMU)
Zone and in the commercial (C1, C2, C3, and CR) zones provided that the ground floor is
occupied with permitted commercial uses. Projects with residential on the ground floor are
conditionally permitted in the C1, C2, C3 and IMU-R zones.
Mobile Homes and Manufactured Homes: Mobile homes and manufactured homes are
permitted subject to the same zoning restrictions as single family residences. The City of
Glendale has no mobile home parks and mobile home parks are not permitted in the City.
                                                                    Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints

Second Units and Guest Houses: Sections 65852.1, 65852.150 and 65852.2 of the
Government Code provide that a city may issue a zoning variance, special use permit or
conditional use permit for a second dwelling unit in a single family zone with certain
limitations. In Glendale, there are many single family homes already on properties zoned to
allow more than one unit.
Although guest houses have been and continue to be allowed, the concept of second units
tends to contradict the traditional view that single family zoning in the City is to provide an
area where each family has its own distinctive property on which to conduct its affairs without
sharing it with others. In 1996, the Glendale City Council examined the issue and enacted
Ordinance No. 5120 prohibiting “second dwelling units ... as referenced in the Government
Code” in all residential zones. In enacting this Ordinance, the City made several findings in
support of the action. Many of the City’s residential streets are in hillside areas and are too
narrow, steep and curving to support additional dwellings. Many of these hillside residential
areas are also subject to high fire danger and adding residences in these areas would
compromise the safety of the neighborhood. Because of the steep terrain, adding residences
to lots in these areas would require substantial amounts of grading that would create visual
impacts, increased potential for earth slides/slumps, and removal of native oak and sycamore.
Many streets in hillside residential areas have street lengths that exceed the standard in the
Municipal Code; adding second units into such neighborhoods would expose additional
people to an increased level of danger during an emergency situation. Many of the hillside
neighborhoods are in fault hazard zones; adding residences would place more people and
buildings at greater hazard during earthquakes. The City is deficient in many areas in schools,
parks, sewer systems, etc. and cannot readily handle additional residences in these
neighborhoods. The City experienced rapid housing and population growth in the 1980’s,
and allowing second units would undermine current efforts to manage that growth. If second
units were allowed in the southern areas of the City, existing overcrowding and other
negative quality of life factors would further deteriorate. Allowing second units could also
increase the number of absentee landlords in the City which the City has determined is
associated with the physical deterioration of residential properties. Homeowners who desire
a second unit have the option to select such a property when they are deciding where to buy.
Guest houses and guest bedrooms have always been allowed in Glendale to accommodate
elderly relatives or friends who need the support of a family environment. The City places
the following constraints on guest houses: 1) they are limited to 500 square feet of floor area;
2) they cannot contain kitchen facilities; and 3) they cannot be rented. The City has
determined that these limitations are appropriate and although they represent a minor
constraint on the characteristics of housing in the City, they do not constrain the number of
second units which can be constructed. They also represent no significant constraint on the
number of units in general in the City since data from Chapter 5 and Exhibit 5-1 in particular
showed that there is ample development capacity in the City to meet our projected need. A
zoning variance procedure is available for processing of individual requests for second
dwelling units.
Single Family Residences: Single family homes are allowed in all residential zones (ROS, R1R,
R1, R-3050, R-2250, R-1650 and R-1250). No distinction is made in Glendale’s code between
stick-built and pre-fabricated manufactured housing. Pre-fabricated manufactured housing is
allowed in residential zones subject to the same regulations as apply to single family
residences.
                                                                  Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Religious quarters: A dwelling for clergy or staff of a place of worship. Places of worship are
permitted in the C1 (Neighborhood Commercial), C2 (Community Commercial), and C3
(Commercial Service) zones, and are conditionally permitted in all other zones other than the
IND (Industrial) zone, where they are not permitted.
6.1.4 Fees and Improvements
Various fees and assessments are charged by the City and other agencies to cover the costs
of processing permits and providing services and facilities, such as utilities, schools, and
infrastructure that are associated with building housing. Almost all of these fees are assessed
through a pro rata share system, based on the magnitude of the project’s impact or on the
extent of the benefit which will be derived.
The majority of the City is highly urbanized with most of its necessary infrastructure, such as
streets, sewers, electrical and water facilities already established. As a result, the cost of land
improvements in these areas is generally less than in undeveloped suburban or rural areas of
the City. New development is occasionally required to repair or install curb, gutter and
sidewalk; to install street lighting; fire hydrants and parkway landscaping. New subdivisions
with new streets are extremely rare in Glendale; such development will also have to build
streets to City standards. Based on the number of residential development applications
submitted over the past three to five years, especially since the City adopted more flexible
mixed use development standards, there is no evidence that City on or off-site improvement
requirements result in any significant constraint to development.
Past fee surveys conducted by the City have indicated that Glendale’s plan check and
building permit fees for residential development are in some cases substantially lower (10-20
percent) than those of the cities of Los Angeles, Burbank or Pasadena. Glendale fees,
therefore, do not appear to be unreasonable nor a significant constraint to development.
Exhibit 6-5 presents a list of typical development fees (as of August 2013) which would be
associated with a 45-unit, multifamily residential project on a one acre parcel. As this table
illustrates, the new Public Facilities Improvement fee represents the largest single
development fee, accounting for approximately 40 percent of the total. School fees
(established by the State and which the City has no authority to amend) account for
approximately 27 percent of the total. Other significant costs include sewer connections,
electrical services, building permit fees, and plan checks and inspections. Of the fees listed in
Exhibit 6-5, water improvements, sewer connections, and electrical services are assessed on a
per unit basis. The total cost of development fees per unit is estimated to be $8,718. No
costs have been assumed for preparation of an environmental impact report (EIR) as
residential projects on flat land parcels typically require a less-lengthy negative declaration
pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.
                                                                    Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints

6.1.5 Building Codes and Enforcement
The City of Glendale Building Codes are based upon Title 24 of the California Code of
Regulations (CCR). Title 24 of the CCR is comprised of amended versions of the International
Building Code, International Fire Code, Uniform Plumbing Code, National Electric Code,
Uniform Mechanical Code, and various other state mandated statutes. These codes are
considered to be the minimum necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare.
The local enforcement of these codes does not add significantly to the cost of housing.
6.1.6 Local Processing and Permit Procedures
The evaluation and review process required by City procedures contributes to the cost of
housing. The holding costs incurred by developers during this process are ultimately
reflected in the unit selling price.
                                                                                         Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints

City of Glendale, California                       H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
The review process for discretionary projects in Glendale is governed by several separate
decision-making bodies: City Council, Planning Commission, Design Review Board (DRB),
Planning Hearing Officer and (on rare occasions) the Environmental and Planning Board (EPB).
Depending on the project, some or all of these groups may review a project. Exhibit 6-7 lists
the approximate time needed for different stages in the project review process. Project
processing begins with the submittal of plans to the City for appropriate review. Projects
requiring discretionary review, such as a conditional use permit, variance, map, or design
review, are submitted to the Permit Services Center. Average processing time for a new
residential project subject to only plan check and DRB review is two to three months, with an
added two months for those projects also subject to Planning Commission and City Council
approval (e.g. subdivisions, change of zone, general plan amendment, etc.). While this review
period compares favorably with other Southern California cities, project review time can be
significantly lengthened if a project involves a hillside subdivision, variance or conditional use
permit. In order to minimize project holding costs, Housing Element policies call for
continued monitoring of departmental processing procedures to determine their impact on
the ultimate cost of housing and to initiate appropriate changes to reduce costs.
Considerable effort has been expended by the City to establish a “one-stop” permit center in
order to provide improved customer service and to expedite the permitting process. The
City also has an express plan check process where plan check is performed on an overtime
basis, at the applicant’s request and expense, to decrease the duration of plan check while
maintaining a timely plan check schedule for all the other projects submitted to the City. The
Planning Department continues to review and amend procedures to process subdivisions and
other development applications. The City presently provides an administrative procedure for
the conversion of stock cooperatives to condominiums and allows the Planning Commission
to approve (subject to appeal) all condominium projects. More complex subdivisions are still
required to be considered by the City Council. An administrative exception process has been
established and greater administrative discretion has been given to staff in the administration
of the design review process. Furthermore, recent changes to the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) guidelines have further streamlined the processing of minor projects in
urban areas. These amended procedures have decreased the processing time for many
development applications. In addition, the Planning Department conducts a yearly review to
ensure that our fees are appropriate.

6.1.7 City Zoning Regulations as a Housing Constraint – Sample Projects
In order to determine whether existing City Zoning regulations were a significant constraint
on housing, staff randomly selected 50 residential development projects that were approved
by the City and which represent all four multi-family zones. These projects are located
throughout the City and are shown in Appendix B. The five projects which did not receive
the maximum density did not request it for unknown reasons. Of the 45 projects which
achieved the maximum allowable density in the particular zone, five were given variances
from height and/or setback standards in order to achieve density permissible under the
zoning. One of these projects was granted a variance because the lot was nine square feet
short of the necessary area. Since 80 percent of the projects evaluated were able to achieve
the maximum density without variances and all of the projects that requested variances to
achieve the maximum density allowable under the zone were granted it, it is apparent that
the City’s regulations do not pose a significant constraint on the quantity of housing
produced in the City.
In the R-3050 Zone, one unit is permitted for each 3050 square feet of lot area. In the 50
project random survey, eight projects in the R-3050 zone were reviewed. Five of these
projects were approved for maximum density without the need for variances. Two were
given variances to allow residential uses on the ground floor (2625 Hermosa and 2631
Hermosa). One was given a variance for lot size (9 square feet short) to allow maximum
density similar to other duplexes in the neighborhood (545 E Palm Dr) Therefore, the zoning
requirements for setbacks, parking, height, etc… allow for development to meet the
maximum density and do not pose a constraint to housing development. Furthermore, in
terms of adequate sites analysis, the development of additional units in the R-3050 zones
demonstrates that developers will tear down one or two units in order to add an additional
unit.
In the R-2250 Zone, one unit is permitted for each 2,250 square feet of lot area. Fifteen
multi-family residential developments were included in the random sample of 50 projects
reviewed for zoning consistency. Of these 15 projects, 13 were approved for the maximum
                                                                                     Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                                          Page 17 of 30

City of Glendale, California                  H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
density, although two required variances. One development did not achieve the maximum
density (2 units below maximum) due to its unique location adjacent to a freeway onramp in
which additional setback was required to meet noise and parking standards (4201
Pennsylvania).      For the two projects with variances, theses were granted to meet the
maximum density (1123-1127 Raymond) and for a variety of variances including setbacks and
parking (124 W Colorado/524 E Elk) due to site characteristics at a freeway off ramp. Eighty
percent of the projects in the R-2250 Zone were able to meet the development standards
without the need for standards deviation, and in over ninety percent of the projects in this
zone were approved at or over the maximum base density for this zone. Therefore, the
zoning requirements for setbacks, parking, height, etc…allow for the development to meet
the maximum density and do not pose a constraint to housing development. Furthermore, in
terms of adequate sites analysis, the development of additional units in the R-2250 zones
demonstrates that developers will tear down units to add additional ones. For example, four
units were demolished to create seven new units (352 W Chevy Chase). Therefore the
justification for assuming that developers will tear down existing units to build new ones is
verified by actual example.
The R-2250 Zone permits developers additional density opportunities when lot widths are 90
feet or greater. Four projects in the R-2250 Zone took advantage of this provision and added
from one to four additional units above the base zoning permitted (522 E Palmer Ave, 337 W
Vine St, 1054 Western Ave and 623 South St.) by right.
In the R-1650 Zone, one unit is permitted for each 1650 square feet of lot area. Fourteen
multi-family residential developments were included in the random sample of 50 projects
reviewed for zoning consistency. Of these 14 projects, 13 were approved for the maximum
density and one (2745 Montrose Ave.) did not request it. None of the 13 projects that
received the maximum density requested variances or other entitlement approval beyond
design review. Therefore, over 90% of the projects in this zone were developed at or over
the maximum base density for this zone. The zoning standards for the R-1650 Zone,
therefore, do not pose a constraint to housing development in that the maximum zone can
be achieved except in exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, in terms of adequate sites
analysis, the development of additional units in the R-1650 Zones demonstrates that
developers will tear down units to add additional ones. For example, three units were
demolished to create five new units (705 E Palmer Ave.) Therefore the justification for
assuming that developers will tear down existing units to build new ones is verified by actual
example.
The R-1650 Zone permits developers additional density opportunities when lot widths are 90
feet or greater. Three projects in the R-1650 Zone took advantage of this provision and
added from one to five additional units above the base zoning permitted (430-436 W Wilson,
216 W Windsor and 2709 Piedmont) by right.
In the R-1250 Zone, one unit is permitted for each 1250 square feet of lot area. Thirteen
multi-family residential developments were included in the random sample of 50 projects
reviewed for zoning consistency. Of these 13 projects, 11 were approved for the maximum
density and two (341 W Glenoaks Ave and 1102 San Rafael Ave) did not request it. It is
unknown why two projects did not request the maximum number of units permitted under
the zone; however, no variance requests were filed requesting the additional density. None
of the 11 projects that received the maximum density requested variances or other
entitlement approval beyond design review. Therefore, 85% of the projects proposed in the
R-1250 zone were developed at or over the maximum base density for this zone. The zoning
                                                                Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                  Page 18 of 30

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
standards for the R-1250 Zone, therefore, do not pose a constraint to housing development
in that the maximum zone can be achieved. Furthermore, in terms of adequate sites analysis,
the development of additional units in the R-1250 Zones demonstrates that developers will
tear down units to add additional ones. For example, 5 units were demolished including one
single family residence and one 4-unit apartment building to create 12 new condominiums
(1304-1308 N. Central). Therefore the justification for assuming that developers will tear
down existing units, even multi-family apartments, to build new ones is verified by actual
example.
The R-1250 Zone permits developers additional density opportunities when lot widths are 90
feet or greater. Six projects in the R-1250 Zone took advantage of this provision and added
from one to seven additional units above the base zoning permitted by right.
6.1.8 Park, Library and Urban Art Impact Fees
Park and Library Fees
Pursuant to the Quimby Act (Section 66477 Government Code), “...the legislative body of a
city or county may, by ordinance, require the dedication of land or impose a requirement of
the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, for park or recreational
purposes as a condition to the approval of a tentative map or parcel map,” subject to certain
conditions. Following an extensive public outreach and hearing process, the City adopted
the “Public Use Facilities Impact Fees” on September 11, 2007. The fees took effect on
January 10, 2008. They are set at $3,500 per unit until January 10, 2011; $7,000 per unit from
January 11, 2011 to January 10, 2014; and $10,500 per unit beginning January 11, 2014. The
purpose of the fees is to support the development of additional park, recreational and library
facilities in the City that are needed to provide necessary services for new residential
projects. The fees also will help reduce the existing park land deficiency in the City.
Commercial and industrial projects will also be subject to the fee at a per-square-foot rate. If
a residential project includes affordable housing, fees are reduced. If at least twenty percent
of the units are affordable, the public facilities impact fees are waived entirely. The following
scale outlines other possible fee reductions:
        15% affordable              fee is 25% of the total
        10% affordable              fee is 50% of the total
        5% affordable               fee is 75% of the total
The City commissioned a report by the consulting firm of Keyser Marston in 2004. That
report evaluated the fees charged by various local cities for new development and found that
Glendale’s fees are comparable to the other cities; therefore, there’s no apparent constraint
on housing in Glendale relative to neighboring cities.
Urban Art Program
The Urban Art Program was initiated in 2006 with the adoption of the Downtown Specific
Plan (DSP). The Glendale City Council adopted ordinances to expand the program city-wide
in 2010 and the ordinance were effective January 14, 2011.
                                                                    Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                      Page 19 of 30

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
The Urban Art Program seeks to promote a diverse and stimulating cultural environment to
enrich the quality of life for residents and visitors. The Program applies to new buildings and
structures, or to the alteration or repair of buildings or structures valued at $500,000 or more
as determined by the Building Official. Projects located in the commercial and mixed-use
zones (specifically the DSP, IMU, IMU-R, SFMU, C1, C2, C3, CR, and CPD zoning districts) are
subject to the Program. The requirement does not apply to Industrial or Residential zones.
Development applications that did not receive a building permit prior to January 14, 2011 are
subject to the rules and regulations of this ordinance.
The Program provides the option to install the art on-site, or to make an in-lieu payment:
       On-site art equals 2 percent (2%) of the project value, or
       In-lieu payment equals 1 percent (1%) of the project value.
Urban Art Plans for the project site and buildings or structures are subject approval by the
applicable Design Review authority, upon recommendation from the Arts and Culture
Commission or other body designated by City Council. Urban Art Plans must be approved
before building permits can be issued, and shall provide for the installation of public art with
a value of at least two percent of the project valuation as determined by the Building Official.
The on-site art shall be installed in compliance with the Urban Art Plan before issuance of final
certificate of occupancy.
Urban Art requirements do not apply to the following:
       Projects financed with public funds,
       Small and/or affordable residential buildings and structures,
       Residential buildings or structures of 1 or 2 units, or residential buildings or structures
        serving those units with more than 25 percent of the units available to low- or
        moderate- income households
       Projects financed with development in-lieu fees,
       Capital Improvement projects,
       Projects involving Designated Historic Resources,
       Project involving nonprofit service providers (defined as 501(c)(3) under the IRS code),
        and
       Vehicle dealerships.
6.1.9 Business Fees
The City of Glendale has no fees for business licenses. The City does have a fee of $198.00
for zoning use certificates required for other than residential uses. Since zoning use
certificates are not needed for residential use, this is not considered to be a barrier to
housing.
                                                                     Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints

6.1.10 Inclusionary Housing Policy
The City adopted an Inclusionary Housing Policy on August 3, 2004. The Policy applies to the
San Fernando Road Corridor Redevelopment Project Area (SFRCRPA) because it was created
in 1992, and State law requires inclusionary housing policies for redevelopment areas created
after January 1, 1976.
The Policy requires that 15 percent of the housing built on a site within the SFRCRPA must
have affordability restrictions-- 9 percent must be affordable to low and moderate-income
households and 6 percent must be affordable to very low-income households. The Policy
allows for four alternative methods for meeting the inclusionary housing requirement.
      If a developer provides the housing on the site itself, 15 percent of the units must
       meet the affordability criteria.
      If the developer chooses to provide the housing off-site but still within the SFRCRPA,
       Site A could be 100 percent market rate but Site B would have to provide the 15
       percent requirement for Site A as well as a 15 percent requirement for Site B itself.
       This can be best illustrated by the following example. If Site A is developed with 100
       units, 15 units would have to be provided on Site B to meet the requirement for Site A.
      In addition, 15 units plus 15 times 15 percent, or 2.25 units, would have to be provided
       on Site B. Fractional units are rounded up, so there would have to be 15 plus 3 units,
       or 18 units total.
      If a developer chooses to provide the housing off-site and outside the SFRCRPA, Site
       A could be 100 percent market rate but an additional 30 percent would have to meet
       the affordability criteria and all be located on Site B. For example, if Site A had 100
       market-rate units, Site B would have to have 30 affordable units.
      Finally, the developer of a site can pay a fee into the City’s Housing Trust Fund instead
       of building the units. The formula for the fee essentially computes the difference
       between the market value of the for-sale units, or the land value of rental units, and
       the reduced values need to meet the affordability criteria. The difference is paid into
       the Housing Trust Fund.
The Inclusionary Housing Policy has several benefits. First, it directly targets the production
of affordable housing, which the market is unlikely to produce without government
intervention. Second, it promotes the creation of affordable housing within Glendale, in
particular within the SFRCRPA. This helps promote infill development and all the benefits of
such development. Finally, it helps Glendale address our own affordable housing needs
rather than relying on other jurisdictions to meet that need.
According to “Inclusionary Housing in California: 30 Years of Innovation”, a report released
jointly by the California Coalition for Rural Housing (CCRH) and the Non-Profit Housing
Association of Northern California (NPH), 107 cities and counties in California had adopted
inclusionary housing policies. Despite critics who contend that such policies may reduce
overall housing production, the report makes apparent that an inclusionary housing policy is
an effective tool to promote the production of affordable housing.
                                                                   Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                     Page 21 of 30

6.2       REGULATORY CONCESSIONS THAT REMOVE OR REDUCE
            GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
6.2.1 Lot Combination/Wide Properties Density Bonus
As clarified earlier in Zoning Regulations as a Housing Constraint, all multiple dwelling zones
other than the R-3050 (Moderate Density Residential) zone in the City allow a 25 percent
density bonus when a property is 90 feet wide or more. Thus the density of property in the
R-2250 (Medium Density Residential) Zone can be increased from 19 units per acre to 24 units
per acre, the density of property in the R-1650 (Medium High Density Residential) Zone can
be increased from 26 units per acre to 33 units per acre and the density of property in the R-
1250 (High Density Residential) Zone can be increased from 35 units per acre to 44 units per
acre by combining smaller lots in larger more efficient sites. Since much of the land with these
zoning categories is located near major streets, this lot consolidation ordinance permits the
development of increased density near transportation corridors. This provision was also
intended to promote large development that can theoretically offer more amenities and
outdoor space. In addition to the lot width density bonus, the City proactively encourages
the use of density bonuses for affordable and senior housing projects as provided under
State law. The City has been active in utilizing the density bonus program for our affordable
housing projects and, in fact, affordable projects have represented a substantial amount of
recent construction in the City.
6.2.2 Downtown Affordable Housing Incentive
In addition to the residential zones, the DSP (Downtown Specific Plan) Zone in the downtown
core allows up to 100 dwelling units to the acre. The SFMU (Commercial/Residential Mixed
Use) and IMU-R (Industrial/Commercial-Residential Mixed Use) zones allow density at up to
100 dwelling units to the acre on properties that do not abut a residential zone; up to 87
units to the acre on properties abutting a multi-family zone; and up to 35 units per acre on
properties abutting a single family zone. In addition, the C1, C2 and C3 Zones allow
residential development at the R-1250 standard except that a conditional use permit is
required for residential use at the ground floor level. The CR (Commercial Retail) Zone in
downtown Montrose also allows residential development at the R-1250 standard, but
residential use is prohibited at the ground floor level.
6.2.3 Implementation of State Density Bonus Incentive
Chapter 30.36 of the Glendale Municipal Code implements state density bonus law as
amended by SB1818. Under the provisions of Section 65915 of the California Government
Code, when a developer agrees to provide a certain percentage of units as affordable to
various income households or for senior housing, the City is required to grant certain
specified concessions to the developer. The Glendale density bonus incentive for lot
consolidation is considered “by right” density and serves as the base density for calculating
the state density bonus provisions for affordable housing. The amount of Density Bonus for
affordable housing is based on the amount by which the percentage of affordable units
exceeds the percentage established by housing type up to a 35% density bonus (See Table
30.36 of the Glendale Municipal Code). For example, a 20,000 square foot lot in the R-1250
                                                                   Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                     Page 22 of 30

City of Glendale, California                      H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
Zone with at least 90 feet of lot width would be eligible for 20 units or a “by right” density of
1 unit per 1,000 square feet of lot area, rather than the 16 units or 1 unit per 1,250 square
feet per lot area for similarly zoned lots with less width. If each of these projects proposed to
provide 10% of the units as affordable to lower income households, then each would be
eligible for a 20% density bonus. The project with the lot density bonus would be eligible for
a total of 24 units, with 10% or 2 units affordable to low income residents. The project
without the lot density bonus would be eligible for a total of 19 units, with 10% or 2 units
affordable to low income residents. Program 2a outlines intentions to continue implementing
this housing program.
6.3     ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Portions of Glendale are exposed to a variety of environmental hazards and contain resources
which may constrain the development of lower-priced residential units. Although these
constraints are primarily related to hazards, the conservation of the City’s natural resources
can also present challenges to housing development.
6.3.1 Hazard-Related Environmental Constraints
Hillside/Slope
The topography in the mountainous portions of Glendale serves as a constraint to residential
development. Slopes in these areas often exceed 60 percent grade, and development
necessitates extreme terrain modifications which significantly add to the cost of
development. Allowable development densities and standards are governed by the Slope
Density Formula outlined in the City’s Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance.
Fire Hazards
The presence of naturally-occurring shrub-dominated vegetation (i.e. chaparral and coastal
sage scrub) in the City’s hillsides results in high and extreme fire risks. In order to reduce the
risk, new development must comply with applicable City requirements for fuel modification
zones, good site design principals and other fire prevention activities.
Flooding/Mudflows
While the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has not identified any areas
within the City of Glendale exposed to 100 year floods, older subdivisions may be exposed to
mudflow hazards associated with heavy rain events. In hillside subdivisions, large-scale fires
can remove a significant amount of native vegetation which decreases a hillside’s water-
holding capability and increases the chance for erosion. In an effort to protect new hillside
development from potential mudflow hazards, the City’s Engineering Section examines the
engineering and grading standards of all subdivisions. Techniques employed to protect
homes from mud-flows include providing debris dams and channels which redirect the flow of
mud away from homes.
Seismic Hazards
Like the entire Southern California region, the City of Glendale is located within a seismically
active area. The primary seismic activity in the City is generated by movement of the San
Andreas, Sierra Madre, and Raymond Hill faults. Of these three, the Sierra Madre is the only
one located within the City’s boundaries. The San Andreas poses a threat on a more regional
                                                                    Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                      Page 23 of 30

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
level, located approximately 25 miles northeast of the Verdugo Mountains. The City prohibits
construction directly atop or astride the Sierra Madre fault, and the Verdugo and Sycamore
Canyon faults which are recognized by the City as potentially active.
On March 25, 1999, the State of California Division of Mines and Geology released maps
covering the Glendale area that identified hazards from seismically-induced landslides and
liquefaction. In the future, larger residential projects within the hazard zones would require
special geotechnical review before issuance of development permits. Construction is not
prohibited in these zones, but stricter building standards may be required as part of the
project geotechnical review. Further recommendations and land use restrictions are
described in the Safety Element.
Natural Resources Constraints
In addition to the environmental constraints associated with hazards, such as flooding and
seismic activity, protection of the City’s natural resources also presents constraints to new
housing development. The Planning Department reviews new development to ensure that
the environment is protected and that projects are revised or mitigation measures imposed
where necessary. The City is especially concerned with the protection of sensitive areas, such
as ridgelines, blue-line streams, riparian habitats or stands of native oaks and sycamores.
Development standards are more stringent in these sensitive areas to minimize potentially
adverse impacts to natural resources.
Ridgelines Ordinances adopted to protect the scenic resource value of primary and
secondary ridgelines apply to tentative tract and parcel maps, building plans, and grading
plans. The geographic areas that are affected by these ordinances include the San Gabriel
Mountains, San Rafael Hills and the Verdugo Mountains.
Blue-Line Streams
The City of Glendale has included the preservation of blue-line streams (defined as any
natural stream course mapped with a blue-line pattern on the most recently published U.S.
Geological Survey 7.5 minute series topographic map) as shown on the City of Glendale
adopted Ridgeline Maps in its Municipal Code. This has the potential to impact tentative
tract and parcel maps, building plans and grading plans for any property with blue-line
streams within its boundaries. Other than improved drainage channels, blueline streams are
located in hillside areas, most of which are zoned open space. A few blueline streams are
located within developed single-family areas zoned R1R. Blueline streams are evaluated on a
site-by-site basis as single-family residential projects are proposed. Past history has shown
that flexible development design has allowed use of single family lots within blueline stream
areas.
Indigenous Trees
The indigenous tree ordinance protects native tree species including oak, sycamore and bay
trees above a certain size. This ordinance prevents these indigenous trees from being cut
down, removed or moved without the City’s review and issuance of a permit.
6.3.2 Environmental Constraints and Adequate Sites Inventory
The environmental constraints are not anticipated to impact the availability of sites for
construction of housing. None of the City of Glendale is located within a flood zone so none
of the adequate sites have a flood hazard. Constraints posed by slope stability, seismic
                                                                  Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                    Page 24 of 30

City of Glendale, California                     H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
hazards, flooding, mudflows and landslide hazards can be addressed through engineering
methods and construction techniques to avoid impacts to public safety while allowing
development of the property for residential uses without impacting densities. There are no
residential sites listed in the adequate sites inventory located within Alquist-Priolo Earthquake
Hazard Study Zones so there are no known seismic hazards which would affect sites on the
inventory. Single-family residential sites located in the ROS and R1R zones are in hillside
areas which may be high fire areas. New and substantially remodeled single-family homes in
high fire areas would need to adhere to fire safety standards for fuel modification and fire
sprinklers; however, such requirements would not impact the use of the property for
residential purposes.
There is a known liquefaction hazard for properties located in the San Fernando Road
corridor area north of Faircourt and west of San Fernando Road along the River and some
sites in this area are included in the adequate sites inventory. Since this area of Glendale is
built-out, this area is presently used for a variety of purposes including residential uses. The
presence of liquefaction hazard is not anticipated to reduce the number of units which could
be constructed on sites within this area because engineering and construction methods are
available to mitigate liquefaction hazard without necessitating a reduction of units.
Construction methods used may increase the cost of housing construction; however, they are
the only feasible mitigation, other than avoidance, for construction in liquefaction hazard
areas.
The City’s hillside restrictions may affect the ability of a lot to be subdivided. However, all
existing, legal single family lots in the R1R and ROS zone with access and meeting minimum
lot size requirements may be suitable for construction with extension of appropriate utilities.
The City does have a requirement for conditional use permits (CUPs) on sites exceeding 50%
slope. The purpose of the CUP is to ensure that the design of the property is compatible
with the existing topography and the neighborhood on a site-by-site basis. Since 1998, the
City has approved over 90% of the CUPs requested. Since average cross slope is calculated
on a case-by-case basis, it is not known which site in the inventory may be affected by a CUP
requirement. However, past history shows that the CUP requirement is not likely to affect
the development capacity of the site inventory, however, the site design, amount of grading,
floor area ratio, and architectural design of the home may be restricted.
6.4     INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
Adequate infrastructure and public services are necessary to accommodate future residential
development. The deficiencies that presently exist as well as those projected in the future
are primarily a result of recent growth and development pressures within the City, although
increased consumption by existing customers is also a factor. The following sections discuss
the availability of electrical, water, sewer, street, and educational services to accommodate
additional growth in Glendale.
6.4.1 Electrical Power
The City of Glendale currently supplies its own electrical power. This power is provided from
two major sources: a generating plant owned and operated by the City and contractual
agreements with approximately 15 private power sources outside the City. At the present
                                                                    Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                      Page 25 of 30

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
time, the total capacity of the system is 500 Megawatts (MW). Of this total, the Glendale
plant provides a maximum of 223 MW. Although 85 percent of the City’s users are
residential customers, they consume only 34.6 percent of all electrical power.
Electricity generated by the Glendale plant and outside sources is distributed to 13
substations throughout the City. To meet increased demand in some areas, the City alters
the service area boundaries of substations to balance out the demand and capacity to
suitable levels. This practice makes for efficient utilization of equipment and capacity. Where
additional substation capacity is needed, additional equipment may be installed in an existing
substation. Newly installed capacity may be used to provide relief to immediate surrounding
areas or to other substation service areas.
At the present time, the neighborhoods on the eastern side of Glendale between Oakmont
Country Club and Glendale Community College are being upgraded. Substation capacity
additions are planned and budgeted for the Glorietta and Tropico substations. These
substation capacity improvements will enable the City to continue to provide efficient,
reliable service for a considerable period of time.
In addition to the constraints of providing additional capacity to relieve overburdened
substations, another potential constraint to development is the requirement that all new
construction provide underground rather than overhead electrical service. This method of
distribution is more reliable and more aesthetically pleasing. If underground substructure
connections are not available, the developer pays the cost of installing the substructures. In
all cases the developer pays the cost for installing the electrical cables and transformers
necessary for the project. At this time, existing and planned substation capacity is adequate
to serve all anticipated development.
The cost of providing electricity and infrastructure improvements is borne by every developer
and is not considered a barrier to housing since the City is built-out and fees are charged on a
fair share basis. However, a program has been added in the Eight Year Housing Plan to
address providing a policy for connection priority for low income housing projects.
6.4.2 Water
The City of Glendale Water and Power’s 2005 Urban Water Management Plan submitted to
the Department of Water Resources in December 2005, provides an analysis of the water
sources and planned future demand in Glendale. The Urban Water Management Plan growth
projection includes growth based on existing General Plan land use designations and zoning
which is consistent with the General Plan. A companion document entitled Water Supply
Evaluation for the Downtown Specific Plan (DSP) was prepared in May 2006 to address
specific findings for that project including anticipated housing capacity as provided in the
DSP. Together, these documents demonstrate that Glendale anticipates adequate water
capacity for the next 20 years to serve development potential anticipated under the General
Plan, which covers the timeframe for this Housing Element. Since Glendale’s General Plan
land use designations and zoning are consistent and the adequate sites analysis demonstrates
that zoning is adequate to accommodate Glendale’s share of the regional need, the City’s
                                                                    Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                      Page 26 of 30

City of Glendale, California                  H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
existing and planned water capacity is anticipated to accommodate Glendale’s share of
regional housing need provided that the amount of allocation from MWD and other sources,
and water system improvements described in the reports are met.
As noted in these water plan documents, a majority of the water used in the City (70 percent)
is obtained from the Metropolitan Water District (MWD), with a lesser amount (30 percent)
water being extracted from local ground and recycled water sources. MWD supplies are
obtained from the Colorado River and from northern California. The City completed
construction of an extensive recycled water distribution system to deliver treated wastewater
from the Los Angeles- Glendale Water Reclamation Plant for landscape irrigation at
cemeteries, golf courses, schools, parks and freeway medians. The City also operates the
Glendale Water Treatment Plant that treats ground water contaminated in the past by heavy
industry.
These water plan documents identify Glendale water system improvements necessary to
assure the reliability and quality of water served. Such improvement include, but are not
limited, to upgrades to Glendale’s water distribution system by adding new water mains,
pumping plants and reservoir facilities.     Pumping stations improvements, installation of
pressure reducing stations, groundwater extraction facility replacement, water system
analysis (hydraulic modeling), water supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA)
upgrades, MWD service connection upgrades and Los Angeles City Department of Water and
Power interconnections are completed or presently in development. Major emphasis over
the past few years has been given to water quality improvements to meet federal and state
drinking water regulations, including development of new treatment technology for
chromium 6, with a plan to have a complete treatment facility in place by the end of 2008.
Additionally, the City is planning to increase water production in the Verdugo Basin by
constructing a new well within the basin, currently in process. Glendale conservation efforts
aimed at achieving voluntary water use reductions are also strategies to ensure adequate
water service.
A copy of the Glendale Urban Water Management Plan can be obtained from the City of
Glendale Department of Water and Power.
The cost of providing water infrastructure improvements to individual projects is borne by
every developer and is not considered a barrier to housing since the City is built-out and fees
are charged on a fair share basis. However, a program has been added in the Eight Year
Housing Plan to address providing a policy for connection priority for low income housing
projects.
6.4.3 Sewers
The City maintains a system of sanitary sewers within the City limits. The sewage system is in
good condition and functions normally. In order to meet demands of new development, the
City requires the developer to install new sewer pipes to serve the development and connect
to the City’s system.
A portion of the wastewater generated in the City is treated at the Los Angeles/Glendale
Water Reclamation Plant. Reclaimed water from this facility is used by both the City of
Glendale and the City of Los Angeles. The reclamation plant has a capacity of 20 million
gallons per day (mgd). The sludge that is generated from the reclamation process is put into
the North Outfall Sewer and conveyed to the Hyperion Treatment Plant in El Segundo. This
                                                                 Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                   Page 27 of 30

plant currently meets State and Federal standards for sludge disposal. Glendale owns 29
mgd capacity at the Hyperion plant and currently uses approximately 17 mgd, which is
approximately 60 percent of its purchased capacity. As such, it is anticipated that existing
sewage capacity will be adequate to accommodate future growth in Glendale.
Connection to sewers is not anticipated to be a barrier to housing since sewer capacity exists.
Therefore, the cost of sewer connection is borne on a site by site basis for laterals and a
developer would not be charged with expanding capacity citywide since such capacity
already exists. The city has no citywide development fees for sewer expansion.
6.4.4 Streets
The City of Glendale is a built-out city, with the exception of some hillside properties. Many
existing streets in the western and southern portions of the City are insufficiently wide. Many
of these streets were designed to the standards prevalent in the early 1900’s, largely
accommodating single-family neighborhoods. Today, many of these streets are located in
areas now zoned for higher density residential development. Where streets are 32 feet or
less in width and where parking is permitted on both sides, the remaining roadway is difficult
for travel in both directions, thus limiting accessibility to certain areas of the City and
contributing to traffic congestion. The City’s Circulation Element of the General Plan (1998)
calls for the widening of these streets to 36 feet or the consideration of implementing
parking restrictions.
In practice, the Engineering Department’s policy is to require widening only when an entire
street is being widened. This prevents disjoined patterns of street improvements and also
reduces the cost of development. In an effort to ensure the development of safe and
accessible travel in areas of residential growth, the City’s Planning Division and Traffic
Engineering Division of the Public Works Department review all large-scale projects on a case
by case basis and require mitigation measures to limit traffic generation as needed.
Street improvement requirements are not a barrier to development since, for most residential
developments, they are limited to replacing curb, gutter and walk on the property frontage
or limited to street widening of less than eight feet when required for a typical street
widening along an entire block, of which a developer would only pay a fair share proportion
of the cost. The city has no development for citywide expansion of the street network.
6.4.5 Education
According to the Glendale Unified School District, although the District experienced
significant overcrowding in the past, overcrowding is easing due to two reasons. School
enrollment has been falling for several years and new classrooms were added to the district
through new construction and by opening previously closed schools. Despite this, many
schools are still near capacity. In addition, the current drop in enrollment may reverse itself in
a few years if the population of the city continues to rise as projected.
As permitted under AB 2926, the Glendale School District levies developer fees on new
construction at a rate of $2.24-$2.63 per square foot for residential development. A
developer fee of $0.31 per square foot of covered or enclosed space is also charged for new
commercial or industrial construction. Other sources of funding for school construction are
local general obligation bonds and the State Bond Fund. Even with these varied funding
                                                                    Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                      Page 28 of 30

sources, the School District believes that there may not be sufficient funds to adequately
address the needs generated by the predicted population increase in the City. Future
funding sources could include an increase in developer fees or the passage of additional
bond issues.
6.5     MARKET CONSTRAINTS
The high cost of renting or buying adequate housing is the primary ongoing constraint to
providing adequate housing in the City of Glendale. High development costs, land costs and
financing constraints contribute to reduce the availability of affordable housing.
6.5.1 Land Costs
Land costs include the cost of raw land, site improvements, and all costs associated with
obtaining government approvals. The limited supply of developable vacant land in Glendale
has accounted for a steady increase in raw land costs.
Hillside properties usually require the purchase of large parcels of land which include steeply
sloped, undevelopable areas, increasing the eventual per unit cost of the land. It is difficult to
estimate an average range of costs of unsubdivided hillside land since a great number of
variables affect the price, including, but not limited to, accessibility and needed public
improvements.
Residential land in the developed areas of Glendale cost an average of $80 - $100 per square
foot in 2007. Additional areas for residential development have been provided through
changes in multi family zone district requirements and rezoning of certain areas to allow
mixed-use development as described in other sections of this document. However, since
most of these areas are infill locations additional costs related to relocation of existing
businesses or residences, demolition of dilapidated or obsolete structures, and improvement
of existing infrastructure to meet the needs of the new use do apply and may significantly
increase costs above the purchase price.
6.5.2 Development Costs
Large scale multi-family residential development (both apartment rentals and condominiums
for home ownership) with subterranean parking is a type of development that is increasing in
Glendale in infill areas permitting higher density residential development. Parking costs are
high at approximately $80 per square foot due to the need to construct subterranean parking
for this type of higher density development.
A review of a 2007 pro-forma for a proposed 30 unit rental development and a 60 unit home
ownership condominium development meeting this description illustrates current cost levels.
The total cost per unit for the rental development is estimated at $465,000 per unit with a
breakdown of cost components are described below. The pro-forma for the home ownership
development per unit is representative of similar projects:
       $309,000 for construction hard costs (of which $55,000 is for subterranean parking);
       $ 25,000 for financing costs;
                                                                   Chapter 6 – Housing Constraints
                                                                                     Page 29 of 30

City of Glendale, California                    H OUSING E LEMENT 2014-2021
       $ 58,000 for other soft costs including insurance, title, legal, marketing, and developer
        fees (with developer fees at 15% of hard costs);
       $ 12,550 for architectural design and engineering costs;
       $ 7,500 for governmental fees; and
       $ 53,000 for land acquisition costs.
Costs of materials rose rapidly from 2000–2004 due to competition for limited resources
based upon increased demand for materials from China and increased demand from the Gulf
Coast after Hurricane Katrina. In 2007 material costs appear to have stabilized.
6.5.3 Financing
The housing market rose rapidly from 2002–2006 in terms of number of home sales and sales
prices. Some of these price increases were made possible through liberal underwriting
requirements for home mortgage financing. Innovative mortgage financing also permitted
liberal use of variable rate mortgage loans, no documentation loans, and more loans available
for homes priced at “jumbo loan” prices. This allowed more home buyers to qualify for
higher priced homes than in the past. In Glendale, this national trend resulted in increased
median home sales prices for existing homes. In June 2003, the resale price of a median
priced single family detached home was $460,000 and the price of a median priced
condominium was $260,000. By June of 2006, prices had risen to $760,500 for a median
priced single family detached home and $425,000 for a median priced condominium.
Since 2006, the trend has reversed. With increased foreclosures in the Southern California
region resulting from home owners unable to sustain higher monthly payments, lenders have
tightened up their underwriting and other financing requirements. Fewer home sales and
falling sales prices in Glendale have resulted. Interest rates on loans, particularly variable rate
loans, have increased resulting in higher monthly mortgage costs and loan defaults. In June
2007, the resale price of a median priced single family detached home had declined from the
prior year to $745,000 and the price of a median priced condominium was slightly higher than
the prior year at $465,000. The volume of sales has fallen significantly as it appears home
sellers are not putting their homes on the market, if at all possible.
With a 5 percent down payment, a $442,000 mortgage for a median priced condominium
amortized over 30 years at an interest rate of 5.6 percent would result in monthly house
payment of approximately $3,320. A household would need an income of about $115,000 in
order to afford a median priced condominium in Glendale at June 2007 prices. Similar to
many Southern California communities, the level of payment required to purchase the median
priced home in Glendale eliminates low and moderate income (and even those at the Work
Force housing income level up to 180% of Area Median Income) first-time homebuyers from
the home purchasing market.

                   small size, SRO units are typically less expensive to rent than
                   regular apartments, so they often serve as the only affordable

a. Verdugo Mountains
Because of the high fire hazard posed by the native veg­
etation in the Verdugo Mountains, a series of fire roads
were established in the 1930's. These provide access to
the mountainous areas in order to minimize the threat
of fire to the surrounding urban areas. This network of
wide, smooth fire roads provides a well developed sys­
tem of interconnecting trails for the Verdugo Mountains.                                                   1000
Map 4-2 identifies paths and trails in the Verdugo Moun­
tains. The trail system is composed of the Verdugo,
Brand Park, Beaudry North, Beaudry South, Whiting
Woods, Skyline and Hostetter Fire Road Trails. The most
popular hiking trails include those on the north facing
slope of the mountain range including Beaudry and

The only fully developed trailhead for the Verdugos is         MAP 4-4     PATHS AND TRAILS OF
found in Brand Park. Other trailheads have been estab­                     THE SAN RAFAEL HILLS
lished but these only provide for parking facilities. There
are numerous other small trail systems in the Verdugo
Mountains which have been improved by the Southern
California Edison Company for access to their individual
towers. However, these trail systems are relatively short
and do not connect to major trail systems. Consider­
ation should be given to establishing a new trail system
to connect Crescenta Valley Park to the fire road system
(via the Whiting Woods Trail) ancIJor to develop more
trailhead facilities for utilization of these trails. Public
transportation is provided close to Crescenta Valley Park,
thereby providing a greater opportunity for publiC ac­
cess to the open space lands.
b. San Rafael Hills
Like the Verdugo Mountains, a series of fire roadways
were developed in the early 1930's to provide for fire
access. Unlike the Verdugo Mountains, however, the
San Rafael Hills have undergone a greater amount of de­
velopment. As a result, many of these fire roads have
been bisected and do not serve as major hiking trails in
this area. Furthermore, due to the recent development
of the San Rafael Hills Estates project, a paved roadway
(Camino San Rafael) has been developed from the Glen­
dale Freeway to Emerald Isle Drive. Access to the open
space areas in the San Rafael Hills is still available along
this roadway to the ridge motor way which provides ac­
cess to the Cerro Negro lookout tower and along the La
Canada-Flintridge border to Cherry Canyon north of
Descanso Gardens. Several laterals from this ridge route
are available with access under the 2 Freeway at Fern
Lane. The trail system in the San Rafael Hills is much
smaller in scale and not as well utilized as the system in
the Verdugo Mountains. The Cherry Canyon Trail con­
nects to the equestrian trails of La Canada Flintridge and
ultimately to the San Gabriel Mountains. Map 4-4 shows
trails in the San Rafael Hills.
c. San Gabriel Mountains
With the recent purchase of the Deukmejian Wilderness
Park, the City of Glendale has provided public access to
the San Gabriel Mountains. Proposed development of
this facility includes an interpretive center and other ac­
tivities which will provide for a developed trailhead sys­
tem to the open space lands (see Map 4-5). The San                                        Map Not To Scale

Gabriel Mountains, in this portion of the range, are ex­
tremely precipitous, thereby making hiking quite diffi­                                   Fire/Service Roads

cult in the upper reaches of the canyon areas. The Mount
Lukens Trail traverses the upper portion of Glendale's
corporate boundary and provides a connection to Haines
Canyon Trail and Stone Canyon Trail, which ultimately

                                                          important within this area and that their continuity with
                                                          and connection to other trail systems are important. The

                                                          Glendale's trail system should be constructed in a man­

I. Native Plant Communities
a. Chaparral
This community is characterized by shrubs which typi­
cally have small thick leaves and deep roots. A number
of these shrub species have evolved under a selection
process that includes periodic fires. As a result, a num­
ber of species are dependent on fire for regeneration by
seed (Keeley and Keeley, 1989). The remaining chapar­
ral species regenerate by one of two means. The first is

dition, the Verdugo Mountains support four streams with
permanent water. These are located in Engleheard Can­      year. Water availability in the drainages in the San Rafael
yon, Henderson Canyon, Brand Canyon and Pomeroy            Hills is increased substantially by run-off from urban
Canyon. A fifth stream with permanent water is Deer        areas; this type of water may pose a threat to wildlife

faults, unstable soil areas, flood plains, watersheds, ar­
eas containing high fire risk, areas required for the pro­
tection of water quality, and enhancement of air quality.
The purpose of this section, therefore, is to assess the
presence of these hazards within the City of Glendale.
b. Fire
The Safety Element of the General Plan provides for a
detailed assessment of natural and urban fire hazards
within the City. Several factors govern the potential
hazards from wildland fires. The primary determinants
are vegetation, wind direction and strength, slopes, hu­
man proximity and access. Glendale contains a variety
of vegetation types, all of which are relatively flammable.
However, the chamise-chaparral plant community is the
most hazardous since these plants contain a large per­
centage of volatile oil within their tissues which can ig­
nite very quickly. Although Glendale has a predomi­
nantly westerly breeze flow, the bulk of local fire out­
breaks accompany the warm, off-shore, dry wind condi­
tions commonly termed "Santa Anas." As a result, loca­
tion is important in the assessment of fire risk. Finally,
slope, human proximity and access are other factors
which influence the degree of fire hazard.
Map 4-19 shows the brush areas within the city with the
highest fire risk. The classification system utilized for
the preparation of this map is included in Table 4-5.
                                                                                                    ~ LowHazard
The most fire prone area for the City is in the Verdugo                                                         Medium Hazard

c. Flood Inundation
Flood hazards due to heavy precipitation can result in
inundation of developed areas due to overflow of nearby
stream courses or from inadequate local storm drain fa­
cilities. The City of Glendale is fortunate that a flood
control system has been developed and has provided pro­
tection for its residents. The United States Department
of Housing and Urban Development has not mapped
any flood hazards for the City of Glendale.

compound, or groups of elements and compounds,
formed in inorganic processes and organic substances,
including, but not limited to, coal, peat and bituminous
rock, but excluding geothermal resources, natural gas and
petroleum. Gold, sand, gravel, clay, crushed stone, lime­

programs necessary to reduce solid waste by 25 percent
by the year 1995 and by 50 percent by the year 2000.
The programs include household and commercial refuse
separation, materials recovery facilities, composting and
other programs to meet the goals of the element. The
Source Reduction and Recycling Element has been en­
dorsed by the County. It awaits review and approval by
the State Integrated Waste Management Board. This will
take place when all cities within the County and the
County have completed their individual elements and a
Countywide Siting Element has been prepared.

Chapter 1 – INTRODUCTION
1.1      Purpose and Content
The Noise Element of a General Plan is a comprehensive program for including noise
management in the planning process. It is a tool for local planners to use in achieving and
maintaining land uses that are compatible with environmental noise levels. The Noise Element
identifies noise sensitive land uses and noise sources, and defines areas of noise impact for the
purpose of developing programs to ensure that Glendale residents will be protected from
excessive noise intrusion.
The current Noise Element of the General Plan for the City of Glendale was adopted in July
1978. That Element identified roadways as the most significant source of noise in the City.
While traffic noise is still the major noise source in the City, other sources have become a
concern. Additionally, the method for controlling noise and incorporating noise concerns into
planning decisions has become more sophisticated over the years since the first Element was
adopted. Thus, the decision was made by the City to update the Noise Element to more
effectively protect and plan for the residents of the City.
The Element is divided into three sections plus the Technical Appendix. Included in the
Technical Appendix is more detailed background information on noise, health effects, and the
noise measurement survey conducted throughout the City, and the methodology used to
generate the noise contour maps. The Noise Element is organized as follows:
          1.   Executive Summary – summarizes the noise environment and the
               implementation programs to minimize noise and land use conflicts.
          2.   Goals, Policies and Programs – defines the goals and policies of the Noise
               Element, and how each will be implemented by the City to achieve these goals.
               Responsible departments are identified. Given the challenging budgetary
               environment the City faces, timing has not been specified. It is expected that
               departments will work on the Program items as staff and budget allow.
          3.   Background Information – groups noise problems into four broad categories
               and discusses related issues.
1.2      Legal Requirements
The Noise Element follows the revised State guidelines (“General Plan Guidelines,” Governors
Office of Planning and Research, November 1998, and Preliminary Draft of revised guidelines,
Year 2002) and State Government Code Section 65302(f). The Element quantifies the
community noise environment in terms of noise exposure contours for both near and long-
term levels of growth and traffic activity. The information will become a guideline for the
development of land use policies to achieve compatible land uses and provide baseline levels
and noise source identification for local noise ordinance enforcement.
                                                                                                  1

1.3      Regulatory Environment
A local government has little direct control of transportation noise at the source because of
preemption by the State and Federal Government. State and Federal agencies have the
responsibility to control the noise from the source, such as vehicle noise emission levels.
Cities like Glendale can best manage the noise environment through proper land use planning.
By considering the potential for noise creation as part of the zoning and General Plan
maintenance process, incompatible land uses can be separated and appropriate regulations
adopted to address noise-generating uses. Noise generation can also be reviewed during the
evaluation of environmental effects of new construction. Mitigation measures or conditions of
approval, if needed, can then be incorporated into the design of the project to reduce noise
impacts. Finally, having an adopted noise ordinance allows Glendale to enforce standards
adopted by the City Council. Glendale employs all these techniques to manage the noise
environment of the City.
                                                                                              2
Chapter 2 – EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The City of Glendale is essentially built out, and thus experiences a set of noise problems
unique to a mature city. In this update, the technical description of noise in Glendale was
updated and a series of comprehensive goals, policies, and implementing actions were
developed. The process of updating the Noise Element included a review of existing and future
noise problems and the re-evaluation of City policies concerning environmental noise. All
recommendations in this plan are made in order to have a beneficial impact on the quality of
life. By use of this noise element plan and its policies, noise impacts from existing noise
generators should be lessened.
2.1 Findings
The predominant noise sources in Glendale, as in many other communities, come from mobile
noise sources, including motor vehicles. Approximately 55.9% of the City's population is
exposed to noise levels of 60 CNEL or higher, approximately 22.3% is exposed to noise levels
of 65 CNEL or higher, and 8.5% to levels 70 CNEL and above.
A number of freeways and arterial roadways expose the City to significant noise levels. The
Union Pacific Railroad along the west side of the City also contributes to the overall noise
environment. Aircraft operating in the area are not a major contributor of noise in the area
although helipads do have some contribution to overall noise. Industrial noise in the City is
minimal and isolated from noise sensitive receptors. The noise environment in Glendale varies
from the busy, high density corridor along freeways and major arterials to the lower density,
residential communities on the hillsides. Other sources of noise within the City are from non-
transportation sources including commercial and construction activities.
Noise affects all types of land uses and activities, although some are more sensitive to high
noise levels than others. Land uses identified as noise sensitive include residences of all types,
hospitals, rest homes, places of worship and schools. Within the City are a number of public
and private schools and day care centers (generally in-home day care centers).
The noise environment for Glendale can be represented using noise contours developed for
the major noise sources within the City. The noise contours are used to identify areas of
existing or potential noise impacts. The contours are developed for existing conditions and
future conditions and are presented in Exhibits 1 and 2. The 60, 65, and 70 dB CNEL contour
levels are shown on these maps. Land uses within these areas should be reviewed for
compatibility with the criteria established in Table 1 and with the standards proposed in Table
2. Although the freeways and roads in the City are going to carry more traffic in 2030
compared to 2006, the noise contours are projected to expand only minimally when the noise
contour maps for the two years are compared. The noise contours along the freeways widen a
small amount and additional portions of roads, such as Kenneth Road and Honolulu Avenue,
will be in the 60 db CNEL or higher contour in 2030.
                                                                                                3

2.2 Noise Mitigation Measures
Sources of noise in Glendale can be divided into transportation sources and non-transportation
sources. Measures that can be used to reduce noise from transportation sources include, but
are not limited to, noise barriers, land use planning, site design review, circulation
improvements, and truck access restrictions. Noise from existing uses can be managed via the
noise ordinance. Noise related to new projects can be mitigated during the project planning
review with the implementation of conditions of approval or mitigation measures such as
providing access from non-residential streets, restricting the hours of delivery, or submission of
an approved truck route plan.
2.2.1 Noise Barriers
A noise barrier (such as a wall, berm, or combination wall and berm) may be the most effective
way to mitigate noise from development. The effect of a noise barrier is critically dependent on
the geometry between the noise source and the receiver. A noise barrier effect occurs when
the "line of sight" between the source and the receiver is blocked by the barrier. Noise barriers
may be one of the mitigation measures employed in new projects and recommended during the
environmental review process. Noise barriers may also be used to reduce noise levels in
existing development. In particular, the City will continue to work with Caltrans and the
Metropolitan Transit Authority to get sound walls built along additional portions of the 2, 5,
134, and 210 Freeways.
2.2.2 Land Use Planning
Noise concerns should be incorporated into land use planning to reduce future noise and land
use incompatibilities. This can be achieved by establishing standards and criteria that specify
acceptable limits of noise for various land uses throughout the City. These criteria are designed
to integrate noise considerations into land use planning to prevent noise/land use conflicts.
Table 1 presents the recommended criteria used to assess the compatibility of proposed land
uses with the noise environment. These criteria are the basis for the development of specific
Noise Standards. These recommended Standards, listed in Table 2, present the recommended
City policies related to land uses and acceptable noise levels. These tables are the primary tools
which allow the City to ensure integrated planning for compatibility between land uses and
outdoor noise. For example, residential development within the 60 CNEL contour should be
carefully reviewed to ensure that no private outdoor yard or patio areas are exposed to noise
levels above 65 CNEL. The Criteria in Table 1 and the Noise Standards in Table 2 will be
implemented by requiring that all new residential and noise sensitive land uses within the 60
CNEL noise contour be subject to environmental review or conditions of approval to ensure
that noise impacts are mitigated. Impacts on new development will be considered mitigated if
the interior noise level meets the 45 CNEL noise standard and the exterior, private yard meets
the 65 CNEL noise standard listed in Table 2 of the Element.
2.2.3 Site Plan Review
The Land Use/Noise Compatibility Matrix shown in Table 1 is used in the site planning stage of
the development process. It is used to identify property opportunities and constraints. In
conjunction with the Noise Contour Maps (Exhibits 1 and 2), this matrix may be used to
determine whether a certain type of land use is appropriate in a particular CNEL zone. This
                                                                                                 4
matrix is particularly helpful to assist in the layout and design of large mixed-use projects
because it identifies the noise sensitivities of various land use types. Such consideration permits
the location and layout of noise sensitive uses in lower noise exposure areas on the project
site.
                                                                                                  5

The Interior and Exterior Noise Standards shown in Table 2 are the actual design standards to
be used in the project design stage. Compliance with these standards should be incorporated by
conditions of approval or environmental mitigation measures and evaluated as part of City
Development Review and building permit plan check.
2.2.4 Noise Ordinance
The most effective method to control community noise impacts from non-transportation noise
sources is through application of the Community Noise Ordinance. The City of Glendale has a
strong, enforceable Noise Ordinance. The Noise Ordinance is designed to protect quiet
residential areas from stationary noise sources. The noise levels encouraged by the ordinance
are typical of a quiet residential area. It should be noted that while some noise problems are
resolved through measurements and code enforcement actions, there are some problems that
are best addressed through some form of mediation program.

       Policy 1.3     Reduce transportation noise through proper design and coordination of
                      routing.
                      Program 1.6        Continue evaluating truck and bus movements and routes in
                      the City to balance noise protection with transit needs.
                      Responsibility: Public Works Department
                                                                                                 13

                       Program 1.7        Review desired truck routes and establishment of truck
                       prohibitions, such as prohibiting through traffic while exempting local
                       deliveries, on noise sensitive streets.
                       Responsibility: Public Works Department
                       Program 1.8        Regulate truck routes, access, and delivery times by
                       conditions of approval when reviewing new land uses.
                       Responsibility: Planning Department
       Policy 1.4      Ensure the effective enforcement of City, State and Federal noise levels by all
                       appropriate City Departments.
                       Program 1.9        Encourage the enforcement of State Motor Vehicle noise
                       standards for cars, trucks, and motorcycles through coordination with the
                       California Highway Patrol and Glendale Police Department.
                       Responsibility: Police Department
       Policy 1.5      Consider noise reduction measures when making revisions to the Circulation
                       Element.
                       Responsibility: Planning Department
       Policy 1.6      Include noise considerations in evaluating city purchases of buses and other
                       noise generating equipment and take actions as appropriate to quiet existing
                       City owned bus fleet.
                       Program 1.10       Evaluate the costs and benefits of purchasing quieter buses as
                       new buses are needed. If appropriate, include a noise specification in the
                       purchase of new buses.
                       Responsibility: Public Works Department
                       Program 1.11       Evaluate the costs and benefits of retrofitting existing buses
                       with quieter mufflers. If appropriate, implement a program of replacing
                       existing mufflers with quieter muffler on City-owned buses.
                       Responsibility: Public Works Department
Goal 2: Reduce noise from non-transportation sources
       Policy 2.1      Improve enforcement of required noise control measures in building design.
                       Program 2.1        Require that all Building Permit applicants, including
                       contractors, sign a form acknowledging requirements of the Noise Ordinance,
                       and assume responsibility for compliance with the Noise Ordinance. This is
                       particularly important for the non-resident contractor installing mechanical
                       equipment.
                       Responsibility: Public Works Department

                       that conditions of approval related to noise control are fulfilled prior to
                       building occupancy.
                       Responsibility: Public Works and Planning Departments
                                                                                                      14
       Policy 2.2     Coordinate noise abatement efforts among city departments.
                      Program 2.3       Promote regular coordination among City departments
                      involved in noise abatement efforts, such as issuing warnings or citations.
                      Include proactive measures as abatement tools to reduce the re-occurrence
                      of problems.
                      Responsibility: Public Works, Community Development and Housing, and
                      Planning Departments
Goal 3: Continue incorporating noise considerations into land use planning decisions
       Policy 3.1     Ensure that land uses comply with adopted standards.
                      Program 3.1       Use the criteria in Table 1 and standards in Table 2 to assess
                      the compatibility of proposed land uses with the noise environment. New
                      land uses, as described in the Land Uses column of Table 2, in a 60 CNEL or
                      higher noise contour, as shown on the map of the 2030 Noise Contours,
                      Exhibit 2, may be subject to potentially significant environmental impacts that
                      must be addressed by a noise study. The study, prepared by a qualified
                      consultant (to the satisfaction of the City), shall address the noise
                      environment and propose appropriate conditions of approval or mitigation
                      measures to comply with the interior and exterior noise standards as shown
                      in Table 2. Interior tenant improvements, signs, and exterior remodeling will
                      not normally be subject to review under this Program.
                      Responsibility: Planning Department, Development Services and/or Public
                      Works Department
       Policy 3.2     Encourage acoustical mitigation design in new construction when necessary.
                      Program 3.2       Continue to enforce the State of California Building Code
                      that specifies that the indoor noise levels for residential living spaces not
                      exceed 45 dB CNEL due to the combined effect of all noise sources.
                      Responsibility: Public Works Department
Goal 4: Enhance measures to control construction noise impacts
       Policy 4.1     Amend the Noise Ordinance to address construction noise problems.
                      Program 4.1       Change the permitted hours of construction to Monday
                      through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
                      Maintain the ban on construction on Sundays and Holidays. Continue to allow
                      emergency repair work, and work to correct safety hazards, at any time.
                      Responsibility: Public Works Department
                                                                                                    15
Goal 5: Promote Noise Awareness in the Community
       Policy 5.1    Inform residents of the ways that they can assist in noise abatement.
                     Program 5.1       Provide information via the Internet and cable television on
                     ways residents can abate noise, such as retrofitting their homes, being “good
                     neighbors” when attending late-night events, etc.
                     Responsibility: Public Works and Planning Departments
       Policy 5.2    Inform the public of the provisions of the Noise Ordinance and its
                     enforcement.

within the City. This description of the noise environment includes identification of noise
sources and noise sensitive land uses, a community noise measurement survey and noise
contour maps.
To define the noise exposure, this section of the report defines noise terminology, describes
the noise measurement results and identifies the major sources of noise in the community. The
sources of noise in Glendale include: motor vehicles, trains, construction, commercial areas,
and general neighborhood noises. To completely assess the noise environment in the City,
noise sensitive receptors must also be identified. As mandated by the State, noise sensitive
receptors include, but are not limited to, areas containing residential uses, schools, hospitals,
rest homes, long-term medical or mental care facilities, or any other land use area deemed
noise sensitive by the local jurisdiction.
Based upon the identification of the major noise sources and the location of sensitive receptors,
a noise measurement survey was conducted. The survey has two functions. The first is to
determine the existing noise levels at noise sensitive land uses and at other areas of interest. A
second function is to obtain an accurate description of the ambient noise levels in various
neighborhoods throughout the City.
Noise contours for all of the major noise sources in Glendale were developed. These contours
were based upon traffic mix, traffic levels, and vehicle speed. The contours are expressed in
terms of the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) and are shown on Exhibits 1 and 2.
4.2     Definitions
Sound is technically described in terms of the loudness (amplitude) and frequency (pitch) of the
sound. The standard unit of measurement of the loudness of sound is the decibel (dB). Since
the human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at all frequencies, a special frequency-dependent
rating scale has been devised to relate noise to human sensitivity. The A-weighted decibel scale
(dBA) performs this compensation by discriminating against frequencies in a manner
approximating the sensitivity of the human ear.
Decibels are based on the logarithmic scale. The logarithmic scale compresses the wide range in
sound pressure levels to a more usable range of numbers in a manner similar to the way that
the Richter scale is used to measure earthquakes. In terms of human response to noise, a sound
10 dBA higher than another is judged to be twice as loud; and 20 dBA higher four times as
loud; and so forth. Everyday sounds normally range from 30 dB (very quiet) to 100 dB (very
loud). Examples of various sound levels in different environments are shown in Exhibit 3.
                                                                                                17

Typical A-Weighted Sound
Noise has been defined as unwanted sound and it is known to have several adverse effects on
people. From these known effects of noise, criteria have been established to help protect the
                                                                                           18
public health and safety and prevent disruption of certain human activities. These criteria are
based on such known effects of noise on people as hearing loss (not generally a factor with
community noise), communication interference, sleep interference, physiological responses and
annoyance. Each of these potential noise impacts on people are briefly discussed in the
narratives below.
4.2.1 Hearing Loss
Hearing loss is, in general, not a concern in community noise problems. The potential for noise-
induced hearing loss is more commonly associated with occupational noise exposures in heavy
industry or very noisy work environments with long-term exposure. The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) identifies a noise exposure limit of 90 dBA for 8 hours per
day to protect from hearing loss. Noise levels in neighborhoods, even in very noisy airport
environments near major international airports, are not sufficiently loud to cause hearing loss. It
is significant to note that in recent years hearing loss is being caused more and more by
recreational exposure to noise, such as off-road vehicle riding, loud music, target and skeet
shooting, etc.
4.2.2 Communication Interference
Communication interference is one of the primary concerns in environmental noise problems.
Communication interference includes speech interference and activities such as watching
television. Normal conversational speech is in the range of 60 to 65 dBA and any noise in this
range or louder may interfere with speech. There are specific methods of describing speech
interference as a function of distance between speaker and listener and voice level.
4.2.3 Sleep Interference
Sleep interference is a major noise concern in noise assessment and, of course, is most critical
during nighttime hours. Sleep disturbance is one of the major causes of annoyance due to
community noise. Noise can make it difficult to fall asleep, create momentary disturbances of
natural sleep patterns by causing shifts from deep to lighter stages and cause awakening. Noise
may even cause awakening, which a person may or may not be able to recall.
Extensive research has been conducted on the effect of noise on sleep disturbance.
Recommended values for desired sound levels in residential bedroom space range from 25 to
45 dBA. The lower noise level recommendations are generally for continuous noise sources
such as heating and ventilating systems and the higher part of the recommended range is for
intermittent noise such as outdoor noise event intrusion into the sleeping area.
4.2.4 Physiological Responses
Physiological responses are those measurable effects of noise on people, which are realized as
changes in pulse rate, blood pressure, etc. While such effects can be induced and observed, the
extent is not known to which these physiological responses cause harm or are sign of harm.
Generally, physiological responses are a reaction to a loud short term noise such as a rifle shot
or a very loud jet over flight.
                                                                                                19
4.2.5 Annoyance
Annoyance is the most difficult of all noise responses to describe. Annoyance is a very individual
characteristic and can vary widely from person to person. What one person considers tolerable
can be quite unbearable to another of equal hearing capability. The level of annoyance, of
course, depends on the characteristics of the noise (i.e.; loudness, frequency spectra, time, and
duration), and how much activity interference (e.g. speech interference and sleep interference)
results from the noise. However, the level of annoyance is also a function of the attitude of the
receiver. Personal sensitivity to noise varies widely. It has been estimated that 2 to 10 percent
of the population is highly susceptible to noise not of their own making, while approximately 20
percent are unaffected by noise. Attitudes are affected by the relationship between the person
and the noise source--is it our dog barking or the neighbor’s dog? Whether we believe that
someone is trying to abate the noise will also affect our level of annoyance.
4.2.6 Scales
Community noise is generally not a steady state and varies with time. Under conditions of non-
steady state noise, some type of statistical metric is necessary in order to quantify noise
exposure over a long period of time. Several rating scales have been developed for describing
the effects of noise on people. They are designed to account for the above known effects of
noise on people. These scales are: the Equivalent Noise Level (LEQ), the Day Night Noise Level
(LDN), the Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL), and percentile noise levels (L%).
LEQ is the “energy” average noise level during the time period of the sample. It is a number
that represents a decibel sound level. This constant sound level would contain an equal amount
of energy as a fluctuating sound level over a given period of time. LEQ can be measured for any
time period, but is typically measured for 15 minutes, 1 hour or 24 hours.
LDN is a 24 hour, time-weighted annual average noise level. Time-weighted refers to the fact
that noise which occurs during certain sensitive time periods is penalized for occurring at these
times. In the LDN scale, those events that take place during the night (10 pm to 7 am) are
penalized by 10 dB. This penalty was selected to attempt to account for increased human
sensitivity to noise during the quieter period of a day, where sleep is the most probable activity.
CNEL is similar to the LDN scale except that it includes an additional 5 dBA penalty for events
that occur during the evening (7 pm to 10 pm) time period. Either LDN or CNEL may be used
to identify community noise impacts within the Noise Element. Example noise environments in
terms of the CNEL metric are shown in Exhibit 4.
                                                                                                 20

L(%), Lmax and Lmin are statistical methods of describing noise which accounts for variance in
noise levels throughout a given measurement period. L(%) is a way of expressing the noise level
exceeded for a percentage of time in a given measurement period. For example since 5 minutes
is 25% of 20 minutes, L(25) is the noise level that is equal to or exceeded for five minutes in a
twenty-minute measurement period. It is L(%) that is used for most Noise Ordinance
standards. Lmax represents the loudest noise level that is measured. The Lmax only occurs for
a fraction of a second with all the other noise less than the Lmax level. Lmin represents the
quietest noise level during a noise measurement. All other noise during the measurement
period is louder than the Lmin.

4.3      Noise Measurements
Twenty-three sites were selected for measurement of the noise environment in Glendale. A
review of noise complaints, discussions with City staff, input from a community meeting and
identification of major noise sources in the community provided the basis for the community
noise survey. The measurement locations are depicted in Exhibit 5.
Noise measurements were made of the short-term Leq values. These measurements provide a
short ‘snapshot’ view of the noise environment. The noise measurements were made at a
normal receptor height of about 5 feet above the ground. Measurements were made on August
16 and 17, 2005. The measurements were made with a Brüel & Kjaer Type 2236 Sound Level
Meter, and calibrated on a regular basis. These noise measurement systems meet the American
National Standards Institute “Type 1” specifications, which is the most accurate for community
noise measurements. The meter and calibrator have current certification traceable to the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
The results of the noise measurements are shown in Exhibit 6. These figures also depict the
date and time of the measurement. The cause of the loudest event is identified and the most
predominant noise source(s) are identified. The quantities measured were the Equivalent Noise
Level (Leq), the maximum noise level (Lmax) and the minimum noise levels (Lmin).
When examining the noise data shown in Exhibit 6 it is important to note that most of these
sites were at the front yards of homes. These data are intended to identify noise levels over a
broad range of the City and are not an assessment of impacts at these sites. In all cases the
major sources of noise are motor vehicles. The noise levels measured cover a wide range. The
quietest environment was in a residential area were noise levels were often below 40 dBA. The
loudest events were buses and trucks and these events would push the noise levels into the
mid 80 dBA range. In general, aircraft noise, industrial noise, and commercial noise sources did
not appear to contribute significantly to the noise levels measured. A detailed discussion of
each of the noise measurement sites and the monitoring results is presented on a site by site
basis in the Technical Appendix.

4.4     Sources of Environmental Noise
The main source of noise in Glendale is motor vehicle traffic. Other sources of noise in the
City that can be of concern include railroad, industrial, commercial, loud car stereos, loud car
mufflers, individual buses, lawnmowers and leaf blowers, loud parties, and automotive facilities.
Noise problems were grouped into four broad categories: (1) transportation noise control, (2)
noise and land use planning integration, 3) noise control for non-transportation noise sources,
and (4) miscellaneous noise concerns. Within each of the categories several issues are
presented and discussed.
4.4.1 Transportation Noise Control
The City of Glendale is served by four major freeways and many arterial roadways and local
streets (shown on Exhibit 7). Freeways include the Glendale Freeway (SR-2), Golden State
Freeway (I-5), Ventura Freeway (SR-134), and Foothill Freeway (I-210). Major roadways in the
City include Foothill Boulevard, Canada Boulevard, Verdugo Road, Glendale Avenue, Glenoaks
Boulevard, San Fernando Road, Broadway, Colorado Street, Chevy Chase Drive, Brand
Boulevard, Central Avenue, and Los Feliz Road.
A Union Pacific Railroad line runs along the west side of the City, generally paralleling San
Fernando Road. This line is a very active Metrolink route with over 50 trains per day. Amtrak
and freight operations also use this railroad.
The City of Glendale contains 6 operational helipads throughout the city (shown on Exhibit 7)
with many emergency helistops in the Verdugo Mountains and San Rafael Hills for firefighting
purposes.
The transportation noise sources are the major contributors of noise in Glendale. Cost
effective strategies to reduce their influence on the community noise environment are part of a
Noise Element. However, the City of Glendale is limited in controlling certain noise sources
due to preemption by Federal and State law. The California Motor Vehicle Code establishes
noise limits for motor vehicles in several sections of the code. Included in the Motor Vehicle
Code (MVC) are the following sections that govern vehicle noise limits: Sections 27200 (new
vehicle sales), 27204 (vehicle noise limits), 27150 (adequate muffler), 27151 (muffler
modification), 27150.3 (no whistle-tip muffler), 27202 (motorcycle limits), 27150.2 (exhaust
systems), and 27007 (sound amplification devices). In other words, the City cannot impose their
own limits on the noise emitted by motor vehicles, nor can they directly limit the amount of
vehicles that drive on the roadways.
Effectiveness of Soundwalls. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), in
coordination with the City of Glendale, has constructed soundwalls along most of the freeways
adjacent to residential areas within the City. Monitoring sites 2, 8, 11 and 15 were used to test
the effectiveness of these soundwalls or to check for the need of a soundwall in these locations.
Soundwalls were present at Sites 2 and 8, which are along the Foothill Freeway and Glendale
Freeway, respectively (see Exhibit 5). The noise levels at these sites were below the Caltrans
standard of 67 dBA (Leq), and indicate that the soundwalls installed are providing adequate
                                                                                                28
mitigation of the noise. Site 11 represents an apartment site west of Paula Avenue near the
Golden State and Ventura Freeways, and although soundwalls are provided for nearby
residential areas, no soundwall is provided for the apartment complex. Noise levels at the
apartment site were monitored at 70 dBA (Leq), which is above the Caltrans standard and is
generally considered unacceptable. Similarly, measurements were made at an apartment
complex at 630 Isabel along the Ventura Freeway. The freeway is depressed in elevation with
respect to the surrounding community, and no soundwalls are provided. Noise levels of 74 dBA
(Leq) were measured in this area, and represent an unacceptable noise level for the community.
The California Department of Transportation has essentially two procedures whereby
soundwalls are added along an existing freeway. The most common approach is that when a
freeway is widened or significantly modified, Caltrans will construct soundwalls for all areas
exceeding their noise standards if the soundwall is feasible and cost effective. The second
approach is part of the Community Noise Abatement Program, more commonly referred to as
the retrofit program. Essentially sites are added to a Caltrans list and prioritized based on need.
Usually the City must take the initiative to show that an area is worthy of being placed on the
retrofit list. Funding is a major obstacle for these retrofit wall projects, and many areas may be
on the list for a decade and more before being funded. Currently Glendale has two areas that
are on the Phase II list. Both of these areas are small. One site is along both sides of the 210
Freeway between Honolulu Avenue and Boston Avenue (0.3 miles) and the second is along
eastbound side of the Ventura Freeway and is listed as near San Rafael Avenue (0.1 mile).
Program 1.1 (programs are presented in Chapter 3) has been developed to pursue adding
additional areas to the retrofit wall program and to actively pursue with Caltrans possible
additional funding mechanisms.
Residential Along Major Roadways. Residential areas along major roadways are represented
by monitoring Sites 9 and 18. These sites were located in residential areas adjacent to major
roadways; specifically, Glenoaks Boulevard and Broadway. Noise levels along these roadways
were in the upper 60 dBA (Leq) range and the CNEL noise levels would be about 70 dBA.
Existing homes in these areas may experience unacceptable indoor noise levels. Older homes,
even with windows closed, have an outside to inside noise reduction of 20 to 25 dBA. This
means that the indoor noise levels with windows closed would be in the 45 to 50 CNEL. New
home construction is required by State building codes to be designed to meet a 45 CNEL noise
standard.
The zoning on Glenoaks Boulevard and Broadway, and several other major streets, allows
commercial and mixed used development. Any residential use constructed would be a multi-
family development. Interior noise levels can be mitigated to meet Building Code requirements
simply by adhering to the Building Code. Programs 3.1 and 3.2 are proposed to address the
potential problems associated with siting residential development in areas subject to elevated
noise levels. Noise studies required by Program 3.1 will ensure that new residents will not be
subjected to excessive noise levels.
Soundwall Along Railroad. The Union Pacific Railroad line borders and passes through
portions of the west side of Glendale. Generally the railroad parallels San Fernando Road.
Metrolink is the primary user of the line, but Amtrak and freight trains also use the line. The
                                                                                                 29
concern was raised at the public meeting that perhaps a soundwall     could be constructed along
the railroad to protect nearby residential areas to the east.          Measurements and noise
projections indicate that traffic on San Fernando Road is a greater   source of noise than is the
train traffic. Little benefit would be achieved by constructing a     soundwall adjacent to the
railroad, and therefore no action is recommended.
4.4.2   Noise and Land Use Planning Integration
Information relative to the existing and forecast noise environment within Glendale should be
integrated into future land use planning decisions. This Element presents the noise environment
in order that the City may include noise impact considerations in development programs. Land
use conflicts related to noise can often be avoided by proper planning and standards.
The City of Glendale has industrial uses in the southwest corner of the City, in a small area in
the southern portion of the City along the east side of San Fernando Road, and in a small
portion of Montrose. These uses do not appear to create major noise problems in the City.
Neither the on-site activities nor the trucks associated with this type of land use were
mentioned at the public meeting. Noise measurements near these areas confirmed that the
industrial uses present are not generating loud levels of noise. Noise generated by the industrial
uses within their property boundaries is subject to the limitations in the Glendale Noise
Ordinance.
Noise generated by parking areas, delivery trucks, and music from bars and restaurants are
common sources of noise complaints. In discussions with staff and again in public meetings,
noise from banquet halls was identified as the most significant commercial noise impacting
residential areas. The banquet halls are in many areas of the City. Other commercial sources of
noise that were identified include the public address (PA) systems at auto dealerships.
Additionally, future plans for the downtown area integrate commercial uses with residential
uses (i.e., mixed use development). Residences may be located above or within close proximity
to dance clubs in this zone. These sources of noise are discussed in more detail below.
Downtown Residential Interface. As part of the revitalization of the downtown area many
mixed-use projects may be constructed. Such projects hold the promise of reducing traffic
congestion by housing people closer to jobs and entertainment. They also improve the
economic viability of downtown by providing a more stable customer base. Aside from these
hoped-for benefits, the increasing number of downtown residential projects are simply a
response to market demand. One of the tradeoffs of living downtown, however, is exposure to
elevated noise levels. The combination of traffic, the mix of residential and commercial land
uses, and the close proximity of uses makes for a unique problem. Just as residents in
agricultural areas must accept the odors associated with agricultural operations, downtown
residents must accept a certain amount of elevated noise levels. Clubs, late-night restaurants,
and banquet facilities are some examples of commercial uses that could locate in the downtown
area and generate noise into nighttime hours. The proximity to such entertainment is certainly
one of the attractions for at least some downtown residents. Programs 3.1 and 3.2 provide the
City with the tools to ensure that excessive noise will be avoided or mitigated.
                                                                                               30
Active Park and Residential Interfaces. One question that arises in land use planning is
whether an active park or playfields conflict with adjacent residential land uses. The noise
measurement at Site 1 was taken at the interface between Dunsmore Park and the adjacent
residential area. This site is in the Montrose area of the City. This site was selected to check on
the compatibility of an active park area with residential uses. While the measurements were
conducted, the ball field, soccer field and tennis courts were all active. There is a parking lot
between the homes and the active fields which acts as a buffer zone. The noise levels measured
at the residences ranged from 42 to 64 dBA with the average noise level (Leq) being just under
50 dBA. Most of the noise measured was due to the playfields, however, the loudest sound
recorded came from a neighborhood dog that barked. The daytime Leq is often indicative of
the CNEL noise level. The CNEL in this area would be expected to be around 50 dBA. Thus
this area represents a quiet residential area and shows that residential and active park uses can
be compatible when in close proximity if properly planned. No program was proposed since
with the proper planning active parks adjacent to residential do not appear to be a noise
conflict.
Noise Standards for Various Park Uses. The park uses in Glendale can be divided into three
types: urban parks, active parks, and quiet parks. The Glendale Central Park located along
Colorado Street is an example of an urban park. Noise levels at this park (i.e., Monitoring Site
17) range up to 68 dBA (Leq). However, the park appeared to be busy and people did not
appear to be bothered by the noise levels. Active parks, such as Dunsmore Park, are usually
generators of noise and are not very sensitive to noise from outside sources. Brand Park (Site
4) is an example of a quiet park. The noise level at Brand Park was 45 dBA (Leq). In this type of
park, peace and quiet are expected and high noise levels would ruin the park experience. Noise
standards, including standard for “quiet parks,” are being proposed as part of Program 3.1.
More background and discussion is provided in the following item in regards to City noise
standards.
City Noise Standards. Noise standards are designed to ensure that new sensitive land uses are
designed and constructed so that the noise environment will be acceptable for that land use.
For example, most cities have an outdoor noise standard for rear yards of single-family
residential uses of 65 CNEL. This requires that when new residences are constructed that
soundwalls, berms, setbacks or other features be used that will result in the rear yards meeting
a 65 CNEL noise level now and for future traffic projections. Currently, the City does not have
any noise standards, which are normally contained in the Noise Element of the General Plan.
(Noise standards should not be confused with the Noise Ordinance, which is discussed in the
Section 4.4.3.) The City enforces the State building code (Chapter 12, Section 1208A) which
requires that “new hotels, motels, dormitories, apartment houses and dwellings other than
detached single-family dwellings” be designed and constructed so as to achieve an indoor noise
level of 45 CNEL or less when constructed and at least 10 years into the future. The standard
protects these dwellings from exterior noise sources such as highways, county roads, city
streets, railroads, rapid transit lines, airports and industrial areas. Cities are allowed to develop
noise standards for other uses as they see fit.
In addition to protecting new construction from obtrusive noise levels, city noise standards also
provide a criterion by which to evaluate the impact of new projects on existing residential areas
                                                                                                   31

and other noise sensitive areas. For example, assume that the City adopts a 65 CNEL for
residential land uses. If a new project is proposed which will generate significant traffic, it can be
determined if the 65 CNEL level will or will not be exceeded at existing residential areas. If
exceeded, then the project would be determined to have a significant impact without further
mitigation.
Program 3.1 utilizes the standards in Table 2 for residential and quiet park uses. These
standards ensure that new development will be adequately protected from noise, and provide a
consistent criterion with which to assess impacts generated by new projects.
San Fernando Corridor Development. San Fernando Road represents one of the major noise
corridors through the City. Noise levels monitored at Sites 16 and 20 show noise levels near
and on this roadway to range from 60 to 72 dBA (Leq). High peak noise levels are also
experienced along this roadway due to the large amount of trucks traveling the roadway and
the nearby railroad. Mixed use is planned for some parts of the San Fernando Corridor. This
type of use would be acceptable from a noise standpoint, as long as the residential units are
properly soundproofed. Adoption of specific City noise standards as proposed in Program 3.1
would insure that new residences in this area are properly designed.
Noise Compatibility Guidelines. The City currently has a set of Noise Compatibility
Guidelines (Table 1). The guidelines identify the general acceptability of noise exposures for
various land use categories in the City. The guidelines are based on the State of California
recommendations for Noise Elements made in 1976. The State in their “General Plan
Guidelines,” has modified slightly the noise compatibility guidelines and Program 3.1 presents
for adoption these updated guidelines. It should be noted that the compatibility guidelines are
simply guidelines, and do not represent standards. The guidelines provide an initial evaluation of
the compatibility between a land use and noise environment.
4.4.3   Non-Transportation Noise Sources—The Noise Ordinance
Exhibit 8 illustrates the spatial locations of noise complaints filed through the City Managers
Office from 3/4/99 to 10/11/05. The significance of the locations is that no specific area is
impacted by localized sources.
Residential land uses and areas identified as noise sensitive must be protected from excessive
noise from non-transportation sources including commercial activities, construction noise, late-
night entertainment, spa and pool equipment and air-conditioner noise to name a few. These
impacts are most effectively controlled through the enforcement of an effective City Noise
Ordinance. A noise ordinance is designed to control noise generated on private property and
impacting another parcel of property. A noise ordinance is not designed to control traffic on
public streets, aircraft noise, train noise and other public transportation noise. The noise
ordinance is part of the City code, and is not contained in the Noise Element of the General
Plan. However, as part of a Noise Element update the noise ordinance is often reviewed and
recommendations made for changes if needed. The key noise ordinance related issues are
discussed below.
                                                                                                    32

Review of Noise Ordinance. The Noise Ordinance is contained in the Glendale Municipal
Code, Title 8, Chapter 36 – Noise Control. The ordinance was updated in 1991. To be
enforceable the courts have ruled that a noise ordinance must have specific noise limits and
protocols for noise measurements. The Glendale Noise Ordinance contains these requirements
and the protocols for measurement of potentially offending noise sources are clear. In general,
the City’s Noise Ordinance is an excellent tool for controlling noise generated on private
property throughout the City. Because of concerns expressed by residents about disturbing
noise from construction activities on the weekends, the Element proposes to revise the
allowable hours for construction. Currently construction is allowed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Monday through Saturday with construction prohibited on Sundays. The proposed change is to
restrict the hours of construction on Saturday to 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. with other days remaining
unchanged. This change would not affect the authority of the Director of Public Works and the
Building Official to authorize other hours.
                                                                                            33

Automotive Interface with Residences. Automotive uses along Brand Boulevard abut the
residential neighborhood in many locations. Noise is generated by automotive repair, public
address (PA) systems, parking of cars, and unloading new cars from transport trucks. This
interface between automotive uses and residences has been a major point of conflict in other
cities. Our measurements (e.g., Site 19) indicate that the noise generated by the automotive
facilities is minimal. This finding was also supported by the fact that this was not brought up as
an issue in the public meeting for the Noise Element Update. In some cases the City has limited
hours of operations for some automotive activities, prohibited PA systems and imposed other
restrictions on the automotive facilities. Additionally, the City has an enforceable Noise
Ordinance that can and has been used to ensure that the residential areas are not unduly
impacted. In summary, the automotive/residential interface does not appear to be generating
impacts on a regular basis, and therefore, no actions items or changes to policy are
recommended.
Banquet Facilities Interface with Residences. Banquet facilities have several sources of noise.
Generally, the parking lots associated with the facilities are the most significant source of noise.
Cars driving into and out of the lots, groups of people talking and shouting, and inadvertent car
alarms can all occur in the parking lot and can occur late at night when the banquet ends. Music
is often played at the banquet facilities and has the potential for being a problem in the
surrounding area when doors and windows are left open. The City does not allow banquet
facilities within 200 feet of a residential zone. Limiting hours and requiring onsite parking away
from residential areas are other planning restrictions that can be used. Banquet facilities that
are currently operating can be controlled via the Noise Ordinance. The Noise Ordinance has
very specific noise level limits that are measured at the nearby residential property line. The
Noise Ordinance limitations apply to all noise generated at the banquet facilities including
parking lot noise. The Noise Ordinance limitations are more stringent after 10 p.m., so
nighttime noise is controlled to a greater extent that noise generated during the evening. Since
the Noise Ordinance is in place and can be used to effectively control banquet facility noise, no
action items or changes to policy are recommended.
Construction Noise. Construction noise is addressed in the Noise Ordinance in Section
8.36.080. The noise ordinance exempts construction activities from compliance with the noise
ordinance limits under certain circumstances. If construction occurs within 500 feet of a
residential zone, then construction is prohibited from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. every night and from 7
p.m. on Saturday to 7 a.m. on Monday (i.e., no Sunday construction). Construction on certain
holidays is also prohibited. To respond to complaints about noise from construction on the
weekend, Program 4.1 proposes to change the Noise Ordinance by restricting construction on
Saturday to the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. This level of control is consistent with the approach
used by most other jurisdictions, with the exception that other jurisdictions usually prohibit
construction on Saturday as well as Sunday. Some jurisdictions do not have a distance limit in
their ordinance and essentially prohibit construction anywhere in their city at night and on
weekends and holidays.

4.4.4   Miscellaneous Noise Issues
Several issues came up as part of the public input process. Not all of the issues raised are
strictly issues that are normally dealt with in the Noise Element. But since they were of
concern to the residents all issues were investigated and usually noise measurements were
made to determine the significance of the issue.
Loud Car Mufflers. Several residents commented on the extensive use of loud mufflers on
vehicles in the City. The type of mufflers and the legal noise levels for with cars is regulated by
the State of California, and the City has no regulatory power in this area. The California Motor
Vehicle Code establishes noise limits for motor vehicles in several sections of the code.
Included in the Motor Vehicle Code (MVC) are the following sections that govern vehicle noise
limits: Sections 27204 (vehicle noise limits), 27150 (adequate muffler), 27151 (muffler
modification), 27150.3 (no whistle-tip muffler), and 27150.2 (exhaust systems).
Site 7 is along Mountain Road at Nibley Park. At the community meeting some residents
complained about the exhaust noise from student vehicles during the evening hours. Because
there are speed bumps on this road, travel speeds are generally low. This measurement was
intended as a check on the situation. Measurements were initiated 8:17 p.m. It is impossible to
positively identify student traffic as opposed to residents, but it was clear that a significant
portion of the traffic was associated with the college. During the measurement period about 15
cars passed by whose noise level was between 65 and 70 dBA. Only one car exceeded 70 dBA,
and that car was responsible for the maximum sound level measured during the period (i.e.,
74.1 dBA). The exhaust on the car was the loudest source of noise. The exhaust on this car,
while perhaps annoying to residents is not illegal, and is consistent with noise levels typically
measured on other small streets throughout the City. The Leq noise level for the measurement
was 56 dBA, which is representative of a quiet urban area. When no cars were present the area
was very quiet, with the Lmin noise level measured at 44 dBA. Measurements at other locations
throughout the City also did not see an abnormally high use of modified or very loud muffler
systems. Program 1.9 supports efforts by the City to encourage enforcement and regulation of
motor vehicle exhaust systems in order to keep this noise source under control.
College Traffic on Mountain Road. Site 7 was measured during the evening to determine if
unacceptable noise levels were generated by traffic associated with college traffic. As indicated
in the item above, it was impossible to positively determine what proportion of traffic on
Mountain Road is due to the college. Clearly some traffic on this road is due to the college. The
City has installed speed bumps on this roadway and this has acted to keep speeds low and the
noise is also correspondingly low. The noise levels measured when college traffic was present
was still typical for a quiet urban area. Therefore, the noise levels are acceptable for this area,
and while it may be desirable to further reduce traffic on this roadway, it can not be justified
from a noise standpoint.
Beeline Bus Noise. At the public meeting, one resident raised the concern about bus noise. He
indicated that he thought the Beeline buses were too loud. His observation was, in fact,
confirmed by our observations. Beeline buses accounted for a disproportionate share of the
maximum sound levels at many of the measurement sites. In fact, a Beeline bus was the loudest
                                                                                                 36
event monitored at Sites 9, 17, 18, and 22. While this study was not intended to quantify bus
noise, it is estimated that the Beeline buses are 5 to 10 dBA louder than buses operating in
other cities. It should be noted that the levels generated by the buses are not illegal, simply
louder than the typical bus. The noise level emitted by a bus is largely dependent on the type
and quality of muffler installed on the bus. Quieter mufflers can restrict the exhaust flow and
cause a slight loss in power compared to louder mufflers. Program 1.11 has been recommended
which would have the City investigate the use of quieter buses, and if appropriate, incorporate
a noise standard into their buying program for new buses and/or replace existing mufflers with
quieter mufflers.
Sports Complex Related Traffic Noise. The Glendale Sports Complex was constructed at
the east end of Fern Lane. Residents continue to complain about the traffic noise associated
with the Sports Complex. Site 6 is along Fern Lane; specifically measurements were made at
1981 Fern Lane. Three 15-minute measurements were made at this site. During the first two
measurements, which lasted from 9:27 p.m. to 9:59 p.m. cars were regularly traveling in a
westbound direction from the Sports Complex. From 10:00 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. only one car
passed the measurement site. Two factors may have tainted our noise measurements. First, the
police were present on the street and this may have caused people to drive slower than if the
police had not been present. Second, one resident told us that about half of the playfields were
not being used because it was not soccer season. We were unable to independently confirm
this. The measurements during the first two periods averaged 56 and 55 dBA. The noise level
during the third period was 50 dBA (Leq). The traffic on the distant freeway kept the noise
levels in the 48 to 52 dBA range.
Based on our limited measurements, the Sports Complex traffic does appear to increase
average noise levels by about 5 dBA during the 30-minute period when the cars are leaving the
Sports Complex. (A similar increase might be expected when the cars are arriving at the
complex.) This increase in noise would be noticeable to the local residents. However, the
noise levels remain low during this time that the time that the cars are leaving. With noise
levels in the mid-50 dBA range, this neighborhood is very typical of many neighborhoods that
were measured. The residents also have complained about the maximum sound levels due to
cars passing by with loud exhausts. In the first measurement period, the loudest event was a
pickup truck and the noise was generated by the vehicle’s tires. In the second period, the
loudest event was caused by the exhaust system on a pickup truck and reached a noise level of
66.6 dBA. Even though this level may be annoying to residents, it is at a legal level and is
consistent with what was measured in other neighborhoods. The City has instituted measures
to slow traffic on Fern Lane and this does appear to be working.
While the noise levels are significantly higher during the period that cars are arriving and
departing the Sports Complex, the noise levels are still well below those experienced in many
neighborhoods in Glendale. The curfew of 10 p.m. at the Sports Complex seems to be effective
in eliminating car traffic after 10 p.m. From a noise standpoint, no further action is needed on
Fern Lane since levels are not excessively loud.
Truck Traffic on Norton Avenue. At the community meeting, residents complained that
trucks in the early morning cut through on Norton Avenue and cause unacceptable noise levels.
                                                                                              37

Noise measurements were made early in the morning at 854 Norton Avenue. We counted
trucks while we conducted our noise measurements and did not see a single truck (including 2
axle delivery trucks). The site was visited a second time without measurements and again no
trucks were observed. Noise levels were fairly low during the measurement with the Leq at 52
dBA. Therefore, no additional action is recommended at this time. Program 1.8 promotes
review by the City of proposed truck routes, access and delivery times to manage this issue.
Police Training and Enforcement. The issue of police training and enforcement was brought
up at the public meeting and in discussions with residents of Fern Lane. In general, the residents
stated concerns that more police enforcement of loud mufflers and loud car radios is needed in
the City. The Police Department trains its officers on the enforcement of the Noise Ordinance
and the Vehicle Code as it relates to noise.
Apartment/Single Family Homes Interface. Residents raised the concern about noise
generated at apartment sites impacting adjacent single-family homes. In general, they thought
that higher noise levels are associated with apartments and single-family homes should not be
located directly adjacent to single-family homes. This issue is both a land use planning issue and
an enforcement issue. Many newer communities will in fact not plan apartments directly
adjacent to single family homes. They feel that there is a higher level of noise associated with
apartment buildings. There are more people and traffic within an apartment complex, and
higher noise levels than in single-family areas would be expected. On the other hand, there are
many apartment complexes that are located directly adjacent to single family homes where no
conflict exists. For older communities, such as Glendale, there may be parts of the city where
gradual replacement of single-family homes with condominiums or apartments is desirable.
Factors that can mitigate the impact of apartment complexes on adjacent residences include
keeping the density of the complex to the lower end of the range for apartment buildings.
Keeping major traffic ingress and egress points, pool areas, and other outdoor gathering areas
away from single family homes can also help. Providing reasonable setbacks between the
apartment buildings and property line is also beneficial. Noise conflicts between single and
multi-family residences were one of the issues that prompted a review of the single/multi-family
interfaces throughout the city and which led to the rezoning of certain parts of the city under
the Multi-Family Transition Zoning program.
When conflicts arise between existing single-family residents and apartment residents it is often
an enforcement issue. Loud stereos, parties, and other intermittent events usually are handled
by the police. Chronic problems, such as pool pump noise, regular crowd noise around the
pool area, and other equipment noise problems, can be corrected via the Noise Ordinance
process. The loud events can be measured and the apartment owner cited. Corrective action
can also be ordered if the problem is severe.

City Manager James M. Rez                     .
Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Planning Division is pleased to submit for your consideration a revision to the 1990
Land Use Element. This revision is necessary as a result of the City Council's adoption
of the Land Use/Zoning Consistency implementation program in 1986 which involved
major City-wide zone changes, adoption of a new zoning ordinance, and several Land Use
Plan amendments. The revision also reflects all Land Use Element amendments and zone
changes adopted by Council since 1977.
The Land Use Element is the primary element in the series of Comprehensive General
Plan Elements mandated by the State of California. The purpose of this element is mani­
fold in that it provides direction to the future physical, social, environmental, and
economic activities of Glendale's population and designates the desired general distribu­
tion, location and extent of the significant uses of the land.
The City of Glendale and its citizens can take great pride in the fact that the City has
maintained its status as one of the finest residential communities in California. Glendale
has developed a diversified industrial base and achieved a leadership role in becoming a
regional hub of commercial and financial activity.
The continued implementation of the Land Use Element will ensure Glendale's future
growth and prosperity. While the element advocates a moderate growth policy, the
primary aim is to achieve this end within the context of providing the community envi­
ronmental protection of the highest quality.

   INTRODUCTION
   Program Objective
   The primary objective of the Land Use Element is to devel­
,
   op a long-range plan for the City of Glendale which will
   provide a comprehensive analysis of current and future land
   use requ irements, econom ic feasibi Iity, envi ron mental im­
   pacts, and implementation techniques. This plan represents
   one application of the goals of Glendale's citizens insofar
   as those goals relate to the use of publicly and privately
J	 owned land. This Element, together with the adopted Cir­
   culation and Scenic Highways Elements, Community Facili­         Each of the four outside "spheres" represents a complex of
   ties Element, Seismic Safety and Safety Elements, Housing        constraints within which the land use element was formulat­
   Element, and Open Space, Recreation and Conservation             ed. Efforts have been made to balance the natural conflicts
   Elements, comprise the City of Glendale's Comprehensive          which arose between the various constraints, so that the
   General Plan.                                                    resu Itant plan represents a well ba lanced design for guiding
                                                                    the future growth of Glendale.
   An additional objective is the need to comply with the
   State Planning Law contained within the Government Code          This plan is not one which reflects a desire to maintain the
   of the State of California.                                      status quo, but rather evidences a need to foster quality
                                                                    growth and change which will work for the benefit of the
   State Mandate                                                    total community. Rampant growth, in terms of population
                                                                    increase, is not fostered in this plan.
   Section 65302 reads, in part, as follows:
                                                                    Perspective
       "The General Plan shall consist of a statement of devel­
       opment policies and shall include a diagram or diagrams      In 1928, Glendale had one of the nation's first land use
       and text setting forth objectives, principles, standards,    plans which was completed by Harland Bartholomew and

 Modification of existing zoning to reflect the objectives and

 1986. The revised zoning map takes into account both the

 Open space traditionally has been considered highly desirable
 and is also recognized as a mechanism for the containment
 and guidance of growth. It is recommended that open space
 be provided in mountainous areas consisting of public pro­
perty as well as privately owned property in conjunction
with developments, or as a result of easements, leases, or
other methods. Preservation of open space wi II reduce the
 magnitude of terrain modification (cut and fill) which is a        RESIDENTIAL
critical concern among Glendale citizens. Methodology to
 initiate these principles in mountainous areas include the
 limitation of the number of dwelling units relative to the
steepness of the natural topography or the amount of re­

gram adopted in 1986. This new Code was comprehensive
in that it reorganized the entire presentation of the Code,
updated and revised outmoded codes and ordinances, and
introduced new procedures for development in Glendale.
The new organization of the Code makes the document
easier to read and to interpret. The Code is organized
around the concept of creating independent zones. All
documentation pertaining to a particular zone is included
in the appropriate section.
The revision and update of the zoning ordinances included
reevaluation and study of all aspects of the Code. This
included the development of a new residential zone, the
creation of height districts in commercial zones, and the

 The Plan's intent for this classification is to distinguish
 those lands and uses reserved for public open space and
 recreational activities. This includes those semi-public lands
 presently used in low intensity residential areas such as
 public schools. Implementation of this program will ,'equire
 the creation of a new zoning classification which permits
 the types of open space and recreation now in existence as
 well as those contemplated in the future. Certain types of
 recreation uses will require performance and design criteria
 to be included in ordinance revision.

INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS
 Industry is predominantly located in two communities,
 Southwest and West Glendale. Industrial uses in North
 Glendale are supportive and service oriented, and a small
 industrial park is located in Verdugo Canyon.            West
 Glendale and Southwest           Glendale demonstrate high
 intended utilization percentages considering the public/
 semi-public uses are of an industrial nature (Glendale
 steam plant, maintenance yards, etc.). The major causes
 of underutilization are discussed in the Industrial section
 and consist mainly uf o!:L, single family homes and com­
 mercial uses in industrial districts.
 Findings and Recommendations

 from the analysis summary above:

    density residential property should be provided in
    the southern communities and in North Glendale
    primarily through redistribution and rezoning of                                                                    1,024.3 8Cres
    underutilized higher density residential areas. Desired
    locations include transitional areas and neighbor­
    hoods where buffer areas are necessary between
    high and lower intensity use districts.
     High density zoning is in disproportionately high
    supply in the southern communities. Underutiliza­
    tion of much of this land by single family, moderate
    and medium density development indicates the need
    to preserve the character and integrity of many
    neighborhoods in these communities. This should
    be accomplished by a redistribution of zoning.
    Underutilization is the major problem in commercial
    and industrial districts. While redistribution and
    rezoning may resolve the commercial problems,
    along with the establishment of commercial centers,
    rev ita Iization and redevelopment appears to be neces­
    sary in many industrial sectors.
 More specific and supportive recommendations will follow
 in the sections on housing, commerce and industry.

location of residential uses, the permitted intensity of
use, and the compatibility with adjacent uses are the most
important aspects to be considered in relation to land use
planning. A Housing Element was adopted and became
part of Glendale's Comprehensive General Plan in July,
1975. This document contained a comprehensive analysis
of the residential needs in Glendale and also provided goals
and recommendations necessary for the improvement of
housing cond it ions.
The purpose of this residential section is to provide an
analysis of the amount, location and compatibility of

and response, communities need to know in advance
what are the potentially hazardous conditions specific
to their area. A major part of this effort requires
mapping of the vulnerable areas in the community. This
is covered in the Technical Background Report to the
Safety Element. For example, the Technical Report
identifies the fault zones that cross the City, areas of
potential landslides and unstable slopes, areas
susceptible to fire and flooding hazards, and areas
where most hazardous materials in the City are being
used, stored or generated. However, the hazard maps
that serve as the basis for the Technical Background
Report are by necessity generalized; the boundaries
between hazard zones should not be interpreted as
precisely defined. This document and the accompanying
illustrations are to be used for general land use planning
purposes only, such as in land use decisions. This
Element should not be used for site-specific studies,
but rather, it should be used to identify areas where
detailed site-investigations should be required for new
developments or for redevelopments.
Computer simulations that estimate loss of life and
damage to buildings and infrastructure (such as
HAZUS, the software used for this study) are still in
their infancy, but already have proven to be of value in
designing and prioritizing appropriate mitigation plans.
The results of these models, however, are estimates
only, and this should not be forgotten. It is the
magnitude, rather than the specific value, of the results
that is significant (an earthquake that results in about
4,000 casualties is clearly more severe an event than
one that causes about 150 casualties). Once this
information is known, appropriate measures can be
taken to reduce the hazard and to prepare for and
respond to the estimated level of damage. These are
the topics covered in this Policy Document.

In 1986, Congress passed the Superfund Amendments
and Reauthorization Act (SARA). Title III of this
legislation requires that each community establish a Local
Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC). This
committee is responsible for developing an emergency
plan that outlines steps to prepare for and respond to
chemical emergencies in that community.
Several California statutes require the emergency
notification of a hazardous chemical release. These
include: Health and Safety Codes §25270.7, §25270.8
and §25507; Vehicle Code §23112.5; Public Utilities Code
§7673; Government Codes §51018, §8670.25.5(a); Water
Codes §13271 and §13272; and California Labor Code
§6409.1(b)10. The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic
Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition
65, and §9030 of the California Labor Code also has
specific reporting requirements.
The Environmental Management Center (EMC) is a
facility run by the Glendale Fire Department that is tasked
with administering a household hazardous waste collec-
tion plan for the City of Glendale in accordance with
the California Integrated Solid Waste Management Act
of 1989 (AB 939). The EMC is located at 780 Flower

3.4       Hazardous Materials
3.4.1 Important Terms and Concepts
The unhealthful effects of certain chemicals and
substances have led to extensive regulation of hazardous
materials. The United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) defines a hazardous waste as a substance
that 1) may cause or significantly contribute to an increase
in mortality or an increase in serious, irreversible, or
incapacitating reversible illness; and 2) that poses a
substantial present or potential future hazard to human
health or the environment when it is improperly treated,
stored, transported, disposed of or otherwise managed.         end, the EPA requires that the levels of five major air

1.     The entire Glendale area can experience strong seismic shaking as a result of an earthquake on the Sierra Madre,
      Verdugo, Raymon or Hollywood faults. Based on the HAZUS analyses, Glendale High School is anticipated to
      experience at least moderate damage as a result of any of the four earthquake scenarios mentioned above. The
      schools in the northern portion of the district, near the Sierra Madre fault, are also anticipated to suffer at least
      moderate damage as a result of the maximum magnitude earthquake on the Sierra Madre fault. The schools
      that, according to the HAZUS analyses, are more likely to perform poorly during a near-source earthquake are
      identified with an “H”.
