Chapter 10. Safety
INTRODUCTION
San Bernardino has seen more than its fair share of disaster; from fires, to
floods, to earthquakes. Reducing exposure to these threats and protecting
the health, safety, and welfare of our community is a fundamental role of
City government. It is increasingly important that the City of San
Bernardino maintain programs that provide an effective response to public
safety concerns. The Safety Element assesses natural and man-made
hazards present in the community and includes policies to address those
hazards.
Purpose
This element specifically addresses the way in which the City will prepare
and respond to fire hazards, geologic, and seismic hazards, and flood
hazards. The Safety Element provides background information related to
each issue and identifies hazard locations within the City, risk-reduction
strategies, and hazard abatement measures that can ultimately be used by
decision-makers in their review of projects. Policies also address ways to
minimize any economic disruption and accelerate the City’s recovery
following a disaster.
Relationship to Other Elements
Critical relationships exist between the Safety Element and other General
Plan Elements. The types and locations of land uses identified in the Land
Use Element are influenced and regulated by the locations of natural
hazards, while emergency evacuation routes and locations of critical
facilities can be influenced by the goals and policies identified in the
Circulation Element. The Public Facilities Element identifies the services
available to the City, such as the Police and Fire Departments, to aid in the
response to hazards and disasters identified in this Element.

     Relationship to Other Documents
     Federal, State, and local regulations and policies such as the California
     Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the California Government Code,
     and the San Bernardino Municipal Code regulate and/or influence land use
     and development in the City. Not only do they help to protect the health,
     safety, and welfare of our residents, visitors and businesses by ensuring
     that proper analyses are conducted, sound construction practices are
     implemented, and uses are appropriately sited within the City, they can
     also help to minimize the recovery time experienced after the occurrence
     of a disaster.
     ACHIEVING THE VISION
     The Safety Element builds upon the City’s Vision of “Creating
     Opportunities for the Future” for its residents. People re-invest in their
     communities if they believe there are opportunities present to enhance
     their local environment. As such, a safe community can help to attract
     new businesses and residents. The Safety Element is responsive to our
     Vision because it represents our desires to:
            Establish the appropriate infrastructure and facilities to protect the
             health, safety, and welfare of the City’s businesses, visitors, and
             residents;
            Enhance the City’s image by providing a safe place to live, work,
             and play;
            Effectively respond to natural and man-made hazards and
             disasters; and
            Minimize any economic disruption and accelerate the City’s
             recovery following a disaster.

GOALS AND POLICIES
The following presents the goals and policies related to safety in the City
of San Bernardino:
Hazardous Materials and Waste
Hazardous materials are any materials that, because of their quantity,
concentration, physical or chemical characteristics, pose a significant
present or potential hazard to human health and safety or to the
environment if released into the environment.
The regulatory responsibility of hazardous waste in the City of San
Bernardino belongs primarily to the San Bernardino County Department
of Environmental Health. Hazardous waste falls into four general
categories of materials that have some distinct characteristics in the types Our Hazardous Materials team
of danger they present. These include materials that are:                    in training. Source: City of San
                                                                             Bernardino Website.
         •  toxic
         •  explosive
         •  reactive
         •  corrosive
The City’s goals and policies for hazardous materials and uses are
designed to ensure the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare,
and environmental resources in the City. Planning practices emphasize
waste reduction, recycling, proper management of hazardous materials,
siting of facilities, and effective emergency response.
1.       Hazardous Waste Management Plan
Hazardous waste and materials are stored, treated, and transported in the
City. As a result, the City implements a Hazardous Waste Management
Plan to ensure that these materials are handled properly. There are
processes in the preparation of the hazardous waste management plan that
include the assessment of the risk involved in dealing with hazardous
waste, which allows the City to make decisions on the level of risk it is
willing to accept.
The most comprehensive State legislation dealing with hazardous waste
materials is the Tanner Act (AB2498), adopted in 1986. Because of the
Tanner Act, the State Department of Health Services provides regulations
and procedures for hazardous waste materials operations and assists
City of San Bernardino                                                                          10-3

     counties with guidelines and funding for the preparation and adoption of
     local hazardous waste management plans. The preparation of local
     management plans in southern California is coordinated on a regional
     basis with the Southern California Hazardous Waste Management
     Authority.
     The San Bernardino County Fire Department is responsible for
     implementing the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan in the City
     of San Bernardino. Adopted in the early 1990’s, this plan established
     regulations at the local level for the creation, storage, and handling of
     hazardous waste material. The management plan provides the following
     components:
             •   Planning process for waste management
             •   Permit process for new and expanded facilities
             •   Appeal process to the State for certain local decisions
     The plan pertains to most of San Bernardino County and is included as an
     element in the County’s General Plan.
     Various departments in the City review plans for new development,
     including hazardous waste generators that might use the City sewer system
     for disposal of waste products. These departments are in a position to
     identify potential hazardous waste generators and advise them of the
     permits required prior to operation.
     Goal 10.1       Protect the environment, public health, safety, and
                     welfare from hazardous wastes.
     Policies:
     10.1.1          Employ effective emergency preparedness and emergency
                     response strategies to minimize the impacts from hazardous
                     materials emergencies, such as spills or contamination.
     10.1.2          Ensure the protection of surface and groundwater quality,
                     land resources, air quality, and environmentally sensitive
                     areas through safe transportation of waste through the City
                     and comprehensive planning of hazardous materials,
                     wastes, and sites.
     10.1.3          Execute long-range planning programs to protect resources
                     and the public from the potential impacts that could be
                     created by the use, storage, transport, and disposal of
                     hazardous waste and materials.
10-4                                                           City of San Bernardino

                                                                                10 Safety
10.1.4          Continue to support the role that the Fire and the Police
                Departments play in the on-site identification of hazardous
                wastes and emergency response to hazardous waste
                accidents in cooperation with the County Department of
                Environmental Health Services.
2.       Hazardous Waste Operations
The State Department of Health Services requires permits for the use,
storage or disposal of hazardous substances. The permit categories range
from the use of solvents and flammable material in the ordinary repair of
automobiles to the treatment or handling of hazardous wastes in large
quantities over prolonged periods of time. Operations that involve the
treatment of hazardous wastes or storage over long periods of time require
the issuance of a special permit by the State Department of Health
Services. As indicated, the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan is
refining permit criteria and standards that will vest the permit process to
the State.
There are several approved hazardous waste management companies
offering managing services to other companies in the City of San
Bernardino for the treatment, disposal or storage of hazardous material.
These companies have either received a permit or have been granted
interim status by the State of California pending review of the facilities for
compliance with federal and State regulations.
Goal 10.2       Promote proper operations of hazardous waste
                facilities and ensure regulations applicable to these
                facilities are enforced.
Policies:
10.2.1           Require the proper handling, treatment, movement, and
                disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous waste.
10.2.2          Encourage businesses to utilize practices and technologies
                that will reduce the generation of hazardous wastes at the
                source.
10.2.3          Implement federal, state, and local regulations for the
                disposal, handling, and storage of hazardous materials.
10.2.4          Work with the Department of Environmental Health
                Services to promote waste minimization, recycling, and use
                of best available technology in City businesses.
City of San Bernardino                                                         10-5
     10.2.5          Participate in the process of selecting routes that are the
                     most acceptable for the safe transportation of hazardous
                     waste material within the City limits. Streets with high
                     concentrations of people, such as the downtown, or with
                     sensitive facilities, such as schools and parks, should be
                     avoided to the maximum extent possible.
     3.      Household Hazardous Waste
     Hazardous materials are even in our homes. Many people don't realize it,
     but there are several common household items that are considered
     hazardous including medications, paint, motor oil, antifreeze, auto
     batteries, lawn care products, pest control products, drain cleaners, pool
     care products such as chlorine and acids, and household cleaners. These
     materials need to be used, stored, and disposed of in a safe and proper
     manner. When used properly, hazardous materials are normally not a
     problem. When used improperly, the results can be devastating. For
     example, some household cleaners may be harmful separately or when
     combined, such as ammonia and bleach. Flames caused by mixed
     household hazardous wastes improperly disposed of in curbside trash bins
     have injured City workers.
     City residents can take household hazardous waste to the San Bernardino
     International Airport and Trade Center (2824 East W Street, Bldg. 302) to
     properly dispose of household hazardous materials.
     Goal 10.3       Minimize risk of injuries or damages caused by
                     household hazardous wastes.
     10.3.1          Conduct educational programs to educate the public about
                     the proper handling and disposal of household hazardous
                     wastes.
     10.3.2          Enforce the proper disposal of Household Hazardous
                     Wastes.
10-6                                                          City of San Bernardino
                                                                               10 Safety
Surface and Subsurface Groundwater
Contamination
There are numerous sites in the City that have historically been subject to
the disposal of hazardous waste and have likely contaminated the
underlying groundwater. These sites may present an imminent danger to
surrounding areas. They are polluting the groundwater and in many
specific instances, they are polluting wells within the City. The pollution
of the City’s water system and the systems of other jurisdictions is a
potentially serious health problem that warrants special attention and
treatment.
Related to the issue of groundwater protection is the issue of minimizing
the effects of storm water and urban runoff pollution (SWURP). Not only
does storm water runoff affect local groundwater, it has the potential to
impact neighboring jurisdictions and the region. Unlike sewage, which
goes to treatment plants, urban runoff flows untreated through the storm
drain system. Anything thrown, swept or poured into the street, gutter or a
catch basin (the curbside openings that lead into the storm drain system)
can flow directly into our waterways. The problem is particularly acute
during heavy rains, but can be a problem at any time due to the improper
disposal of products associated with home, garden, and automotive
maintenance.
Water pollution is of national importance and the federal Clean Water Act
established the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit program to address the problem. The Clean Water Act
requires that cities “effectively prohibit non-stormwater discharges into
the storm sewers” and “require controls to reduce the discharge of
pollutants to the maximum extent practicable.” Cities are now required to
obtain NPDES permits to discharge their storm water into the storm drains
and implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) on new construction
in order to prevent illegal discharges to storm drains and runoff from
construction sites, restaurants, outdoor storage sites, and industrial areas.
Also see additional related discussion and policies in Chapter 9, Utilities.

     Goal 10.4 Minimize the threat of surface and subsurface water
               contamination and promote restoration of healthful
               groundwater resources.
     Policies:
     10.4.1    Promote integrated inter-agency review and participation in
               water resource evaluation and mitigation programs.
     10.4.2    Protect surface water and groundwater from contamination.
     10.4.3    Eliminate or remediate old sources of water contamination
               generated by hazardous materials and uses.
     10.4.4    Develop programs and incentives for prevention of
               groundwater contamination and clean up of known
               contaminated sites.
     Goal 10.5 Reduce urban run-off from new and existing
               development.
     Policies:
     10.5.1    Ensure compliance with the Federal Clean Water Act
               requirements for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
               System (NPDES) permits, including developing and
               requiring the development of Water Quality Management
               Plans for all new development and significant
               redevelopment in the City. (LU-1)
     10.5.2    Continue to implement an urban runoff reduction program
               consistent with regional and federal requirements, which
               includes requiring and encouraging the following:
               •   Increase permeable areas to allow more percolation of
                   runoff into the ground;
               •   Use natural drainage, detention ponds or infiltration pits
                   to collect runoff;
               •   Divert and catch runoff using swales, berms, green strip
                   filters, gravel beds and French drains;
               •   Install rain gutters and orient them towards permeable
                   surfaces;
               •   Construct property grades to divert flow to permeable
                   areas;

                •    Use subsurface areas for storm runoff either for reuse or
                     to enable release of runoff at predetermined times or
                     rates to minimize peak discharge into storm drains;
                •    Use porous materials, wherever possible, for
                     construction of driveways, walkways and parking lots;
                     and
                •    Divert runoff away from material and waste storage
                     areas and pollution-laden surfaces such as parking lots.
                     (LU-1)
10.5.3          Cooperate with surrounding jurisdictions and the County to
                provide adequate storm drainage facilities.
10.5.4          Require new development and significant redevelopment to
                utilize site preparation, grading and foundation designs that
                provide erosion control to prevent sedimentation and
                contamination of waterways. (LU-1)
10.5.5          Ensure compliance with the requirements for Storm Water
                Pollution Prevention Plans or Water Quality Management
                Plans for all new development or construction activities.
10.5.6          Coordinate with appropriate federal, state, and local
                resource agencies on development projects and
                construction activities affecting waterways and drainages.

                              Storm drains and flood control facilities within the City include: channels,
                              storm drains, street waterways, natural drainage courses, dams, basins, and
                              levees. Some streets in the City of San Bernardino are specifically
                              designed to accommodate storm flow. Flows carried within the street
                              right-of-way may cause localized flooding during storms, possibly making
                              some roads impassable during the storm event.
                              Storms are not the only cause of flooding within our City. Basements and
                              underground utility vaults may also experience flooding in areas between
                              the Santa Ana River and downtown due to the City’s existing high

Figure S-5 summarizes the general liquefaction susceptibilities for
maximum credible earthquakes occurring on the San Andreas, San
Jacinto, or Loma Linda/Glen Helen Faults. Two general zones, “high”
and “moderately-high to moderate” are depicted, and encompass almost
the entire south end of the City. High zones are concentrated adjacent to
the San Andreas Fault zone north and northeast of the City and in the old
artesian area between the San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults in the
central and southern parts of the City. In general, the old artesian area will
continue to experience the greatest groundwater fluctuations.
These zones delineate regional susceptibility and can vary greatly due to
groundwater level changes. Site-specific geotechnical reports are
necessary to determine site-specific liquefaction potential and possible
design mitigation.

3.       Hazardous Buildings
Ground shaking, fault rupture, or liquefaction pose threats to the
community during an earthquake. Buildings that house people or
buildings providing essential functions and services can be damaged,
imposing significant impacts to the City. Continuing advances in
engineering design and building code standards over the past decade have
greatly reduced the potential for collapse in an earthquake of most of our
new buildings. However, many of the City’s buildings were built before
some of the earthquake design standards were incorporated into the
building code, and as such, the City is home to numerous unreinforced
masonry buildings, pre-cast concrete buildings, soft-story structures, and
non-ductile concrete frame buildings in need of seismic mitigation.

The Unreinforced Masonry Law requires all cities and counties in Seismic
Zone 4 (CBC, 1998) to identify hazardous unreinforced masonry buildings
in their jurisdictions. Owners of such buildings must be notified of the
potential earthquake hazard, and mitigation must be performed. The
mitigation method, which may include retrofitting or demolition, is left to
the local jurisdiction.

                       an effective program for seismic upgrading of unreinforced
                       masonry buildings within the City.
      Geology and Soils
      Site-specific investigation of geologic and soils conditions are the City’s
      primary means of hazard evaluation and an important basis for developing
      effective mitigation of individual development projects through the
      planning and design. Standardized reporting procedures are necessary to
      assure consistency of hazard evaluation in the planning area.
      Data collected for an individual development site does not necessarily
      provide a complete picture of the regional geologic hazards affecting the
      site. A broader data base of geologic and soils information, derived from
      a variety of research, development, and excavation projects, would
      provide a broader perspective and significant insights on potential
      development hazards, that can be utilized on a regional scale for land use
      planning.
      1.       Subsidence
      Subsidence can be caused by natural geologic processes or by human
      activity such as subsurface mining or pumping of groundwater or oil.
      Historic and potential ground subsidence areas within the San Bernardino
      planning area are depicted in Figure S-6. The City’s historic subsidence
      area was located within the thick, poorly consolidated alluvial and marsh
      deposits of the old artesian area north of Loma Linda. Potential
      subsidence within this area may be as great as five to eight feet if
      unreplenished groundwater is depleted from the Bunker Hill-San Timoteo
      Basin. Since 1972, the San Bernardino Municipal Water District has
      maintained groundwater levels from recharge to percolation basins that, in
      turn, filter back into the alluvial deposits. Problems with ground
      subsidence have not been identified since the groundwater recharge
      program began.

2.       Landslides
General slope stability is determined by a number of factors including
slope, vegetative cover, wildfire, bedrock, soil, precipitation, and human
alteration. Slopes may be in temporary equilibrium until one of the above
factors is modified resulting in an unstable condition and potential failure.
Slope stability studies of the San Bernardino planning area were
conducted by Morton (1974) and Miller (1979) and include general
descriptions of slope areas along with accompanying maps. Generalized
slopes are subdivided into areas of low relief, areas of moderate relief, and
areas of high relief. Generalized landslide susceptibility in the City is
considered low to moderate. A combination of the generalized slope
categories and the generalized landslide susceptibility areas results in two
potentially hazardous zones. These zones are mapped in Figure S-7 and
include:
        Areas of low relief with low to moderate susceptibility that may
         contain small-scale surficial soil slips, debris flow, and mudflows
         on steep slopes.
        Areas of moderate and high relief with low to moderate
         susceptibility that may contain small to large rotational slides,
         debris slide, and combinations of surficial slides and flows. These
         areas contain individual landslides that have been included on the
         regional slope stability and landslides map.
Potential slope failures in the above areas could be hazardous to buildings,
reservoirs, roads, and utilities. Seismic shaking may also include slope
failure.
Goal 10.9        Minimize exposure to and risks from geologic
                 activities.
Policies:
10.9.1           Minimize risk to life and property by properly identifying

Wind
The City is subject to extremely high winds, which have resulted in
significant property damage. For example, portions of roofs and block
walls have been broken and blown away and public utility structures such
as power lines and traffic signals have been damaged.
The most significant wind problems occur at the canyon mouths and
valleys extending downslope from the San Bernardino Mountains. The
highest velocities are associated with downslope canyon and Santa Ana
winds (90-100 mph).
The Santa Ana wind conditions are a reversal of the prevailing
southwesterly winds and usually occur on a region-wide basis during late
summer and early fall. Santa Ana’s are dry, warm winds that flow from
the higher desert elevations in the north through the mountain passes and
canyons. As they converge through the canyons, their velocities increase.
Consequently, peak velocities are highest at the mouths of the canyons and
dissipate as they spread across the valley floor.
High winds exacerbate brush fire conditions. Of the major fires in the San
Bernardino Mountains, all have occurred during periods of high winds.
New development in the foothill areas and valleys will expose buildings
and population to significant wind hazards.
The high wind velocity and property damage potential have resulted in the
northern half of the City adjacent to the mountains being classified by the
City as a “High Wind Area” (Figure S-8). In this area of the City,
stringent conditions for the construction of buildings and public facilities
are applied. Due to various topographic conditions, wind velocities vary
throughout the City; however, building standards remain constant. A
detailed study may reveal localized wind patterns that merit different
structural standards.
Goal 10.10      Protect people and property from the adverse impacts
                of winds.

      10.10.6 Construct public infrastructure (lighting poles, street lights,
              bridges, etc.) to withstand extreme wind velocities in High
              Wind Hazard areas.
      10.10.7 Maintain police, fire, medical, and other pertinent programs
              to respond to wind-caused emergencies.
      10.10.8 Initiate a review of the wind hazard potential as it applies to
              various parts of the City and, if merited, tailor the design
              standards accordingly.

Urban and Wildland Fires
Fires in undeveloped areas result from the ignition of accumulated brush
and woody materials, and are appropriately termed “wildland fires”. Such
fires can burn large areas and cause a great deal of damage to both
structures and valuable open space land. Urban fires usually result from       Foothill Fire Zone
                                                                               Overlay

      The danger from wildland fires in foothill locations is increased by the
      number of structures and encroachment of new development in the hillside
      areas. Specific concerns include the density of development, spacing of
      structures, brush clearance, building materials, access to buildings by fire
      equipment, adequacy of evacuation routes, property maintenance, and
      water availability. The capacity of the water systems to provide sufficient
      water to fight fires is also a significant issue.
      The U.S. Department of Forestry has records of wildland fires dating back
      to the beginning of the 20th century. The data indicates that fires occur on
      a regular basis almost every year and that very large fires occur
      approximately every ten years. According to the Department of Forestry,
      the large fires correspond to the age of the vegetation which, if not burned
      regularly, begins to accumulate dead material that is more easily ignited
      and spreads fire faster than newer growth.
      Consequently, a decade can pass with few fires followed by a decade with
      several large fires. The occurrence of the largest fires also corresponds to
      periods of extremely high wind conditions. This was seen in 2003 Old
      Waterman Canyon fire, the largest fire in recent history, which destroyed
      approximately 330 residential properties, and the Panorama fire in 1980,
      which destroyed 345 structures and killed four people. Many of the areas
      burned during the Panorama fire were again burned in 2003.
      The large fires that are spread by winds periodically approaching and
      exceeding 90 to 100 miles per hour are considered uncontrollable by the
      California Department of Forestry and U.S. Forest Service. Other areas in
      southern California are being burned off periodically by way of controlled
      burns to remove older vegetation. The controlled burn process is used
      very carefully in the San Bernardino Mountains because of the
      unpredictability and force of the winds in the area that could make
      controlled burns a potential hazard.
      Goal 10.11       Protect people and property from urban and wildland

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Advance preparation for potential disasters can prevent severe loss of life
and property from catastrophic events. The proper preparations improve
the City’s ability to respond to emergency situations created by these
occurrences.
Preparation, however, is only the first step in the management of hazards
and disasters. Once a disaster has occurred, the capability of the City to
respond to the situation at hand affects how quickly the City can recover
from impacts.
1.       Emergency Management Plan
The City of San Bernardino Emergency Plan details the functional
responsibilities and interactions of the federal, state, and local
governmental agencies as well as private organizations in the event of
natural and/or human-related disasters. Included within the natural
disaster category are earthquakes, geologic hazards, floods, and fires.
Potential human-related disasters include hazardous materials incident,
nuclear attack, and transportation-related accidents.
Within the Emergency Management Plan, potential hazards are described,
the possible effects delineated, and recommended mitigations are
discussed where applicable. Post-disaster aid, reconstruction, and
financial assistance are also discussed.
2.       Hazard Mitigation Plan
The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000), Section 322 (a-d),
requires that local governments, as a condition of receiving federal
disaster mitigation funds, adopt a mitigation plan that describes the
process for identifying hazards, risks, and vulnerabilities, identifies and
prioritizes mitigation actions, encourages the development of local
mitigation, and provides technical support for those efforts. In response to
this and the requirements of the State of California Office of Emergency
Services and the San Bernardino County Office of Emergency Services,
we have prepared the San Bernardino Hazard Mitigation Plan. While we
cannot prevent natural disasters from occurring, we can reduce/eliminate
their effects through the well organized public education and awareness
effort, preparedness, and mitigation set forth in the Hazard Mitigation
Plan.

      3.       Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Planning
      The San Bernardino City Fire Department has a Hazardous Materials
      Response Team specially trained and equipped to handle hazardous
      materials releases that have adverse effects on lives, the environment, and
      property within the City of San Bernardino. A release is any spilling,
      leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting,
      escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment, unless
      permitted or authorized by a regulatory agency.
      If the fire and police departments determine that an incident requires
      special expertise and equipment, they may request assistance from the
      Countywide Haz Mat Team of the County Environmental Health
      Department. The Haz Mat Team includes a minimum of two fire
      specialists and two environmental health specialists who perform hazard
      identification, risk assessment, and actual control measures. Haz Mat is a
      cooperative organization structure that is intended to bring the maximum
      available equipment and special expertise to any given emergency
      situation.
      Goal 10.12       Ensure the availability and effective response of
                       emergency services in the event of a disaster.
      Policies:
      10.12.1          Maintain a functional City emergency response plan that
                       addresses all hazards.
      10.12.2          Implement the City of San Bernardino Hazard Mitigation

                       implementation of community education and self-help
                       programs. (S-4)
      10.12.5          Prevent serious damage and injuries through effective
                       hazard mitigation.
      10.12.6          Maintain mutual aid agreements with neighboring cities
                       and the County of San Bernardino and develop partnerships
                       to respond to disaster with other emergency relief
                       organizations.

Chapter 11. Historical and
Archaeological Resources
INTRODUCTION
A Historical and Archaeological Resources Element is not a required
element of the General Plan by state law, but a desirable one. The purpose
of incorporating the Historical and Archaeological Resources Element into
the General Plan is to provide the basis for enabling legislation that will
allow the City of San Bernardino to effectively preserve, enhance, and
maintain sites and structures that have been deemed architecturally,
historically, archaeologically, and/or culturally significant. This is
critically important in our City since it contains many older structures and
historic sites, which may be threatened with demolition or removal.
Purpose
The Historical and Archaeological Resources Element provides policy
guidance that addresses the preservation and reuse of the City’s historic
and archaeological resources.
Relationship to Other Elements
The Historical and Archaeological Resources Element is closely linked
with the Land Use and Natural Resources Elements. Together, these
Elements address the preservation and enhancement of our historical
resources.

     Historic Resources in San Bernardino
     Properties that should be regarded as historic resources for planning
     purposes in any community can be expected to change as buildings and
     neighborhoods age and new historic themes are identified. Consequently,
     no static list or combination of lists of historic properties alone can form a
     sufficient basis the identification of historic resources. Each existing list
     should be thought of as merely as a starting point, which may suggest the
     appropriateness of further study, identification, and evaluation.
     The following are some of the more important historic resource reference
     documents available to the City:
     Historic Resources Reconnaissance Survey. Although it was last
     conducted in 1991, the Historic Resources Reconnaissance Survey
     provides for the most complete overview of historically significant
     properties and neighborhoods within the City that were considered
     historically sensitive at the time of its adoption. As such, it forms the
     single most important resource to the City for historic preservation
     planning.
     State Historic Resources Inventory. Maintained by the California Office
     of Historic Preservation, this list includes all properties evaluated in State-
     sponsored survey projects and undertakings requiring Federal
     environmental review. Current copies of this tabular list can be obtained
     from the San Bernardino Archaeological Information Center in Redlands.
     Environmental Impact Reports and Special Studies. EIRs, EISs, and
     other environmental documents may include determinations of eligibility
     for historic properties within the City.
     National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listings. Current NRHP
     listings for the City can be obtained online from the National Park Service.
     Examples of properties within the City listed on the NRHP are the Santa
     Fe Railway Passenger and Freight Depot, the San Bernardino County
     Courthouse, and the U.S. Post Office Downtown Station.
     State Landmarks and Points of Interest listings. Current State landmarks
     can be obtained online from the California Office of Historic Preservation.
     A current Points of Interest list can be obtained by contacting the Office of

Regulatory Setting for Historic Resources
Management
1.       State Regulations: The California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires evaluation of
project impacts on historic resources, including properties “listed in, or
determined eligible for listing in, the California Register of Historical
Resources [or] included in a local register of historical resources.” A
resource is eligible for listing on the California Register of Historical
Resources if it meets any of the following criteria:
        Is associated with events that have made a significant contribution
         to the broad patterns of California's history and cultural heritage;
        Is associated with the lives of persons important in our past;
        Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, region,
         or method of construction, or represents the work of an important
         creative individual, or possesses high artistic values; or
        Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
         prehistory or history.
The California Register may also include properties listed in “local
registers” of historic properties. A “local register of historic resources” is
broadly defined in §5020.1 (k), as “a list of properties officially
designated or recognized as historically significant by a local government
pursuant to a local ordinance or resolution.” Local registers of historic
properties come essentially in two forms: (1) surveys of historic resources
conducted by a local agency in accordance with Office of Historic
Preservation procedures and standards, adopted by the local agency and
maintained as current, and (2) landmarks designated under local
ordinances or resolutions. (Public Resources Code §§ 5024.1, 21804.1,
15064.5)
By definition, the California Register of Historical Resources also includes
all “properties formally determined eligible for, or listed in, the National
Register of Historic Places,” and certain specified State Historical
Landmarks. The majority of “formal determinations” of NRHP eligibility
occur when properties are evaluated by the State Office of Historic
City of San Bernardino                                                                           11-5

     Preservation in connection with federal environmental review procedures
     (Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966). Formal
     determinations of eligibility also occur when properties are nominated to
     the NRHP, but are not listed due to the absence of owner consent.
     The criteria for determining eligibility for listing on the National Register
     of Historic Places (NRHP) have been developed by the National Park
     Service. Properties may qualify for NRHP listing if they:
             Are associated with events that have made a significant
              contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or
             Are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
             Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method
              of construction or that represent the work of a master, or that
              possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
              distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
              distinction; or
             Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
              prehistory or history.
     According to the National Register of Historic Places guidelines, the
     “essential physical features” of a property must be present for it to convey
     its significance. Further, in order to qualify for the NRHP, a resource must
     retain its integrity, or “the ability of a property to convey its significance.”
     The seven aspects of integrity are: Location (the place where the historic
     property was constructed or the place where the historic event occurred);
     Design (the combination of elements that create the form, plan, space,
     structure, and style of a property); Setting (the physical environment of a
     historic property); Materials (the physical elements that were combined or
     deposited during a particular period of time and in a particular pattern or
     configuration to form a historic property); Workmanship (the physical
     evidence of the crafts of a particular culture or people during any given
     period of history or prehistory); Feeling (a property’s expression of the
     aesthetic or historic sense of a particular period of time), and; Association
     (the direct link between an important historic event or person and a
     historic property).
     The relevant aspects of integrity depend upon the National Register
     criteria applied to a property. For example, a property nominated under
     Criterion A (events), would be likely to convey its significance primarily
     through integrity of location, setting, and association. A property
11-6                                                            City of San Bernardino

                                                                11 Historical and Archaeological Resources
nominated solely under Criterion C (design) would usually rely primarily
upon integrity of design, materials, and workmanship. The California
Register procedures include similar language with regard to integrity.
                                                                                     Requirement for CEQA
The minimum age criterion for the National Register of Historic Places               Review
(NRHP) and the California Register of Historical Resources (CRHR) is 50
years. Properties less than 50 years old may be eligible for listing on the          Public Resources Code
                                                                                     §21084.1 establishes historic

culturally significant.”
A lead agency is responsible for the identification of “potentially feasible
measures to mitigate significant adverse changes in the significance of an
historical resource.” The most current CEQA guidelines adopted in 1999
clarify what types of measures may constitute mitigation of impacts to less
than significant levels, and brings the guidelines into conformance with
recent court decisions in this respect. In particular, the guidelines specify a
methodology for determining if impacts are mitigated to less than
significant levels. These are the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving,
Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings and the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for
City of San Bernardino                                                                                11-7

     Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (1995), publications of the National Park
     Service. (PRC §15064.5(b)(3-4))
     The purpose of citing the Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines and
     Standards in this context is twofold. First, the Guidelines and Standards
     have been developed and refined over a period of several decades, and
     have become widely accepted as cornerstones of the practice of
     professional historic preservation in the United States. Secondly, the
     Guidelines and Standards direct the development of mitigation measures
     towards the substance of historic preservation, and away from palliative
     measures, such as the documentation of destroyed historic properties.
     2.       Federal Regulations: Section 106 of the Historic
              Preservation Act of 1966
     Section 106 of the Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (36 CFR Part 800)
     requires that federal agencies take into account the effects of their
     undertakings on historic properties, and to provide the Advisory Council
     on Historic Preservation with an opportunity to comment on such
     undertakings when the effects are considered to be adverse. These
     regulations were last revised on a comprehensive basis in May 1999.
     By reference, Section 106 reporting responsibilities also apply to local
     agencies utilizing federal funds for local projects, such as housing
     rehabilitation projects conducted with Community Development Block
     Grant funding. The federal agency undertaking the project is technically
     responsible for compliance with the Section 106 regulations; however, in
     practice, the technical steps required to comply are delegated to the local
     agency expending the federal monies.
     The first step in the Section 106 process is the identification and
     evaluation of historic properties within the Area of Potential Effect (APE).
     This impact zone is defined in the regulations as “the geographic area or
     areas within which an undertaking may cause changes in the character or
     use of historic properties, if any such properties exist,” and will vary
     depending on the scope of the undertaking and the character of the site and
     environs. Historic properties are defined for the purposes of Section 106 as
     properties listed, or eligible for listing, on the National Register of Historic
     Places, and may include individually eligible buildings, structures, objects,
     sites, or districts. Agencies are encouraged to consult with local
     governments, groups and individuals with knowledge and interest in
     historic properties during the determination of eligibility phase.
     The agency is required to consult with the State Historic Preservation
     Officer (SHPO) on determinations of eligibility, who is granted a limited
11-8                                                           City of San Bernardino

                                                               11 Historical and Archaeological Resources
period during which the SHPO may state concurrence or non-concurrence
with the agency’s opinion. Failing any stated view by the SHPO, the
SHPO is presumed to agree with the agency. Unresolved disagreements
between the SHPO and the agency on the question of eligibility are
resolved by a request by the agency to the Keeper of the National Register
for a formal determination of eligibility.
If historic properties are found to exist within the APE, the agency must
determine if the undertaking will have an effect on the historic properties.
An undertaking is seen to have an effect on an historic property, “when the
undertaking may alter, directly or indirectly, the characteristics of a
historic property that may qualify the property for inclusion in the
National Register.” [36 CFR 800.5(a)(1)] The agency is required to
characterize the undertaking as having either “no effect,” an “adverse
effect” or “no adverse effect,” based on the Criteria for Adverse Effect
detailed at 36 CFR 800.5(a)(2). Adverse effects include the physical
destruction, damage, or alteration of the historic property, isolation from
its historic setting, the introduction of out-of-character visual, audible or
atmospheric elements, or the neglect, transfer, sale or lease of the historic
property. Federal agencies are once again encouraged to consult with local
governments, groups and individuals with knowledge and interest in
historic properties during the determination of effects phase. [36 CFR
800.6 (a)]
If an adverse effect occurs, the agency is required to consult with the
SHPO in order to develop methods to reduce the harmfulness of the
undertaking. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation must also be
notified by the agency of the finding of adverse effect, and should invite
the Council’s participation in the consultation. This consultation process
will sometimes result in a Memorandum of Agreement between the
agency and SHPO. Failing agreement between the SHPO and the agency,
the regulations provide for the participation of Advisory Council on a
request basis.
City of San Bernardino                                                                          11-9

      ACHIEVING THE VISION
      From the Arrowhead to the Depot, San Bernardino has a rich and diverse
      history that we want to celebrate and capitalize upon. Like many other
      older communities in southern California, virtually all areas within the
      City now have to address issues arising from the changing characteristics
      of the community, as the ongoing wave of growth poses a continuous
      challenge to properly identify and preserve important historical aspects of
      the City’s heritage. Salient among these issues is the preservation of key
      landmarks and revitalization of San Bernardino’s historic era downtown.
      Fortunately, these issues are by no means unique to San Bernardino.
      Since the mid-1960s, precisely for the purpose of meeting such challenges
      brought about by accelerating growth, both the federal and state
      authorities have created a number statutes, regulations, and programs to
      help local communities preserve their historical and cultural heritage. The
      City of San Bernardino has taken advantage of some of these
      opportunities, while others remain to be implemented.
      The Historical and Archeological Resources Element is responsive to our
      Vision because it represents our stated desires to:
             Enjoy the social benefits of historic preservation that come in the
              form of increased community pride;
             Realize a recognizable identity for San Bernardino that come from
              a popular interest in the community’s past;
             Create a rich cultural community in which we will be able
              experience the City’s past;
             Enhance property values and increase economic and financial
              benefits in the older parts of our City; and
             Create a unique environment that attracts investments and visitors
              through historic preservation, adaptive reuse, and compatible
              design controls.
11-10                                                         City of San Bernardino

                                                               11 Historical and Archaeological Resources
GOALS AND POLICIES
Since 1989, we have met several historic preservation goals. Most
significantly, we completed a Historic Resources Reconnaissance Survey
Report in 1991, which is contained in five volumes and available at the
City Hall. Also accomplished were the adoption of the Main Street
Overlay District, a Historic Building Demolition Ordinance, the Historic
Depot District Concept Improvement Plan, and, by ordinance, the waiver
of fees charged for permits issued for repairs, alterations or additions
related to the preservation or rehabilitation of a qualified historical
property.
However, there are still steps we can take to strengthen our historic
preservation efforts: from updating historic surveys, to creating additional
incentives for historic preservation, to increasing public awareness about
our resources. The following presents the goals and policies for historic
and archeological issues in the City of San Bernardino planning area.
Preservation Program
Goal 11.1       Develop a program to protect, preserve, and restore
                the sites, buildings and districts that have
                architectural, historical, archaeological, and/or cultural
                significance.
Policies:
11.1.1          Develop a comprehensive historic preservation plan that
                includes:
                •   Adoption of a Preservation Ordinance that authorizes
                    the City to designate resources deemed to be of
                    significance as a City Historical landmark or district.
                •   Establishment of a Historic Resources Commission that
                    will review and recommend preservation ordinances,
                    design standards, and historical designations of
                    resources.
                •   Adoption of the Secretary of Interior Standards for
                    Historic Rehabilitation and the standards and guidelines
                    as prescribed by the State Office of Historic
                    Preservation as design standards for alterations to
                    historic resources.
City of San Bernardino                                                                          11-11

             •   Establishment of a design review process for potential
                 development projects in or adjacent to Historic
                 Preservation Overlay Zones. (A-1 and HAR-1, 2, 3, and
                 4)
      11.1.2 Maintain and update the Historic Resources
             Reconnaissance Survey database files of historic,
             architectural, and cultural resources conducted in 1991, and
             integrate it into the City’s ordinance and environmental
             review process. Prior to public distribution, Native
             American tribes should be consulted to address any issues
             of confidentiality. (A-1)
      11.1.3 Consider, within the environmental review process,
             properties that may have become historically significant
             since completion of the survey in 1991. (LU-1)
      11.1.4 Compile and maintain an inventory, based on the survey, of
             the Planning Area’s significant historic, architectural and
             cultural resources. Prior to public distribution, Native
             American tribes should be consulted to address any issues
             of confidentiality.
      11.1.5 Continue to adopt historic district and overlay zone
             ordinances as described in the Historic Resources
             Reconnaissance Survey Report. Consider the designation of
             Historic Districts and Historic Overlay Zones as described
             in the Historic Resources Reconnaissance Survey Report.
      11.1.6 Consider the need for a comprehensive survey for
             Downtown as well as establishing priorities for future
             intensive-level surveys.
      11.1.7 Require that all City-owned properties containing or
             adjacent to historic resources be maintained in a manner
             that is aesthetically and/or functionally compatible with
             such resources.
      11.1.8 Continue to develop design standards for commercial areas,
             similar to those in the Main Street Overlay District, which
             promotes the removal of tacked-on facades and
             inappropriate signage, the restoration of original facades,
             and designs that complement the historic pattern.

11.1.9          Require that an environmental review be conducted on all
                applications (e.g. grading, building, and demolition) for
                resources designated or potentially designated as significant
                in order to ensure that these sites are preserved and
                protected. (LU-1)

      Historic Protection
      Goal 11.4 Protect and enhance our historic and cultural
                resources.
      Policies:
      11.4.1    Encourage the preservation, maintenance, enhancement,
                and reuse of existing buildings in redevelopment and
                commercial areas; the retention and renovation of existing
                residential buildings; and the relocation of existing
                residential buildings when retention on-site is deemed not
                to be feasible.

Policies:
11.5.1          Complete an inventory of areas of archaeological
                sensitivity in the planning area. Prior to public distribution,
                Native American tribes should be consulted to address any
                issues of confidentiality.
11.5.2          Develop mitigation measures for projects located in
                archaeologically sensitive areas to protect such locations,
                remove artifacts, and retain them for educational display.
                Native American tribes should be consulted to determine

Chapter 12. Natural Resources
and Conservation
INTRODUCTION
San Bernardino values the preservation of natural resources, wildlife
habitat, and air quality. Our scenic resources and wildlife habitat areas
provide recreational and ecological benefits, as well as a source of
aesthetic enjoyment. San Bernardino strives to ensure that demands on
natural resources made today do not compromise the needs of tomorrow.
These resources are important to us, and through the strategies and
policies outlined in this Element, we will work to preserve and protect our
existing resources and to capture new resources as they become available.
With assistance from interested organizations, creative solutions will be
discovered and implemented to preserve sensitive habitat areas.
Purpose
The Goals and Policies in this element are intended to maintain, improve,
or preserve the quality and supply of the City’s natural resources. This
Element addresses the following topics:
        Biological Resources,
        Natural Features,
        Mineral Resources, and
        Air Quality.
City of San Bernardino                                                                      12-1

     Relationship to Other Elements
     The Natural Resources and Conservation Element is linked to two other
     General Plan Elements: Circulation and Land Use. Air quality can be
     significantly impacted by the emissions of automobiles. The Circulation
     Element strives to outline effective and efficient circulation routes and
     alternative transportation opportunities that can help reduce the impacts
     vehicles create on San Bernardino’s air quality. The Land Use Element
     designates land uses within the City, and will explore the compatibility of
     proposed land uses with the mineral extraction uses and biological
     resources identified in this chapter.
     ACHIEVING THE VISION
     The City’s vision recognizes that the distinctive nature of San Bernardino
     is created not only by its people and developments, but also by the breadth
     of its natural features. As San Bernardino continues to develop, pressure
     to convert or encroach into natural resources will increase. It will be vital
     for us to remember that the preservation of these natural resources will
     enhance the social, physical, environmental, and economic quality of life
     for residents, thus reinforcing the City’s vision to “Celebrate the past,
     value the present, and create opportunities for the future.”
     The natural resources element is responsive to the vision because it strives
     to:
            Minimize impacts to biological resources and natural features from
             new development;
            Utilize mineral resources efficiently; and
            Enhance quality of life by reducing harmful emissions and
             maintaining air quality.

                                                                  12 Natural Resources and Conservation
GOALS AND POLICIES
Following are the goals and policies related to the natural resources of San
Bernardino:
Biological Resources
A great variety of sensitive biological elements are known to exist or
potentially occur within our City. Many of these sensitive elements are
closely associated with the aquatic and woodland communities of the San
Bernardino Mountains and the Santa Ana River and its tributaries.
However, it should be noted that sensitive elements might occur in
virtually any of the remaining non-urban habitats within the City. Since
there are areas of the City that contain significant plant and wildlife
species, the City will need to balance the preservation of sensitive habitats
with the need for new development.
Much of the valley and upland areas has undergone extensive disturbance
by agricultural and urban land uses, and therefore, supports a decreased
diversity of plant and animal life. Upland areas which remain undisturbed
or which have not been disturbed for some time support inland coastal
sagebrush scrub vegetation and a variety of wildlife. This diversity is
somewhat lessened in areas that are small and fragmented; however,
adjacent “urban woodlands” and windrows tend to augment this diversity.
Alluvial fans and floodplains of the valley floor support distinctive scrub
vegetation containing an assortment of shrubs characteristic of both
coastal sagebrush and chaparral communities. Such areas are high quality
habitat for a variety of wildlife and support the only known occurrences of
two plant species that have recently been declared federally endangered:
the Santa Ana River Wooly Star and the Slender-horned spine flower.
Above the valley floor and uplands are deep canyons that support riparian
and oak woodland habitats. Woodlands provide a high quality habitat for
a diverse assemblage of wildlife species. Large mammals such as coyote,
bobcat, deer, and occasionally mountain lion and bear descend from the
mountains along these canyon corridors.
The canyons and mountain slopes along the northern edge of our City
support mainly chaparral and woodland vegetation whose relatively
undisturbed nature, together with their contiguity with similar large areas
of the San Bernardino National Forest, enhances the viability of these
mountain areas as wildlife habitat.
City of San Bernardino                                                                       12-3

     Goal 12.1 Conserve and enhance San Bernardino’s biological
               resources.
     Policies:
     12.1.1    Acquire and maintain current information regarding the
               status and location of sensitive biological elements (species
               and natural communities) within the planning area, as
               shown on Figure NRC-1. (NR-3)
     12.1.2    Site and develop land uses in a manner that is sensitive to
               the unique characteristics of and that minimizes the impacts
               upon sensitive biological resources. (LU-1)
     12.1.3    Require that all proposed land uses in the “Biological
               Resource Management Area” (BRM), Figure NRC-2, be
               subject to review by the Environmental Review Committee
               (ERC).
     12.1.4    Require that development in the BRM:
               a. Submit a report prepared by a qualified professional(s)
                   that addresses the proposed project’s impact on
                   sensitive species and habitat, especially those that are
                   identified in State and Federal conservation programs;
               b. Identify mitigation measures necessary to eliminate
                   significant adverse impacts to sensitive biological
                   resources;
               c. Define a program for monitoring, evaluating the
                   effectiveness of, and ensuring the adequacy of the
                   specified mitigation measures; and
               d. Discuss restoration of significant habitats.
     Goal 12.2 Protect riparian corridors to provide habitat for fish
               and wildlife.
     Policies:
     12.2.1    Prohibit development and grading within fifty (50) feet of
               riparian corridors, as identified by a qualified biologist,
               unless no feasible alternative exists. (LU-1)

12.2.2          Generally permit the following uses within riparian
                corridors:
                a. Education and research, excluding buildings and other
                    structures;
                b. Passive (non mechanized) recreation;
                c. Trails and scenic overlooks on public land(s);
                d. Fish and wildlife management activities;
                e. Necessary water supply projects;
                f. Resource consumptive uses as provided for in the Fish
                    and Game Code and Title 14 of the California
                    Administrative Code;
                g. Flood control projects where no other methods are
                    available to protect the public safety;
                h. Bridges and pipelines when supports are not in
                    significant conflict with corridor resources. (LU-1)
12.2.3          Pursue voluntary open space or conservation easements to
                protect sensitive species or their habitats. (NR-1)
12.2.4          Development adjacent to riparian corridors shall:
                a. Minimize removal of vegetation;
                b. Minimize erosion, sedimentation, and runoff by
                    appropriate protection or vegetation and landscape;
                c. Provide for sufficient passage of native and
                    anadromous fish as specified by the California
                    Department of Fish and Game;
                d. Minimize wastewater discharges and entrapment;
                e. Prevent groundwater depletion or substantial
                    interference with surface and subsurface flows; and
                    provide for natural vegetation buffers.
12.2.5          Permit modification of the boundaries of the designated
                riparian corridors based on field research and aerial
                interpretation data as part of biological surveys.

Goal 12.3       Establish open space corridors between and to
                protected wildlands.
Policies:
12.3.1          Identify areas and formulate recommendations for the
                acquisition of property, including funding, to establish a
                permanent corridor contiguous to the National Forest via
                Cable Creek and/or Devil Canyon. The City shall consult
                with various federal, state and local agencies and City
                departments prior to the adoption of any open space
                corridor plan.
12.3.2          Seek to acquire real property rights of open space corridor
                parcels identified as being suitable for acquisition. (NR-1)
12.3.3          Establish the following habitat types as high-priority for
                acquisition as funds are available:
                a. Habitat of endangered species;
                b. Alluvial scrub vegetation;
                c. Riparian vegetation dominated by willow, alder,

                d. Native walnut woodlands.
12.3.4          Preserve and enhance the natural characteristics of the
                Santa Ana River, City Creek, and Cajon Creek as habitat
                areas.
12.3.5          Prevent further loss of existing stands of Santa Ana River
                Wooly-star (Eriastrum densifolium sanctorum) and
                Slender-horned Centrostegia (Centrostegia leptoceras).

                               Mineral extraction is an important component of San Bernardino’s
                               economy. In 1975, the State legislature adopted the Surface Mining and
                               Reclamation Act (SMARA). This designated Mineral Resources Zones
                               that were of State-wide or regional importance. Classification of land
                               within California takes place according to a priority list established by the
                               State Mining and Geology Board (SMGB). The classifications used by the
                               state to define MRZs are as follows:
                                       MRZ-1: Areas where the available geologic information indicates
                                        no significant mineral deposits or a minimal likelihood of
                                        significant mineral deposits.
                                       MRZ-2: Areas where the available geologic information indicates
                                        that there are significant mineral deposits or that there is a
                                        likelihood of significant mineral deposits.

Several areas within the San Bernardino region have been classified as
Mineral Resource Zone 2 (MRZ-2). MRZ-2 areas indicate the existence
of a construction aggregate deposit that meets certain State criteria for
value and marketability based solely on geologic factors. By statute, the
Board does not utilize “existing land uses” as criteria in its classification
of Mineral Resource Zones. This may often result in the classification of
MRZs that are already developed in a variety of uses and intensities,
rendering these areas unsuitable for mineral production. These Mineral
Resource areas are mapped in Figure NRC-3.
Goal 12.4        Properly manage designated areas for mineral
                 extraction to meet the needs of the area.
Policies:
12.4.1           Continue to document current extraction sites, including
                 sand and gravel quarries, including the status and duration
                 of existing permits and approvals.
12.4.2           Impose conditions and enforce mitigation measures on
                 mining operations to reduce dust, noise, and safety hazards
                 associated with removal of construction aggregate and
                 minimize impacts on adjacent properties and environmental
                 resources.
12.4.3           Determine and designate approved access routes to and
                 from mineral resource sectors to minimize the impacts to
                 vehicular circulation on City streets.
12.4.4           Require that any applications to permit uses other than
                 mineral extraction or the interim uses defined in areas
                 designated IE, Industrial Extractive, include findings to be
                 prepared by the project proponent outlining the reasons
                 why mining is not a feasible use and how the deletion of
                 the area as a potential mineral resource supply impacts the
                 regional supply of aggregate resources.
City of San Bernardino                                                                              12-13

      12.4.5 Require that the operation and reclamation of surface mines
             be consistent with the State Surface Mining and
             Reclamation Act (SMARA) and the Development Code.
      12.4.6 Designate post aggregate extraction reclamation procedures
             to mitigate potential environmental impacts and safety
             hazards. Long-term monitoring of the effectiveness of the
             reclamation procedures should be considered as an integral
             part of the program.
      12.4.7 Restrict incompatible land uses within the impact area of
             existing or potential surface mining areas.
      12.4.8 Require that new, non-mining land uses adjacent to existing
             mining operations be designed to provide a buffer between
             the new development and the mining operations. The
             buffer distance shall be based on an evaluation of noise,
             aesthetics, drainage, operating conditions, biological
             resources, topography, lighting, traffic, operating hours,
             and air quality. (LU-1)

Air Quality
The quality of air that we breathe directly affects our health, environment,
and quality of life. Air pollutants can cause mild to severe health effects
and respiratory illnesses. Just as people are affected by air pollution, so
too are plants and animals. For instance, plants and trees may absorb air
pollutants that can stunt or kill them. Pollutants may also lower visibility
and cause property damage, discolor painted surfaces, eat away at stones
used in buildings, and dissolve mortar that holds brick structures together.
Our air quality is largely dependent upon climatic conditions. The
distinctive climate of the basin is determined by its terrain, latitude, and
coastal location. The general region lies in the semi-permanent high-
pressure zone of the eastern Pacific, resulting in a mild climate tempered
by cool sea breezes. This mild climatic pattern is interrupted infrequently
by periods of extremely hot weather, winter storms, or Santa Ana winds.
The airshed is a scarce, non-renewable resource that has become so
polluted in southern California that its conservation is of critical concern.
Though the City of San Bernardino is a small part of the total South Coast
Air Basin and cannot mitigate the regional problem alone, it can take
actions to incrementally reduce its share of emissions and protect its
residents.
Pollutant Sources and Types
Pollutants are emitted into the air from stationary and mobile sources.
1.       Stationary Sources
Stationary sources can be divided into two major subcategories: point
sources and area sources. Point sources consist of one or more emission
sources at a facility with an identified location and are usually associated
with manufacturing and industrial processing plants. Area sources
produce many small emissions (e.g., residential water heaters,
architectural coatings), which are distributed across the region.
2.       Mobile Sources
Mobile sources are divided into two subcategories: on-road and off-road
sources. On-road sources are a combination of emissions from
automobiles, trucks, and indirect sources. Indirect sources are uses that
indirectly cause the generation of air pollutants by attracting vehicle trips

      or consuming energy (e.g. office complex or commercial center), or are
      actions proposed by local governments, such as redevelopment districts
      and private projects involving the development of either large buildings or
      tracts. Off-road sources include aircraft, ships, trains, and self-propelled
      construction equipment.
      3.      Pollutant Types
      Federal and State law regulates the air pollutants emitted into the ambient
      air by stationary and mobile sources. These regulated air pollutants are
      known as “criteria air pollutants.” Primary criteria air pollutants are those
      that are emitted directly from sources. Carbon monoxide (CO); reactive
      organic gases (ROG); nitrogen oxides (NOx); sulfur dioxide (SO2); and
      most fine particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), including lead (Pb) and
      fugitive dust; are primary criteria air pollutants. Secondary criteria air
      pollutants are those pollutants formed by chemical and photochemical
      reactions in the atmosphere. Ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are
      the principal secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants’ concentrations
      decrease as they dissipate, but secondary pollutants reach maximum
      concentrations at a distance downwind from the original source.
      California Clean Air Act Requirements
      A series of governing bodies monitor air quality as well as enforce and
      develop policies and standards for the improvement of air quality. The
      Clean Air Act of 1990 is a federal law that is enforced by the
      Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Though the EPA is a part of the
      federal government, much of the permitting and enforcement for
      emissions is done at the state and regional level.
      In California, regional boards called Air Quality Management Districts
      have Air Quality Management Plans (AQMPs) that are updated every
      three years. The City of San Bernardino falls within the South Coast Air
      Basin (SCAB or Basin), which includes all of Orange County and the non-
      desert portions of Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties.
      Air quality conditions in the SCAB are under the jurisdiction of the South
      Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).
      In general, the net input of pollutants into the South Coast Air Basin
      atmosphere from mobile and stationary sources is much the same every
      day of the year, however, air quality levels in this area are below State and
      Federal air quality standards. New development is contributing to existing
      air pollution levels while localized concentrations of pollutants (i.e.,
12-18                                                          City of San Bernardino

                                                                    12 Natural Resources and Conservation
carbon monoxide) affect sensitive air quality receptors such as schools,
hospitals, and residential areas.
In 1990, the California Legislature enacted the California Clean Air Act
(CCAA). The CCAA requires regional emissions to be reduced by 5% per
year, averaged over a 3-year period, until attainment can be demonstrated.
Each region that did not meet a national or state air quality standard was
required to prepare a plan that demonstrated how the 5% reductions were
to be achieved. In response, the SCAQMD revised their air quality plans
to meet CCAA requirements.
The 1997 AQMP was designed to meet both federal and state air quality
planning guidelines. Strategies for controlling air pollutant emissions in
the AQMP are grouped into three “tiers,” based on their anticipated timing
for implementation. Tier 1 consists of the implementation of best available
current technology and management practices that can be adopted within
five years. Tier II is based on anticipated advancement in current
technology and vigorous regulatory action, while Tier III controls consist
of implementation measures which first require the development of new
technologies.
The SCAQMD Governing Board adopted the 2003 AQMP in August,
2003. The 2003 AQMP updates the attainment demonstration for the
federal standards for ozone and particulate matter (PM10); replaces the
1997 attainment demonstration for the federal carbon monoxide (CO)
standard and provides a basis for a maintenance plan for CO for the future;
and updates the maintenance plan for the federal nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
standard that the South Coast Air Basin (Basin) has met since 1992.
This revision to the AQMP also addresses several state and federal
planning requirements and incorporates significant new scientific data,
primarily in the form of updated emissions inventories, ambient
measurements, new meteorological episodes and new air quality modeling
tools. The 2003 AQMP is consistent with and builds upon the approaches
taken in the 1997 AQMP and the 1999 Amendments to the Ozone SIP for
the South Coast Air Basin for the attainment of the federal ozone air
quality standard. However, this revision points to the urgent need for
additional emission reductions (beyond those incorporated in the 1997/99
Plan) from all sources, specifically those under the jurisdiction of the
California Air Resources Board and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency which account for approximately 80 percent of the ozone
precursor emissions in the Basin.
It should be noted that air pollutants are not limited to jurisdictional
boundaries. Local land use patterns, emission sources, and airflow

      patterns throughout Southern California contribute to the air quality of San
      Bernardino. While the City can enact policies that limit emissions within
      its boundaries, it is necessary to support efforts to decrease region-wide
      pollution emissions as surrounding jurisdictions significantly impact the
      County’s air quality. The following policies are designed to establish a
      regional basis for improving air quality.
      Goal 12.5       Promote air quality that is compatible with the health,
                      well being, and enjoyment of life.
      Policies:
      12.5.1          Reduce the emission of pollutants including carbon
                      monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, photochemical smog, and
                      sulfate in accordance with South Coast Air Quality
                      Management District (SCAQMD) standards.
      12.5.2          Prohibit the development of land uses (e.g. heavy
                      manufacturing) that will contribute significantly to air
                      quality degradation, unless sufficient mitigation measures
                      are undertaken according SCAQMD standards.
      12.5.3          Require dust abatement measures during grading and
                      construction operations. (LU-1)
      12.5.4          Evaluate the air emissions of industrial land uses to ensure
                      that they will not impact adjacent uses.
      12.5.5          Purchase City vehicles that use energy efficient fuel and
                      minimize air pollution. (NR-2)
      Goal 12.6       Reduce the amount of vehicular emissions in San
                      Bernardino.
      Policies:
      12.6.1          Promote a pattern of land uses which locates residential
                      uses in close proximity to employment and commercial
                      services and provides, to the fullest extent possible, local
                      job opportunities and commercial service to minimize
                      vehicular travel and associated air emissions.
      12.6.2          Disperse urban service centers (libraries, post offices,
                      social services, etc.) throughout the City to minimize

                automobiles. (LU-1)
12.6.5          Require qualifying development to implement or
                participate in transportation demand management
                programs, which provide incentives for car pooling, van
                pools, and the use of public transit and employ other trip
                reduction techniques (consistent with the Circulation

                Transit District to expand as necessary the comprehensive
                mass transit system for the City to reduce vehicular travel.
12.6.7          Promote the use of public transit and alternative travel
                modes to reduce air emissions.
Goal 12.7       Participate in regional initiatives and programs to
                improve the South Coast Basin's air quality.

                District and incorporate pertinent local implementation
                provisions of the Air Quality Management Plan.
12.7.2          Work with the South Coast Air Quality Management
                District to establish controls and monitor uses in the City
                that could add to the air basin's degradation (e.g. auto
                repair, manufacturers).

Chapter 13. Energy and Water
Conservation
INTRODUCTION
San Bernardino imports almost all of its energy resources (natural gas, oil,
and electricity) but is blessed by renewable geothermal and water
resources. Despite the renewable resources, San Bernardino, like so much
of America, is largely dependant on non-renewable energy sources, which
result in reliance on unpredictable supplies that are outside of the City’s
control. In addition, our abundant water supply can be affected by
variable periods of rain and drought as well as the demands of the rest of
Southern California. Efficient use of these resources can reduce costs,
help improve regional conditions, and be an economic benefit to San
Bernardino.
Purpose
The Energy and Water Conservation Element provides policy guidance
that addresses the efficient use and conservation of our valuable energy
and water resources.
Relationship to Other Elements
The Energy and Water Conservation Element is closely linked with the
Land Use, Natural Resources, Public Facility, and Utility Elements.
Together, these Elements provide direction for the responsible and
efficient use of our resources.
ACHIEVING THE VISION
Our continued and future activities are dependent on conservation of
existing and development of new water and energy resources. Urban
patterns that reduce the reliance upon the automobile, efficient distribution
systems, reduced reliance on non-renewable energy resources,
City of San Bernardino                                                                        13-1

     conservation of the resources we currently use, and structural designs that
     reduce energy use are essential as conservation techniques. More directly,
     conserving water and energy also reduces costs and saves money.
     If used efficiently and developed appropriately, our local resources, such
     as geothermal, solar, reclaimed water, and water, can be used as
     commodities to help improve our overall standard of living.
     The Energy and Water Conservation Element is responsive to our Vision
     because it represents our desires to:
            Create additional water storage facilities to meet the demands of
             additional growth and accommodate economic development;
            Capitalize on our water and reclaimed water resources;
            Be responsible stewards of our energy and water resources; and
            Discover and implement conservation of our water and energy
             resources.

Water Conservation
San Bernardino gets 100% of its water from an underground aquifer called
the Bunker Hill Basin. The aquifer is filled from rain and snows that filter
down through our local mountains. 60 wells, some of which reach as far as
1,200 feet deep, tap into the aquifer and 551 miles of water mains deliver
it to more than 40,000 service connections.
Unfortunately, we need to do more to prevent leaks, reduce waste, and use
the resources we have more efficiently. We waste a lot of water in our
daily lives. For instance, use of our toilets account for almost 30% of our
home water use; laundry accounts for roughly 22% of our home water use;
and showers account for 20% of our home water use. Simple measures
can be taken to reduce the amount of water that is wasted during these
activities.
Fortunately, San Bernardino has a head start in water conservation through
a reclamation program. The Water Department’s Water Reclamation
Plant and Rapid Infiltration and Extraction Facility reclaims 30,000
million gallons of water each day that are used for landscaping,
commercial, and agricultural purposes. In this manner, our reclaimed
water acts as a commodity that is used to our economic benefit.
It is also important that we control discharges into our waterways to
protect our water quality and the integrity of our groundwater. As detailed
in the Utilities Element, any new construction and development in the City
must comply with several regulations aimed at reducing discharges or
runoff into our waterways including the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) and Clean Water Act. New projects must
incorporate appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control the
discharge of point source (these are the readily identifiable inputs where
waste is discharged to the receiving waters from a pipe or drain) and non-
point source (discharges that occur over a wide area and are associated
with particular land uses, such as urban and agricultural uses) pollutants
both during construction and for the life of the project.
City of San Bernardino                                                                       13-5

     Excess reclaimed water is currently discharged into the Santa Ana River
     where it contributes to other existing water flows and adds to the habitat
     for several kinds of fish and birds.
     Goal 13.2      Manage and protect the quality of the City’s surface
                    waters and ground water basins.

                    leaking, and/or inefficient plumbing with more efficient,
                    water-saving plumbing. (EWC-1)
     13.2.4         Require the use of reclaimed water for landscape irrigation

Chapter 14. Noise
INTRODUCTION
San Bernardino is affected by several different sources of noise, including
automobile, rail, and air traffic, sports events, commercial and industrial
activity, and periodic nuisances such as construction. Excessive levels of
noise can damage our physical health, psychological stability, social
cohesion, property values, and economic productivity. The control of
noise, therefore, is an essential component in creating a safe, compatible,
and productive environment.
Purpose
The Noise Element provides policy guidance that addresses the
generation, mitigation, avoidance, and the control of excessive noise.
Specifically, this Element addresses the following issues:
         •  Land use;
         •  Transportation related noise generated from roadways,
            passenger and freight railroad operations, and air flights; and
         •  Spill over noise from activities such as construction, leaf
            blowers, and commercial/industrial operations.
Relationship to Other Elements
The Noise Element is closely linked with the Land Use and Circulation
Elements as well as the Development Code, which contains the City’s
noise standards. Together, these guidelines and standards provide for the
citywide regulation of excessive noise.
It should be recognized that the City does not have the authority to
regulate all sources of noise within the City and various other agencies
may supercede City authority. A discussion of these agencies and their
roles with respect to regulating noise is provided below. Furthermore,
various types of project funding (e.g., State Highway projects, HUD

       redevelopment, etc.) could be subject to standards that differ from the
       City’s.
       1.       Federal Highway Administration
       Several major transportation routes traverse the City of San Bernardino:
       State Routes 18, 30, 330, and 66, as well as Interstates 10 and 215. These
       routes are subject to federal funding and, as such, are under the purview of
       the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which has its own noise
       standards. These noise standards are based on Leq and L10 values. The
       FHWA design noise levels are included in Table N-1, FHWA Design
       Noise Levels.

       requirements related specifically to standards for exterior noise levels
       along with policies for approving HUD-supported or assisted housing
       projects in high noise areas. In general, these requirements established
       three zones. These include:
                •     65 dBA Ldn or less - an acceptable zone where all projects
                      could be approved,

                                                                               14 Noise
         •  Exceeding 65 dBA Ldn but not exceeding 75 dBA Ldn - a
            normally unacceptable zone where mitigation measures would
            be required and each project would have to be individually
            evaluated for approval or denial. These measures must provide
            5 dBA of attenuation above the attenuation provided by
            standard construction required in a 65 to 70 dBA Ldn area and
            10 dBA of attenuation in a 70 to 75 dBA Ldn area, and
         •  Exceeding 75 dBA Ldn - an unacceptable zone in which
            projects would not, as a rule, be approved.
HUD’s regulations do not include interior noise standards. Rather, a goal
of 45 dBA Ldn is set forth and attenuation requirements are geared towards
achieving that goal. HUD assumes that, using standard construction, any
building will provide sufficient attenuation so that if the exterior level is
65 dBA Ldn or less, the interior level will be 45 dBA Ldn or less. It should
be noted, however, that HUD regulations were created solely for
residential development requiring government funding and are not related
to the operation of other sensitive land uses such as schools or churches.
3.       Federal Railroad Administration
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is charged with the
regulation of railroad noise under the Noise Control Act. No federal
regulations specify absolute levels of acceptable noise that apply directly
to railroad noise and compatible land uses along rail lines. While these
regulations remain in full force, the EPA Office of Noise Abatement and
Control was closed in 1982, leaving the enforcement of EPA regulations
to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Table N-2, Summary of
EPA/FRA Railroad Noise Standards, summarizes the EPA railroad noise
standards that set operating noise standards for railroad equipment and set
noise limit standards for new equipment.

     4.         California Department of Health Services
     The California Department of Health Services (DHS) Office of Noise
     Control studied the correlation of noise levels and their effects on various
     land uses. As a result, the DHS established four categories for judging the
     severity of noise intrusion on specified land uses.
     Figure N-1, Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Exposure,
     presents a land use compatibility chart for community noise prepared by
     the California Office of Noise Control. It identifies “normally
     acceptable,” “conditionally acceptable,” “normally unacceptable,” and
     “clearly unacceptable” exterior noise levels for various land uses. A
     “conditionally acceptable” designation implies new construction or
     development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the
     noise reduction requirements for each land use is made and needed noise
     insulation features are incorporated in the design. By comparison, a
     “normally acceptable” designation indicates that standard construction can
     occur with no special noise reduction requirements.

Table N-3, State of California Interior and Exterior Noise Standards,
includes the State interior and exterior noise standards for varying land
uses. It is important to note that the exterior noise levels are to be attained
in “habitable” exterior areas and need not encompass the entirety of a
property.

The City of San Bernardino Noise Ordinance (Section 19.20.030.15 of the
Development Code) specifies the maximum acceptable levels of noise for
residential uses in the City. These standards indicate that exterior noise
City of San Bernardino                                                                            14-7

     levels at residential locations should not exceed a CNEL of 65 dB while
     interior levels shall not exceed an annual CNEL of 45 dB in any habitable
     room. Chapter 12, Airport Overlay District, of the Development Code
     provides additional noise standards related to the flight operations of the
     San Bernardino International Airport and Trade Center within the 65 dB
     noise contours.
     Definitions
     The following is a list of commonly used terms and abbreviations that may
     be found within this element or when discussing the topic of noise. It is
     important to become familiar with the definitions listed in order to better
     understand the importance of the Noise Element within the City of San
     Bernardino General Plan.
            Ambient Noise – The composite of noise from all sources near
             and far. In this context, the ambient noise level constitutes the
             normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given location.
            Intrusive Noise – That noise which intrudes over and above the
             existing ambient noise at a given location. The relative
             intrusiveness of a sound depends upon its amplitude, duration,
             frequency and time of occurrence, and tonal or informational
             content as well as the prevailing noise level.
            dB (Decibel) – The unit of measure that denotes the ratio between
             two quantities that are proportional to power; the number of
             decibels corresponding to the ratio of the two amounts of power is
             based on a logarithmic scale.
            dBA (A-weighted decibel) – The A-weighted decibel scale
             discriminates against upper and lower frequencies in a manner
             approximating the sensitivity of the human ear. The scale is based
             on a reference pressure level of 20 micropascals (zero dBA). The
             scale ranges from zero for the average least perceptible sound to
             about 130 for the average pain level.
            L50 – The A-weighted sound level that is exceeded 50% of the
             sample time. Alternatively, the A-weighted sound level that is
             exceeded 30 minutes in a 60-minute period (similarly, L10, L25,
             etc.). These values are typically used to demonstrate compliance
             with noise restrictions included in the City noise ordinance.
            Leq (Equivalent Energy Level) – The average acoustic energy
             content of noise during the time it lasts. The Leq of a time-varying
14-8                                                         City of San Bernardino

                                                                                14 Noise
         noise and that of a steady noise are the same if they deliver the
         same acoustic energy to the ear during exposure, no matter what
         time of day they occur.
        Ldn (Day-Night Average Level) – The average equivalent A-
         weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after the
         addition of 10 decibels to sound levels in the night from 10:00 p.m.
         to 7:00 a.m. Note: CNEL and Ldn represent daily levels of noise
         exposure averaged on an annual or daily basis, while Leq
         represents the equivalent energy noise exposure for a shorter time
         period, typically one hour.
        CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level) – The average
         equivalent A-weighted sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained
         after the addition of five decibels to sound levels in the evening
         from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and after the addition of 10 decibels
         to sound levels in the night from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
        Noise Contours – Lines drawn around a noise source indicating
         equal levels of noise exposure. CNEL and Ldn are the metrics used
         in this document to describe annoyance due to noise and to
         establish land use planning criteria for noise.
        Vibration – Another community annoyance related to noise is
         vibration. As with noise, vibration can be described by both its
         amplitude and frequency. Amplitude may be characterized by
         displacement, velocity, and/or acceleration. Typically, particle
         velocity (measured in inches or millimeters per second) and/or
         acceleration (measured in gravities) are used to describe vibration.
         Vibration can be felt outdoors, but the perceived intensity of
         vibration impacts are much greater indoors, due to the shaking of
         the structure. Some of the most common sources of vibration
         come from trains and/or transit vehicles, construction equipment,
         airplanes, and large vehicles. Several land uses are especially
         sensitive to vibration, and therefore have a lower vibration
         threshold. These uses include, but are not limited to, concert halls,
         hospitals, libraries, vibration-sensitive research operations,
         residential areas, schools, and offices.

      ACHIEVING THE VISION
      As San Bernardino has developed and expanded its boundaries over time,
      there are numerous areas of the City that are impacted by noise. For
      instance, many residences are located near industrial areas or adjacent to
      busy streets or rail lines. The Citizens of San Bernardino are concerned
      about the effects of noise on their health and serenity and of the need to
      provide the range of uses needed to maintain a high quality of life.
      There are several techniques to deal with noise impacts: applying noise
      attenuation techniques, limiting certain kinds of development near noise-
      producing land uses, implementing design and building techniques in site
      layouts and construction, and setting and enforcing standards for noise-
      producing land uses.
      The Noise Element is responsive to our Vision because it represents our
      stated desires to:
             Manage and mitigate the impacts from truck traffic to decrease
              congestion and noise pollution;
             Locate future residential uses and other sensitive receptors away
              from existing noise sources; and
             Develop and employ measures to decrease the impacts associated
              with air and rail operations on sensitive receptors such as
              residences and schools.

                                                                                14 Noise
GOALS AND POLICIES
The following presents the goals and policies for noise related issues in the
City of San Bernardino planning area.
Land Use Planning and Design
As San Bernardino grows, the increases in population, employment, and
tourist activity may generate more traffic and attract additional noise
producing uses. Additionally, some undeveloped and underdeveloped
areas are designated for land uses that may be noise-sensitive and are
located in proximity to roadways, railroads, and transit facilities. As a
result, land use compatibility in relation to noise is an important
consideration in the planning and design process.
To identify potential mitigation to address noise abatement strategies,
noise evaluations should be conducted when a proposed project places
sensitive land uses and major noise generators within close proximity to
each other. The City currently uses the project review process to identify
potential noise issues and works with developers or landowners to apply
site planning and other strategies to reduce noise impacts. A developer, for
example, could take advantage of the natural shape and contours of a site
to arrange buildings and other uses in a manner that would reduce, and
possibly eliminate, noise impacts. Examples of other site and architectural
techniques could include:
        Increasing the distance between noise source and receiver.
        Placing non-noise sensitive land uses such as parking lots,
         maintenance facilities and utility areas between the noise source
         and receiver.
        Using non-noise sensitive structures such as garages to shield
         noise-sensitive areas.
        Orienting buildings to shield outdoor spaces from a noise source.
        Locating bedrooms in residential developments on the side of the
         house facing away from major roads.
City of San Bernardino                                                        14-11

      Goal 14.1       Ensure that residents are protected from excessive
                      noise through careful land planning.
      Policies:
      14.1.1          Minimize, reduce, or prohibit, as may be required, the new
                      development of housing, health care facilities, schools,
                      libraries, religious facilities, and other noise sensitive uses
                      in areas where existing or future noise levels exceed an Ldn
                      of 65 dB(A) exterior and an Ldn of 45 dB(A) interior if the
                      noise cannot be reduced to these levels. (LU-1)
      14.1.2          Require that automobile and truck access to commercial
                      properties abutting residential parcels be located at the
                      maximum practical distance from the residential parcel.
                      (LU-1)
      14.1.3          Require that all parking for commercial uses abutting
                      residential areas be enclosed within a structure, buffered by
                      walls, and/or limited hours of operation. (LU-1)
      14.1.4          Prohibit the development of new or expansion of existing
                      industrial, commercial, or other uses that generate noise
                      impacts on housing, schools, health care facilities or other
                      sensitive uses above a Ldn of 65 dB(A). (LU-1)
      Transportation Related Noise Sources
      San Bernardino has long been a hub of transportation and includes several
      major highways (such as State Routes 18, 30, 330, and 66, as well as
      Interstates 10 and 215), major arterials, railways, and the San Bernardino
      International Airport and Trade Center. These transportation facilities,
      while important components to mobility and economic vitality, are the
      major contributors of noise in San Bernardino. Cost effective strategies to
      reduce their influence on the community noise environment are an
      essential part of the Noise Element.
      Local government has little direct control of some of the transportation
      related noise at the source. These levels are set by state and federal
      agencies. However, the City does have some control over transportation
      noise that exceeds State and/or federal standards through the enforcement
      of the Municipal Code.

                                                                                                  14 Noise
The most effective method the City has to mitigate transportation noise is
through the application of noise barriers and site design review. The
effect of a noise barrier is critically dependent on the distance between the
noise source and the receiver. A noise barrier effect occurs when the
barrier penetrates the “line of sight” between the source and receiver: the
greater the penetration or height of the barrier, the greater the noise
reduction. Additional attenuation can be achieved depending upon the
source of transportation related noise.
1.       Roadways
Roadways are a significant source of noise in the City. Sound emanates
from vehicle engines and from the tires rolling over the pavement. One
way the City can control vehicle noise is through speed reduction. A
change of just 5 miles per hour can change the resultant noise by
approximately one to two dBA. The difference in noise associated with a
reduction of 10 miles per hour reduction could be roughly equivalent to
reducing the traffic volume by one-half.
The City also has some control over traffic-generated noise through
weight limitations and the designation of truck routes. Medium trucks,
(i.e., those with a gross vehicle weight between 5 and 13.25 tons) produce
as much acoustical energy as approximately 5 to 16 automobiles
depending on the speed, with slower speeds demonstrating greater
differential. Similarly, heavy trucks (i.e., those with a gross vehicle
weight in excess of 13.25 tons) produce as much acoustical energy as 10
to 60 automobiles.                                                            Airport Noise Contours

                            specified noise contours. For planning purposes, federal and state laws
                            have established well-defined regulations for acceptable noise levels with
                            the basic criterion set at a maximum 65 decibel (dB) Community Noise

                            some acceptable mitigation within the noise contours, avoidance by noise
                            sensitive uses is often the best remedy. Conversely, those land uses with

                            Overflight creates another noise concern. An overflight is a distinctly
                            visible and audible passage of an aircraft, not necessarily one that is
                            directly overhead. Overflight often extends past the boundary of the
                            defined CNEL contour and creates an annoyance. The SBIA has limited

                            Another prevalent source of noise in the City is from railroad operations.
                            Within the San Bernardino planning area, trains travel on three different
                            rail lines that include: (1) The Cajon Pass Line; (2) The Main Line-
                            Redlands, which extends eastward to the City of Redlands; and, (3) The
                            Main Line-Colton, which extends westward to the City of Colton.
                            Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) and Union Pacific (UP) also
                            operate rail lines within the City. These rail lines include: (1) The Santa
                            Fe Subdivision Two Line; (2) The Santa Fe Subdivision Three Line; and,
                            (3) The Santa Fe Cajon Pass Line. Each route contributes a different level
                            of noise to the City resulting from the different volumes of train traffic
                            that occur on each line.
                            Railroad noise is dependant on a number of factors including the number
                            of operations per day, the times these operations occur, the numbers of

                                                                               14 Noise
Goal 14.2       Encourage the reduction of noise from transportation-
                related noise sources such as motor vehicles, aircraft
                operations, and railroad movements.
Policies:
14.2.1          Work with Caltrans to landscape or install mitigation
                elements along freeways and highways adjacent to existing
                residential subdivisions or noise-sensitive uses to reduce
                noise impacts. (N-1)
14.2.2          Employ noise mitigation practices when designing future
                streets and highways, and when improvements occur along
                existing road segments. Mitigation measures should
                emphasize the establishment of natural buffers or setbacks
                between the arterial roadways and adjoining noise-sensitive
                areas. (N-1)
14.2.3          Require that development that increases the ambient noise
                level adjacent to noise-sensitive land uses provide
                appropriate mitigation measures. (LU-1)
14.2.4          Maintain roadways so that the paving is in good condition
                and free of cracks, bumps, and potholes. (A-2)
14.2.5          Require sound walls, berms, and landscaping along existing
                and future highways and railroad right-of-ways to beautify
                the landscape and reduce noise. (N-1)
14.2.6          Buffer residential neighborhoods from noise caused by
                train operations and increasing high traffic volumes along
                major arterials and freeways. (N-1)
14.2.7          Require heliports/helistops to comply with Federal
                Aviation Administration standards.
14.2.8          Minimize noise attributable to vehicular travel in
                residential neighborhoods by inhibiting through trips by the
                use of cul-de-sacs, one-way streets, and other traffic
                controls.
14.2.9          Enforce sections of the California Vehicle Code related to
                mufflers and modified exhaust systems.
City of San Bernardino                                                       14-19
      14.2.10 Provide for the development of alternate transportation
              modes such as bicycle paths and pedestrian walkways to
              minimize the number of automobile trips. (LU-1)
      14.2.11 Require that new equipment and vehicles purchased by the
              City comply with noise performance standards consistent
              with the best available noise reduction technology. (A-3)
      14.2.12 Require that commercial and industrial uses implement
              transportation demand management programs consistent
              with the Air Quality Management Plan that provide
              incentives for car pooling, van pools, and the use of public
              transit to reduce traffic and associated noise levels in the
              City. (LU-1)
      14.2.13 Work with local agencies and businesses to provide public
              transit services that reduce traffic and associated noise.
      14.2.14 Work with public transit agencies to ensure that the buses,
              vans, and other vehicles used do not generate excessive
              noise levels.
      14.2.15 Work with all railroad operators in the City to properly
              maintain lines and establish operational restrictions during
              the early morning and late evening hours to reduce impacts
              in residential areas and other noise sensitive areas.
      14.2.16 Work with all railroad operators to install noise mitigation
              features where operations impact existing adjacent
              residential or other noise-sensitive uses.
      14.2.17 Ensure that new development is compatible with the noise
              compatibility criteria and noise contours as defined in the
              Comprehensive Land Use Plan for the SBIA and depicted
              in Figure LU-4.
      14.2.18 Limit the development of sensitive land uses located within
              the 65 decibel (dB) Community Noise Equivalent Level
              (CNEL) contour, as defined in the Comprehensive Land
              Use Plan for the SBIA and depicted in Figure LU-4.
      14.2.19 As may be necessary, require acoustical analysis and
              ensure the provision of effective noise mitigation measures
              for sensitive land uses, especially residential uses, in areas
              significantly impacted by noise.

                                                                                  14 Noise
Non-Transportation Related Noise Sources
The City currently has a diverse collection of land uses, most of which
generate their own noise. Industrial facilities generate noise through
various processes that involve the use of heavy equipment and machinery.
Commercial facilities and residential units can generate noise from the use
of heating, ventilating, air conditioning (HVAC) units, pool and spa
pumps, as well as landscape maintenance equipment. Additionally,
schoolyard activities, barking dogs, and residential parties can also be
sources of nuisance noise.
Mixed-use areas that place more sensitive residential uses alongside or
above commercial uses can present their own problems. Requiring that
the commercial aspect meet a residential standard could make commercial
operations difficult and offer an unfair competitive advantage to a similar
operation placed in a dedicated commercial zone. Alternatively, applying
a commercial standard to a mixed-use project could result in unacceptable
noise levels at the residential portion of the structure/site. Still, mixed-use
projects offer several advantages from both an air quality and
transportation perspective, and should be encouraged.
Another source of noise comes from the operations of trucks and trains
within the City. As previously mentioned, the operation of railroad trains
and heavy trucks is preempted from local noise regulation while operating
on public roads and dedicated right-of-ways. However, noise is also
generated by operations (e.g., idling, loading, and unloading) that occur at
facilities. Once on private property, these sources are no longer
considered preempted and the City has authority to regulate this noise if it
“spills” into adjacent areas.
Finally, construction in all land use zones can temporarily elevate noise.
The City recognizes that construction is a necessity; still, various measures
are available to reduce this nuisance (and potentially hazardous) noise
when necessary.

      Goal 14.3 Protect residents from the negative effects of “spill
                over” or nuisance noise.
      Policies:
      14.3.1    Require that construction activities adjacent to residential
                units be limited as necessary to prevent adverse noise
                impacts. (LU-1)
      14.3.2    Require that construction activities employ feasible and
                practical techniques that minimize the noise impacts on
                adjacent uses. (LU-1)
      14.3.3    Adopt and enforce a standard for exterior noise levels for
                all commercial uses that prevents adverse levels of
                discernible noise on adjoining residential properties. (A-1)
      14.3.4    Adopt and enforce a standard for exterior noise levels from
                the use of leaf blowers, motorized lawn mowers, parking
                lot sweepers, or other high-noise equipment on commercial
                properties if their activity will result in noise that adversely
                affects abutting residential parcels. (A-1)
      14.3.5    Require that the hours of truck deliveries to commercial
                properties abutting residential uses be limited unless there
                is no feasible alternative or there are overriding
                transportation benefits by scheduling deliveries at another
                hour. (LU-1)
      14.3.6    Ensure that buildings are constructed soundly to prevent
                adverse noise transmission between differing uses located
                in the same structure and individual residences in multi-
                family buildings. (LU-1)
      14.3.7    Require that commercial uses in structures containing
                residences on upper floors not be noise intensive. (LU-1)
      14.3.8    Require common walls and floors between commercial and
                residential uses be constructed to minimize the
                transmission of noise and vibration. (LU-1)

Chapter 2. Land Use
INTRODUCTION
The way in which our land is used provides the most vivid impression of
San Bernardino. Our pattern of land uses transitions from predominantly
industrial near the Santa Ana River and the San Bernardino International
Airport and Trade Center to predominantly residential toward the
mountains, with a substantial commercial and industrial core at the center.
The intensity and mixture of land uses play an important role as well,
reflecting considerable diversity in this community of almost 200,000
people. The demands placed upon the land by the existing uses and others
planned in the future account for the City’s extensive infrastructure: roads,
sewers, drainage, utilities, parks, and myriad other facilities and services.
Most of these support functions consume a lot of land, as well as
accommodating the personnel who provide essential public services.
It is fortunate that the City has almost exclusive responsibility and
authority for guiding and regulating land uses (there are a few exceptions,
but they account for only a small part of our land resources). The most
common tools used to perform this important local function include this
General Plan and a variety of local ordinances. Of these, the Development
Code, for regulating land use, and the subdivision ordinance, for creating
building sites, are the most influential.
Purpose
The Land Use Element functions as a guide to planners, the general
public, and decision makers as to our ultimate pattern of development. It
designates general site development standards and the distribution,
location, and extent of land uses, such as housing, business, industry, open
space, natural resources, recreation, and public/quasi-public uses. The
Land Use Element also discusses the standards of residential density and
non-residential intensity for the various land use designations.

    The General Plan Land Use Map captures and communicates the City’s
    long-term desires for the future use and development of their land
    resources.
    Relationship to Other Elements
    Of the general plan elements required by State law, the Land Use Element
    has the broadest scope. Since it governs how land is to be utilized, many
    of the issues and policies contained in other plan Elements are linked in
    some degree to this Element. For example, the Circulation Element
    defines policies for the accommodation of vehicular and other trips
    generated by the population and uses permitted by the Land Use Element.
    Similarly, the location and density of uses prescribed by this Element are
    influenced by policies for the protection of environmental resources
    prescribed by the Natural Resources and Conservation Element. It is
    important to note, however, that the Elements are equal in terms of the
    requirement to comply with their policies.
    1.       Area Plans
    Area plans are distinct components of general plans that address smaller
    geographical areas. Basically, an area plan refines the policies of the
    general plan as they apply to smaller geographic areas but have the same
    authority as general plans. The General Plan contains one Area Plan, the
    Verdemont Heights Area Plan, which is described later in this chapter.
    Relationship to Land Use Regulatory
    Documents
    1.      Zoning
    Zoning is a primary mechanism for implementing the General Plan. It
    provides the detailed regulations pertaining to permitted and conditional
    uses, site development standards, and performance criteria to implement
    the goals and policies of the General Plan. San Bernardino’s Development
    Code (Title 19 of the San Bernardino Municipal Code) was adopted in
    May 1991 and has been periodically revised since that time. In particular,
    the Land Use Element establishes the primary basis for consistency with
    the City’s Development Code.
    The City’s Zoning map corresponds with the General Plan designations.
    One or more of the zoning districts established in the City’s Development
    Code corresponds to each of the General Plan Land Use Designations.

Bernardino Development Services Department.
2.       Specific Plans
Specific plans provide focused guidance and regulation for particular
areas. They generally include a land use plan, circulation plan,
infrastructure plan, development standards, design guidelines, phasing
plan, financing plan, and implementation plan. Specific Plans provide
either detailed policy guidance or zoning level regulation.
San Bernardino has eight approved specific plans governing land use
development in designated areas throughout the City. The specific plans
listed below on Table LU-1 and are depicted on the Land Use Map
included in this Element. The Specific Plans can be obtained at the City
of San Bernardino Development Services Department.

3.       Redevelopment Plans
Through redevelopment, cities have the power to turn blighted,
deteriorating areas into revitalized, productive community assets. The
City of San Bernardino has a comprehensive and diverse redevelopment
program currently containing ten redevelopment project areas. These
include:
•        Central City Projects
•        Central City North
•        Central City West

                              •       Mt. Vernon Corridor
                              Locations of each project area and a more thorough discussion of
                              redevelopment in San Bernardino is addressed in the Economic
                              Development Element.

                              Cities are allowed to plan for unincorporated areas adjacent to their
                              boundaries that are logical extensions of their future growth and possible
Airport Noise Contours        candidates for annexation. However, until annexation occurs, these lands
and Safety Zones
                              within the City’s sphere of influence remain under the governance of San
As of the writing of this     Bernardino County and its General Plan. The City of San Bernardino’s
General Plan, the Airport     sphere of influence includes 6,549 acres and is shown on the General Plan

In accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations, restrictions may apply
to some types of development proposed within the Airport’s identified
safety and noise zones. These restrictions are addressed in the Land Use,
Circulation, and Noise Elements.
6.       Annual Budget
The City’s annual budget is the process by which City resources are
committed over the ensuing fiscal year. It is an ongoing means of
determining priorities and reallocating resources according to anticipated
near-term conditions. This is especially the case where the work entails a
major project or involves retaining consultants or specialists to augment
the staff. This aspect of budgeting complements the “hard”
implementation improvements reflected in the Capital Improvement
Program, which is also part of the annual budgeting process.
7.       Capital Improvements Program
San Bernardino prepares a Capital Improvements Program, which serves
as a planning and budgeting mechanism for the major projects to be
undertaken by the City. This Program addresses projects for public works
and infrastructure installation, maintenance and repair, parks and
recreation services, and miscellaneous support services. The Program
must conform to the policy direction provided in the General Plan.

                                  The Land Use Element is responsive to our Vision because it represents
                                  our stated desires to:

LAND USE PLAN
As required by state law, the General Plan must specify land uses and the
density/intensity of development. Although not as specific as zoning
classifications, general plans are required to describe each land use
designation and include a diagram of the location of these uses. These
components, as well as a series of planning objectives that serve as the
foundation for the Land Use Plan (Figure LU-2), are included in this
section of the land use element.
Land Use Designation System
The Land Use system for the City of San Bernardino is organized in a
three-tiered hierarchy, with each level of the hierarchy containing a
progressively more detailed level of land use guidance: The first and most
basic level is the Foundation Component Plan, the second level is the
General Plan Land Use map, and the third level is the Strategic Area Map.
1.       Foundation Component Plan
The Foundation Component Plan (Figure LU-1) describers the
fundamental pattern of land use in a generalized form. The purpose of this
map is to provide an understanding of the basic land use structure and not
to determine the specific land use on individual properties.
The Foundation Component Plan consists of nine broad land uses: Single
Family Residential, Multi-Family Residential, Commercial Office,
Commercial General, Commercial Regional, Commercial Heavy,
Industrial, Public Facility/Quasi Public, and Open Space. Each of these
Foundation Components is subdivided into more detailed land use
designations at the General Plan level.

2.       General Plan Land Use Map
The General Plan Land Use Map (Figure LU-2) describes the distribution
of land uses at a parcel specific level. The 33 land use designations shown
on this map further delineates the basic Foundation Component Plan
designations and contains the specific description of allowable uses and
development standards for each land use category.
A definition of each land use category, the allowable uses, and related
policies are contained in Table LU-2.
3.       Strategic Area Map
The Strategic Area Map (Figure LU-5) describes districts of the City
where detailed policy guidance is tailored to address unique issues within
each area. This map reflects two strategic situations:
1) Areas where the goals and policies of the General Plan focus on
    preservation and enhancement of existing neighborhoods and where
    fundamental changes in the land use pattern are not anticipated or
    desired.
2) Areas where change is either imminent and needs guidance or where
    change is desired and needs stimulation and guidance.
Strategies have been tailored to address the specific needs and issues of
each Strategic Area. These strategies are contained in the Strategic Areas
section found at the end of this Element.

Land Use Designations
Land use designations are provided to define the amount, type, and nature
of development that is allowed in a given location on the Land Use Plan.
The following table, Table LU-2, describes each of the land use
designations shown on the Land Use Plan, as well as the density and
intensity standards required in accordance with the California Government
Code. Examples of the types of development envisioned in each land use
category are shown on Figure LU-3, Illustrative Land Use Examples.
Each of the residential use categories includes a range of allowable
densities. The maximum density defines the maximum number of units
per adjusted gross acre1 at which development can occur within a given
area. The determination of precise density, development location, and lot
coverage on any residential property is a function of: 1) the provisions of
the General Plan that are intended to maximize public safety, achieve high
quality site planning and design, retain significant natural resources, and
ensure compatibility between uses; and 2) the building and development
standards contained in the Development Code, public works standards,
and other regulations and ordinances.
Each of the non-residential designations indicates a maximum level of
development intensity. The building intensity is measured by floor area
ratio (FAR). An FAR is the ratio of total net floor area of a building to the
total lot area. An FAR describes the intensity of the use on a site and not
the building height or site coverage. It does not include the area within
parking lots or parking structures.

  As detailed in Appendix 5, Methodology Report, adjusted gross acres do not include the
rights-of-way for roadways, flood control channels, or railroads.

     3,418 acres of public/quasi-public land uses, and 3,110 acres of open
     space land uses (parks or permanent open spaces). The City’s planning
     area also includes 10,043 acres that are not able to be utilized for private
     use or development, including flood control facilities, road rights-of-way,
     and railroad rights-of-way.
     Assuming buildout of the plan at the adjusted level, the land use plan
     accommodates a total of 95,664total units, which includes 82,714dwelling
     units in the incorporated City and 12,950dwelling units in the City’s
     sphere of influence. Based on a factor of 3.340 persons per household2,
     the projected population at buildout for the entire planning area would be
     approximately 319,241people, which includes 276,264persons in the City
     and 42,976persons in the City’s sphere of influence.
     Within the total planning area (incorporated plus sphere of influence), the
     land use plan also provides for a total of 3,995acres of commercial and
     office uses, including 257 acres of mixed use development (accommodates
     a mix of commercial, office, and higher density residential development),
     and 6,065acres of light and general industrial uses. At build out, the land
     use plan for the total planning area could generate approximately 355,629
     jobs using the adjusted intensity factors (FARs).

  Projections of population by residential designation are based on a persons-per-household factor of 3.340. These factors were derived from statistics generated in the
Department of Finance, City/County Population and Housing Estimates, 1/1/2004. This projection of population represents the maximum-range of population that could be
generated within this land use plan.
3
  Residential buildout does not assume buildout at the maximum density; instead residential buildout is projected to occur at 85% of the maximum density for each land use
category.
4
  Population adjusted to account for senior units in Arrowhead Springs, which were assumed to contain 150 units that will be restricted to seniors (1.5 persons per unit) and 150
units that will not be age restricted (3.340 persons per unit).

GOALS AND POLICIES
The following section describes land use goals and policies that, in
conjunction with the Land Use Plan and accompanying density and
intensity standards, guide the future land development of the City. Goals
and policies are divided into two subsections: Citywide and Strategic Area
Goals and Policies.
In addition to these goals and policies, it is important to remember that the
other General Plan Elements and other planning tools such as zoning,
specific plans, and redevelopment plans provide additional land use
direction to achieve the quality of development desired by the City.
CITYWIDE GOALS AND POLICIES
The following Goals and Policies represent overarching desires and apply
to the entire City and Sphere of Influence. Distinction and variation from
these policies may be found in the Strategic Areas that address their
unique issues and conditions.
Distinct Neighborhoods
San Bernardino contains a wide range of neighborhoods accommodating
an assortment of lifestyles: from the urban downtown multifamily
dwellings, to student housing, to new and older suburban enclaves, to
hillside and golf course estates, to rural estates. Each neighborhood has,
or can have, its own unique character that is a source of pride for the
residents. Neighborhood character is defined by many factors: what the
neighborhood looks like, what it feels like, how well it is maintained, etc.
But more importantly, it is an image in the minds of those who live and
work there and in the perceptions of those who visit.
Some neighborhoods in San Bernardino are a source of pride for residents,
as reflected by the quality of their homes, the diversity of their residents,
the beauty of their streetscapes, and the availability of and access to, open
space and recreation opportunities. Other neighborhoods are in need of
assistance to help maintain, upgrade, and improve safety and aesthetics.
One thing is certain in the Vision for San Bernardino, there is a strong
desire to maintain, enhance, and improve the various neighborhoods in the
community.

     2.1             Preserve and enhance San Bernardino’s unique
                     neighborhoods.
     Policies:
     2.1.1           Actively enforce development standards, design guidelines,
                     and policies to preserve and enhance the character of San
                     Bernardino’s neighborhoods. (LU-1)
     2.1.2           Require that new development with potentially adverse
                     impacts on existing neighborhoods or residents such as
                     noise, traffic, emissions, and storm water runoff, be located
                     and designed so that quality of life and safety in existing
                     neighborhoods are preserved. (LU-1)
     2.1.3           Encourage future development to provide public spaces
                     that foster social interaction. (LU-1)
     2.1.4           Provide assistance in the form of grants, loans, home-
                     improvement efforts, coordinated code and law
                     enforcement, public right-of-way maintenance and
                     enhancement, and trash collection to help improve San
                     Bernardino’s residential neighborhoods. (LU-1 and LU-3)
     2.1.5           Ensure compliance with maintenance and development
                     standards through the rigorous enforcement of Code
                     Enforcement and Safety standards. (LU-5)
     Compatibility
     San Bernardino is a diverse community, which, as it has developed over
     many years, contains a rich mixture of residential, industrial,
     entertainment, office, and commercial land uses. A number of uses,
     including industrial, commercial, and transportation facilities, can have
     potentially adverse effects upon residential neighborhoods, sensitive
     habitat areas, medical facilities, and schools. Achieving compatibility
     between these various uses is a delicate process, especially when these
     uses are located in close proximity to one another. Due to the historic
     development pattern of San Bernardino, residential land uses are
     interspersed among or adjacent to uses that can generate adverse impacts.
     The potential impacts of commercial, industrial, and transportation
     facilities, which are vital to San Bernardino’s economy and many of which
     are not under the City’s jurisdiction, must be balanced with the needs of
2-34                                                         City of San Bernardino

                                                                              2 Land Use
residential neighborhoods. Site planning, orientation of uses on site,
buffering between adjacent properties, coordination with outside agencies
and jurisdictions, and the limitation of noise and emissions, are necessary
to achieve compatibility between the range of uses in the City.
Within the City’s Sphere of Influence are several areas, such as Muscoy
and Arrowhead Suburban Farms, which are currently under the County of
San Bernardino’s jurisdiction. Coordination between the City and the
County are necessary to ensure developments that are compatible with the
City’s standards.
2.2             Promote development that integrates with and
                minimizes impacts on surrounding land uses.
Policies:
2.2.1           Ensure compatibility between land uses and quality design
                through adherence to the standards and regulations in the
                Development Code and policies and guidelines in the
                Community Design Element. (LU-1)
2.2.2           Require new uses to provide mitigation or buffers between
                existing uses where potential adverse impacts could occur,
                including, as appropriate, decorative walls, landscape
                setbacks, restricted vehicular access, enclosure of parking
                structures to prevent sound transmission, and control of
                lighting and ambient illumination. (LU-1)
2.2.3           Sensitively integrate regionally beneficial land uses such as
                transportation corridors, flood control systems, utility
                corridors, and recreational corridors into the community.
                (LU-1 and CD-1)
2.2.4           Hillside development and development adjacent to natural
                areas shall be designed and landscaped to preserve natural
                features and habitat and protect structures from the threats
                from natural disasters, such as wildfires and floods. (LU-1)
2.2.5           Establish and maintain an ongoing liaison with Caltrans,
                the railroads, and other agencies to help minimize impacts
                and improve aesthetics of their facilities and operations;
                including possible noise walls, berms, limitation on hours
                and types of operations, landscaped setbacks and decorative
                walls along its periphery.

     2.2.6            Establish and maintain an ongoing liaison with the County
                      of San Bernardino to conform development projects within
                      the City’s sphere of influence to the City’s General Plan.
                      (LU-2)
     2.2.7            Control the development of industrial and similar uses that
                      use, store, produce or transport toxics, air emissions, and
                      other pollutants. (LU-1)
     2.2.8            Control the location and number of community-sensitive
                      uses, such as alcohol sales, adult bookstores and
                      businesses, game arcades, and similar uses based on
                      proximity to residences, schools, religious facilities, and
                      parks. (LU-1)
     2.2.9            Require Police Department review of uses that may be
                      characterized by high levels of noise, nighttime patronage,
                      and/or rates of crime; providing for the conditioning or
                      control of use to prevent adverse impacts on adjacent
                      residences, schools, religious facilities, and similar
                      “sensitive” uses. (LU-1)
     2.2.10           The protection of the quality of life shall take precedence
                      during the review of new projects. Accordingly, the City
                      shall utilize its discretion to deny or require mitigation of
                      projects that result in impacts that outweigh benefits to the
                      public. (LU-1)
     Distinct Character and Identity
     San Bernardino is blessed with a rich mixture of significant features and
     distinct areas, such as the San Bernardino Mountains, a vibrant downtown,
     a baseball stadium, a rich cultural heritage, and two universities.
     Unfortunately, these features are often overshadowed by the presence of
     deteriorating strip commercial, unattractive signage, vacant housing, and
     poorly maintained and dilapidated structures. In addition, San Bernardino
     has evolved over time without a defined strategy for the organization of
     land uses, building forms, open spaces and linkages. Consequently, a
     number of districts are poorly defined or inadequately linked to adjacent
     ones. It also difficult to determine when you have entered or left the City,
     which is partly due to confusing jurisdictional boundaries and
     unincorporated islands, as well as to the lack of a unifying theme. Man
     made “edges” (e.g. Santa Fe Railroad, rail yards, I-215, and I-10) tend to
2-36                                                            City of San Bernardino

                                                                                               2 Land Use
isolate different districts from one another. These edges deserve special
attention in creating clear linkages.
Connecting, blending, and marketing the gems of the community and
creating recognizable places where people can gather, shop, and socialize
is an important ingredient in achieving the Vision. In addition to the
Strategic Policy Areas detailed at the end of this chapter, the following
goal and policies are intended to capitalize on our City’s unique qualities.
2.3             Create and enhance dynamic, recognizable places for
                San Bernardino’s residents, employees, and visitors.
Policies:
2.3.1           Commercial centers, open spaces, educational facilities,
                and recreational facilities should be linked to residential
                neighborhoods. (LU-1)
2.3.2           Promote development that is compact, pedestrian-friendly,
                and served by a variety of transportation options along
                major corridors and in key activity areas. (LU-1)
2.3.3           Entries into the City and distinct neighborhoods should be
                well defined or highlighted to help define boundaries and
                act as landmarks. (CD-1 and CD-3)
2.3.4           Develop a cohesive theme for the entire City as well as
                sub-themes for neighborhoods to provide identity, help
                create a sense of community, and add to the City’s
                personality. (CD-1 and CD-3)
2.3.5           Capitalize on cultural events, such as the Route 66
                Rendezvous, to help market and build a distinct identity for
                the City.
                                                                             In 2003, the Route 66 Rendezvous
2.3.6           Circulation system improvements shall continue to be         attracted over 2,100 cars and over
                pursued that facilitate connectivity across freeway and rail 550,000 spectators.
                corridors. (C-1)
2.3.7           Improvements shall be made to transportation corridors that
                promote physical connectivity and reflect consistently high
                aesthetic values. (CD-1)
2.3.8           Continue to enhance Hospitality Lane as a major shopping
                and office center for the City. (CD-3)
City of San Bernardino                                                                           2-37

     2.3.9            Facilitate the improvement and expansion of the National
                      Orange Show, including the formulation of a master plan
                      that addresses on-site and surrounding uses, access, and
                      design. (CD-3)
     Redevelopment and Revitalization
     San Bernardino has a wide range of structural conditions, level of property
     maintenance, and quality of development. San Bernardino also contains
     many historically critical corridors that, as new freeways have developed
     and the economy changed, have declined in vitality and appearance.
     Consequently, there is a considerable amount of underutilized properties,
     marginal uses, and vacant lands in the City. Fortunately, this also means
     that there is a considerable amount of development potential in the City.
     This potential can be realized through the development of vacant lands
     and the intensification and rehabilitation of existing development to
     become more productive.
     However, the City has many historical and cultural assets that must be
     recognized as revitalization occurs. Protecting and building upon San
     Bernardino’s assets to capitalize on current and future growth dynamics
     will require redevelopment and revitalization strategies to enhance
     existing uses and bring new development to the City. A more thorough
     discussion of redevelopment as an economic development strategy is
     addressed in the Economic Development Element. The following goal
     and policies are focused on land use.
     This General Plan focuses economic development potential along key
     corridors and in selected activity centers. This is accomplished through
     the Strategic Area Overlay districts described later in this Element. One
     of the key strategies represented by the Strategic Area Overlay system in
     this Plan is simply to recognize, enhance, and promote the gems that exist
     in the community so that a positive image can be regained. In addition,
     the Plan focuses on creating distinct, discernible “places” of varied sizes,
     functions, and complexity. By this means, economic activity can be
     stimulated to reinforce itself: achieving greater private sector profit, public
     benefit, and sustainability over the long haul. Existing magnets for
     development can therefore be made much more attractive and, over time,
     stimulate an improved living environment.

2.4             Enhance the quality of life and economic vitality in
                San Bernardino by strategic infill of new development
                and revitalization of existing development.
Policies:
2.4.1           Quality infill development shall be accorded a high priority
                in the commitment of City resources and available funding.
2.4.2           Continue to provide special incentives and improvement
                programs to revitalize deteriorated housing stock,
                residential neighborhoods, major business corridors, and
                employment centers. (LU-3 and LU-4)
2.4.3           Where necessary to stimulate the desired mix and intensity
                of development, land use flexibility and customized site
                development standards shall be achieved through various
                master-planning devices such as specific plans, planned
                development zoning, and creative site planning. (LU-1)
2.4.4           Protect large parcels that front onto freeways and
                commercial corridors from subdivision into smaller parcels.
2.4.5           Explore the creative use of powerline easements and other
                utility easements for economically viable uses.
2.4.6           Work with Omnitrans to explore initiatives that promote
                redevelopment near transit stops in order to encourage
                transit ridership, reduce vehicular trips, improve air quality,
                and improve traffic congestion:
                a. Concentrate mixed use development, retail,
                     employment, entertainment, educational, and
                     civic/government uses within walking distance of
                     transit stops.
                b. Explore the use of incentives that can be awarded to
                     projects that provide pedestrian amenities (wide
                     sidewalks, public plazas, seating areas, etc…) and/or
                     include desirable uses located within walking distance
                     (1/2 mile) of transit stops. Incentives may include
                     density bonuses, increases in non-residential floor area,
                     reductions in parking requirements, and modified
                     development standards.

     Quality Development
     Due to the age of San Bernardino and the numerous periods in which
     development has occurred, there is a wide range in the quality of
     developments. Some projects are exemplary illustrations of what to
     achieve and others of what to avoid. Our Vision is clear in this; the
     citizens of San Bernardino want developments that are of a high value
     with a careful attention to detail. We also want properties to be
     maintained at a high level to help improve the image of San Bernardino.
     A more detailed discussion of aesthetic quality is provided in the Urban
     Design Element. The policies in this Element focus on the land use
     aspects of quality development.
     2.5             Enhance the aesthetic quality of land uses and
                     structures in San Bernardino.
     Policies:
     2.5.1           Use code enforcement in coordination with all relevant City
                     departments to reverse deterioration and achieve acceptable
                     levels of development quality. These efforts should focus
                     on structural maintenance and rehabilitation, debris and
                     weed removal, property maintenance, and safety. (LU-4
                     and LU-5)
     2.5.2           Continue collaboration with the San Manuel Indians and
                     County of San Bernardino to achieve acceptable
                     development quality within San Bernardino’s sphere of
                     influence.
     2.5.3           Partner with the San Manuel Indians to jointly promote
                     opportunities in the area and to address the needs of future
                     developments in areas surrounding tribal lands.
     2.5.4           Require that all new structures achieve a high level of
                     architectural design and provide a careful attention to
                     detail. (LU-1)
     2.5.5           Provide programs that educate residential and commercial
                     property owners and tenants regarding methods for the
                     maintenance and upkeep of their property. (LU-5)

                                                                            2 Land Use
2.5.6           Require that new developments be designed to complement
                and not devalue the physical characteristics of the
                surrounding environment, including consideration of:
                a. The site’s natural topography and vegetation;
                b. Surrounding exemplary architectural design styles;
                c. Linkages to pedestrian, bicycle, and equestrian paths;
                d. The use of consistent fencing and signage;
                e. The provision of interconnecting greenbelts and
                    community amenities, such as clubhouses, health clubs,
                    tennis courts, and swimming pools;
                f. The use of building materials, colors, and forms that
                    contribute to a “neighborhood” character;
                g. The use of extensive site landscaping;
                h. The use of consistent and well designed street signage,
                    building signage, and entry monumentation;
                i. A variation in the setbacks of structures;
                j. The inclusion of extensive landscape throughout the
                    site and along street frontages;
                k. The articulation of building facades to provide interest
                    and variation by the use of offset planes and cubic
                    volumes, building details, balconies, arcades, or
                    recessed or projecting windows, and other techniques
                    which avoid “box”-like structures;
                l. The integration of exterior stairways into the
                    architectural design;
                m. The screening of rooftop mechanical equipment;
                n. The use of a consistent design through the use of
                    unifying architectural design elements, signage,
                    lighting, and pedestrian areas;
                o. The provision of art and other visual amenities;
                p. The inclusion of awnings, overhangs, arcades, and other
                    architectural elements to provide protection from sun,
                    rain, and wind; and
                q. The location of parking at the rear, above, or below the
                    ground floor of non-residential buildings to enhance

     Conservation
     San Bernardino has an unusual array of historic and environmental
     resources. The citizens of San Bernardino share a strong desire to
     minimize the potential impacts of future development on these resources,
     especially in hillside, mountainous, and sensitive habitat areas. Conserving
     the significant features of these land and history can enhance the City’s
     quality of life, help maintain a rural feeling in certain areas, and balance
     the need for development with related environmental qualities.
     2.6              Control development and the use of land to minimize
                      adverse impacts on significant natural, historic,
                      cultural, habitat, and hillside resources.
     Policies:
     2.6.1            Hillside development and development adjacent to natural
                      areas shall be designed and sited to maintain the character
                      of the City’s significant open spaces and historic and
                      cultural landmarks. (LU-1)
     2.6.2            Balance the preservation of plant and wildlife habitats with
                      the need for new development through site plan review and
                      enforcement of the California Environmental Quality Act
                      (CEQA). (LU-1)
     2.6.3            Capitalize on the recreational and environmental resources
                      offered by the Santa Ana River and Cajon Wash by
                      requiring the dedication and development of pedestrian and
                      greenbelt linkages. (LU-1 and PRT-3)
     2.6.4            Work with project proponents to allow the adaptive reuse
                      of historic structures, especially as professional offices and
                      medical uses. (LU-1)
     Community Services and Infrastructure
     With population growth and urban activity continuing to increase,
     developments will require further investments in the maintenance,
     rehabilitation, and provision of capital improvements such as new and
     improved roads, utilities, parks, libraries, community centers, schools, and
     other public uses and services necessary to support a quality urban life.

Urban activity is highly dependent upon the availability of adequate water
supplies. While many cities in Southern California are in short supply of
water resources, such is not the case in San Bernardino. Due to large
levels of underground water, the water must be contained to control
flooding and reduce the threat of liquefaction. The City is in need of
additional water storage facilities and must address the contamination of
its ground water.
2.7             Provide for the development and maintenance of
                public infrastructure and services to support existing
                and future residents, businesses, recreation, and
                other uses.
Policies:
2.7.1           Enhance and expand drainage, sewer, and water
                supply/storage facilities to serve new development and
                intensification of existing lands. (U-1)
2.7.2           Work with the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water
                District to create additional water storage capacity and take
                advantage of the abundant water supplies. (U-1)
2.7.3           Continue to explore opportunities, such as water themed
                uses, to financially capitalize on the City’s water resources
                to enhance the City’s image. (U-1)
2.7.4           Reserve lands for the continuation and expansion of public
                streets and highways in accordance with the Master Plan of
                Highways. (C-3)
2.7.5           Require that development be contingent upon the ability of
                public infrastructure to provide sufficient capacity to
                accommodate its demands and mitigate its impacts. (LU-1)
Safety
A more thorough discussion of safety related issues and policies can be
found in Safety and Public Facilities and Services Elements. The focus of
the following policies is on the land use aspects of safety.
San Bernardino is crisscrossed by major earthquake fault lines and flood
channels, which must be considered in new developments and design
standards. The threat of wildland fires is a concern in the hillsides, with
City of San Bernardino                                                         2-43

     the situation aggravated by high winds in the area. With the occurrence of
     an earthquake along the San Andreas, San Jacinto, or Glen Helen/Loma
     Linda faults, much of the City is susceptible to liquefaction, particularly
     due to the City’s high water tables.
     The City has experienced a relatively high crime rate in the past, which
     resulted in severely negative economic, image and social impacts.
     However, between 1993 and 1999 the crime rate dropped by 50.5%. This
     was accomplished through community policing, proactive community
     efforts such as the Neighborhood Watch program, and the use of building
     designs that enhance safety and improved lighting.
     As the City grows, the Fire and Police Departments must be able to keep
     pace and new developments must be designed and sited to enhance safety.
     2.8             Protect the life and property of residents, businesses,
                     and visitors to the City of San Bernardino from crime
                     and the hazards of flood, fire, seismic risk, and
                     liquefaction.
     Policies:
     2.8.1           Ensure that all structures comply with seismic safety
                     provisions and building codes. (LU-1)
     2.8.2           Ensure that design and development standards
                     appropriately address the hazards posed by wildfires and
                     wind, with particular focus on the varying degrees of these
                     threats in the foothills, valleys, ridges, and the southern and
                     western flanks of the San Bernardino Mountains. (LU-1
                     and A-1)
     2.8.3           Encourage projects to incorporate the Crime Prevention
                     Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and defensible
                     space techniques to help improve safety. (LU-1)
     2.8.4           Control the development of industrial and other uses that
                     use, store, produce, or transport toxics, air emissions, and
                     other pollutants. (LU-1)

This Section focuses on the administration of the General Plan.
Administration of the General Plan includes establishing, maintaining, and
applying tools and procedures for interpreting the intent of the General
Plan and applying that interpretation.
2.10            Actively apply, enforce, and utilize the General Plan in
                the day-to-day activities of the City.
Policies:
2.10.1          Ensure that all decisions related to the physical
                development and growth of the City of San Bernardino
                complies with the General Plan. Specifically, the
                provisions of this plan shall be applied to the following:
                a. Proposed private development projects;
                b. Proposed public works projects in support of land
                    development or preservation (Government Code
                    Section 65401);
                c. Proposed acquisition or disposal of public land
                    (Government Code Section 65401); and
                d. Adoption of ordinances and standards for implementing
                    General Plan land use designations, especially through
                    the Development Code.
2.10.2          Permit amendments to the General Plan in accordance with
                the following:
                a. Technical Amendments – involves changes that do not
                    alter the basic assumptions or policy direction of the
                    plan and only involve changes of a technical nature
                    (corrections to statistics; mapping error corrections;
                    editorial clarifications that do not change the intent of
                    the General Plan) may be approved by the Development
                    Services Director as necessary.
                b. Mapping/Policy Amendment - involves changes in land
                    use designations, basic assumptions, the vision, or
                    policies and requires approval by the Mayor and
                    Common Council and a recommendation by the
                    Planning Commission. (LU-1)

     2.10.3 Ensure that residents of San Bernardino have the
            opportunity to provide input to the determination of future
            land use development that may significantly affect the
            character and quality of life.

                                                                             2 Land Use
STRATEGIC POLICY AREAS
This section of the Land Use Element provides specialized goals and
policies, in addition to those identified earlier, which address specific
areas of the City. Together with the other elements of the General Plan,
specific plans, the Development Code, and ongoing neighborhood and
capital improvement programs, the policies of the Strategic Areas are
intended to help create, preserve, revitalize, and enhance selected areas of
the City.
The Strategic Area Map (Figure LU-5) describes the locations of the
Strategic Areas. The boundaries on this map are intended to be general in
nature and not precise. Instead, the map depicts general areas where a
desired outcome is sought. Application of the strategies to adjacent
parcels is appropriate if that action contributes to the desired outcome of
the Strategic Area commensurate with costs and impacts.
The Strategic Policy Areas include two basic distinctions: areas where
enhancement is desired but changes in the land use pattern are not
anticipated or desired and those areas where change is desired and merits
guidance and/or stimulation. These two areas are described as follows:
1.       Urban Conservation and Enhancement Areas. Areas where the
         goals and policies of the General Plan focus on preservation and
         enhancement of existing neighborhoods and where fundamental
         changes in the land use pattern are not anticipated or desired.
         These areas are subject to the goals and policies of the General
         Plan.
2.       Strategic Areas. Areas where change is either imminent and needs
         stimulation/guidance or where change is desired and needs
         stimulation/guidance.
Each Strategic Policy Area contains a brief description of the physical
conditions and issues followed by a set of Strategies. Strategies are
unique structural aspects of the Strategic Policy Areas. Strategies are
similar to the Policies contained in other parts of the General Plan but are
focused on initiative. Whereas the rest of the General Plan is a
combination of general initiatives and ongoing reactions of proposals,
Strategies are intended to result in actions and provide direction to
influence each particular proposal.

Urban Conservation and Enhancement Area
The lands identified in the Urban Conservation and Enhancement Area
account for the vast majority of the planning area. The Urban
Conservation and Enhancement Area is not intended to undergo a
fundamental change in the land use pattern. Instead, the focus of this
Strategic Area is on stability and quality assurance. Strategies are aimed
at enhancing and improving the existing uses. The policies and
implementation measures in this General Plan and the Neighborhood
Improvement Program guide the enhancement of this Strategic Area.
Strategic Areas
The intent of these Strategic Areas is to achieve a fundamental change in
the land use pattern or quality of development. These areas are identified
because change is either imminent and needs guidance or is desired and
needs guidance and/or stimulation.
1.       San Bernardino Valley College Strategic Area
San Bernardino Valley College Strategic Area is located in the
southwestern portion of the City and is generally bounded by the City of
Colton on the west and south, Mill Street on the north, and K Street on the
east.
The San Bernardino Valley College, the centerpiece of this area, is a
community college with an enrollment of approximately 10,000 students.
The college is a major community feature that can be capitalized upon as a
catalyst for growth and improvement in the area, as well as a positive
marketing tool for the City as a whole. The intent of the strategies in this
Strategic Area are to interconnect and unify the district through the use of
cohesive design, landscaping, and signage, enhanced pedestrian
connections, and improved parking conditions. A fundamental tenant of
this Strategic Area is to preserve the flexibility of the campus to grow and
change while improving the aesthetic conditions and connectivity of the
District.
Strategies
1.       Partner with San Bernardino Valley College and the City of Colton
         to:
         a) Prepare design and landscaping guidelines for the major street
             frontages within the San Bernardino Valley College influence
             area.
City of San Bernardino                                                        2-55
        b) Improve on-campus parking and reduce college related parking
            in the adjacent residential neighborhoods.
        c) Explore opportunities for off-campus parking on the vacant
            parcels to the west of Mount Vernon Avenue and joint use
            parking in the commercial center on the southwestern corner of
            Mount Vernon Avenue and Mill Street.
        d) Improve the pedestrian connectivity to the adjacent commercial
            uses.
     2. Improve entry monumentation and install landscaping to identify
        this area as an entry into the City of San Bernardino.
     3. Partner with the San Bernardino Valley College to:
        a) Promote activities and events.
        b) Promote the City and the college.
        c) Address access and parking issues.
        d) Address campus security.
        e) Explore opportunities for future campus expansion and areas
            for a development partnership. For instance, the College and
            City could acquire, develop, and lease the commercial property
            on the corner of Mill Street and Mount Vernon Avenue. This
            property could become a revenue generator and house a
            campus village that consisted of the aircraft maintenance
            facilities, offices, a conference center, student parking, and
            student oriented commercial uses. The commercial uses on site
            could be incorporated into the campus village.
     4. Develop a neighborhood revitalization program that helps the
        surrounding residential areas to improve their appearance and
        incorporate the design and landscape guidelines developed for the
        area. The revitalization program should address landscaping,
        lighting, facade improvements, and safety (e.g. Neighborhood
        Watch programs).
     5. Partner with San Bernardino Valley College, and potentially the
        Building Industry Association and Chamber of Commerce, to
        develop a curriculum that addresses neighborhood revitalization,
2-56                                                      City of San Bernardino
                                                                              2 Land Use
         household maintenance, improvements, and facade improvements.
         Utilize the class to help improve the surrounding neighborhood.
2.       Santa Fe Depot Strategic Area
The Santa Fe Depot Strategic Area is located in the western portion of the
City, immediately west of Downtown and Interstate 215. The Strategic
Area is bounded on the northern end by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Railroad line, on the south by Rialto Avenue, on the east by Interstate 215,
and on the west by Viaduct and Giovanola Avenues.
The centerpiece of this Strategic Area is the Historic Santa Fe Depot, a
three-story mission style structure with four distinctive Moorish domes
and a 380-foot long arch colonnade. Because of the role the Depot played
in the City’s history and its distinctive architectural style, the Depot is a
designated historic structure. The Depot site also contains a Metro Link
station and Park-N-Ride lot. Surrounding the Depot is a mixture of
commercial, industrial, and residential uses that have little relationship or
physical connection with the Depot itself.
The goal of the Strategic Area is to integrate the Depot with the
surrounding neighborhood and create an identifiable district, help the
surrounding businesses become more economically viable, and improve
the aesthetics of the area.
Strategies
1.       Implement the Historic Depot District Concept Improvement Plan.
2.       Connect and physically integrate the surrounding uses with the
         Depot through design, landscaping, entry features, and pedestrian
         pathways, to create a distinctive character as outlined in the
         Historic Depot District Concept Improvement Plan.
3.       Assist in the creation of a railroad museum to house the historic 4-
         84 locomotive No. 3751. Assistance from the City can be
         provided through assistance in finding an adequate site, waiving
         permitting fees, and fast tracking the approval process.
4.       Identify businesses that would benefit from San Bernardino’s
         cluster of rail, transportation, and freight related services and
         develop and implement a plan to promote and encourage such
         businesses to locate in San Bernardino.
City of San Bernardino                                                         2-57

     3.       Redlands Boulevard Strategic Area
     The Redlands Boulevard Strategic Area is located in the southern tip of
     the City, just south of the 10 Freeway. The Strategic Area is bounded by
     Redlands Boulevard on the north, the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe
     Railway (BNSF) Railroad on the South, the City of Colton on the west,
     and the Gage Canal and City of Loma Linda on the East. Waterman
     Avenue bisects the Strategic Area into eastern and western halves and
     provides direct freeway access.
     Despite the proximity to and direct access from the 10 Freeway, the
     Strategic Area suffers from a lack of visibility from the freeway. In
     addition, the 10 Freeway separates the Strategic Area from the rest of the
     City and the area tends to relate more to Loma Linda and Colton than the
     rest of the San Bernardino.
     This area has been identified as a Strategic Area because of the need to
     help businesses remain economically robust and to attract viable uses that
     will help strengthen the City’s tax base.
     Strategies
     1.       In addition to the underlying land uses, allow a mixture of regional
              serving commercial, light industrial, religious, and office uses in
              the Redlands Boulevard Strategic Area.
     2.       Ensure screening and buffering between the Strategic Area and the
              residential communities to the south.
     3.       Collaborate with the Chamber of Commerce to assist the
              businesses in the Strategic Area with their marketing efforts.
     4.       Through the public review process, modify the standards for the
              size and placement of signage to allow businesses an opportunity
              to increase their visibility from the freeway.
     4.       Tippecanoe Strategic Area
     The Tippecanoe Strategic Area is located in the central portion of the City,
     south and west of the San Bernardino International Airport. The
     Tippecanoe Strategic Area is generally bound by Baseline and Rialto
     Streets on the north, the Santa Ana River on the south, Arrowhead and
     Waterman Avenues on the west, and Tippecanoe Avenue on the east. The
     boundaries of the Strategic Area include portions of the City of Highland
2-58                                                          City of San Bernardino

                                                                               2 Land Use
between 3rd and 5th Streets in order to foster cooperation with the City of
Highland for this critical area.
This area has been identified as a Strategic Area because of the need to
address the area’s infrastructure needs, to help the area to capitalize upon
adjacent economic opportunities, such as the San Bernardino International
Airport, improve the area’s aesthetics, improve the circulation system, to
redevelop vacant and underutilized lands into their highest potential, and
to capitalize upon the presence of the Santa Ana River.
Strategies
1.       Create an Infrastructure Improvement Fee for the Tippecanoe
         Strategic Area for the purposes of encouraging redevelopment and
         improvement of the area.
2.       Acquire and consolidate underutilized and blighted parcels through
         redevelopment efforts to help stimulate the redevelopment and
         revitalization of the Tippecanoe Area.
3.       Create a landscaping and sound barrier program along major
         arterials and where industrial uses abut residences to minimize
         noise impacts and improve aesthetics.
4.       Ensure that traffic signals along Tippecanoe Avenue are
         synchronized.
5.       Expand Tippecanoe Avenue from the southern City boundary to
         Baseline Avenue.
6.       Work with the cities of Loma Linda and Redlands to extend
         Mountain View Avenue north of the Santa Ana River and on the I-
         10/Mountian View intersection improvements.
7.       Coordinate with the City of Highland to ensure the development of
         an integrated infrastructure system that meets the current and
         future demands of the area.
8.       Implement measures contained in the Tippecanoe Baseline
         Infrastructure Plan, Appendix 11.
9.       Enhance and protect the Santa Ana River by ensuring that future
         industrial development does not block access to, pollute, or turn its
         back on this resource.
City of San Bernardino                                                          2-59

     5.      Eastern Recreation Village Strategic Area
     The Eastern Recreation Village Strategic Area is located in the eastern
     portion of the City. The Eastern Recreation Village Strategic Area is
     generally bound by 30 Freeway to the north, Warm Creek and Baseline
     Street on the south, Sterling Avenue and the City of Highland to the west,
     and the City of Highland on the east.
     The centerpiece of this area is the California Youth Soccer Association
     (CYSA) sports complex. The soccer complex is a seasonal regional
     destination and during the peak season, parking is limited and soccer
     tournament attendees frequently park in the surrounding residential
     neighborhoods. Park and recreational space in the area also includes the
     Spetcher Memorial Park, San Gorgonio High School, and Emmerton
     Elementary.
     Immediately south of the 30 Freeway, in the central portion of the
     Strategic Area, is the Arden-Guthrie area, which is designated as Public
     Commercial Recreation (PCR). The intent of this designation is to
     develop commercial and commercially oriented recreational uses, such as
     golf courses, fairgrounds, skateboard park, roller hockey rink, bowling
     alley, batting cages, other privately owned uses such as a water-oriented
     gated attraction, sports complexes, or softball/baseball diamonds, in a
     manner that does not negatively impact surrounding residential uses.
     This area has been designated a Strategic Area because of the recreational
     opportunities it presents. Given the soccer complex, the elementary and
     high school, park, and Warm Creek, this area can be developed and
     marketed as a recreational village. Multi-purpose trails and pedestrian
     amenities could be provided to link the village and the major features in
     the Strategic Area.
     Strategies
     1.      Convene an Eastern Recreation Village District comprised of the
             City, San Gorgonio High School, Emmerton Elementary School,
             Flood Control District, local residents, and CYSA-South Soccer
             Foundation. The purpose of the Eastern Recreation Village
             District is to:
             a) Develop a master plan of development and improvements. The
                  master plan should address allowable uses, linkage
                  opportunities, multi-purpose trails, design and landscaping
                  themes, and funding and financing options.
2-60                                                          City of San Bernardino
                                                                              2 Land Use
         b) Cooperatively address parking issues. Options to address the
             parking issue include shared off-site parking, providing a
             parking structure at the CYSA complex, or shared parking
             facilities at the Arden-Guthrie area.
         c) Explore opportunities to implement pedestrian connections.
         d) Explore opportunities to redevelop the Arden-Guthrie area in a
             manner that enhances the recreational theme of the area.
         e) Develop a program to market the features of the area, attract
             investment, and stimulate redevelopment of the Arden-Guthrie
             area and the San Bernardino Plaza commercial center.
         f) Explore uses that would be appropriate to locate in the area that
             would complement the recreational focus. Uses such as day
             care, libraries, skate parks, YMCAs, community centers,
             churches and BMX bike tracks may be appropriate in the
             Eastern Recreation Village.
2.       Continue consolidation efforts of the 21-acre Arden-Guthrie site.
         Efforts should include:
         a) Relocating current residential tenants.
         b) Consider swapping land with property owners for other
             residentially designated areas in the City.
3.       Develop a linkage program and multi-purpose trail system and
         implementation program for the Strategic Area. Create a program
         to add landscaping along Warm and Sand Creeks, which run along
         the southern and eastern borders of the Strategic Area.
4.       Partner with area colleges to develop recreational programs that
         can take place in the Strategic Area.
6.       Residential Conversion/Restoration Strategic Area
The Residential Conversion/Restoration Strategic Area contains
approximately 77 parcels and is located on the eastern edge of the City.
The area is general bound by 19th Street on the north, 18th Street on the
south, Guthrie Street on the east, and Sterling Avenue on the west.
This area was originally developed as three and four unit apartment
buildings, several of which have been demolished, are vacant, or are in a
City of San Bernardino                                                         2-61
     state of disrepair. The remaining apartment buildings are suitable for
     conversion from rental units to lower density, owner-occupied, single-
     family homes on lots that are smaller than typical lots in the area (7,200
     square feet or greater).
     This area has been identified as a Strategic Area to promote the conversion
     of the remaining apartments, as well as reinvestment and stability in the
     area.
     Strategies
     1.      Amend the Development Code to 1) allow the conversion of the
             remaining 3-4 unit apartment buildings, which are located on a
             minimum of 7,200 square foot lots, to a maximum of two single-
             family dwellings, and 2) permit the lot area for the converted
             apartments to be a minimum of 3,500 square feet, and 3) allow
             zero lot-line and flag lot configurations, subject to a Conditional
             Use Permit.
     7.      Southeast Industrial Strategic Area
     The Southeast Industrial Strategic Area is located in the southeastern
     portion of the City, just south of the San Bernardino International Airport
     Strategic Area and north of the Southeast Strategic Area. The Southeast
     Industrial Area is wedge shaped area bounded by the Santa Ana River to
     the north and west, the BNSF railroad to the south and Mountain View
     Avenue and the City of Redlands to the east. Tippecanoe Avenue runs
     north to south and generally divides the Strategic Area into an eastern and
     western half. The Gage Canal runs diagonally through the Strategic Area
     to the west of Tippecanoe Avenue.
     This Strategic Area contains a mixture of industrial and residential uses.
     Due to the proximity of the industrial uses, the adjacent residences are
     impacted by truck traffic, noise, and odor. This area has been identified as
     a Strategic Area because of the need to protect the industrial job base, help
     improve residential conditions, and to help mitigate impacts to adjacent
     residences. The Santa Ana River, which borders the northern portion of
     this Strategic Area, is a regional amenity that the City must enhance and
     protect and which can be utilized as an asset for local industrial users and

Strategies
1.       Create landscaping and wall barriers between the residential
         communities and the industrial developments to the west and
         north.
2.       Utilize Lot Beatification monies to turn vacant lots into pocket
         parks to provide a buffer between the residential neighborhood and
         the industrial area.
3.       Utilize redevelopment monies and state and federal grants to
         revitalize residential area and rehabilitate run-down units.
4.       Encourage the continued development of the industrial area by
         enhancing connections and access to the railroad and airport.
5.       Reference the East Valley Truck Study to determine issues and
         mitigation measures related to the traffic impacts from the UPS
         distribution center.
6.       Utilize Neighborhood Improvement Program, Home Improvement
         Program funds, and similar funding sources to rehabilitate older
         housing stock.
7.       Utilized EDA Mortgage Assistance Program funds to increase
         homeownership rates that may then bring about increased
         investment in homes and the neighborhoods.
8.       Enhance and protect the Santa Ana River by ensuring that future
         industrial development does not block access to, pollute, or turn its
         back on this resource.
8.       Southeast Strategic Area
As its name implies, the Southeast Strategic Area is located in the
southeast corner of the City. The area is bounded by the BSNF railroad on
the northern edge, the 10 Freeway on the south, Tippecanoe Avenue on
the west, and Mountain View Avenue and the City of Redlands on the
east.
This area has been identified as a Strategic Area because of the need to
improve the conditions and accessibility of its residential neighborhoods.
Homes in this Strategic Area are in need of rehabilitation, should be
separated from the surrounding industrial areas with berming and buffers,
and should be connected physically and socially with the rest of the City.

                                9.      San Bernardino International Airport and Trade Center
                                        Strategic Area
                                The San Bernardino International Airport and Trade Center (SBIA)
                                Strategic Area is located in the southeastern edge of the City. The
                                Strategic Area is generally bounded on the north by 3rd and 5th Streets, on
                                the south by Mill Street, on the west by Lena Road, and on the east by the
                                Cities of Redlands and Highland.
                                The SBIA is one of our greatest economic growth opportunities and
                                therefore requires our focused attention. The SBIA is comprised of two
                                portions: 1) the airport and related facilities of the former Norton Air
                                Force Base, and 2) the Trade Center, which encompasses the non-airport
                                portions of the property.
                                The Airport contains approximately 1,350 acres, which are managed by
                                the San Bernardino International Airport Authority (SBIAA), a Joint
                                Powers Authority made up of representatives from the cities of San
                                Bernardino, Highland, Loma Linda, Colton, and the County of San

The Trade Center portion of the SBIA is composed two non-contiguous
areas of the former Norton Air Force Base totaling approximately 652
acres. The Trade Center is managed by the Inland Valley Development
Agency (IVDA) and is addressed in the San Bernardino International
Trade Center Specific Plan. The IVDA is a Joint Powers Authority made
up of representatives from the cities of San Bernardino, Loma Linda,
Colton, and the County of San Bernardino.
The SBIA can accommodate large warehousing and manufacturing
companies, and more importantly, it serves as a transportation hub,
providing access to air transportation and close proximity to major rail
lines and roadways. SBIA has the capacity to provide regional air traffic
for domestic and international service, both commercial and cargo along
with the necessary support facilities, for major and smaller airlines.
There is an opportunity for the properties surrounding the SBIA to
develop with uses that are related to or can benefit from the proximity of
an airport. For instance, business oriented and general aviation related
uses, manufacturing, warehousing, offices, and travel related business
such as hotels, could be attracted by the presence of the Airport.
Strategies
1.       Create a Fast Track permitting process for businesses seeking to
         locate in the SBIA Strategic Area.
2.       Work with homeowners and renters in the residential
         neighborhood along Tippecanoe Avenue to voluntarily move to
         another part of the City.
3.       Capitalize on the Foreign Trade Zone status to market the benefits
         of locating at the Airport.
4.       Ensure that inappropriate land uses do not encroach into the
         airport’s noise and safety zones by complying with the adopted
         Comprehensive Airport Master Plan.
5.       Partner with the SBIAA and the IVDA to create a plan that:
         a) Identifies businesses that would benefit from San Bernardino’s
             air transportation system and proximity to rail and freight
             related services. The intent is not to create an intermodal
             facility near the SBIA.
         b) Promotes such businesses to relocate to San Bernardino.

                              10.     Downtown Strategic Area
                              The Downtown Strategic Area encompasses the historic heart of San
                              Bernardino. The Downtown Strategic Area stretches from 9th Street on
                              the north to Mill and Rialto Streets on the south, from Interstate 215 on the
                              west, to Waterman Avenue on the east.
                              The Downtown plays a pivotal role in the City. It is the symbolic center
                              as well as the social and economic heart of San Bernardino. Within its
                              boundaries are the City Hall, County Administrative Center and Court
                              House, Carousel Mall, Federal building, State offices, California Theater
                              of the Performing Arts, Caltrans, a bus station, Seccombe Lake Recreation
                              Area, Arts on Fifth, Pioneer Memorial Cemetery, YWCA, Sturges
                              Auditorium, Radisson Hotel, Meadowbrook Park, and the potential Lakes
                              and Streams project, which was in process during the writing of this Plan.
                              There is an opportunity to capitalize and improve upon this role.
                              According to the Existing Economic Conditions and Trends Study
                              prepared for the General Plan Update, “the large cluster of existing multi-

government offices,           City.” The study also indicates that some of the office demand in San
entertainment, cultural, and
shopping.                     Bernardino is likely to be met by infill development in the Downtown area
                              (approximately 170,000 square feet annually over the next five years) and
                              with the City’s long-term Downtown Revitalization strategy and possible
                              expansion of the government center. The increased employment in the
                              Downtown will then provide additional support for retail and pedestrian
                              oriented retail development. An opportunity for downtown revitalization
                              are new mixed-use residential and office development projects, which will
                              help support the addition of new retail space in the Strategic Area.
                              Another area of interest is the Arrowhead Credit Union Park, which is
                              located immediately south of the Downtown Strategic Area. The
                              Arrowhead Credit Union Park provides an amenity to residents and
                              attracts a regional audience, which directly correlates with and enhances
                              the Downtown Strategic Area. However, the Arrowhead Credit Union
                              Park is not physically connected to its surroundings. Efforts should be
                              made to develop the area surrounding the Arrowhead Credit Union Park
                              with complimentary retail services including sports related uses,

restaurants and other pedestrian friendly developments to attract the retail
dollars of the Arrowhead Credit Union Park audience. These efforts
should include increased landscaping and street furniture treatments to
enhance the visual appeal and pedestrian-friendly atmosphere.
The San Bernardino Revitalization Plan encompasses the majority of the
Downtown Strategic Area. Critical to the area, is the development of a
design theme that ties the entire downtown together.
Strategies
1.       Promote downtown revitalization by seeking and facilitating
         mixed-use projects (e.g. combinations of residential, commercial,
         and office uses).                                                      The Arrowhead Credit Union
                                                                                Park, home of the Inland Empire
2.       Continue to facilitate the development of outdoor dining in the        66ers.
         downtown area.
3.       Allow the ground floor of new non-residential and residential
         structures to incorporate “pedestrian-active” retail uses
         (restaurants, florists, gift shops, bookstores, clothing, shoe repair,
         etc.).
4.       Accommodate residential units above the first floor of commercial
         structures provided that:
         a) The impacts of noise, odor, and other characteristics of
             commercial activity can be adequately mitigated; and
         b) A healthy, safe, and well-designed living environment with a
             complement of amenities can be achieved for the residential
             units.
5.       Buildings in the downtown should be designed, sited, and massed
         to convey an “urban-like” character; locating structures in
         proximity to sidewalks, using architectural design styles and
         materials which visually convey a sense of “mass” and
         “permanency” (such as granite and marble, defined piers and
         columns, etc.), incorporating multiple stories, and similar
         techniques.
6.       Preserve significant historic structures and community features and
         incorporate historic themes and community symbols into the
         design of the Downtown area to maintain a strong character and
         distinguish it as the City’s historic/civic core.
City of San Bernardino                                                                            2-67

     7.      Provide generous pedestrian amenities such as wide sidewalks,
             ground-level retail uses, parkways, vintage streetlights, sitting
             areas, and street furniture.
     8.      Establish a consistent street lighting type in the downtown area
             utilizing a light standard that is compatible with the historic
             commercial fabric and coordinated with an overall street furniture
             and graphics/signage program.
     9.      Encourage that buildings be located within twenty-five feet of the
             sidewalk, except for setbacks to allow outdoor dining, pedestrian-
             oriented plazas, courtyards, and landscaped areas.
     10.     Commercial and office buildings should be designed to enhance
             pedestrian activity and convey a “human scale” at their street
             elevation.
     11.     Parking should be located to the rear, below, or above the ground
             floor of the street-facing commercial/office structure.
     12.     Attract/develop high end housing in the Downtown Strategic Area,
             especially adjacent to parks and other desirable amenities.
     13.     Encourage mixed use development and pedestrian friendly
             uses/development adjacent to transit stops.
     11.     Community Hospital Strategic Area
     The Community Hospital Strategic Area is located on the west side of the
     City and is generally bounded by I-210 on the north, 16th Street on the
     south, Western Avenue and I-215 on the east and Pennsylvania Avenue on
     the west. This Strategic Area is bisected by Medical Center Drive.
     This Strategic Area is anchored by the Community Hospital of San
     Bernardino. Numerous medical offices have developed in the surrounding
     area and, in essence, create a medical district. The purpose of this
     Strategic Area is to provide incentives and programs that capitalize upon
     the presence of the hospital and surrounding medical offices, which can
     act as a catalyst for improvements in the area and to facilitate medically
     related development in the future.
     1.      Prepare design and landscaping guidelines for the major street
             frontages within the Strategic Area.

2.       Improve the pedestrian connectivity and safety throughout the
         Strategic Area.
3.       Improve entry monumentation and install landscaping to identify
         this area as a medical district. Directories and informational kiosks
         should be installed on major intersections and roadways.
4.       Develop a neighborhood revitalization program that helps the
         surrounding residential areas to improve their appearance and
         incorporate the design and landscape guidelines developed for the
         area. The revitalization program should address landscaping,
         lighting, facade improvements, and safety (Neighborhood Watch
         programs).
5.       Focus new uses to those that are medical or medically related or to
         those uses that provide a service to the users of the area, such as
         delis, restaurants, florists, and office supply/reproduction.
6.       Allow the adaptive reuse of residential uses for medical or
         medically related uses.
12.      Corridor Strategic Areas
The Corridor Strategic Areas, the Mount Vernon, E-Street, Baseline, and
Highland Strategic Areas, all share similar issues as well as solutions.
Each corridor is characterized by a pattern of strip commercial, vacant or
underutilized parcels, dilapidated structures, and uncoordinated aesthetics    E-Street Transit

     Strategies
     1.     Corridor Improvement Program.
            Purpose: The Corridor Improvement Program is an optional
            package of policy, regulatory, and incentive programs that, if
            applied, are intended to stimulate private investment and result in
            desired development within the Corridor Strategic Areas. This is
            accomplished by providing optional incentives, in the form of
            density bonuses and varied development standards, to
            developments that qualify. While the underlying land use
            designations still apply, the property owner may request, and the
2-70                                                         City of San Bernardino

                                                                                2 Land Use
         City may choose to apply, aspects of this program to stimulate
         desirable development.
         a) Priority Locational Projects are those that: 1) develop or
             improve commercial and/or mixed uses on the intersections of
             arterials, and/or 2) replace strip commercial use with
             residential uses or improve existing residential uses between
             the intersections of arterials.
             •   In Priority Locational Projects: mixed-use projects are
                 permitted with a floor area ratio of 2.0 for commercial and
                 office uses and residential density of 24 units per acre.
                 Commercial only projects are permitted at a maximum
                 floor area ratio of 1.5. A maximum height of 3 stories is
                 permitted for projects that combine residential and
                 commercial uses and 2 stories for commercial only
                 projects. Parking areas are required to be located in the
                 rear of the lot with the buildings oriented to the sidewalk.
         b) Lot Consolidation. Projects that combine parcels are eligible to
             receive a 2.5% density bonus and a 10% floor area ratio bonus
             for each lot combined.
         c) Encourage the development of desired projects or provide
             public amenities through the use of incentives. The following
             incentives are not cumulative and the City can choose to award
             the greatest level of incentives to projects that incorporate
             numerous desirable features.
             •   Proximity to transit. Projects with a residential component
                 that are located within 500 feet of a designated transit stop
                 are eligible to receive up to a 15% density bonus. Mixed-
                 use projects would also receive a 10% increase in floor area
                 ratio to accommodate the additional residential units.
             •   Shared parking. Projects that consolidate and combine
                 individual parking lots into shared parking facilities are
                 eligible to receive a 10% increase in floor area ratio and
                 reduce the overall parking requirement by 25%.
             •   Pedestrian building orientation. Projects that orient the
                 parking in the rear of the lot and orient the main entrance of
                 the building toward the sidewalk are eligible to receive an
                 increase of up to 5% in floor area ratio.
             •   Public plaza. Projects that include a public plaza of at least
                 625 square feet (no dimension less than 25 feet) adjacent to
City of San Bernardino                                                           2-71

            and accessible from the front sidewalk are eligible to
            receive an increase of 1 square foot in floor area for every
            square foot of public plaza.
        •   Public art. Projects that provide permanent, outdoor art
            that is viewable by the public from the front sidewalk are
            eligible to receive an increase of up to 5% in floor area
            ratio.
     d) Develop and implement improvement plans for each corridor
        that address:
        •   Themes for each corridor that key off the unique and
            significant features in and nearby the Strategic Areas.
        •   Design and landscaping standards for each corridor street
            frontages that enhance each theme.
        •   A promotion/marketing campaign for each Corridor
            Strategic Area.
        •   Signage and entry monumentation that identifies the
            features of and near the each Corridor Strategic Area.
        •   Opportunities for commercial intensification, such as at the
            intersection of arterials, and areas where an infusion of
            alternative land uses, such as residential or mixed use, can
            occur.
     e) Develop an incentive and assistance package that supports
        facade improvements and lot consolidation for property owners
        in each Corridor Strategic Area.
     f) Focus code enforcement activities on the dilapidated and
        vacant structures to encourage property owners to eliminate
        unsafe conditions and building deficiencies.
     g) Utilize the City’s existing demolition program to demolish
        vacant, dangerous, and dilapidated buildings.
     h) Until redevelopment occurs, develop a program to utilize the
        properties of recently demolished structures for interim uses
        that benefit the adjacent residences, such as community
        gardens, parks, or recreational areas.
     i) Utilize the existing acquisition/rehabilitation/resale program to
        improve residential properties within each Strategic Area.

         j) Utilize Lot Beatification monies to turn vacant lots into
             permanent community amenities, such as community gardens,
             pocket parks, or play grounds.
13.      University District Specific Plan
Founded in 1965, California State University, San Bernardino is located in
the northwestern portion of the City of San Bernardino. Since that time,
the growth and development of the University and City have occurred
independently. This independent growth has resulted in a University and
City that are not physically integrated.
The University represents a major opportunity to help improve the City’s
image. The City can capitalize upon the presence of the University and
use it as a catalyst to improve the surrounding community, which in turn
can help improve the image of the University. The intent of this Specific
Plan is to lay a foundation for this integration of the University into the
surrounding community.
A guiding vision of this Specific Plan is to collaborate with the University
to fully integrate the campus with the surrounding community. The
following goals and policies direct the future of the University District
Specific Plan area:
        Focus on pedestrian-oriented development, such as mixed uses and
         University related uses, and less upon auto dependent uses.
         Develop a walkable University village.
        Develop a seamless connection between the community and
         University through access, physical improvements such as
         landscaping, streetscape, signage and art, and street naming.
        Integrate the curriculum of the University with the community.
         For instance, teaching classes can be linked with area schools or
         course curriculum can incorporate community improvement
         projects.
        Capitalize upon potential economic connections. For instance, the
         University’s educational program can be connected with area
         schools.
        Market the University and surrounding community with the
         intention of becoming recognized as a “University town.”

           Market the art and cultural facilities that the University and
            surrounding community have to offer. Tie the curriculum of the
            University and the art and cultural programs of the community
            together.
           Encourage the development of trolley/transit connections between
            the University and downtown and the MetroLink station at the
            Santa Fe Depot.
           Maintain the spacious and park-like “campus feel” of the
            University.
           Maintain and improve the open communications between
            university and community and increase opportunities for the
            University to participate in City-run programs.
           Enhance the regional recreational link with the University.
           Develop efficient vehicular and pedestrian access within the
            University village.
           Offer a range of housing types to accommodate a wide range of
            population, including University faculty and staff.
           Ensure that quality housing is developed in the surrounding
            community.
     Strategies
     1.     Implement the provisions of the University District Specific Plan

14.      Verdemont Heights Area Plan
a.       Introduction
The Verdemont Heights Area Plan presents the general plan level
development and use guidance for the 3,409 acres generally located in the
northwestern corner of the City.
b.       Location
Verdemont Heights is a residential community located in the northwestern
most corner of the City, nestled in the foothills of the San Bernardino
Mountains and overlooking the Cajon Creek Wash and the Glen Helen
Regional Park. Verdemont Heights is bordered on the north by the San
Bernardino National Forest, on the southwest by Kendall Drive, Interstate
215, and the Cajon Creek, and on the southeast by the Devil’s Canyon
Flood Control Basins and the East Branch of the California Aqueduct.
Immediately southeast of these flood control basins is the California State
University at San Bernardino.
Verdemont Heights encompasses a gently north-south sloping hill at the
base of the San Bernardino Mountains. Several seasonal creeks flow out
of the mountains and can carry significant volumes of water during the
rainy times and during the spring snow melt. The most significant is
Cable Creek, which is fed by the Meyers Canyon and Meecham Canyon
creeks.
                                                                            Top: View of Verdemont Heights

Plan.
The Verdemont Heights Area Plan is a part of the General Plan and
provides the policy level guidance for the development of Verdemont
Heights.
d.       Opportunities and Constraints
Verdemont Heights is accessed from Interstate 215 by an interchange at
Palm Avenue, which is a major north-south street in the area, and besides
Little League Drive, provides the only access across the freeway. Kendall
Drive, which parallels Interstate 215, is the major arterial in the area. A

                              series of collector and local streets form a distinct grid pattern over the
                              southern end of Verdemont Heights.
                              Verdemont Heights contains a number of development constraints, chiefly
                              fire, flood, seismic, and wind hazards, archaeological sensitivities, a lack
                              of an urban level of infrastructure, and slope. In terms of the hazards,
                              much of Verdemont Heights is subject to extreme and moderate fire
                              hazards and high winds. The southwestern portion of the community is
                              also subject to 100 and 500-year flooding. The San Andreas Fault runs
                              along the northern edge of Verdemont Heights and the southern edge is
                              subject to liquefaction.
                              An urban level of infrastructure does not serve the majority of Verdemont
                              Heights and new developments are required to extend services into the
                              area, which raises the costs of development. The City coordinates the
Due to the rural character of development of required infrastructure systems, which, as of 2004, are
parts of Verdemont Heights,
many roadways are partially   funded by four development fees: the Verdemont Infrastructure fee, the
improved and lack complete    Chestnut Drainage Fee, Verdemont fire station service area mitigation fee,
width, curbs, gutters, and    and the Palm Box Culvert/Traffic Signals fee.
sidewalks.
                              Because of its location at the foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains,
                              portions of Verdemont Heights are subject to the Hillside Management
                              Overlay District. The purpose of the Hillside Management Overlay is to
                              regulate development in the hillsides to protect the hill’s topographic
                              character and environmental sensitivities, reduce cutting and scaring, and
                              ensure high quality design that “fits” with the project’s surroundings. This
                              is accomplished through the enforcement of policies that limit densities
                              based upon the percentage of slope: the steeper the slope, the less the
                              residential density allowed. Projects located at the base of the foothills on
                              slopes of 15% or less are not subject to the provisions of the Overlay.
                              As of 2004, Verdemont Heights was in need of additional parkland to
                              serve residents. In 2004, Verdemont Heights contained nine developed
                              parks totaling 65.5 acres. This does not include the 26-acre Little League
                              fields, which are not considered public parks. Based upon 3.340 persons
                              per household3, Verdemont Heights could accommodate approximately
                              16,671people. Based upon the City’s parkland requirement of 5 acres of
                              parkland per 1,000 population, a total of 83 acres of public parks are

Recreation, and Trails Chapter of this General Plan. It is important to note
that as of the writing of this General Plan, there were several parks in the
process of being dedicated and improved in conjunction with new
residential tracts.
e.       Area Plan Concept
The goal of the Verdemont Heights Area Plan is to provide the guidance
and direction to create an identifiable village that is unique and includes a
range of services and activities to serve the residents of the area.
(1)      Land Use Concept
As shown on Figure LU-6, the land use plan identifies three distinct
subareas within Verdemont Heights that are connected by an integrated
signage and landscaping program. The first subarea is Verdemont Estates,
which is located in the northwestern portion of the area, basically west of
Little League Drive. The Residential Estate land use designation
characterizes this subarea.
The second subarea is the Verdemont Hills, which is a collection of
suburban subdivisions located adjacent to I-215 and extending to the
foothills east of Little League Drive. The Residential Low and Residential
Suburban land use designations characterize this subarea. This is also the
subarea that contains the Little League Ballfield and the Palm Avenue
Elementary School. The northern portion of Verdemont Hills is subject to
the slope density limits and development standards of the Hillside
Management Overlay District.
The third subarea is Verdemont Plaza, which is located adjacent to
Interstate 215 near Palm Avenue and Cable Creek. This subarea contains
commercial properties that are oriented toward the freeway and mainly
serve travelers. This area includes gas stations and eateries. The
Commercial General land use designation characterizes this subarea.
(2)      Gateway Features
Unique entry features, or gateways, help identify Verdemont Heights and
create a common identify for the entire area. As shown on Figure LU-6,
several gateways are proposed at strategic points around Verdemont
Heights. These gateways incorporate significant features, such as unique      Pedestrian gateway enhancements
public art or signage, signature landscaping, and directional signage.        and entry signage, such as these
                                                                              examples, should be used to help
                                                                              differentiate and identify

                                  Unique and clear identification signs help travelers navigate through the
                                  area and help students quickly access the University. Due to the proximity
                                  of the University, Kendall Drive is an ideal place to create an exciting
                                  image consistent with the University District Specific Plan. Accordingly,
                                  themed banners and signage should be permitted in the right-of-way along
                                  Kendall Drive to advertise special events, sporting events, Little League
                                  functions, education and cultural programs and simply to maintain the
                                  University’s presence in the community. Informational kiosks can help
                                  strengthen the connection between the University and Verdemont.

                                  within Verdemont Heights. Landscaping, fencing, lighting, and trails
                                  work together to enhance the image of the area.

f.       Goals, Policies, and Strategies
2.11            Create an identifiable and unique village that includes
                distinct residential neighborhoods and a full array of
                services and activities to meet the needs of residents
                of the area.
2.11.1          Enhance the three distinct subareas that comprise
                Verdemont Heights:
                a. Verdemont Estates, which is located in the
                    northwestern portion of the area west of Little League
                    Drive, has a rural character and consists of the larger lot
                    residential uses.
                b. Verdemont Hills, which is a collection of subdivisions
                    located adjacent to I-215 and extending to the foothills
                    east of Little League Drive, and has a suburban
                    character.
                c. Verdemont Plaza, which is located along Kendal Drive
                    adjacent to Palm Avenue, contains commercial
                    properties that are oriented toward the freeway and
                    mainly serve travelers.
2.11.2          Develop a trail system in Verdemont Heights and along
                Cable Creek that provide a complete access system and
                provides direct access to Verdemont Plaza.
2.11.3          Consider the development of a direct linkage at Belmont
                Avenue to the University to help make the University an
                integral part of the Verdemont Heights living experience.
                Two options are desired for this connection: either a
                pedestrian/bicycle trail and/or a rural two-lane road.
                •   Any vehicular linkage to the University shall be
                    designed to minimize traffic passing through the
                    residential neighborhoods. Traffic shall be directed to
                    Kendall Avenue down Pine Avenue.                            If a vehicular connection to the
                                                                                University is desired, then
                •   Directional signage, traffic islands, speed bumps, and      appropriate measures, such as
                    street neck-downs are examples of some of the methods       signage, should be used to route
                                                                                traffic away from residential
                    that can be employed to calm and redirect traffic.          neighborhoods and along Pine.
2.11.4          As shown on Figure LU-6, develop an integrated corridor
                enhancement system, including landscaping and signage,
                which are unique to Verdemont Heights. The following

                                                should be used within the landscape setback along
                                                corridors.
                                            •   Utilize drought-tolerant, fire resistant, and native
                                                landscaping in the right-of-ways.
                                            •   Solid privacy or sound walls should be heavily screened

                                            to the development of gateways within Verdemont Heights:
                                            •   A formal, symmetrical landscape plan may be utilized
                                                at gateways.
                                            •   Unique, eye-catching features should be utilized in
                                                Gateways. Arches, towers, fountains, and significant
                                                landscaping should be employed to help identify the

                 •   While no strict standards are given for the design and
                     development of Gateways, they generally range in size
                     from 800 to 1,400 square feet and generally have
                     curbside dimensions of between 40 and 50 feet from the
                     corner on each side.
2.11.6           Ensure that new developments either provide their fair
                 share of recreational facilities based upon the City’s
                 parkland requirements or appropriate in-lieu fees.
2.11.7           Ensure that any in-lieu fees generated by development in    An example of a simple, yet
                 Verdemont Heights be used for new parklands within          effective wall enhancement to
                 Verdemont Heights.                                          help add character and rich detail

Strategies
1.       As described in the University District Specific Plan, collaborate
         with the University and Flood Control District to create a trail or
         perhaps a two-lane road connecting Ohio Street to Devil’s Canyon
         Levee Road or W. Northpark Boulevard. This connection would
         be periodically closed and flooded and must be designed, signed,
         and gated accordingly.
2.       Develop a landscaping, gateway, and signage program to be
         implemented by developer fees.
3.       Collaborate with the University to create a transit system
         connecting Verdemont Heights to the University and surrounding
         communities. Future transit stops should be planned in existing
         and future communities.
4.       Promote the development of higher end housing. This may include
         the creation of a University housing community for CSUSB
         professors and staff.
5.       In collaboration with the Economic Development Agency,
         University, and the Chamber of Commerce, market Verdemont
         Heights as a desirable location to live and an attractive place to
         develop due to its location and due to its proximity to the
         California State University, San Bernardino campus.
6.       Explore amending the park ordinance to allow flexibility in the
         provision of required parkland acreage and trails, through such
         means as:
City of San Bernardino                                                                         2-83

         a) As agreed upon by the City, permit higher densities, up to one
             level higher (e.g. RE to RL, RL to RS, and RS to RU) than the
             underlying land use designations allows in exchange for
             parkland set-asides.
         b) Develop a Transfer of Development Rights program to secure
             parkland while allowing developers to build at higher densities
             elsewhere in San Bernardino.
         c) Pursue the ability to utilize public flood control areas as park or
             open space areas with the San Bernardino Flood Control
             District.
     7.  Review development standards and landscaping provisions in
         relation to wildland fire, flooding, and wind hazards and ensure
         they appropriately address the threat levels in Verdemont Heights.
     8.  Require developments adjacent to designated trails to provide trails
         within a Landscape and Maintenance District, or similar method
         accepted by the City, to ensure their long term upkeep.
     9.  Ensure that individual driveway access from new residential
         subdivisions/developments is not taken directly from Arterial and
         Collector roadways to reduce conflicts with trails and vehicular
         traffic.
     10. Attract upscale local serving uses to serve the residents of the area
         and improve the desirability of Verdemont Heights.
     11. Aggressively pursue the acquisition and development of parks and
         recreation facilities to satisfy the City’s parkland requirement.
     12. Working with Omnitrans, explore the feasibility of “transit
         friendly” uses, such as park-and-ride lots, higher density transit
         oriented developments, and transit stations.

Chapter 3. Housing
INTRODUCTION
Purpose
The (2001) Housing Element is a comprehensive statement by the City of
San Bernardino of its current and future housing needs and proposed
actions to facilitate the provision of housing to meet those needs at all
income levels. The purpose of the Housing Element is to identify current
and projected housing needs in San Bernardino and set forth goals,
policies, and programs that address those needs. The Housing Element
has been prepared to meet the requirements of State law and local housing
objectives. In addition, the revised Housing Element updates the previous
Housing Element by incorporating new information and reflecting
community concerns related to housing in the City of San Bernardino.
Consistency with State Law
The contents of the Housing Element are mandated by Section 65580
through 65589 of the State Government Code. In accordance with State
law, the Housing Element is to be consistent and compatible with other
General Plan Elements. This provides for clear policy and direction for
making decisions pertaining to zoning, subdivision approval, housing
allocations, and capital improvements.
Government Code Section 65583 requires the Housing Element to include
the following components:
        A review of the previous element's goals, policies, programs, and
         objectives to ascertain the effectiveness of each of these
         components, as well as of the overall effectiveness of the Housing
         Element.
City of San Bernardino                                                       3-1

           An assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and
            constraints relevant to meeting these needs.
           An analysis and program for preserving assisted housing
            developments.
           A statement of community goals, quantified objectives, and
            policies relative to the maintenance, preservation, improvement,
            and development of housing.
           A program that sets forth a five-year schedule of actions that the
            City is undertaking, or intends to undertake, in implementing the
            policies set forth in the Housing Element.
    The 1990 Census was used as the "baseline" updated with 2000 Census
    data as available. Other sources including the California Department of
    Finance (DOF) yearly estimates of housing units, households, and
    population; the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
    regional estimates and projections; various other federal, state, and City
    agencies and organizations; and preliminary work on an administrative
    draft housing element prepared by Parsons, Harland, Bartholomew &
    Associates, Inc.
    As part of the planning process, the community and interested parties have
    the opportunity to review and provide comments on the Draft and Final
    Housing Elements during the public hearing process. The Draft and Final
    Housing Elements will be circulated to the California Department of
    Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review and comment.
    Prior to adoption, the City will hold public hearings to further obtain
    comments from the community. In addition, the City incorporated the
    goals, objectives, and priorities of the City of San Bernardino Consolidate
    Plan in the Housing Element. That plan was developed with extensive
    public input.
    Housing Element Organization
    The Housing Element is comprised of the following sections:
           Community Profile
           Housing Needs

Relationship to Redevelopment
The San Bernardino Housing Element has been developed in close
coordination with the City Redevelopment Plan, and the Redevelopment
Plan is incorporated by reference into the Housing Element. Specifically,
the San Bernardino Consolidated Plan was prepared concurrently with the
Housing Element. The Consolidated Plan, prepared by the City Economic
Development Agency, is a five year plan (Fiscal Year 2000 – 2005) that
outlines the goals, strategies and action programs as they relate to housing
and development problems. Programs within the Consolidated Plan deal
with homeownership incentives and opportunities, and the Consolidated
Plan also includes related programs dealing with job development,
improvement of the infrastructure, public facilities and fair housing.
Paramount in the Consolidated Plan is a specific strategy for the fair and
efficient use of the Redevelopment housing set-aside funds. In accordance
with State Law, 20% of the Redevelopment Agency’s tax increment is
reserved for housing-related issues. Within the City of San Bernardino,
those set-aside funds are substantial (approximately $3.5 million
annually), and they provide a significant resource for meeting the goals
and objectives of the Housing Element. The Consolidated Plan identifies
eight needs and priorities:
1) Preservation and rehabilitation of the affordable existing single family
    units.
2) Expansion of homeownership opportunities and assistance to
    homebuyers with the purchase of affordable housing – both existing
    and new construction.
3) Provision of rental assistance and preservation of existing affordable
    rental housing.
4) Assistance to homeless and special needs persons with supportive
    service programs.
5) Expansion of affordable housing opportunities through new
    construction.

    6) Promotion of economic development and employment opportunities
        for low- and moderate-income households.
    7) Improvement and expansion of infrastructure to meet current and
        future needs and to create a suitable living environment.
    8) Elimination of impediments for fair housing through education,
        enforcement and testing.
    As a means of implementing the Consolidated Plan, a Consolidated
    Annual Action Plan is prepared each fiscal year. The latest Consolidated
    Annual Action Plan for fiscal year 2002-03 identifies $161,374,205 in
    funds for various programs and a total of 4,486 housing units to be
    assisted. The “Housing Programs” contained in Section V of this Housing
    Element, specify the housing-related programs, funding amounts and
    funding sources for the five-year period covered by this Housing Element
    and the Consolidated Plan.
    Public Participation
    State law requires local governments to solicit public participation from all
    economic segments of the community in the development and adoption of
    the Housing Element. Typically, the notification and public hearing
    process achieve citizen participation in the adoption of a general plan or
    general plan element. However, given the vigorous hosing activities
    pursued by the City of San Bernardino, the City established a formal
    Citizen Participation Program. This program was initiated and
    implemented in conjunction with the preparation of the Consolidated
    Plan, and is carried forward through the annual preparation and adoption
    of the Consolidated Annual Action Plans.
    The City adopted a Citizen Participation Plan. A Community
    Development Citizen Advisory Committee (CDCAC) was established.
    The CDCAC consists of thirteen members appointed by the Mayor and
    Common Council, representing all income and ethnic groups, with an
    emphasis on those residing in identified blighted areas of the City. The
    CDCAC reviews the annual plans, including programs and funding
    allocations, and makes recommendations to the Common Council. A
    primary role of the CDCAC is to provide community outreach. In that
    capacity, notices of CDCAC meetings are sent to community service
    organizations, business organization, Chamber of Commerce, religious
    associations, and other interested individuals and groups. The
    Consolidated Annual Action Plans as well as the drafts of this Housing
    Element were made available to these organizations and individuals, and a
3-4                                                         City of San Bernardino

                                                                             3. Housing
30-day review period has been and is established to allow consideration of
and comment on the documents.
In addition to the efforts of the CDCAC, the City retained the services of a
consultant for the purposed of contacting public agencies and private
nonprofit organizations. Those efforts were in conjunction with the
preparation of the Consolidated Plan update, the Consolidated Annual
Action Plan, as well as the preparation of the Housing Element. Agencies
consulted include: San Bernardino County Health Department, San
Bernardino County Hosing Authority, adjacent city governments, and
providers of homeless services.
Finally, Citizen Participation is provided through the public hearing
process. Prior to transmittal of the draft Housing Element to the State
Department of Hosing and Community Development, public hearings
were scheduled before the City Planning Commission. In addition to the
review of the draft by the CDCAC and the public outreach achieved
through the CDCAC and public notice process, bilingual services offered
through the City Department of Housing and Community Development
for those interested individuals and organization that need such service.
This Element, incorporating comments from the State Department of
HCD, will undergo further public hearing notice and review both before
the Planning Commission and Community Council.

COMMUNITY PROFILE
Population Characteristics
1.       Population Trends
The population of the City of San Bernardino was 185,401 in 2000, a 13%
increase over 1990. This was less than the City's growth rate of 33%
between 1980 and 1990, a result of the recession and other factors in the
mid to late 1990s. The County grew at a rate of 21%, from 1,418,380 in
1990 to 1,709,434 in 2000, a decrease from the 58% growth rate between
1980 and 1990. The population of the City of San Bernardino is still
growing, but at a significantly reduced rate of less than 1% or less since
1994. These growth rates are shown in Table H-1.

5.        Age of Population
In 2000, 64.8% of the population was 18 and older, while 8.2% was 65 or
older. This is just below the County population with 67.7% 18 and older
and 8.6% 65 and older.
6.        Household Income
Households can also be characterized by income level of which four
categories are typically used for comparative purposes. The four
categories are based on the San Bernardino County median income, which
represents the mid-point at which half of all households earn more and
half earn less. Households in the "Very Low-Income" category earn 50%
or less of the median area income while "Low-Income" households earn
between 50% and 80% of the area median income. "Moderate-Income"
households earn between 80% and 120% of the area median income.
Finally, "Above Moderate-Income" households earn above 120% of the
median income. Table H-5 shows the 1999 median income ranges.

        An analysis of household growth by income level reveals that nearly 41%
        of households in the City were in the very-low and lower income brackets.
        This is a higher percentage than the countywide level of 29%. City and
        County income levels in 1999 are shown on Table H-6. Median household
        income in 1999 for all households was $31,140. Relatively, the median
        household income in the City of San Bernardino in 1989 was $25,533.
        However, HUD lists the 1998 median income as $26,845. The 2000
        Census identifies the 1999 Median Household Income as $31,140.
        Comparison between the City and County based on 2000 data shows that
        the City has a higher percentage of people in the low- and very low-
        income categories, while the County has a higher percentage of
        households in the moderate- and above moderate-income categories.
        Therefore, City residents are less able to afford housing than County

The median household income in the County in 1999 was $42,066 while
the median household income in the City was $31,140. Table H-7 shows
that there were approximately 5,022 households (8.9%) in the $10,000 to
$14,999 income bracket, which falls within the very low-income
classification. An additional 16.2% were in the low-income category and
14.3% fell within the moderate-income category.

7.       Poverty
According to 2000 Census data, approximately 27.6% of the City’s
population were below the poverty level. Of people below the poverty
level, 43% were White, 25% were “Other,” 24% were Black, 6% were
Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1% were Native American. Although 43% of
people below the poverty level were White, there was a disproportionately
City of San Bernardino                                                        3-11

     higher percentage of Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and residents of other
     ethnicities below the poverty level.
     The highest number of impoverished Whites (50%), Blacks (43%), and
     Others (48%) were adults aged 18 to 64 followed by children under age
     five, who were likely the children of the impoverished adults. The highest
     number of impoverished Asian/Pacific Islanders and Native Americans
     were between the ages of 18 and 64 (about 42.5%), followed by
     impoverished children were between the ages of six and eleven.
     An equal percentage of people (48%) below the poverty level in the City
     were age 18 to 54 and children age 17 and younger. Forty two percent of
     these children were age five and under, and are likely the children of
     young single White mothers who are female heads of household. Female
     householders represent 58% of all families below the poverty level.
     Female householders with children age 17 and younger represent 54% of
     all families below the poverty level. Only 4% of all impoverished persons
     were age 65 or older, and most (56%) were White. The poverty rates for
     each age group do not correlate with the percent of each age group within
     the total population. Compared to the total population, a higher percentage
     of children are below the poverty level, while a lower percentage of adults
     and the elderly are below the poverty level.
     Employment Trends
     1.      Area Employment Profile
     Of the City's population age 16 and older, approximately 2% were
     employed in the armed forces, 53% were employed civilians, 39% were
     not in the labor force by choice, and nearly 7% were unemployed. Of the
     61,337 people who were employed, approximately 18% were employed as
     administrative support. Other common occupations were precision
     production and craft (14%), other service jobs (13%), professional
     specialty (12%), and sales (12%) (National Decision Systems, 1990
     Census Data). It should be noted that after the closure of Norton Air Force
     Base in 1995, persons residing in the City who were employed in the
     armed forces and related civil service sector decreased.
     According to the State Employment Development Department (EDD)
     1995-2002 projection data for San Bernardino County, the largest
     occupations in the County are retail sales, general management, general
     office clerks, and cashiers. Approximately 55,710 people were employed
     in these occupations in 1995, with a projected growth in 2002 to 82,350.
     The fastest growing occupations in the County between 1995 and 2002 are

ushers/lobby attendants (112% growth), cabinetmakers/carpenters (103%),
furniture finishers (90%), machine operators (75%), and construction
(73%). However, with growth the number of people employed in each of
these occupations is far below the number of people working in retail and
general management/clerical positions. For example, it is projected that
there will be 360 ushers/lobby attendants in 2002, while there will be
openings for an additional 8,270 cashiers and 7,150 retail salespersons. A
number of white-collar office jobs, such as bank tellers and typists, will
experience decline between 1995 and 2002 due to changing technologies
and computerization. Various technical professions will also experience
decline, including aircraft engine specialists, power plant operators, and
aircraft assemblers, due to mechanization and technological advances and
plant/base closures. Table H-8 lists the employers in the City of San
Bernardino with 200 or more employees.

2.       Unemployment
According to the State Economic Development Department, the City of
San Bernardino had a 7.5% unemployment rate as of December 2002,
which is about 6,820 persons of a total labor force of 91,430 people. The
unemployment rate for the City is higher than the countywide rate of
5.1%. In 1990, the City had a significantly higher unemployment rate of
12.7%, compared to the County's unemployment rate of 4.8%. The larger
City of San Bernardino                                                     3-13
        historical gap was due to job reductions in several major industries, most
        notably the closure of Norton Air Force Base and the relocation of the
        Burlington Northern Santa Fe shop.
        These factors contributed to local unemployment and the decrease in
        aviation manufacturing and specialist jobs, which are typically higher
        paying jobs. Also, retail service jobs, the most common occupations in the
        area, tend to have seasonal swings in employment. Thus, unemployment
        rates may vary throughout the year, shrinking during winter holiday
        seasons and growing during slow sales periods in the spring.
        In analyzing the gap in unemployment rates between the City and County,
        it is important to look at education attainment levels, disabilities within the
        population, and numbers of persons receiving public assistance.
        Table H-9 shows that most adults (60.6%) in the City had a high school
        education or less, about the same percentage as countywide. About one-
        third of adults had less than a high school education, compared to about
        one-fourth of adults countywide. The high proportion of adults without a
        high school diploma has no doubt contributed to the higher rate of
        unemployment in the City and lower levels of income. Such residents
        typically have fewer employable skills.

        The rate of dependence on public income assistance may also be a factor
        in the higher City unemployment rate. Those receiving public assistance
        may not want to work because: 1) they are receiving enough money to
        survive without working; 2) they are afraid that if assistance ceases once
        they are employed, they won't earn enough to survive on their wages; or
        3) they may lose health care benefits available through MediCal.

                                                                            3. Housing
In the City of San Bernardino, 6,731 households (11.9%) received public
assistance in 1999 according to Census data. About 34,211 households
(6.5%) in the County received public assistance in 1999.
Special Needs Groups
Special needs are defined as any physical, economic, social, or cultural
characteristics that are present in a substantial percentage of the local
population that distinguish individuals from the general population with
respect to their physical and financial housing needs and support services.
Affordability issues are also important to groups such as female-headed
households, college students, farm workers, or military personnel.
1.       Elderly
The elderly face both financial and accessibility problems in finding
suitable housing. Many elderly persons are on a fixed income, which
limits their options, and when compounded by mobility limitations or the
need for extra assistance. As of 2000, there were 15, 266 persons over age
65 residing in the City. Approximately 1,648 households were elderly
persons below the poverty level (2000 Census).
Of the elderly households, about two-thirds resided in owner occupied
housing units, while one-third were renter households in 1990. However,
this does not mean that older households do not experience financial
difficulties in properly maintaining their homes, paying customary
housing expenses, or meeting monthly rental expenses. The Census
reports (1990) that 15% of the homeowners 65 years of age or more and
61% of the renters in this age group paid 30% or more for housing. Data
on households 65 and older indicate that a substantial number (although
by no means the majority) of these older adults may need either income
and/or housing assistance.
2.       Mobility and Self-Care Limitations
Approximately 5% of the City’s non-institutionalized residents have
physical conditions that affect their ability to live independently in a
conventional residential environment. These individuals have mobility
impairments, self-care limitations, or other conditions that may require
special housing accommodations or financial assistance. Individuals with
such disabilities can have a number of special needs that distinguish them
from the population at large.
Some people with mobility and/or self-care limitations are able to live
with families to assist them with housing. A segment of the disabled
City of San Bernardino                                                      3-15

     population, particularly low-income and retired individuals, may not have
     the financial capacity to pay for needed accommodations or modifications
     to their homes. In addition, even those able to pay for special housing
     accommodations may find them unavailable in the City.
     Although the California Administrative Code Title 24 requires all public
     buildings be accessible to the public through architectural standards such
     as ramp ways, large doors, and restroom modifications to enable handicap
     access, this provision does not extend to most residential projects.
     According to 2000 Census data, there were approximately 31,800 non-
     institutionalized disabled persons over age 20 in San Bernardino. An
     analysis of Table H-10 shows that most disabled persons in the City and
     County were between the ages of 16 and 64 in 1990. However, 67% of
     the disabled between the ages of 65 and 74 and 69% of the disabled over
     age 75 in the City were women. Overall, the City had higher percentages
     of people with mobility and/or self-care limitations than the County. This
     may be due to a larger number of services offered in the City, or it could
     be a result of lower living costs in the City that attracts people with limited
     budgets due to their special needs.

3.       Persons with Disabilities
Three types of disabled persons are considered as having special housing
needs: Physically, Mentally and Developmentally Disabled. Each
category is unique and requires specific attention in terms of access to
housing, employment, social services, medical services, recreation and
entertainment. According to the 2000 Census, there were a total of 36,635
persons with disabilities within the City of San Bernardino. This accounts
for 19.8% per the total City population. Compared with the County of
17.7% and the statewide of 6.8%, the number of disabled persons living
within San Bernardino is significantly higher. Of the total number of
disabled persons, 29,353, or 80.1%, are between the ages of 5 and 65, and
7,282, or 19.9%, are 65 years and older.
4.       Female Heads of Household
Most female-headed households are either single elderly women or single
mothers. Traditionally, these two groups have been considered special
needs groups because their incomes tend to be lower, making it difficult to
obtain affordable housing, or because they have specific physical needs
related to housing (such as child care or assisted living support). Of the
56,330 households in the City in 2000, 11,890 or 21% were female-headed
family households.
According to 2000 Census data for the City, female-headed households
comprised 44% of all families below the poverty level. Because of the
high percentage, it is difficult to find adequate housing that is both
affordable and able to accommodate a family. As a result, female heads of
households often spend more on immediate needs such as food, clothing,
transportation, and medical care, than on home maintenance, which results
in living units falling into disrepair.
5.       Large Families
In 1990, there were approximately 9,330 households of five or more
persons in the City and 78,476 households of five or more persons in the
County. Of the total number of households in the City, 4,647 were five
persons, 2,221 were six persons, and 2,462 were seven or more persons.
Comparatively, households of five or more in both the City and County
made up 17% of the total number of households.
As shown in Table H-11, the number of large households in San
Bernardino that own the units they occupy (4,073) is slightly less than the
number of large households that rent (5,074). In addition, the City
City of San Bernardino                                                      3-17
     contains more housing units with four or more bedrooms than the number
     of large households with the need for multi-bedroom dwelling units.

     6.      College Students
     College students may have limited budgets due to the cost of education
     and finding adequate part-time employment. Often students choose to live
     off campus to reduce living costs, selecting substandard housing or over
     crowded conditions. California State University, San Bernardino is
     located within the City and has a student enrollment of approximately
     12,000. However, the 1994 Student Needs and Priorities Survey revealed
     that on-campus housing was a low priority to students and that most
     students commuted from their homes. Since the majority of students come
     from within the community, and likely live with their parents or other
     family members, affordable student housing does not appear to be an
     unmet need in the community.
     7.      Farm Workers
     During early years in the history of the City of San Bernardino, agriculture
     was an important component of the City’s as well as the region’s
     economy. The citrus industry particularly was a central feature of the
     economy and employment base, and strongly influenced the development
     patterns within the San Bernardino Valley. With the post World War II
     development boom, however, the once prolific orange groves and grape
     vineyards began to rapidly disappear. Today, there are only historical
     reminders of the once thriving agricultural influence, the most notable
     being the National Orange Show.
     Farm workers tend to have low incomes due to the manual nature of their
     work, and they tend to have families with children and larger sized
     families. Migrant farm workers need affordable housing but on a seasonal
3-18                                                         City of San Bernardino

                                                                             3. Housing
basis. According to 2000 Census data, there were 269 people employed in
farming, forestry, and fishing occupations. This is only 0.4% of the City's
total population age 16 and over. The need for farm worker housing is less
than significant since the City is not a center of agricultural production.
The County and City Housing Authorities, and the County Agricultural
Commissioner did not have further information regarding agricultural
employment, farm worker housing, or housing needs for farm workers.
According to the California Department of Housing and Community
Development, while there is no farm worker housing in the City of San
Bernardino, Farm worker housing exists in agricultural areas of the
County, the nearest being those located in Beaumont and Indio.
8.       Homeless
Homelessness is caused by a number of social and economic factors
including a breakdown of traditional social relationships, unemployment,
shortage of low-income housing, and the deinstitutionalization of the
mentally ill. A homeless person lacks consistent and adequate shelter.
Homeless persons can be considered resident (those remaining in an area
year-round), or transient. Emergency and transitional shelters can help to
address the needs of the homeless. Emergency shelters provide a short-
term solution to homelessness and involve limited supplemental services.
In contrast, transitional shelters are directed towards removing the basis
for homelessness. Shelter is provided for an extended period of time, and
is combined with other social services and counseling to assist in the
transition to self-sufficiency.
The nature of the homeless population makes exact counting difficult. The
1990 Census found 53 "visible" people living on the streets and 916
people in homeless shelters. Because the homeless move around and are
not always visible on the street it is difficult to get an accurate count of
homeless persons in a community. The San Bernardino County Homeless
Coalition conducted a survey in 1997 and found 2,254 homeless people in
the County, including an estimate of people likely to become homeless by
2000.
Agencies Offering Public Assistance
There are 30 public service organizations and agencies in the City ranging
from after school activities for children to senior meal delivery. The
larger facilities include:
        The Frazee Community Shelter operates 5 emergency shelters,
         with a total of 77 beds and 100 clients and a hot meal program and
City of San Bernardino                                                       3-19

       job training referral service. Approximately 28,821 people utilize
       the emergency shelter services each year. They also assist with
       rent deposits and utilities, clean clothing, and bus tickets.
       Approximately 53% of their clients are families with children. The
       average stay in one of their shelters is two to three weeks.
      Mary's Mercy Center operates three facilities and provides
       essential services such as meals, emergency food bags, clothing,
       showers, and laundry services. They serve approximately 600
       clients and serve mostly single men and women.
      Option House also operates three facilities, but they provide
       transitional shelter as well as meals, showers, and counseling
       programs. There are 31 beds available to serve their 33 clients and
       the average stay is 60 days. Option House is specifically for
       victims of family violence.
      The Salvation Army operates its primary facility in the City of San
       Bernardino, but also provides services in nearby cities. They
       operate 87 beds for 162 clients, with an average stay of 30 days.
       Mostly single adults, battered women, and families use this
       program with children. In addition to emergency shelter, the
       Salvation Army offers meals, referral services, and counseling.
       The Mentally Ill Homeless Program offers a 50-bed shelter for 700
       mentally ill persons annually. They also provide case
       management, employment training, skill honing, and referral
       services. Although they have no plans for expansion, they do need
       additional beds to serve the needs of the community.
      Catholic Charities of San Bernardino/Riverside does not run a
       shelter facility, but does give vouchers/assistance for those seeking
       shelter in motels or other shelters. They also provide utility
       disconnection and eviction prevention services, along with other
       counseling, training, and emergency/food assistance.
      The Children's Fund, Inc. offers shelter assistance to children age
       18 and under as well as food, clothing, and essentials. They serve
       30,000 to 40,000 children annually.

Group Homes and Institutional Quarters
Group homes offer special assistance to a variety of housing needs ranging
from correctional facilities to college dormitories to nursing homes.
Census data showed 3.765 persons in institutionalized group quarters and
2,084 persons in non-institutionalized group quarters in 2000. Patton State
Hospital in San Bernardino serves 1,239 patients, although it only has
enough beds for 1,145. Patton State Hospital is one of the largest public
health facilities in California for the mentally ill and serves patients
throughout the State.

   HOUSING NEEDS
   Existing Housing Stock
   1.        Housing Composition
   According to the 2000 Census, the City had 63,535 housing units. Of
   these, approximately 7,205 housing units were vacant in 2000, for an
   11.3% vacancy rate. This was broken down into a homeowner vacancy
   rate of 6.1% and a rental vacancy rate of 9.7%. In comparison, the County
   had 72,775 vacant housing units, for a vacancy rate of 12.1%.
   Of the 56,330 occupied housing units, 29,536 (52.4%) were owner-
   occupied and 26,794 (47.6%) were renter-occupied. A large percentage of
   units in the City are multiple dwelling units, particularly large multiple
   dwelling units of five or more units within a housing structure. This is
   likely a result of a larger population on limited incomes and single adults
   who prefer (or can only afford) lower cost and lower maintenance
   housing. Since 1995, nearly all of the units constructed in the City were
   single-family detached housing units. This is a growing demand for these
   units as housing prices are relatively low in San Bernardino compared to
   outlying cities and counties, and a weak demand for and/or financing
   obstacles to the production of market-rate rental housing in the City.

     Housing Costs
     Housing prices are substantially lower in the City of San Bernardino than
     in many surrounding communities and countywide. Lower housing costs
     are consistent with a population of more lower-income residents. A
     number of units are available at rates affordable for very low-income
     individuals or families. For example, a person with a very low-income of
     $15,000 could spend up to $375 a month on a one-bedroom apartment,
     which is approximately 30% of their income. A sample of apartment
     complexes in the City revealed that the average one-bedroom unit was
     around $426 per month. Two-bedroom units in the San Bernardino
     average $524 per month, while three-bedroom apartment units average
     $681 per month. Other types of rental in the City were slightly lower than
     the average apartment complex unit, suggesting that apartments may have
     somewhat inflated rates or that homes and other rental units may be of
     poor quality compared to apartment units. Compared to other areas in San
     Bernardino County and surrounding counties, rental rates are fairly
     inexpensive due to the depressed status of the housing market. There are
     more housing units than can be sold or rented in the City. However, the
     condition of the housing stock may be in disrepair causing people to build
     new units, and further drive down the market, or limiting people's choices
     due to expensive needed repairs on available housing units. Table H-13
     lists various rental rates of apartment complexes and other rental units in
     the City in 1999.

There are 43 mobile home parks in the City offering 4,126 single, double,
and triple-wide spaces. The average range of rents is between $250 and
$300 and no rents exceeded $350 in the sample taken from the mobile
home parks.
Table H-14 lists prices of homes sold between 1998 and 1999. The highest
percentage of homes was three-bedroom single-family units, followed by
two-bedroom single-family units. Comparison between single-family
homes and multi-family homes/condominiums, show that condominiums
were less costly than single-family homes. However, there were nine
three-bedroom condominiums that sold for over $3,000,000, suggesting
that the average price would be lower had these expensive units not been
sold. The California Association of Realtors lists the median housing
prices for the City and County as of October 1999 as $83,500 and
$115,000, respectively. These rates increased by approximately $2,000
between September and October for nearly a 6% increase in the City and
nearly a 2% increase in the County. The median price had not increased
in the City for a year, but had increased over 7% in the year for County
homes. Between October and November 1999, median home prices in the
City grew by an additional 6%.

      Currently, there are 407 HUD repossessed homes for sale in the City's
      housing market, down from over 1,000 in 1995. Homes range from a low
      of $21,000 to a high of $154,000. The number of bedrooms ranges from
      one to eight, although most were two and three bedroom houses.
      Table H-15 compares new home prices in the County to other counties in
      the region. According to the table, new home prices in San Bernardino
      County were the least expensive in the region. Although this means that
      housing in the area is more affordable to households with lower incomes,
      it also attracts people with low-incomes as affordable housing may not be
      available in surrounding counties.

Income and Affordability
As stated previously, there are four income categories typically used for
comparative purposes based on the median income, which represents the
mid-point at which half of all households earn more and half earn less.
A standard measure of housing affordability is that housing expenses
should not exceed 30% of a household’s income, on the average. Those
who pay 30% or more of their income on housing may experience
difficulty in affording other basic necessities. However, to truly evaluate
housing affordability, individual circumstances and factors must be taken
into account. These circumstances and other factors include other long-
term debt, mortgage interest rates, the number of children in a household,
and other large, ongoing expenses (such as medical bills). Since it is
impossible to take each household’s individual circumstances into
account, the 30% rule-of-thumb provides a general measure of housing
affordability for the average household. Table H-16 shows the number of
households paying over 30% of their income on housing. Some
households choose to pay over 30% of their income for various reasons,
such as location, aesthetics, or other features. Other households choose to
pay larger percentages of their income on housing because they may
receive tax advantages or are investing with the knowledge that their
income will increase so that they pay a lower percentage of their income
on a long-term basis. In contrast, some households are forced to pay a
large percentage of their income either because they cannot afford
anything less, or they are limited to certain costs due to a lack of available
low-cost housing options. Approximately 60% of all low-income
households in the City pay over 30% of their income on housing.
                                           Table H-16

        Note: 1990 U.S. Census data uses income ranges that do not correspond exactly
        to the income categories. Therefore, there are people in the lower-income
        category that actually fall into the moderate-income category and likewise
        between the very low- and lower-income categories. The numbers in the table
        include more persons than are actually in those categories.

      Further analysis of housing expenditures as a percent of income shows
      that most owners pay zero to 24% of their income on housing (Table H-
      17). Renters with income below $20,000 tend to pay a higher percentage
      of their income on housing. However, renters with incomes above
      $20,000 usually paid less than 25% of their income on housing. The
      majority of people in the $50,000 or more income level paid 0% to 24% of
      their income on housing whether they rented or owned.

      1.       Affordability Trends
      Table H-18 shows the median gross rent in relation to income in 1990 as
      such data is not available for 1999. According to Census data, the median
      gross rent was $485 in the City and $556 in San Bernardino County.
      People with very low-incomes had a number of affordable options as 27%
      of all apartment units in the City had rents below 30% of their income.
      People with low-incomes had many more options than those with very
      low-incomes, and could easily afford the median rent. The rents were
      primarily within the range of people with low-incomes. However, those
      with moderate-incomes had the most options as at least 96% of the units in
      the City and 91% of the units in the County were within an affordable

range. However, approximately 36% of the City's population falls in the
very low-income category and therefore, it is necessary to increase the
number of units affordable to very low-income groups even though the
City has over a quarter of its units dedicated to this income group. It is
important to note that the percentage of apartments affordable within the
low- and moderate-income groups is cumulative and include the
percentage from the previous income group.

A household can typically qualify to purchase a home that is 2.5 to 3.0
times the annual income of that household, depending on the down
payment, the level of other long-term obligations (such as a car loan), and
interest rates. In practice, the interaction of these factors allows some
households to qualify for homes priced at more than three times their
annual income, while other households may be limited to purchasing
homes no more than two times their annual incomes. Based on the homes
sold in the last year and affordability rates at 3.0 times the annual income
of a three-person household, Table H-19 shows that there were 567 homes
affordable to three-person households in the very low-income category. It
is important to note that subsidized or assisted housing is not included in
these housing costs as they are not likely to be listed in local papers.

     Annual Growth of Housing Stock
     Table H-20 summarizes building activity in San Bernardino over the past
     ten years. The majority of housing units built in this period are privately
     owned single dwelling units. One publicly owned single dwelling unit
     was built in July of 1999, however, pre-1997 data does not distinguish
     between new private and public buildings, and therefore this information
     cannot be distinguished before 1997. In contrast, data for 1997 through
     1999 does not list mobile home building activity, and therefore, it is
     unknown how many mobile units were constructed in this period.
     Although building activity was strong between 1989 and 1994, growth of
     new housing units slowed significantly and has shifted away from mobile
     homes and multiple dwelling complexes to focus almost entirely on single
     dwelling units.

     Adequate utilities within a housing unit are a measure of the unit's ability
     to provide people with decent housing. The Census data shows that the

source. Seventy-seven housing units were connected to individual wells.
Most housing units were connected to the public sewer (57,007).
However, 1,620 units were connected to a septic tank or cesspool, and 177
units achieved sewage disposal through other means. Heating fuel for
occupied housing units ranged from gas and electricity to wood and solar
energy. Of the occupied housing units in the City, 45,438 had utility gas,
476 had tank gas, 8,012 had electricity, 235 were fueled by wood, 13 used
fuel oil or kerosene, 40 utilized solar energy, 60 used another type of fuel,
and 208 had no heating fuel.
The year a structure was built can, at times, be an indicator of the current
condition of the housing unit. Housing units built before 1940 may be old,
but may not necessarily be in a rundown condition. In contrast, newer
homes that were built equipped with adequate utilities and amenities may
already be rundown due to abuse or just general lack of care. However, it
is useful to look at the age of the housing stock to determine where
inadequacies may lie, or why certain units remain vacant. Table H-21
shows that the highest percentage of vacant units were newer and that the
highest percentage of housing units in the City were built in the 1980s,
although nearly 10,000 units were built during each decade between the
1940s and 1990s. The year 1963 represents the median year structures
were built according to Census data.

One hundred and seventy-three occupied units that lacked complete
plumbing facilities had householders between the ages of 15 and 64.
Twenty-six householders over age 64 lived in units without complete
plumbing facilities. However, occupied units lacking complete plumbing
facilities comprised less than 1% of all occupied households. Therefore, an
overwhelming number of homes in the City are new and do not lack
critical features such as plumbing. However, basic maintenance, such as
City of San Bernardino                                                        3-31
     roof repairs, new paint, and cleanliness will need to be encouraged to keep
     the housing stock viable.
     1.      1999 Housing Condition Survey
     The City conducted a general block-by-block analysis of housing
     conditions in all areas of the City except neighborhoods and subdivisions
     developed after the mid-1980s. The objective of the survey was to assess
     the overall, predominant conditions of properties and dwelling units at the
     block level, in contrast to a property/housing conditions survey of
     individual dwelling units. A summary of the survey findings is included in
     Table H-22.
     The survey areas included nearly 50,000 dwelling units, about 75% of the
     City’s housing stock. The survey examined exterior property and dwelling
     unit conditions using a point scoring system for yard
     maintenance/appearance and the conditions of major exterior components
     of dwelling units.
     General property conditions on each block were rated according to the
     condition of the paving, landscape, walls and fences, and the amount of
     debris surrounding dwellings. The dwelling units on each block were 35
     shows the number of blocks per property and dwelling unit condition
     rating.
     In general, there was a close correlation between property conditions and
     dwelling unit conditions at the block level. On about 9% of the blocks
     surveyed, however, property conditions varied significantly from dwelling
     unit conditions. On about 60% of blocks with substantial differences
     between housing and property conditions, the majority of dwelling units
     were in excellent or sound condition while the majority of properties had
     only fair or poor maintenance. Conversely, on about 40% of the blocks
     with substantial differences, the majority of dwelling units needed minor
     or moderate rehabilitation while the majority of properties were well-
     maintained (excellent or good condition). Blocks with substantial
     differences between dwelling unit and property conditions were generally
     scattered throughout the City.

Although there are poorly maintained properties and dwelling units in
need of rehabilitation or replacement scattered throughout older city
neighborhoods, the predominant need in most residential areas appears to
be for the correction of deferred maintenance, minor rehabilitation, and/or
the replacement of landscaping.
The survey results indicate that the property conditions in the majority of
blocks (58%) were excellent or good. Nearly 30% of the blocks surveyed,
however, had properties in predominantly poor or severely deteriorated
condition. Although a lower percentage of multi-family properties (52%)
were rated as excellent or good, most of the remaining properties were in
fair conditions (rather than poor or severely deteriorated).
The housing condition survey results indicate that the predominant
housing needs on most blocks (nearly 60%) are for deferred maintenance,
such as repainting, minor roof repairs, or door/window repair, or for minor
rehabilitation. A higher percentage of multi-family dwellings than single-
family dwellings (13% versus 6%) need moderate rehabilitation.
The biggest problem for properties in San Bernardino appears to be
landscaping maintenance. Unkempt lawns, overgrown trees and bushes,
and other yard deficiencies reduce the character and value of
neighborhoods, but can easily be rehabilitated to rejuvenate
City of San Bernardino                                                      3-33
     neighborhoods. Deteriorating walls and fences were also common,
     particularly on blocks with multi-family properties. Visible debris was a
     common problem in single-family neighborhoods, with 29 blocks
     exhibiting severe litter in the yard such as appliances, cars, and furniture.
     A few blocks had severe problems in almost all property condition
     categories (except walls and fencing where there were none).
     Of the housing condition problems noted in the survey, deteriorated roofs
     and siding (including a need for repainting) appeared to be the most
     prevalent problems.
     The majority of blocks with property and/or dwelling unit problems were
     had dwelling units mostly over 30 years old. Blocks with predominantly
     newer housing were usually good or excellent condition, although there
     were some properties in need of minor repairs and clean up. At 30 years
     of age, many property and dwelling unit components are beyond their
     useful lives and need repair or replacement.
     In summary, newer neighborhoods are in better condition than older, more
     centrally located neighborhoods, although all neighborhoods were
     interspersed with dwellings in need of some additional repair or
     maintenance.
     2.      Housing Accommodations
     The number of bedrooms within a housing unit can also characterize the
     housing stock in a community as shown in Table H-23. One- and two-
     bedroom units had the highest percentage of vacancy per total units of
     their type. However, they also represented the majority of housing types
     in the City, which suggests that there were an adequate number of these
     highly desirable units in a community composed primarily of smaller sized
     households. It should also be noted that although there were few five or
     more bedroom units, they were all occupied, suggesting that there may be
     a need for larger sized units. Because the overwhelming majority of
     housing units have complete plumbing and kitchen facilities, and are
     served with public utilities, it is unlikely that housing conditions represent
     a problem that requires governmental action. However, low property
     values do not provide strong economic incentives to property owners to
     maintain the housing stock in sound condition.

3.       Overcrowding
Overcrowding typically results when either: 1) the housing costs of
available housing with a sufficient number of bedrooms for larger families
exceeds the family's ability to afford such housing, or 2) unrelated
individuals (such as students or low-wage single adult workers) share
dwelling units due to high housing costs. This can lead to overcrowded
situations if the housing unit is not large enough to accommodate all of the
people efficiently. In general, overcrowding is a measure of the ability of
existing housing to adequately accommodate residents and can result in
deterioration of the quality of life within a community. Nearly 50% of the
housing units in the City had between four and five rooms as shown on
Table H-24. There were approximately 2.9 people per occupied housing
unit.

     There were a total of 150,298 bedrooms in 1990, with approximately 1.09
     people per room. This number lowers slightly to 1.07 when studio
     dwellings are included. In 1990, approximately 137 studios and 11,453
     bedrooms were vacant. Over 45% of these vacancies were in two
     bedroom dwellings, which may have been unaffordable to very low-
     income individuals or were too small for larger families.
     The Census defines overcrowding as 1.01 or more persons per room, and
     extreme overcrowding as more than 1.5 persons per room. Since data in
     relation to overcrowding have not been broken down into housing type by
     number of rooms, type of household, or by household income,
     overcrowding must be evaluated in terms of other factors such as cultural
     expectations, size of rooms, availability and type of common areas or open
     space, and the age and relationship of persons in the unit.
     Tables 25 and 26 summarize the overcrowding status in the City. Fifteen
     percent of the City's occupied housing units were overcrowded, compared
     to 11% of the County's occupied housing units. In 1990, there were 5,603
     (21%) renter-occupied and 2,321 (9%) owner-occupied units, totaling
     7,924 units, defined as overcrowded in the City. In contrast, Census
     figures for the County was 16% for renter-occupied and 6% for owner-
     occupied units. Compared to the County there is a significant rate of
     overcrowding in the City.

Assisted Rental Housing Eligible to Convert to
Market Rentals
In 1989, the California Government Code was amended to include a
requirement that localities identify and develop a program in their housing
elements for the preservation of assisted, affordable multi-family units.
Subsequent amendments have clarified the scope of the analysis to also
include units developed pursuant to inclusionary housing and density
bonus programs. In the preservation analysis, localities are required to
provide an inventory of assisted, affordable units that are eligible to
convert within ten years. As part of the analysis, an estimation of the cost
of preserving versus replacing the units is to be included, as well as
programs designed to preserve the affordable units.
Assisted housing projects in the City can alleviate the financial hardships
low-income households may face. Assisted housing projects are those that
offer financial aid or provide extra services for people in need of financial
or basic living assistance. There are a variety of programs, each focusing
on a specific need or with a specific goal to eliminate unmet housing
needs in the community.
The California Housing Finance Agency has three listings for State
assisted housing projects in San Bernardino. One project, Dorjil Estates is
owned by CHFA and therefore does not have contract expiration dates.
The second project, Victoria Woods, is a non-Section 8 non-Section 202
senior complex that has only received a loan from CHFA, and therefore,
does not have an expiration date. These projects are based on 50% of the
City of San Bernardino                                                         3-37
     median income and are therefore, directed toward very low-income
     households. The third project is Little Zion Manor, which operates low-
     income family and senior units. The Section 8 contract for Little Zion
     Manor is due to expire in 2021. Under Section 8 assistance, eligible
     tenants pay 30% of their income for rent, and the difference between the
     tenant's contribution and HUD pays the actual rent through operating
     subsidies to owners. Assistance is tied to the project and rent is subsidized
     only as long as the tenant occupies the unit.
     HUD's November 1999 rental listings for the City lists 15 assisted multi-
     family housing complexes. Of these 15 complexes, seven offer elderly
     units for a total of 841 designated elderly units. Thirteen of the complexes
     listed by HUD are Section 8 assisted complexes, offering a total of 1,181
     units. All of the assisted housing projects listed by HUD had no vacancies
     as of November. Of the fifteen projects, the terms of affordability on ten
     have expired, and the owners are free to charge whatever rent they desire.
     Of the five remaining projects with active affordability agreements, three
     are at-risk of conversion to market rate housing between 2000 and 2010,
     representing 218 very low-income units. Of these units, 188 are owned
     and operated by non-profit organizations that are unlikely to convert the
     rentals to market-rate housing. See (Table H-27.)
     With regard to Section 8 projects, the property owner can opt to terminate
     the Section 8 contract (opt-out), or renew the contract for another five
     years. The primary incentive for Section 8 property owners to opt-out is
     the higher rent that would be paid for these units at market value.
     In order for the property owner to successfully opt-out of the Section 8
     contract, the owner must satisfy certain procedural requirements. A
     Notice of Intent (NOI) must be filed with HUD one year before the
     termination date that indicates the owner's intent to convert the units to
     market rate. Failure to file an NOI within the specified timeframe, or
     follow the other procedures to opt-out of the Section 8 contract results in
     an automatic contract rollover for five years.
     Upon filing of an NOI, HUD may offer several incentives to property
     owners to remain in their contracts including re-financing the property
     mortgage, and establishing higher rents charged for the projects.
     Pursuant to Section 65863.10 of the Government Code, the property
     owner of a Section 8 contract must also provide six months advanced
     notification to each tenant household if the property owner intends to
     terminate the Section 8 contract. The notice must indicate the anticipated
     date of conversion and the anticipated rent increase. The property owner
     is also required to serve notice to the City.

  The cost of conserving the assisted and inclusionary units is estimated to
  be significantly less than that required to replace the units through new
  construction. Detailed information is not available to calculate the
  difference in cost between preserving and constructing units affordable to
  low income households. The difference between very low income and
  market rate rents requires the most subsidy. Preserving low- and
  moderate-income units does not require as much subsidy. Since land
  prices and land availability are generally the limiting factors to
  development of low income housing, it is estimated that subsidizing rents
  to preserve assisted housing is more feasible and economical than new
  construction.
   City of San Bernardino                                                                      3-39
     There are three methods of assisting low-income tenants living in at-risk
     units: 1) provide monthly rental subsidies in the private market, 2) acquire
     and preserve the presently subsidized units, and 3) construct comparable
     replacement units.
     The estimated cost of providing monthly subsidies to 218 very low-
     income households could range from $0 to $1.2 million annually, based on
     the range of rents in the local housing market and assuming that those
     being assisted will, on the average, have incomes between 30% and 50%
     of the San Bernardino County median income for a household of four
     persons. The average annual subsidy is estimated to be $583,000, the
     present value of which over 30-years is about $10.2 million (assuming a
     long-term annual inflation rate of 4%).
     An analysis of seven rental apartment properties recently for sale in the
     City (ranging from 11 to 197 rental units) revealed a range of per unit cost
     from $26,000 to $53,000, and per square foot cost from $21 to $45,
     depending on the location, unit sizes, number of bedrooms, age, and
     amenities.1 The estimated acquisition cost per unit for apartments that
     would match the assisted rental housing developments ranges from
     $32,000 to $47,000. Replacement of the 218 at-risk units through
     acquisition of units would range from $7 million to $10.3 million, plus
     annual operating and maintenance costs.
     The cost of constructing new rental units is estimated to range from
     $50,000 to $70,000 per dwelling unit depending on the size, density, and
     amenities. The cost of constructing 218 new rental units similar to the
     assisted units would probably range from $55,000 to $65,000 per dwelling
     unit, or $12 million to $14.2 million.
     Of the three options for addressing the potential loss of subsidized rental
     units, the least expensive option in present dollars would be the payment
     of monthly rental subsidies to very low-income households over a 30-year
     period. Although this option would guarantee that the same number of
     very low-income renters are assisted as the number of subsidized rental
     units that could be lost, the payment of subsidies does not preserve the
     affordability of rental units or replace affordable rental units lost.
     The next more costly alternative would be the acquisition of existing
     subsidized rental housing, but only if the rental units do not require
     extensive rehabilitation. If so, the construction of new replacement unit
     might be as cost effective.

 1.       Entities Interested in the Right of First Refusal
 Should the City determine that the acquisition of existing at-risk rental
 housing projects is the most prudent course, there are a number of
 nonprofit housing agencies that have expressed an interested in acquiring
 and preserving affordable rental housing developments in the City. This
 interest is often referred to as “right of first refusal” because owners of
 assisted rental housing are required to notify such agencies if the property
 will be sold an offer them the opportunity to make an offer. Table H-29
 lists these agencies.

     2.      At Risk Housing Programs
     In order to monitor and preserve existing low and moderate income
     housing that exists within the City, a program has been included in the
     “Housing Programs” section of this housing element. Program No. 43
     requires the formal establishment of a process to monitor all programs
     identified in the foregoing subsections, and to (1) provide for an early
     warning system for possible conversion of any non-market rate units, (2)
     gauging owner interest in potentially non-renewal, opting-out or
     prepaying, (3) offer incentives to owners to maintain the affordable
     programs, and/or (4) to require notice and other mechanisms for
     potentially displaced tenants to find and move to alternative low and
     moderate housing.
     Current Housing Needs
     Very low- and low-income households represent 51% of the total City
     households, but represent 79% of all households with housing problems.
     Table H-30 compares the housing problems in the City by income. Very
     low- and low-income households represent 86% of all households that
     overpay for housing, while most (63%) of these households rent their
     units. They also represent 72% of overcrowded households, although this
     is only 10% of the total households in the City. Likewise, most (57%) of
     these are rental households. Therefore, housing needs should focus on
     programs that assist very low and low-income households.

SCAG produces Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA)
projections for all cities in its region. SCAG's 1998-2005 RHNA
projections indicate that a total of 3,782 new units will need to be
constructed within the City to accommodate new households. Of the total
allocation, 1,148 units are allocated for very low-income households, 676
units are to be for low-income households, 734 units are to be for
moderate-income households, and 1,223 units are to be above moderate-
income households.
Land is available for development for a wide range of housing types, from
single-family estates to high-density apartments. Although infrastructure
and environmental constraints may exist on some of the parcels,
infrastructure is available to accommodate continued growth for at least
the next five years. Construction and development costs will continue to
increase, but programs are available through the City to offset some of
these costs, making home ownership a possibility for households who
would not normally be able to afford a home.
The City of San Bernardino filed an appeal of its RHNA on the basis that

     account the recession of the early 1990s. During the 1990s, the City
     experienced the closure of Norton Air Force Base and the loss of
     approximately 10,000 jobs, and the closure of the Burlington Northern
     Santa Fe Shops and the loss of additional jobs. Those concerns are
     summarized as follows:
     High Vacancy Rates. The RHNA was based on a 1990-vacancy rate of
     5.2% that did not reflect the recession. The City experienced a high
     vacancy rate of 17% in 1998, lowering to 11% as reflected in the 2000
     Census.
     Foreclosures. The City experienced an extremely high rate of foreclosures
     in the mid to late 1990s, with over 1,000 foreclosed units in 1995.
     Low Sales Prices. The high vacancy and foreclosure rates affected the
     resale market throughout the City. The Real Estate Research Council
     estimated that homes in the City of San Bernardino still are 15% lower
     than their 1990 value.
     Low Building Activity. From 1990 to 1993, the City issued about 600
     residential permits per year. From 1994 through 2000, the City issued less
     than 100 residential permits per year.
     Future Housing Needs
     State housing element law requires that each city analyze its existing and
     projected housing needs for all income levels. This analysis must include a
     locality's fair share of the regional need. The distribution of regional need
     is prepared by SCAG in its Regional Housing Needs Assessment
     (RHNA). The current RHNA was prepared in 1999 and is shown in Tables
     31 and 32.
     In addition, State housing element law requires that each city develop a
     five-year program of actions designed to meet its regional need. Therefore,
     in developing the City's regional need, the 7.5-year planning period 1998-
     1999 to 2004-2005 was used. The City's regional need is calculated by
     taking into consideration the City's growth over the five-year period and
     adjusting it for the current vacancy need and demolitions. It is projected
     that during this period, the City will need to accommodate 4,182 new
     dwelling units, of which 355 dwelling units will replace existing units in
     need of demolition. The projected annual construction need is 504 units.
     Finally, State law requires that the City's regional need be distributed on
     the basis of income in order to avoid concentrating lower income units in
     jurisdictions, which already have a high concentration. This calculation

Future Residential Growth Areas
The City has many vacant acres designated for residential development to
accommodate the City's fair-share of the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment as determined by SCAG. According to the Vacant Parcel Area
Summary developed by the City, there were 4,911 acres of vacant single-
family residential land, 918 acres of vacant multi-family residential land,
and 761 acres of commercial/residential land. Table H-33 contains a
summary of the vacant residentially designated lands and commercial
lands where residential units are permitted.
Although over 6,700 acres of vacant residential land is located within the
City corporate boundaries, not all of that land is completely developable or
developable to the full densities as indicated in Table H-33. For example,
approximately 3,400 acres of RE, RL and RL-3.5 zoned properties are
located in the northern foothill areas and are characterized by 15% or
greater slopes and/or high fire hazard. A parcel-by-parcel survey was
conducted of each vacant parcel throughout the City to determine the
amount of acreage that had high development potential. All parcels
subject to flood hazard (inundation during a 100-year storm), high fire
hazard, slopes exceeding 5%, lacking frontage on a paved public street,
utilities (water, sewer, electric) to the property line, or which were
City of San Bernardino                                                        3-45
     substandard (lacking minimum size or lot dimensions) were eliminated.
     Table H-33a shows the resultant acres with high development potential. A
     total of 1,645 vacant single-family zoned acres, 918 multi-family zoned
     acres, and 761 commercial residential zoned acres have been identified as
     having high development potential. Adjusting for setbacks, dedications
     and open space requirements, the net usable acres are: 1,233 acres of
     single-family, 688 acres of multi-family, and 570 acres of commercial
     residential. Without factoring in density bonuses, the potential number of
     resultant dwelling units that could be realized is 43,277. The realistic
     potential number of dwelling units that could reasonably be expected to be
     constructed, therefore, far exceeds the City’s RHNA allocation of 3,782.
     The City did not calculate the number of parcels or the amount of
     underutilized acreage or acreage available for redevelopment potential
     because of the abundance of vacant land available for immediate
     residential development. However, there are opportunities throughout the
     City and the goals, objectives, policies, and programs reflect the City’s
     commitment to redevelopment potential, as well as new development.
     Since the City allows the development of residential units in some of the
     commercial land use districts, and there is adequate land currently
     designated for residential development to meet the RHNA, the conversion
     of non-residential acreage is not an issue.

     Given the market demand, land costs and other economic factors it is
     unlikely that property zoned for multi-family residential would be
     developed as single-family residential. However, assuming that all of the
     multi-family zoned properties identified as having high development
     potential were developed at a single-family residential density, there
     would be a total of 4,134 units constructed. This assumes that the 918.5
     acres of multi-family zoned parcels identified in Table H-33a would be
     developed at the RS density of 4.5 dwelling units per acre. The number of
     units would still exceed the RHNA totals by 352 units, however, it would
     be difficult to impossible to expect that the very low and low allocations
     would be met without higher density housing.
     1.       Vacant Land Suitable for Lower Income Housing
     Of the total acres identified in Table H-33a, an analysis was conducted of
     the parcels that would be appropriate for development for lower income
     housing. All parcels were considered with respect to distance to public
     transit, shopping, employment centers, medical and other social-welfare
     services. An assumption was that qualifying parcels would need to be
     within a normal walking distance of 500 feet of all of the noted services.
     As a result, the vacant parcels that would qualify all are located within the
3-48                                                                   City of San Bernardino

central portion of the City, which is generally bordered by Mt. Vernon
Avenue on the west, Mill Street on the south, Waterman Avenue on the
west, and Highland Avenue on the north. Table H-33b summarizes the
total number of sites, acreage and potential number of dwelling units that
can be considered as having excellent potential for development for lower
income housing. In summary, there are 13,520 units located on 815 sites
that have high potential for lower income housing. That amount, which is
a conservative number and does not assume density bonus, is well above
the RHNA number of 1,824 units (1,148 very low and 676 low).

In addition to the foregoing analysis, it is recognized that even though
there is ample land available to meet the City’s RHNA allocations, it is
also recognized that several of the parcels identified in Table H-33b are
limited in size, particularly within the central portion of the City where
many of the vacant parcels are single lots ranging in size of between 5,000
and 7,000 square feet. In order to achieve an economy of scale, a critical
factor in developing higher density housing units in the lower affordability
categories, the vacant land survey was extended to an evaluation of sites
by size. Table H-33c shows the vacant sites by size category: under 0.5
acre, 0.5 to 1 acre, 1 to 5 acres, and those over 5 acres. Table H-33d
summarizes the available larger sites of over one-acre in size. Those sites
are currently zoned for residential use, are located within close proximity
to pubic transportation, shopping and other services, and generally offer
high potential for development for lower income housing. In summary,
there are 28 such sites totaling 150 acres, which have the potential of
being developed with a total of 2,762 dwelling units, without factoring in
density bonus.

                                                                             3. Housing
Emergency Shelters/Transitional Housing
In recognition of the seriousness of the homeless problem within San
Bernardino County in general and within the City in particular, the San
Bernardino County Homeless Coalition was established in 1991. The
Coalition consists of representatives of government agencies, churches
and organizations providing aid to the homeless, and private agencies and
individuals concerned with the needs of the homeless. A primary service
provided by the Coalition is to identify the magnitude of the homeless
problem through out the County, and to specify specific needs throughout
each geographic area. It is estimated by the Coalition that there are
approximately 1,000 homeless persons at any given time with the City of
San Bernardino.
In recognition of the severity of the homeless problem within the City, the
Consolidated Plan, prepared by the City Economic Development Agency
(EDA) has assigned as a “High Priority” programs to “Assist the
Homeless and Special Needs Persons with Supportive Services.” The
EDA does this through coordination with the County, and other agencies,
provision of staff and expertise assistance, provision of Redevelopment
Agency funds, allocation of federal funding, and assistance in the
preparation and processing of federal and state funding requests by social
service organizations. The stated goals of the Consolidated Plan include
the goal of meeting the need of 1,000 emergency shelter units (beds)
within the five-year timeframe of the Plan (years 2000 through 2005).
There are 24 organizations providing homeless services in San
Bernardino, including twelve that provide emergency shelter that, in 2000,
provided shelter for 512 persons. The Consolidated Annual Action Plan
for fiscal year 2002-03 identifies approximately $1.9 million in funds to be
allocated for emergency shelters, transitional housing and housing for
battered women. These funds are designed to provide up to 664 beds. In
addition, funding is also identified for homeless-related services, homeless
prevention and on-going shelter operations.
Specific programs used by the EDA to deal with the homeless problem in
the City include the following:
         •  Emergency Shelter Grant Program – federal and EDA funds
            allocated to organizations that provide emergency shelter to the
            homeless individuals and families;
         •  Use of Redevelopment Agency (RDA) funds – RDA funds
            have been used to purchase and rehabilitate a four-unit
            apartment complex for emergency shelter operated by the
City of San Bernardino                                                       3-51

                  Frazee Community Center (Frazee continues to operate the
                  facility with assistance from the EDA), and $200,000 grant
                  provided the Obershaw House to provide transitional housing
                  to families with children;
             •    Battered Women’s Shelters – The EDA provides funding for
                  the continued operation of House of Ruth, Option House and
                  New House;
             •    San Bernardino County Continuum of Care Coalition – the
                  City is an active participant in the Continuum and provides
                  staff resources and funds to the organization made up of
                  various public and private agencies concerned with
                  homelessness and that provides inter-agency coordination and
                  assistance to provide facilities throughout the County.
     The City Development Code permits homeless facilities in the RM, RMH,
     RH (multiple-family residential) and CR-2 (commercial) zones subject to
     approval of a Conditional Use Permit (CUP). As described in the
     foregoing section, the CUP in the City is relatively short in comparison to
     other cities and counties in the region, requiring approximately three to
     four months to process. In addition to the homeless facilities described
     above, the Development Code allows single-room occupancy (SRO)
     hotels in the CG and CR-2 zones with approval of a CUP. SRO’s play a
     vital role in providing transitional housing, particularly in meeting another
     City goal of assisting in the transition from emergency shelter to more
     permanent housing facilities.
     Currently, there are four agencies providing emergency shelter services:
     Salvation Army, Option House, Mary’s Mercy Center and Central
     Lutheran Mission. Four organizations provided services for homeless
     youth: Los Padrinos Youth Services, Home of Neighborly Services, the
     Children’s Fund and Homeless Children’s Fund. Two battered women’s
     shelters are existing: Option House and New House. The facilities are
     located within the central city area or within portions of the City that are in
     close proximity of other related service providers such as State, County,
     City offices and social service organizations providing counseling, health
     services, food and clothing.
     The City recently approved the Pathway to Prosperity, a facility for
     individuals to live and train for eventual return to non-emergency shelter
     or non-transitional housing and full-time employment. Even though
     located within a commercial zone, the project was processed
     administratively without the need for a CUP on the basis that the facility
     constituted a “live-work” use and was permitted as a matter of right within
     the permitted uses within a commercial zone.

                                                                           3. Housing
Special Needs Housing
The San Bernardino Consolidated Plan (FY 2000-05) identifies the
following special housing needs within the City:
        Elderly/Frail Elderly
        Persons with Mental Disabilities
        Persons with Physical/Developmental Disabilities
        Persons with Alcohol or Other Drug Addictions
        Persons with AIDS/HIV
        Large Families
The Consolidated Plan identifies as “high priority” the needs of the
foregoing group classifications, and over $8 million has been included
within the Plan to meet the housing and supportive service need of those
individuals. Specific programs include the provision of senior affordable
housing units, retrofit of existing units for handicapped persons, meals,
housing services, group homes and teaching facilities, and on-going
counseling and treatment. In addition, to those programs, the City
continues to encourage and work with developers, social organizations,
and non-profit groups to provide for the housing and service needs of
special groups. To accomplish this, the City’s Economic Development
Agency (EDA) provides financial support as well as coordination and
consultation services in the form of:
         •  Coordination with non-profit agencies (see Table H-39) to
            make them aware of any “at risk” housing that can be acquired
            through the right of first refusal;
         •  Providing subsidies to purchase vacant parcels for new
            construction;
         •  Providing subsidies for rehabilitation of existing units;
         •  Through the preparation, publication and dissemination of
            program brochures;
         •  Providing interdepartmental guidance through the pre-
            application review process;
         •  Provision of density bonuses for multiple-family housing;
         •  Coordination with lending institutions to provide low-interest
            loans for new construction and rehabilitation;
         •  Coordination with for-profit developers to provide information
            on exiting parcels available for purchase through the
City of San Bernardino                                                     3-53

                 Redevelopment Agency, and provision of assistance in
                 property acquisition and assembly of parcels;
              •  Coordination with lending institutions to provide low-interest
                 loans; and
              •  Continue to coordinate with non-profit and for-profit groups in
                 providing assistance in the process of City permits.
     A number of programs have been included in the “Housing Programs”
     section of this Housing Element that identify specific steps the City
     intends to undertake in providing housing opportunities for Special Need
     individuals, as well as recommended programs to further mitigate or
     eliminate governmental constraints in providing such housing and related
     services. Fifteen of the forty-two programs are specifically developed to
     address Special Needs housing.
     Non-Governmental Constraints on Housing
     Development
     1.       Land and Development Costs
     The ability to fulfill housing needs is greatly constrained by factors
     prevalent in the housing market. Non-governmental factors inhibiting the
     availability of housing include housing costs, land prices and construction
     costs, financing costs, existing neighborhood conditions, and consumer
     expectations.
     Discussions with local housing developers reveal that construction and
     new housing costs are relatively low because the City primarily has an
     entry level or first move-up market, and therefore, costly investments are
     not optimal because of the nature of the market. New housing costs range
     between $150,000 to $160,000 for an average sized home, but costs for
     new homes can range anywhere from $110,000 to $180,000. New home
     prices are therefore very low in comparison to the rest of the County and
     the Southern California Region. The primary problem with the stagnant
     housing market stems from an FHA lending cap of approximately
     $174,000 for loans in San Bernardino. This creates a restriction on the
     market because buyers, particularly first-time buyers are unable to get
     loans large enough for down payments on more expensive homes.
     Because loan levels are held low, housing prices are also held low enough
     to be marketable in the community. The County is experiencing influx
     from neighboring Los Angeles and Orange Counties, which has increased
     home prices in some western portions of the County. However, this
     growth has not yet reached the City to result in higher housing prices.
3-54                                                          City of San Bernardino

                                                                            3. Housing
Land prices and construction costs also impact affordable housing
development. According to local real estate and development
professionals, raw land for single-family homes averages around $30,000
per acre, without improvements. One single-family parcel, 30 acres in
size, was recently for sale for $33,000 (www.loopnet.com). Two
multifamily parcels, one just over three acres and the other just under one
acre were recently for sale for about $136,000 and $110,000 per acre. The
higher priced multifamily parcel was zoned for 18 units per acre and the
lower cost parcel R-2. By comparison, several industrial parcels recently
for sale had asking prices of ranging from $65,000 to $131,000 per acre,
and one retail commercial site with freeway access had an asking price of
$676,000 per acre.
Improvements such as utilities, water, and sewage services among others
is an additional $15,000 to $18,000 per lot (7,000 square feet to 15,000
square feet respectively). Development also results in local fees such as
school fees, fire district fees, and others, which cost $18,000 per housing
unit. Marketing is an additional $5,000 per unit. Soft costs, such as
architecture, engineering, and other professional services average $7,000
per unit. Other expenses, including administration and sales averages
$9,000 per unit. Materials and labor range from $40 to $50 per square
foot. Therefore, a 1,000 square foot unit would average around $45,000 in
construction costs. The minimum cost of a 1,000 square- foot site-built
single-family home on a 7,000 square foot lot would be about $105,000 in
land, construction, and related costs (pers. com., Dave Mlynarski,
MAPCO, 1999), excluding the homebuilder’s profit.
In addition, financing and interest rates further constrain the market. One
and a half- percent financing and interest rates of 9.75% are the average
current rates for the City. These rates are fairly low compared to previous
years, and even in the past ten years when average interest rates were
between 11% and 12%. Dropping rates are likely in response to market
stagnation, however if an influx of population from Los Angeles and
Orange Counties reaches the City and economic growth continues in the
region, rates may rise along with housing prices.
2.       Interest Costs
The cost of borrowing money can present a constraint to both the producer
and consumer of housing. Higher interest rates increase the cost of doing
business for land developers and homebuilders. Higher interest rates also
increase the consumer’s cost of borrowing money for home loans. Tables
34 and 35 show how changes in interest rates affect borrowing costs, and
impact the finished cost per unit, of housing.
City of San Bernardino                                                      3-55

      Table H-34 shows that each 1 percentage point increase in the interest rate
      increases borrowing costs by about 6% for a 15-year home loan – nearly
      20% if the increase is from seven to 10 percentage points. For a 30-year
      loan, each 1 percentage point increase increases the monthly payment nine
      to 10% – nearly 32% if the increase is from seven to 10 percentage points.
      Even small increases home loan interest rates can substantially affect
      monthly housing costs and reduce its affordability to low-and moderate-
      income households.
      Many consumers mitigate the impact of rising interest rates by purchasing
      adjustable rate mortgages that typically begin with substantially lower
      introductory rates. Adjustable rate mortgages allow a borrower’s interest
      cost, and monthly payment, to rise or fall with market rates. In a rising
      interest rate climate, adjustable rate mortgages can offer substantial short-
      term savings over a fixed-rate loan. In a declining or highly volatile
      interest rate climate, adjustable rate mortgages can lead to higher short-
      term costs.

      An increase in borrowing costs affects the cost of providing rental housing
      in two ways: 1) construction costs rise (most residential development if
      financed, at least in part, through construction loans); and 2) permanent
      borrowing costs increase.
      Table H-35 shows the impact of changes in loan rates on the monthly rent
      for a hypothetical apartment project that is privately financed and that
      receives state and/or federal funds. In the example, three per-unit project

costs are assumed: 1) a small apartment complex with minimal amenities
that costs $55,000 per unit to construct; 2) a medium quality apartment
complex with average amenities that costs $65,000 per unit to construct;
and 3) a luxury apartment complex that costs $75,000 per unit to
construct. In each case the properties include a mix of one- and two-
bedroom apartments. These examples assume that 75% of the project is
financed at a commercial lending rate for a term of 15 years.

A 3 percentage point increase in interest rates for permanent financing,
from 8% to 11%, will increase the per unit borrowing cost by nearly 19%
and the overall per unit cost (accounting for operation and maintenance
expenses) by about 10%.
3.       Vacancy Rate
Vacancy rates may be viewed as both an opportunity and constraint. High
vacancy rates can assist in keeping rents low as well as the median price
for re-sale housing. However, on the other hand, a high vacancy rate
severely discourages construction of new housing units, and can act as a
deterrent or disincentive to property owners to make improvements and
even repairs. According to the 2000 Census, the City has an abnormally
high vacancy rate of 11%. The closure of major businesses in recent
years, and particularly the closure of Norton Air Force Base in 1994, has
had a far-reaching negative impact on the economy of the City, and
directly contributed to the high vacancy within the community. Unlike
other military base closures in California and the nation, the Norton
closure was particularly major within San Bernardino due to the fact that,
unlike other military bases, Norton has very limited on-base housing and
relied heavily on privately-owned housing market supply within the City.
In turn, there was heavy reliance on the part of local landlords on Norton
to supply a steady supply of tenants. That fact is demonstrated by the
City of San Bernardino                                                     3-57
     historical vacancy rates within the City: prior to 1994, the vacancy rates
     traditionally ran at 5% or less. The 1990 Census showed a vacancy rate of
     5.2%; in 1995, following the base closure that rate took a dramatic jump to
     over 17%; and since 1995, the rate has been steady at 11%. Most
     statisticians and economists agree that a vacancy rate exceeding 4% to 5%
     is unhealthy with respect to a local economy, and results in depressing the
     housing market, particularly with respect to new construction.
     4.       Local Housing Market
     Local housing market conditions can represent both a constraint and an
     opportunity to meeting objectives for housing construction and
     conservation. As noted previously, San Bernardino has a high vacancy
     rate and a persistent glut of HUD-repossessed single-family dwellings. In
     addition, the City has a high rate of “absentee” ownership among single-
     family homes that are rentals. Consequently, San Bernardino’s large stock
     of affordable housing represents an opportunity to allow low-income
     families to become homeowners and to attract middle-income families to
     the City. Because many of these homes are in deteriorated condition or not
     available for sale, local housing market conditions also create
     impediments to achieving these objectives.
     Although the local housing market shows signs of improvement, it is still
     affected by the aftermath of the economic downturn of the early 1990s and
     the closure of Norton Air Force Base. These conditions have discouraged
     some of the new homebuilding that the City could have otherwise
     expected, have reduced opportunities for low-income families to become
     first-time homebuyers, and have discouraged many middle- and upper-
     income households from considering San Bernardino as a potential place
     to live.
     5.       At Risk Housing Programs
     In order to monitor and preserve existing low and moderate income
     housing that exists within the City, a program has been included in the
     “Housing Programs” section of this housing element. Program No. 43
     requires the formal establishment of a process to monitor all programs
     identified in the foregoing subsections, and to 1) provide for an early
     warning system for possible conversion of any non-market rate units; 2)
     gauging owner interest in potentially non-renewal, opting-out or
     prepaying; 3) offer incentives to owners to maintain the affordable
     programs; and/or 4) to require notice and other mechanisms for potentially
     displaced tenants to find and move to alternative low and moderate
     housing.
3-58                                                         City of San Bernardino

                                                                              3. Housing
Governmental Constraints on Housing
Development
Local governments affect the supply, distribution, and cost of housing
through their actions and policies. This section discusses those constraints
to housing development imposed by local government that could
potentially and significantly affect the availability and cost of new
housing.
1.       Land Use Controls
The General Plan of the City of San Bernardino was updated in 1989 and
it is not a constraint to the provision of vacant sites for housing. The Land
Use Element and Map permitted the construction of an estimated 25,190
new dwelling units on land within the City that is vacant and/or whose use
designation was changed to residential in 1989. The Plan was developed
based on the community's desired residential density, capacity of current
and projected infrastructure, and severe environmental constraints in some
areas of the City caused by earthquake, landslide, fire, and wind dangers.
If long-term demand for housing exceeds the maximum number of units
allowed by the plan, then the plan will become a constraint on housing.
Over the next five years, at least, however, the City’s General Plan
provides for ample vacant land at a range of densities to accommodate a
variety of housing types affordable to all income groups. However,
environmental and infrastructure difficulties constitute a pragmatic limit to
housing development in some areas of the City, as discussed below.
2.       Infrastructure
a.       Water/Wastewater
Generally, the policies and programs of the City’s General Plan provide
that the infrastructure supporting new housing development will be
expanded concurrent with development. The City Water Department
indicates that it has sufficient capacity to accommodate the demands
attributable to the Plan's housing build-out. It will be necessary to extend
water distribution lines, boosters, and water storage facilities for new
housing tracts on the periphery of existing development. Costs for such
improvements will be borne by the developers. However, the City is
unable to mandate that individual private water purveyors within the City
extend service. This could affect the timing and location of development.
Historically, the supply of potable water and the ability of individual
purveyors to expand their supply capacities to meet demand from
population growth have not been a limiting factor to development. The
City of San Bernardino                                                        3-59

     Municipal Water Department has initiated a program to expand its
     wastewater treatment capacity. Present design capacity is 28 mgd of
     primary and secondary treatment, and three mgd of tertiary treatment. The
     expansion will add 30 mgd of primary treatment capacity, 15 mgd of
     secondary treatment capacity, up to 10.5 mgd of tertiary treatment
     capacity, and 15 mgd of solids handling facilities. The treatment plant
     capacity will be expanded in either 7.5 mgd or 15 mgd modules depending
     on growth within the service area. Additionally, the Water Department
     has entered into a regional project agreement to provide tertiary treatment
     for all existing capacity.
     Disposal of the additional sewage resulting from General Plan residential
     build-out will require the construction of new and/or upgraded wastewater
     collection facilities within the City pursuant to the City's Sewer System
     Master Plan.
     With respect to the vacant residentially zoned properties identified in
     Table H-33a (2,493 acres), water and sewer facilities exist to the
     properties so identified, and there are adequate supplies/capacities to
     accommodate full potential development of those properties. For the
     period covered by the Housing Element (2000-2005), the availability of
     water and wastewater services and capacity are not anticipated to constrain
     the City’s ability to accommodate new residential development, and there
     is more than adequate supplies/capacities available to meet the City
     RHNA allocation.
     b.       Flood Control
     New residential development in the foothill areas may be subject to flood
     hazards due to slope and canyon runoff. Additional storm drain and flood
     control facilities (e.g., per San Bernardino County Flood Control District's
     Comprehensive Storm Drain Plan) will be needed to convey the increased
     surface runoff, to protect residential properties not currently protected
     from 100-year storm flows and surrounding properties. Such will be the
     individual or joint responsibilities of subdivision developers.
     Because of steep slopes and other environmental constraints in the
     northern portion of the City, the allowed residential density is relatively
     low and cannot accommodate a large number of new dwelling units. A
     lack of adequate flood control in this area will not significantly constrain
     the City’s ability to accommodate its RHNA allocation. As noted in Table
     H-33a, and as discussed in the foregoing section “Future Residential
     Growth Areas”, an abundance of vacant residentially-zoned lands exist
     within the more central portions of the City that are not subject to
     development constraints such as flooding and high fire hazard.
3-60                                                          City of San Bernardino

                                                                                3. Housing
c.       Private Utilities
All potential residential parcels have easy access to electricity, natural gas,
telecommunication, and cable television services. The properties
identified in Tables 33a and 33b have been included on the basis of their
ability to be developed in the near future. Among the criteria used to
identify those parcels as having “high development potential” was the fact
that utilities, including water, sewer and electric exist to the property
boundaries.
d.       Transportation
Areas designated for residential development are served by or can be
readily linked with streets and highways. Residential subdivisions will be
required to dedicate and develop streets and highways in accordance with
the Circulation Element of the General Plan.
3.       Building Codes and Enforcement
San Bernardino’s building codes are based upon the State Uniform
Building, Plumbing, Mechanical, and Electrical Codes and are considered
to be necessary to protect the public's health, safety and welfare. These
codes cannot be regarded as a constraint to housing development.
The City's code enforcement process does not unduly penalize older
residential structures based on their age. Property owners are notified and
given the opportunity to bring their structures up to code prior to any
approved demolitions. Property owners who desire to repair or improve
their properties need only comply with the current building code
requirements for those portions of a dwelling unit affected by the repair or
improvement unless health and safety violations are noted elsewhere in the
unit. Structures are not demolished unless they threaten the public's health,
safety and welfare.
4.       Impact Fees, Improvements, and Dedications
Various impact fees and assessments are charged by the City to cover the
costs of processing permits and providing services and facilities, such as
utilities, and infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a
pro-rata share system, based on the magnitude of the project's impact or on
the extent of the benefit that will be derived from the services or facilities
for which the fees are charged. The City of San Bernardino’s fees are not
high relative to other cities in the region.
City of San Bernardino                                                          3-61

     In addition to on-site improvements which may be required as part of a
     project's development, off-site improvements may also be imposed to
     ensure a development pays its share of the local cost of expansions in
     services, facilities, and infrastructure. Such improvements may include
     water, sewer and other utility line extensions, street construction and
     related projects. Dedications of land or in-lieu fees may also be required
     of a project for right-of-way, transit facilities, recreational facilities and
     school sites, consistent with the City's Subdivision Ordinance.
     Fees have been set at a level necessary to cover the costs to the City to
     make appropriate contributions to the community (e.g., traffic mitigation
     and storm drain improvements). However, these fees contribute to the cost
     of housing, and may constrain the development of lower-priced units. A
     sample scenario of the fees required to build two different types of
     housing is shown on Table H-36.

     The estimated fees assume a 1,200 square-foot, three-bedroom, single-

                                                                            3. Housing
1,000 square-foot, three-bedroom apartment in a 50-unit development on
4.2 acres (RM District, 12 du/ac). The estimated per-unit fees represent
about 6% of the average cost of a new single-family dwelling and about
5% of the average monthly rent for new three-bedroom apartment.
5.       Permit Processing
Residential construction involving four or fewer single-family homes,
mobile homes and multi-family units are approved at the staff level.
Projects are evaluated relative to the zoning code and building code
standards and receive approvals within two weeks of application. All
planning, plan check, building, public works, and fire plan check functions
operate at the same one-stop counter in City Hall.
Residential construction involving subdivisions and larger single and
multi-family projects require review by the staff Development Review
Committee (for projects of 5 to 11 units) and the Planning Commission
(for projects of 15 units or more). A typical subdivision or apartment
project or 15 units or more would take approximately 18 weeks from
initial application to approval, assuming there were not major
environmental or development issues.
The City has a fast track process for commercial and industrial
applications. However, all developers may take advantage of the City's no
fee pre-application review process. The City encourages potential
applicants to attend a pre-application review meeting, before formal
application submittal. There is also a procedure for an applicant for a
building permit to pay extra to fast track the checking of building plans.
In the early 1990’s, the City undertook a major revision to its Zoning Code
and land use regulations with the stated intent to simplify and streamline
the land development process within the City. The results were a
completely new Development Code that includes all development-related
regulations and standards in a single document. Included in the new Code
are the City’s zoning regulations, subdivision regulations and design
standards. The Development Code is clearly and simply written, and
includes a number of changes to expedite the development review process
within the City. The Development Review process was developed as a
tool to expedite the review and approval process in that it provides a
mechanism for the City to assist developers by providing review and
access to various City departments. The Development Review process
itself does not add time to a project’s approval, and actually shortens the
process by providing a one-stop service to project proponents. All City
staff persons associated with project approval are assembled to review
project plans and to advise the applicant on needed or recommended
City of San Bernardino                                                      3-63

     revisions prior to the matter being approved administratively or heard by
     the Planning Commission. Typically, the time to process a project
     through Development Review from the time an application is deemed
     complete is approximately three to four weeks. However, it is estimated
     that the process saves considerable time overall in that issues are resolved
     at an early stage, in turn saving the necessary time to revise plans prior to
     final approval, and, in the case of larger projects subject to Planning
     Commission review, results in immediate Planning Commission action
     rather than continuances for the purpose of plan revision or in order to
     provide additional information.
     In addition to the foregoing, the Development Code provides for density
     bonuses for affordable housing in accordance with State Government
     Code Section 65915, and for providing certain on-site amenities in multi-
     family zones and commercial-residential zones, such as attached garages,
     additional landscaping and recreational facilities, and day care centers.
     Within San Bernardino, multiple-family residential projects are permitted
     as a matter of right in the RU, RM, RMH and RH zone districts subject to
     a Development Permit and do not require approval of a Conditional Use
     Permit. Multiple-family residential is also permitted in two commercial
     zones, also subject to approval of a Development Permit: CG-2 and CR-2.
     In addition, the CO-1, CO-2, CG-2 and CR-2 zones permit senior citizen
     housing and senior congregate care facilities subject to approval of a
     Conditional Use Permit. The time frame for processing a Conditional Use
     Permit is approximately three to four months, considerably less than the
     maximum allowed under the Permit Streamlining Act. These time frames
     are considered relatively short when compared with other jurisdictions in
     the region, and are not considered an impediment to providing affordable
     housing or contributing to increased cost of housing within the City.
     6.      Zoning and Development Standards
     The City has established standards in the Development Code for all
     residential projects. The lot size, unit density, height, lot coverage, set
     backs, open spaces, design review and parking standards were established
     to ensure quality of life for all of the City's residents. The City periodically
     evaluates these standards to see if they are appropriate in light of changes
     in construction techniques and development preferences.
     The Development Code includes development standards for traditional
     single family subdivisions, planned residential developments, and multi-
     family residences of various densities. A variety of other housing types,
     including detached and attached units, duplexes, mobile home parks, and
3-64                                                            City of San Bernardino
                                                                            3. Housing
small lot subdivisions, are provided for in the Residential Urban District,
where the intent is to consolidate lots to achieve maximum open space.
The Development Code also has provisions for senior and congregate care
facilities, granny and second units, manufactured housing, and various
community care facilities. Multi-family housing is also allowed in several
commercial districts.
A density bonus provision is also included in the Code, allowing increased
density for multi-family low-income units.
Table H-37 shows the Development Code minimum dwelling unit sizes
and Table H-38 shows the residential development standards. These
standards are not considered constraints to providing lower-cost housing,
as the minimum unit sizes are generally less than the square footage that
homebuilders voluntarily provide in the region.

                                                                            3. Housing
7.       Governmental Constraints - State
The major State restriction to publicly assisted multifamily rental housing
is Article 34 of the California Constitution. Article 34 can constrain some
affordable housing options by requiring local voter referendum approval
of all development, construction, or acquisition of public housing when:
(a) units are publicly owned; and (b) units are privately-owned by public
financing, and more than 49% of the units are reserved for low-income
occupancy.
The potential for this state constitutional requirement to constrain
affordable multifamily rental housing development in the City is minimal
because virtually all such housing is developed by private non-profit
organizations for which the requirements of Article 34 do not apply.
8.       Persons with Disabilities
Government Code Section 65008 was amended in 2001 to require that
Housing Elements, beginning January 1, 2002, to require the following:
1.       As part of a governmental constraints analysis, a Housing Element
         must analyze potential and actual constraints on the development,
         maintenance and improvement of housing for persons with
         disabilities and demonstrate local efforts to remove governmental
         constraints that hinder the locality from meeting the need for
         housing for such persons; and
2.       As part of the required constraints program, the Housing Element
         must include programs that remove constraints or provide
         reasonable accommodations for hosing designed for persons with
         disabilities.
As noted in the “Community Profile” section of this Element, the City has
a significantly high number of persons with disabilities – 19.8% of the
total City population according to the 2000 Census. In order to address
the matter, the City has, and will continue, to require new construction to
include the requirements of Title 24 for handicapped access. Public
projects require handicapped access facilities and improvements. The City
Economic Development Agency provides funds for existing projects for
disabled retrofit. Finally, a program has been included in the “Housing
Programs” portion of Section V of this Hosing Element stating that the
City will undertake to evaluate the potential of adopting a “Reasonable
Accommodation” ordinance that will provide a process for persons with
City of San Bernardino                                                      3-67

     disabilities to make requests for relief from the various land use, zoning,
     or building laws, rules, policies, and procedures of the City.
     9.      Environmental Constraints
     The San Andreas Earthquake Fault Zone traverses the City in a northwest
     to southeast fashion, following the foothills along the northern edge of the
     City. The San Jacinto and Loma Linda Earthquake Fault Zones further
     traverse the City, also in a northwest to southeast fashion, through the
     lower middle and southern portions of the City. Several watercourses go
     through the City, including the Santa Ana River, Cajon Creek, Lytle
     Creek, and numerous canyon drainage courses. The City also has
     significant biological habitats along the foothills and rivers. The
     environmental constraints will affect the development of housing units to
     the extent that developers proposed projects in constrained areas.
     However, the City estimates that less than 7% of the total vacant
     residential land area is affected by environmental constraints.
     10.     State and Federal Regulations Governing Subsidized
              Multifamily Rental Housing
     Although a number of state and federal program provide low-cost loans
     and grants for the construction of low-income multifamily rental housing,
     builders of such housing must comply with a myriad of regulations
     governing everything from bidding procedures labor standards. One
     provision of state and federal law that has the most impact on housing
     construction cost is the requirement to pay “prevailing wages,” which are
     typically based on union wage levels that are substantially higher than the
     average wages paid to construction workers. Prevailing wage
     requirements, in combination with other state and federal regulations, can
     increase the construction cost by 25% to 30% above that for a similar,
     privately funded project. This increased cost can more than offset the
     savings from low-interest government loans, requiring developers of low-
     income rental housing to supplement their financing with grants and other
     subsidies to make a project financially feasible.
     Opportunities for Energy Conservation
     There are many opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing
     homes. Construction of energy efficient buildings does not lower the price
     of housing. However, housing with energy conservation features should
     result in reduced monthly occupancy costs as consumption of fuel and
     energy is decreased. Similarly, retrofitting existing structures with energy
     conserving features can result in a reduction in utility costs. Examples of
3-68                                                          City of San Bernardino

                                                                                3. Housing
energy conservation opportunities include weatherization programs and
home energy audits; installation of insulation; installation or retrofitting of
more efficient appliances, and mechanical or solar energy systems; and
building design and orientation which incorporates energy conservation
considerations. The City enforces all provisions of Title 24 of the
California Administrative Code, which provides for energy conservation
features in new residential construction. Likewise, the City's General Plan
encourages energy conservation subdivision design methods in accordance
with California Government Code Title 7 Section 66473.1 to conserve
heating and cooling energy.
1.       State Building Code Standards
The California Energy Commission was created in 1974 by the Warren-
Alquist State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Act
(Public Resources Code 25000 et seq.). Among the requirements of the
new law was a directive for the Commission to adopt energy conservation
standards for new construction. The first residential energy conservation
standards were developed in the late 1970s (Title 24, Part 6 of the
California Code of Regulations) and have been periodically revised and
refined since that time.
A feature of the state’s energy conservation standards is the definition of
“climate zones” that allow different approaches to energy conservation in
different parts of the state. The City of San Bernardino is located in
Climate Zone 10, which covers the semi-arid inland valleys just east of the
coastal mountains from the San Bernardino County line to the Mexican
border. This climate zone is characterized by a mild winters, hot summers,
desert winds, and abundant sunshine.
Because of these climate conditions, a substantial percentage of residential
energy use goes to space cooling between the months of May and October.
Residential site design and construction techniques that reduce the amount
of energy used for space cooling would significantly reduce overall energy
demand.
The city’s abundant sunshine provides an opportunity to use solar energy
techniques to generate electricity, heat water, and provide space heating
during colder months, as well. Natural space heating can be substantially
increased through the proper location of windows and thermal mass.

EVALUATION OF PROGRAMS UNDER
THE 1989 HOUSING ELEMENT
The following chart lists the programs that have been implemented since
adoption of the 1989 Housing Element. The chart includes the
department/agency with primary responsibility for implementing the
program, the funding source, the goal of each program, implementation
status, and targeted income group(s).
In implementing the 1989 General Plan Housing Element, the City’s
mission has been to “Actively maintain, improve and develop quality
neighborhoods and housing opportunities throughout the City of San
Bernardino.” Most of the implementing actions have focused on the
existing housing stock, therefore. At the time the Housing Element was
adopted in 1989, the City believed that it would need to give higher
priority to the construction of additional housing for low-income residents.
By the mid-1990s, the City decided it needed to re-focus its efforts and
concentrate on improvement of the existing housing stock. The severe
recession of the early 1990s caused a loss of many high-paying jobs that
were not replaced. Many formerly moderate and middle-income residents
became low-income or left the City. As a result, San Bernardino
experienced chronically high residential vacancy rates. In addition, the
condition of many single-family homes in existing neighborhoods did not
improve as quickly as the City had originally anticipated, partly due to a
lack of private investment to match public efforts.
The City believed that the construction of new low-income dwelling units
was unnecessary when there were significant opportunities to create
affordable housing units through rehabilitation of the existing housing
stock. For example, the Neighborhood Housing and Rental Rehabilitation
Programs have assisted a number of single- and multi-family units in the
City. However, the number of units assisted is far below the number of
units in need of repair. Since the need for this program continues to grow,
the City determined that the program should continue with adequate
funding to serve more units and with adequate advertising so that residents
know the program is available.
Table H-39 outlines the Programs and Actions identified in the City's 1989
Housing Element and their success.

HOUSING GOALS, POLICIES, AND
OBJECTIVES
Priorities
The primary housing problems and needs in the City of San Bernardino
are:
1.       Large proportion of low-income and particularly, very low-
         income, households. Over half of the City’s population have
         incomes less than 80% of the San Bernardino County median
         income, and over one-third have incomes less than 50% of the
         median. The percentage of persons with incomes below the
         poverty level is nearly double the countywide rate. Poverty is
         especially widespread among single mothers. Single mothers head
         30% of all households with children. As a result, a substantial
         percentage of households pay more than 30% of their income for
         housing (see #3 below), even with the City’s relatively low
         housing costs.
2.       Relatively low home ownership rates, particularly among the
         City’s minority population, due to the large percentage of low-
         income households and the low number of single-family homes
         that are not available for sale. Disparities in homeownership
         appear to relate primarily to income levels. More low-income
         households could become homeowners if there were lower-cost
         homes available for purchase in the City. A large percentage of
         single-family homes are not available for sale because they are
         rentals offered by absentee property owners.
3.       Extremely high percentage of very low-income renters, who pay in
         excess of 30% of their income for housing, creating a need for
         affordable housing that far exceeds the supply. Although housing
         prices are relatively low in San Bernardino, incomes are also much
         lower, resulting in a severe affordability problem for the City’s
         lowest-income residents. The San Bernardino County Housing
         Authority’s waiting list for housing assistance includes nearly
         2,200 (mostly very low-income) city residents, nearly as many as
         are currently being assisted by the Housing Authority. Among
         those earning 50% to 80% of the countywide median income, a
         much lower but still substantial percentage of households
         (particularly homeowners) pay more than 30% of their incomes for
City of San Bernardino                                                      3-75

            housing. Overpayment does not appear to be a widespread
            problem for households earning more than 80% of the countywide
            median income.
     4.     Increasing needs of elderly adults for housing that addresses their
            special needs. The population of single elderly women in
            particular is increasing faster than the overall elderly population.
            As the population ages, there will be a growing demand for senior
            housing that meets the special physical and financial needs of this
            group.
     5.     Overcrowding has increased among large families and renters.
            Nearly one in five households in the City has five or more
            members. About the same percentage of rental units are
            overcrowded. Overcrowding is a predictable result when housing
            costs rise faster than incomes, especially among the lowest-income
            segment of the population.
     6.     Over 40% of the City’s housing stock is more than 40 years old.
            Nearly one in five homes was constructed during just one decade –
            the 1950s. Most of the housing units on nearly one-third of the
            blocks examined in a recent housing condition survey need minor
            to moderate rehabilitation. Most of the housing units on another
            30% of the blocks surveyed need maintenance work (repainting
            and roof repairs being the common needs). Housing condition
            problems are concentrated in the area west of Waterman Avenue
            between Highway 30 and Rialto Road. Neighborhoods with the
            highest percentage of rented single-family homes appear to have
            the highest percentage of homes in need of maintenance and
            repairs.
     7.     The City has the largest homeless population in the metropolitan
            area, between 1,000 and 2,000 persons. Particularly vulnerable
            homeless sub-groups include individuals with mental illnesses,
            substance abusers, woman (and their children) escaping domestic
            violence, homeless youth, and persons with HIV/AIDS.
     8.     The City has a very high vacancy rate, averaging over 11% per
            year over recent years. The high vacancy rate has made it difficult
            to impossible to attract new housing construction and has
            contributed to the depressed multi-family housing construction
            within the City.
     The goals, policies, and programs presented in this section reflect the
     highest priority needs of the City of San Bernardino as determined from
3-76                                                          City of San Bernardino

                                                                            3. Housing

Policies:
3.1.1           Accommodate the production of new housing units on
                currently vacant or underutilized land at densities and
                standards designated in the Land Use Element of the
                General Plan.

                income housing projects, consistent with state law.
3.1.3           Encourage the development of senior housing in all areas
                of the City, especially the downtown, where the permissible
                density may be increased by 96 units per acre (178%) to a
                maximum of 150 units per acre.
City of San Bernardino                                                      3-77

     3.1.4      Accommodate residential development in areas of the
                Central City designated for mixed commercial and
                residential use in accordance with policies in the Land Use
                Element.
     3.1.5      Avoid concentrations of housing for any single income
                group.
     3.1.6      Continue to simplify the development review process for
                the development of housing units.
     3.1.7      Lobby and support the School District in reducing the
                school fees levied on new dwelling units selling for under
                $100,000 to very low and low income households.
     Housing and Neighborhood Preservation
     Goal 3.2   Conserve and improve the condition of the existing
                affordable housing stock and revitalize neighborhoods
                containing a substantial percentage of deteriorated
                dwelling units.
     Objective: Prevent the physical deterioration of the housing stock and
                older residential neighborhoods, and to rehabilitate
                dwelling units and neighborhoods that show signs of
                deterioration.
     Policies:
     3.2.1      Assist in the maintenance and rehabilitation of rental units
                whose owners provide affordable housing to lower income
                tenants in exchange for long-term affordability agreements.
     3.2.2      Assist low-income homeowners to correct building code
                violations and meet the habitability standards of the City
                Building and Safety Code.
     3.2.3      Continue to rehabilitate and reuse abandoned houses by
                making them available to low- and moderate-income
                households.
     3.2.4      Incorporate neighborhood improvement strategies to
                complement housing rehabilitation in addressing general
3-78                                                    City of San Bernardino
                                                                              3. Housing
                property conditions, public facilities, and city services for
                healthy neighborhoods.
3.2.5           Dedicate resources to eradicate and prevent blighting
                conditions and maintain standards to safeguard and
                preserve the City’s neighborhoods, and continue to
                financially support the City’s code compliance programs.
Affordable Housing
Goal 3.3        Assist in the development of adequate housing to
                meet the needs of low and moderate-income
                households.
Objective:      Develop new programs, and continue existing programs,
                that have proved their effectiveness to assist the
                construction, creation, and preservation of units affordable
                to very low, low-, and moderate-income households.
Policies:
3.3.1           In compliance with state law (Government Code Section
                65915), provide density bonuses and/or regulatory and
                financial incentives to developers who propose to include a
                specified percentage of very low-income, low-income,
                and/or senior housing in new development projects or as
                part of the conversion of rental apartments to
                condominiums.
3.3.2           Encourage the development of affordable units by non-
                profit organizations through financial and technical support
                to nonprofit housing developers, and through assistance in
                accessing local, State and Federal funding and incentives.
3.3.3           Investigate the feasibility of reducing fees and modifying
                development standards for affordable infill housing projects
                when necessary to make such projects financially feasible.
Objective:      Use available private, local, state, and federal housing
                funds to the fullest extent possible in conjunction with
                other public and private agencies to meet the housing
                assistance needs of lower income households.

     Policies:
     3.3.4      Assist the San Bernardino County Housing Authority to
                increase the availability of rental assistance to eligible
                tenant households in the City by identifying priority needs,
                referring residents to Housing Authority programs,

                 procedures of the City that may be necessary to ensure
                 equal access to housing.
Quantified Objectives

community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to the
maintenance, preservation, improvement, and development of housing.”
The City’s quantified objectives are contained in Appendix 1 and
generally address:
        The number of new housing units that can be accommodated on
         vacant land and redevelopment;
        The number of dwelling units to be rehabilitated;
        The number of new affordable dwelling units for which funding
         assistance will be provided; and
        The number of assisted multifamily rental housing units to be
         preserved as affordable units between 2000 and 2010.

Chapter 4. Economic
Development
INTRODUCTION
The City of San Bernardino has undergone tough economic times over the
last decade. With the closure of Norton Air Force Base in 1994, the
relocation of the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) and
Kaiser Steel, and the economic downturn of the 1990’s, we have lost
thousands of jobs and our economy has experienced the residual effects of
these shifts in employment and the economy. However, the City is
actively implementing programs and pursuing projects to position itself
for an economic renaissance. In fact, we are making progress and
attracting major industries to locate in our City.
We recognize the vital impact that our economic livelihood has on the
quality of life in our community and as such, we want to ensure that the
proper goals and policies are in place to provide the appropriate direction
and guidance to achieve our ideal economic condition. Although an
Economic Development Element is not required by State Law, it is
included in this General Plan because of its important role in the future of
the City.
Purpose
The purpose of the Economic Development Element is to guide the City in
expanding the local economy, which provides jobs, attracts and retains
businesses, supports diverse and vibrant commercial areas, and brings in
sufficient revenue to support local programs and services. To achieve a
balanced and healthy economy, the Economic Development Element sets
forth the goals and policies necessary to ensure a prosperous economic
future and maintain the quality of life within the community.
City of San Bernardino                                                                     4-1

    Relationship to Other Elements
    The Economic Development Element is related to the Land Use,
    Circulation, Public Facilities, and Housing Elements. A healthy economy
    not only provides the tax base for local services and infrastructure, but
    also affects the demand for a variety of land uses. A proper balance of
    land uses helps the local economy by providing the business community
    with a diverse workforce; housing, recreational, cultural, and retail
    opportunities for employers and employees; and supporting infrastructure
    facilities and services that foster economic growth. The Economic
    Development Element is also related to the Community Design Element
    because community identity can enhance the economic vitality and
    marketability of the City.
    ACHIEVING THE VISION
    Economic development is a dynamic process that increases the wealth of
    the community and allows it to provide a high quality of life for its
    residents, businesses, and organizations. The primary purpose of the
    economic development process should be to identify target economic
    opportunities that are both realistic and compatible with the City’s long-
    term vision and goals. The Economic Development Element is responsive
    to our Vision because it represents our desires to:
            Build upon location and transportation advantages;
            Partner and collaborate with local institutions;
            Capture a share of growing markets;
            Expand our industrial market and office development
             opportunities;
            Revitalize underutilized retail development;
            Revitalize and reinvigorate investment and establishment of
             businesses Downtown; and
            Enhance the City’s image and role as a gateway to the mountains
             and desert.

ABOUT OUR ECONOMY
Key Economic Issues
A combination of factors including the national recession of the early
1990s, the closure of the Norton Air Force Base, and increasing regional
competitive forces in the commercial/industrial sectors have continued to
challenge the City of San Bernardino. The present economic downturn,
acknowledged to have begun in early 2001, is also an evolving challenge.
Among the above, the closure of Norton Air Force Base had the most
adverse effect on the City's economy. San Bernardino instantly lost the
multiple levels of economic activity generated by Norton Air Force Base
during the last 50+ years of its presence.
Owing in significant part to loss of a number of major employers, San
Bernardino has been an economically distressed community for the better
part of two decades. Deprived of these longstanding employers and many
of the ancillary businesses they supported, the community has suffered a
variety of economic and social problems. These include chronic
unemployment and the associated need for public assistance,
disinvestments in housing stock, and consequent blight and poor health
conditions among many poorer residents.
                                                                              Household Size

    Socio-Economic Conditions
    The City of San Bernardino faces many challenges. Over the past decade,
    our population, households, earning power, median household income,
    and housing units have not kept pace with the region. These shortcomings
    will need to be evaluated and strategies will need to be developed to
    ensure that the City is keeping up with the region’s economic position.
    While the population of the City has experienced steady growth over the
    last decade, it has not kept pace with the County’s growth. The City
    comprised 10.8 percent of the County’s population in 2000, a slight
    decrease compared to 11.6 percent in 1990.
    The City’s population has a larger proportion of households that earn
    lower levels of income than the County average. In 1999 dollars, about 40
    percent of the City’s households earned less than $25,000 compared to
    about 29 percent for the County. About 25 percent of the City’s
    households earned $50,000 or more compared to approximately 37 percent
    for the County.
    The City’s estimated median household income in 1999 was about
    $32,600, which was lower than the county median of approximately
    $40,900. San Bernardino’s average household income was also lower
    ($39,200) than the County ($49,200).
    While the City’s housing stock has remained about the same from 1990 to
    2000, the number of dwelling units in the City has increased by about 9
    percent from 58,969 to 64,376 units. In comparison, the total number of
    housing units in San Bernardino County increased by about 12.5 percent.
    Housing stock consisted primarily of single-family units (60.6 percent),
    while multi-family units comprised about 32.2 percent of the City’s
    housing units. Mobile homes made up approximately 7.2 percent of the
    City’s housing stock.
    Trends in median home prices have been moving upward for the City
    during this time period. The City of San Bernardino provided more
    affordable housing with the median at about $86,000 in comparison to the
    County at about $109,000.
    Employment and Salaries
    The City of San Bernardino has many opportunities for long-term
    employment growth and stability in the City. Highlights of trends that
    have important implications for the City include:

        While total employment for the Riverside–San Bernardino PMSA
         (Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area) grew at an average annual
         rate of 3.3 percent from 1990 to 2000, total employment in the City
         grew relatively less rapidly at an annual average rate of 2.1
         percent;
        The Services sector was the fastest growing non-farm sector in the
         PMSA from 1990 to 2000, averaging 4.5 percent employment
         growth over this time period. This sector also showed the most
         growth, increasing by about 34 percent over the 10-year period;
        The region’s continued expansion of rail, trucking, and air
         transportation facilities resulted in increased employment in
         Transportation and Wholesale Trade related jobs, each sector
         growing at average annual rate of 4.0 percent from 1990 to 2000.
        1999 estimates indicate that the City of San Bernardino had a total
         of approximately 74,100 jobs, or about 13.9 percent of the total
         countywide jobs.
        The major shares of San Bernardino County’s governmental
         resources are concentrated in the City of San Bernardino (29.3
         percent of the total County government employment in 1999). This
         large cluster provides sustained demand for business, retail, and
         professional services.
        In 1999, the City’s employment was comprised primarily of jobs in
         the Services (42.4 percent), Retail (23.1 percent) and Public
         Administration (10.1 percent) sectors. Over half (58 percent) of
         the Services employment was in the Health and Educational
         Services sectors.
        Although Services is a key sector for the City, the Manufacturing,
         Wholesale Trade, and Transportation sectors represent target areas
         for expansion. These sectors represented only 5.4 percent, 4.4
         percent, and 3.5 percent, respectively, of the City’s total
         employment in 1999.
The City’s payroll increased from about $1.6 billion in 1991 to about $2.0
billion in 1998, or about $336.0 million in nominal dollars. When the
City’s payroll is adjusted for inflation, the purchasing power of payroll in
the City has increased by about $97.6 million in constant 2000 dollars or
5.0 percent from 1991 to 1998. Government had the biggest payroll,
followed by Retail and Educational Institutions. In constant 2000 dollars
the payroll for Governmental Agencies was the largest of all sectors in
City of San Bernardino                                                                     4-5

    1998, or a total of about $636.8 million. This was followed by the Retail
    sector at about $240.7 million. Manufacturing had a total payroll of about
    $89.4 million. In constant 2000 dollars, the average annual salary per
    worker has increased only slightly, from $28,590 in 1991 to $30,218 in
    1998.
    The highest average annual salary was in the Utilities sector at an average
    $49,323 annually, followed by the Government sector at $41,196. Other
    Services and Business Services have lower average salaries, with Retail
    salaries the lowest, at an average $18,471 annually. Another economic
    consideration is the relative salaries generated by the different industries.
    Although the Retail sector had the second highest payroll during 1998,
    retail salaries are among the lowest salaries of all sectors. Selected
    categories within the Services sector, such as Education, Health and
    Engineering, and Management, can have higher average salaries than the
    Service sector as a whole suggesting that if the right mix of basic
    industries can be expanded or attracted to the City, there is the potential to
    increase average incomes in the local area.
    Market Trends
    The Inland Empire as a whole has undergone a tremendous transformation
    over the last 15 to 20 years and has become a major industrial center for
    Southern California. With most of the I-10 freeway corridor now
    becoming a mature market, commercial, and industrial developments are
    seeking locations farther east. San Bernardino is in a good position to take
    advantage of these market conditions with the City’s access to the I-10, I-
    215 and I-15 freeways. Also, the extension of the Foothill Freeway from
    San Bernardino to La Verne will be completed within five years,
    providing significant east-west connections. This section addresses the
    trends in the retail, office, and industrial markets and their implications for
    San Bernardino.
    1.       Retail Trends
    Although the City continues to attract retail dollars from neighboring
    communities, its position as a retail center has been declining. The loss of
    a large share of the City’s employment base and corresponding disposable
    income due to the Norton Air Force base closure was a significant
    contributor to this decline. Increasing retail competition from newer
    regional centers, such as Ontario Mills, is also contributing to the erosion
    of San Bernardino’s regional retail market base.

Inventory
As of mid-year 2000, the City had a total inventory of about 4.1 million
square feet of leasable retail space. About 43 percent of this total
inventory was comprised of community serving centers and neighborhood
centers. The 29-year old Carousel Mall has over 1.0 million square feet
and is the largest regional center in the City, followed by the 35-year old
Inland Center at about 1.0 million square feet. Carousel Mall has lease
rates ranging from $18 to $40 per square foot per year, while smaller
centers have lease rates in the range of $16 to $25 per square foot per year.
Most of the City’s centers were built from 1956 to 1989 and are in need of
revitalization. Many of the City’s strip centers are underutilized and many
are in need of aesthetic enhancement. Major commercial corridors are in
need of landscape and median improvements. As the overall image of the
City slowly changes over time, it can become a highly sought after place
to conduct business and invest.                                                   Characteristics of the Inland Empire

Preliminary analysis indicates that the existing retail stock is over-built by          (San Bernardino, Colton,

In the last few years the Inland Empire has started to emerge as a desirable
location for office development. The primary thrust behind the region’s
growth has been the affordability of housing relative to Los Angeles and
Orange Counties. In addition, continuing expansion of Ontario airport
passenger traffic and the future potential of the San Bernardino
International Airport and Trade Center make the area more attractive for
City of San Bernardino                                                                                   4-7

    office use, which generates and attracts business travel. Supportable space
    estimates indicate that the City of San Bernardino’s office market is
    currently overbuilt. However, projected employment growth shows that
    the City could capture as much as 170,000 square feet annually over the
    next five years, particularly in the downtown.
    Inventory and Absorption
    The approximate volume of multi-tenant space located in the City of San
    Bernardino is about 3.03 million square feet. This does not include single
    use governmental space. About 551,300 square feet of this total is vacant
    resulting in an overall vacancy rate of 18.2 percent. As of the 3rd quarter
    2000, about 530,000 square feet of office space was under construction, all
    of which was in the Airport area and the Riverside area.
    The demand for office space in the Inland Empire is expected to remain
    strong as the neighboring office markets of Los Angeles and Orange
    Counties continue to tighten. As of the 3rd quarter of 2000, the San
    Bernardino sub-market had absorbed about 268,000 square feet of the
    550,000 total square feet absorbed in the Inland Empire region, or about
    49 percent of the total.
    Opportunities
    A net new demand of about 850,000 square feet of new office space is
    forecasted in the City. Opportunities for office development will be
    primarily in the downtown area with infill and mixed commercial
    development, as well as lower-density office park type development in the
    northern part of the City along the I-215 corridor or adjacent to California
    State University, San Bernardino (CSUSB).
    3.      Industrial Trends
    As a shortage of industrial space is occurring in Orange County, the Inland
    Empire has experienced a large number of firms taking advantage of
    available land at affordable prices relative to other markets. Industrial
    space absorption in the Inland Empire has therefore remained strong. The
    area around the junction of the I-15 with the I-10 and Route 60 freeways is
    now reaching capacity and space costs are beginning to rise. As a result,
    industrial developers and manufacturing clients are now increasing their
    activity further east. The City of San Bernardino is benefiting from this
    trend.

Inventory and Absorption
The total Inland Empire market inventory was approximately 215.9
million square feet as of the third quarter of 2000. The San
Bernardino/Redlands submarket contained about 11.8 million square feet
or about 5 percent of the regional total. About 9.5 million square feet of
the San Bernardino/Redlands submarket was located in the City of San
Bernardino. The City of San Bernardino had a vacancy rate of about 4.8
percent, lower than the San Bernardino/Redlands submarket of 6.0 percent
and the region’s 7.1 percent.

Other Economic Development Efforts
The Economic Development Agency also implements the City’s
Economic Development Strategy. This strategy includes aggressive
business promotion and consulting services focusing on business retention
attraction and expansion services for new or existing businesses by
providing resources in technical assistance, financial assistance, and

businesses with potential for significant growth and job creation.
Through the implementation of the Economic Development Strategy and
supplemental business development tools such as BizNet, the City is

conduct business. By reinvigorating business investment into the
community, the City will also foster redevelopment and revitalization of

Workforce Development – Job Promotion,
Training, and Career Education
Many of the local schools and universities have mentor and training
programs as part of their available curriculum. These programs can be
expanded and enhanced to generate a skilled workforce that will remain in
the community as long as employment opportunities are available.
Creating reciprocal relationships with the City’s workforce population,
major institutions, and educational facilities that provide training programs
can foster reinvestment into the community by those that live and work
there. Identifying the skills of the City’s current workforce can also help
to define the types of uses that should be attracted to the City.
Goal 4.12       Positively define and capitalize on available workforce
                skill capabilities to attract new employers.
Policies:
4.12.1          Define and market the regional labor force in areas within
                commuting distance from San Bernardino.
4.12.2          Attract large employers with bilingual labor force needs
                and modest skills. Examples include Call Centers and
                Billing Centers.
4.12.3          Provide tax incentives and technical assistance to
                encourage home-based businesses/offices.
4.12.4          Promote bilingual capacities of the resident labor force as
                an asset.
Goal 4.13       Partner with the existing educational institutions to
                effectively deliver job training programs to residents.
4.13.1          Identify training and labor force needs of oncoming
                employment sectors.
4.13.2          Provide vocational training opportunities to the resident
                labor force in conjunction with the San Bernardino Valley
                College and CSUSB. (E-8)

     Recreational, Cultural, Entertainment, and
     Educational Activity Areas
     Recreational, cultural, entertainment, and educational opportunities have
     the potential to create a draw to the City of San Bernardino. Highly
     publicized events such as the Route 66 Rendezvous help to convey a
     positive image of the City and should be capitalized upon.
     Goal 4.14       Enhance, maintain, and develop recreational, cultural,
                     entertainment, and educational facilities within the
                     City.

Chapter 5. Community Design
INTRODUCTION
The City of San Bernardino is a large, diverse planning area that stretches
over 70 square miles and encompasses various natural and man-made
environments. The topography includes soaring mountains, deep valleys,
wide alluvial plains, streams, rivers, and a flat valley floor. Its built
environment ranges from dense commercial and civic uses in Downtown,
to single-family neighborhoods, to hillside estates. Visitors view the City
from major freeways and along arterials; residents experience it along its
local streets, parks, schools, and shopping centers. Creating a positive and
strong community identity for such a diverse area is the goal of this
Element.
Purpose
The Community Design Element provides policy guidance that respects
San Bernardino’s diverse context while seeking to unify the City through
carefully crafted design policies. A Community Design Element is an
optional part of the General Plan, but the City recognizes the importance
of community appearance and design to its vitality and future.
This element addresses the following aesthetic issues:
        Community wide design issues,
        District or neighborhood aesthetic consideration, and
        Individual land use design considerations.
Relationship to Other Elements
The Community Design Element is closely linked to the Land Use
Element as well as the Development Code. In concert, these three
documents address both citywide policy level and ordinance level land
uses and development standards.
City of San Bernardino                                                               5-1

    In addition, special urban design standards are present in some of the
    City’s redevelopment project areas. These special standards set forth
    architectural and site design standards to create a sense of cohesion in
    these revitalizing areas. The most extensive example of these special
    restrictions is the Development Framework and Design Guidelines
    adopted as part of the Central City South Overlay District, adopted in
    1987. These guidelines discuss access and parking, height, bulk, and
    setback of buildings, ground floor frontage, landscaping and hardscaping,
    and other design features.
    Finally, certain master planned areas have their own codes, covenants, and
    restrictions (CC&Rs) that are applied by the master developers to projects
    that wish to locate within these areas. Two examples of this case are the
    Tri-City Corporate Center in the Hospitality district and the State College
    Business Park within the State College Redevelopment Project Area.

                                                                               5 Community Design
ACHIEVING THE VISION
The overriding vision of San Bernardino is to enhance the City’s overall
image, recreate and capture its distinct personality, and create a strong
community identity from a diverse base, while at the same time avoiding a
sterile sameness.
The Urban Design Element is responsive to our Vision because it
represents our desires to:
        Develop unique entry features into the City as a whole and into
         distinct neighborhoods and districts to help define our boundaries
         and act as landmarks;
        Develop and enact a cohesive theme for the entire City as well as
         sub-themes for our neighborhoods to provide identity and create a
         sense of community;
        Ensure well-designed and coordinated projects, including the site
         plan, architecture, materials, colors, landscaping, and signage;
        Realize well-maintained properties, roadways, parks, libraries, and
         community centers;
        Enjoy aesthetic enhancements along our arterial corridors and
         public rights-of-way, including landscaping and streetscape
         improvements; and
        Preserve the City’s historic heritage and incorporate its significant
         features into the design of new projects.
COMMUNITY DESIGN SCOPE AND
STRUCTURE
An important theory behind this Element is that community design exists
at various levels, from the scale of an individual project to that of the
entire community. In between, districts and neighborhoods are visually
distinct sub-areas that are tied to the City as a whole. The challenge for
the City of San Bernardino is to incorporate new development into the
design fabric of the City so that it contributes both to overall community
image and to its immediate context. The best way to plan for this is to
establish design guidelines and policies at each of these important levels.

    The following structure offers a way of thinking about design features
    applicable to these distinct levels and provides the basis for the issues,
    goals and policies that follow:
           Community-wide Design Features
            •  City gateways and entries
            •  Major corridor design and street furniture
            •  City signs and logos
            •  Community facilities – civic center, parks, trails, community
               centers
           District and Neighborhood Level Design Features
            •  Specialized landscaping and streetscape themes
            •  Neighborhood entry features
           Project Level Design Features
            •  Architectural variety and interest
            •  Creative site planning
            •  Context and compatibility transitions
            •  Convenient parking and access
            •  Varied streetscape treatment
    See Figure CD-1 for a depiction of significant community-wide design
    features. The plan constitutes a visual summary of the important
    community design features that are the focus of this Element.

                                                                                 5 Community Design
GOALS AND POLICIES
The following presents the goals and policies for community design for in
the City of San Bernardino.
Community-Wide Design Features
In a city as large and diverse as San Bernardino, it is challenging to create
a consistent community design theme. San Bernardino is approximately
60 square miles (70 square miles including the Sphere of Influence) and
has irregular borders intermingled with adjacent cities and the County.
Our topography varies from the hills and canyons to the north to the flat
areas toward the southwest. Our neighborhoods range from period
architecture of the early 1900’s to suburban tracts typical of development
in the 1950’s through today. In addition, our commercial areas range from
specialty retail areas to strip commercial development along its many
corridors.
Unifying this City of diverse elements is both a challenge and an
opportunity. The creation of distinct community gateways and enhanced
corridors can provide a community identity and distinguish San
Bernardino from surrounding communities. An example of the type of
aesthetic improvements we desire can be seen in Figure CD-2, Illustrative
Examples.
Gateways
Due to the amorphous City boundaries and size of San Bernardino, it is
often difficult to identify entry into the City. The creation of strong
gateways, or entry points, can help distinguish San Bernardino, act as
landmarks, and help the traveler navigate through the community.
Goal 5.1         Create conspicuous gateways at key points in the
                 community to identify and distinguish San Bernardino.
Policies:
5.1.1            Provide improvements along principal streets at the City
                 boundary that clearly identify major entries to the City.
                 Such improvements may include signage, landscaping,
                 vertical pylons, and/or other distinctive treatments. (LU-3
                 and CD-1)                                                    An example of one of the City

                                   5.1.2           Designate and provide monumentation for important
                                                   primary and secondary entry points into the City, especially

                                   Residents and visitors alike often experience the City by traveling along
                                   its many arterial corridors. These corridors vary in character from
                                   designated scenic highways to more regional-serving arterials.
                                   From a community design perspective, arterial streetscape improvement
                                   plans provide visual continuity and interest to the motorist and pedestrian.
                                   Such plans can reinforce City design themes as well as soften views of
                                   adjoining development.

Specific Areas
As described in the Introduction and Land Use Element, San Bernardino is
comprised of numerous districts, such as Downtown, the University
District, or the Sante Fe Depot area. Many of these districts are
recognized in the Land Use Element and contain tailored policy direction.
Unique design and aesthetic design policies can be found in the Strategic
Areas section of the Land Use Element.
There are many areas of the City that have not been specifically called out
in the General Plan, but that does not mean these areas are ignored. As
described above, it is a policy of the City to create a program to identify
districts and prepare design guidelines for them.
Project Level Features
As the saying goes, the whole is equal to the sum of its parts. This is
clearly evidenced in community design and aesthetics: well-designed and
maintained structures enhance the surrounding neighborhood, while
conversely, poorly designed and maintained properties damage the value
of the entire community. Accordingly, the City should pay special
attention to the design details of individual projects to ensure that they
improve and do not detract from the community. Code enforcement
efforts should be diligent when it comes to enforcing property
maintenance, sign, and outdoor storage regulations. Examples of the types
of aesthetic enhancements we desire can be seen on Figure CD-2,

Chapter 6. Circulation
INTRODUCTION
An efficient and safe circulation system is a critical concern for our
residents and visitors. Our ability to maneuver affects our quality of life in
a myriad of ways: from driving on the freeway, to parking, to shipping
goods, to emergency access, to riding a bike and walking across a street.
We are blessed with an amazing array of mobility options upon which we
can capitalize and enhance our community.
As the County’s largest city and given its location, San Bernardino’s
transportation system has a broad and significant impact. Not only does it
serve the mobility of over 186,000 residents, San Bernardino’s roadways
affect and are affected by regional influences. We are positioned as a
gateway into the Southern California from the Cajon Pass and Interstate
215, to the Inland Empire via Interstate 10, and to the San Bernardino
Mountains from State Routes 18, 30, and 330. A grid system of streets,
developed early in the City’s history, directly connects to a valley-wide
street system linking a string of foothill and valley communities as far
west as Pomona (approximately 30 miles). Some of these east-to-west
arterials retain the same name through much of the valley (e.g., Baseline
Street, Foothill Boulevard, and Highland Avenue).
But we have so much more than streets that we can rely upon to enrich our
mobility options. We are the location of major freight and passenger rail
operations and are blessed with one-of-a-kind resources in the San
Bernardino International Airport and Trade Center and the Santa Ana
River Trail, which passes through a portion of our community.
City of San Bernardino                                                            6-1

    Purpose
    Our transportation system affects almost every aspect of the City’s quality
    of life: land use patterns, air quality, open-space, habitat planning, noise,
    energy use, and community appearance.
    The major purpose of this Element is to design and improve a circulation
    system to meet the current and future needs of all its residents. Such a
    system should have the following three components: equity, efficiency and
    foresight. It should be accessible to all economic segments of the City to
    make their lives more convenient and practical. It should make use of
    existing infrastructure wherever practical. Finally, it should preserve
    important transportation routes for future planning needs.
    Relationship to Other Elements
    State planning law not only requires a Circulation Element, it mandates
    that it be directly correlated to the Land Use Element. This means that it
    must assess the adequacy of the circulation system to handle traffic
    generated by planned land use changes. But circulation directly or
    indirectly affects almost all elements of the General Plan, including the
    required Housing, Natural Resources and Conservation, Noise, and Safety
    Elements. In addition, it is directly related to the Economic Development
    Element due to the movement of employees, products, materials and ideas
    throughout the City, and to the Community Design Element for a
    roadway’s direct effect on the City’s image and character.
    The Parks, Recreation, and Trails Element contains the discussion and
    policies related to our bicycle facilities and trails.

ACHIEVING THE VISION
The Land Use Element is responsive to our Vision because it represents
our desires to:
        Improve our community’s appearance and identity by revitalizing
         our corridors and roadways;
        Reinforce our strategic location within Southern California’s
         transportation system by providing a system of streets that
         accommodate projected traffic levels and allow the convenient
         movement of people and goods;
        Capitalize upon our freight and passenger rail operations to
         stimulate economic growth;
        Minimize the impacts of truck traffic, particularly in residential
         areas;
        Fulfill the potential of the San Bernardino International Airport
         and Trade Center to become a vibrant center for commerce and
         travel and stimulate surrounding businesses;
        Realize the improvement of our historic Santa Fe Depot so that it
         will be an example of our community and a destination in itself;
        Improve our entire system of mobility by providing a range of
         transportation alternatives including light rail, bus, bicycle, and
         pedestrian paths and trails; and
        Expand the safety of our streets and neighborhoods.

                                 a.       Freeways/Highway
                                 Freeways/Highways are controlled-access, separated roadways that
                                 provide for high volumes of vehicular traffic at high speeds. There are
                                 four freeways within the City of San Bernardino and one highway:
                                         The San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) is the major east-west freeway

                                                                              6 Circulation
        Interstate 210 provides local east-west service between I-215 and
         State Route 330. As of 2005, this freeway was under construction
         and was also known as State Route 30 and will become the future
         I-210 when completed.
        State Route 18 provides a connection from I-210 to the mountain
         resorts/communities of Lake Gregory.
b.       Major Arterials
These roadways can accommodate six or eight travel lanes and may have
raised medians. These facilities carry high traffic volumes and are the
primary thoroughfares linking San Bernardino with adjacent cities and the
regional highway system. Driveway access to these roadways is typically
limited to provide efficient high volume traffic flow. Examples of Major
Arterials include:
        Waterman Avenue
        Mount Vernon Avenue
        Highland Avenue
        Baseline Street
c.       Secondary Arterials
These roadways are typically four-lane streets, providing two lanes in each
direction. These highways carry traffic along the perimeters of major
developments, provide support to the major arterials, and are also through
streets enabling traffic to travel uninterrupted for longer distances through
the City. Examples of Secondary Arterials Include:
        Little Mountain Drive
        9th Street
        Arrowhead Avenue (North of 5th Street)
        Sierra Way
d.       Collector Streets
These roadways are typically two-lane streets that connect the local streets
with the secondary arterials allowing local traffic to access the regional
transportation facilities. Examples of Collector Streets include:
City of San Bernardino                                                           6-5

           California Street
           6th Street
           Meridian Avenue
    e.      Local Streets
    These roadways are typically two-lane streets that are designed to serve
    neighborhoods within residential areas. There are several variations on
    local streets depending on location, length of the street, and type of land
    use.
    f.      Standard Roadway Cross Sections
    The following are the typical cross sections for each roadway
    classification. In order to maintain acceptable levels of service, additional
    right-of-way dedication beyond the typical cross section may be required
    in order to accommodate additional turn lanes or other design features.
    Unique street cross-sections, median designs, and street widths may be
    considered for each development in order to create distinction and identity
    as long as function, capacity, and safety are maintained to the City’s
    satisfaction.

2.       Scenic Highways and Routes
Scenic highways and routes are a unique component of the circulation
system as they traverse areas of unusual scenic or aesthetic value. As
shown on Figure C-1, Scenic Highways/Routes, two roadways within the
City have been nominated for official Scenic Highway status. The portions
of State Route 30, south of the 330, and State Route 330 that pass through
the City are designated as Eligible Scenic Highways.
Due to the designation as Eligible Scenic Highways, the provisions of the
California Scenic Highways program apply to these sections of the
roadways in the City. The purpose of the California Scenic Highways
program, which was established in 1963, is to “Preserve and protect scenic
highway corridors from change which would diminish the aesthetic value
of lands adjacent to highways.” This program provides guidance for
signage, aesthetics, grading, and screening to help maintain the scenic
value of the roadway.
We support the designation of these roadways and further desire that they
be officially designated in the future. Accordingly, we support the
provisions of the Scenic Highways program and will enhance these two
corridors so that the scenic designation is earned.

Railways
San Bernardino includes both major (main line) and minor (spurs)
railroads that accommodate both freight and passenger rail services. This
is both a blessing and a curse: a blessing because we are home to extensive
rail freight facilities, which help strengthen our economy, attract business,
and provide mobility options; and a curse because of impacts associated
with railroads, such as noise and temporary restriction of emergency
access.
1.       Freight Rail
Extensive freight rail service is provided within the City by Burlington
Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) and Union Pacific (UP) railroads; in fact,
freight operators are the largest users of San Bernardino’s rail facilities.
Rail service provided by UP on its main line through San Bernardino is
expected to grow significantly in the future due to the increased
international trade at the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, the San
Bernardino International Airport, as well as population growth in southern
California. Currently there are 24 trains per day on a peak day passing
through San Bernardino on the UP main line. By 2025, this is forecast to
increase to 132 trains per day.
BNSF operates intermodal, carload freight, and bulk unit trains through
the City. The BNSF main line runs through Riverside County and crosses
the UP line in Colton. It will carry the major growth in rail traffic
associated with the Ports.
Growth in train traffic on the other rail lines and spurs in San Bernardino
will be limited to the needs of the local industrial users which need rail
service. The land use plan concentrates industrial use in locations already
served by rail spur lines.
2.       Passenger Rail Service
Both Amtrak and Metrolink provide long-distance passenger train service
from the Historic Depot in San Bernardino.
Amtrak has provided local, interstate, and transcontinental service at San
Bernardino since Amtrak's inception in 1971. At the present time, Amtrak
trains operate west to Los Angeles; southeast to Palm Springs and on to
Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida;
and northeast to Needles, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas,

                            Existing Traffic Conditions
                            This section summarizes the existing circulation conditions in the City of
                            San Bernardino. The analysis is based on existing amount of traffic
                            volume on various street corridors and the capacity of the streets and
                            intersections to carry traffic. The capacity measures the ability of the
                            street system to meet and serve the demands from traffic. It is the most
                            practical measure of determining the City’s capability to provide mobility
                            to its residents. The capacity of a roadway is affected by a number of
                            factors, e.g., the street width, the number of travel lanes, the number of
                            crossing streets, the type of traffic control devices, the presence of on-
                            street parking, the number of access driveways, and the streets horizontal
                            and vertical alignments to name a few.

                                                                             6 Circulation
1.       About Traffic Projections
a.       Level of Service (LOS) and V/C Analysis
An important “standard” referred to throughout this Element relates to the
ability of a roadway and/or intersection to accommodate traffic. This level
of service standard may be used to describe both existing and future traffic
conditions. Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative ranking that
characterizes traffic congestion on a scale of A to F with LOS A being a
free-flow condition and LOS F representing extreme congestion.
In addition to the LOS definition, a volume to capacity ratio or V/C ratio
is used to provide a more quantified description of traffic conditions at
intersections. The V/C ratio is the ratio of existing or projected traffic
volumes to an intersection’s design capacity. A V/C ratio of 0.90 for an
intersection means that the traffic volumes at the intersection represent 90
percent of its design capacity. The V/C ratio can also be related to the
LOS definitions. For example, an intersection with a V/C ratio exceeding
0.95 is handling traffic volumes that approach design capacity. The V/C
ratio of 0.95 corresponds to LOS E, which indicates unacceptable level of
service. The following six levels of service definitions relate traffic
conditions to traffic volumes and the design capacity of roadways and/or
intersections.
        LOS A (V/C ratio 0.0 - 0.60). There are no cycles that are fully
         loaded, and few are even close to loaded. No approach phase is
         fully utilized by traffic and no vehicle waits longer than one red
         indication. Typically, the approach appears quite open, turning
         movements are easily made, and nearly all drivers find freedom of
         operation.
        LOS B (V/C ratio 0.61 - 0.70). Represents stable operation. An
         occasional approach phase is fully utilized and a substantial
         number are approaching full use. Many drivers begin to feel
         somewhat restricted within platoons of vehicles.
        LOS C (V/C ratio 0.71 - 0.80). Stable operation continues. Full
         signal cycle loading is still intermittent, but more frequent.
         Occasionally drivers may have to wait through more than one red
         signal indication, and backups may develop behind turning
         vehicles.
        LOS D (V/C ratio 0.81 - 0.90). Encompasses a zone of increasing
         restriction approaching instability. Delays to approaching vehicles
         may be substantial during short peaks with the peak period, but
City of San Bernardino                                                         6-15

              enough cycles with lower demand occur to permit periodic
              clearance of developing queues, thus preventing excessive
              backups.
             LOS E (V/C ratio 0.91 - 1.00). Represents the most vehicles that
              any particular intersection approach can accommodate. At
              capacity (V/C = 1.00), there may be long queues of vehicles
              waiting upstream of the intersection and delays may be great (up to
              several signal cycles).
             LOS F (V/C ratio > 1.00). Represents jammed conditions.
              Backups from locations downstream or on the cross street may
              restrict or prevent movement of vehicles out of the approach under
              consideration; hence, volumes carried are not predictable. V/C
              values are highly variable, because full utilization of the approach
              may be prevented by outside conditions.
     b.       Existing LOS and V/C Ratios
     Existing traffic counts were conducted at various roadway segments and
     major intersections in 2003 to determine existing V/C and LOS at these
     facilities. The LOS of roadway segments is based on average daily traffic
     (ADT) volumes and their traffic handling capacities on a daily basis. The
     LOS of intersections is based on traffic volumes at the intersections during
     the AM and PM peak hours and the traffic handling capacity of the
     intersection’s critical lane. The results are shown in Appendix 14, Traffic
     Analysis Summary (Table 1 for intersections, and Table 2 for roadway
     segments).
     In the City of San Bernardino, the minimum acceptable level of service is
     established as LOS C for roadways and LOS D for intersections.
     Mitigation measures are required for roadway corridors/locations where
     traffic conditions show an LOS worse than the minimum acceptable LOS.
     As shown in Table 1 of Appendix 14, the following intersections are
     currently operating at an unacceptable LOS (the LOS at these intersections
     is worse than LOS D):
             Hunts Lane @ E Street
             Meridian Avenue @ Rialto Avenue
             Mountain View Avenue @ San Bernardino Street
             Rancho Avenue @ 5th St/Foothill Boulevard

                                                                             6 Circulation

        Waterman Avenue @ 36th Street
        Waterman Avenue @ Fifth Street
        Waterman Avenue @ SR-30 EB Ramp
Table 2 of Appendix 14 shows that the following roadway segments are
operating an unacceptable LOS (i.e., LOS is worse than LOS C) based on
capacity analysis of 24-hour volumes:
        Tippecanoe Avenue South of Hospitality Lane
Mitigation measures are required to improve the conditions at the above
locations to an acceptable LOS.
Future Traffic Conditions
This section analyzes potential traffic conditions in the City of San
Bernardino at a theoretical build-out of the plan. The LOS definitions,
calculation procedures, mitigation requirements, etc. used in the existing
conditions analysis also applies to this section.
1.       Background Model Input
a.       Recommended Roadway Improvements
The City has identified a number of roadway improvements,
reclassification and addition/deletion of certain roadway segments in order
to improve its circulation conditions to handle existing as well as future
traffic volumes (See Appendix 9, Circulation Plan Changes). For the
future traffic conditions analysis of the General Plan at buildout, these
improvements were assumed to be in place.
b.       Focused Travel Demand Model
As part of the analysis of the capabilities of the circulation system at the
theoretical buildout of the land use plan, a focused travel demand model
was developed. The model and the methodology used to create the model
are described in Appendix 14, Traffic Analysis Summary.
City of San Bernardino                                                         6-17

     2.      Build-out Traffic Forecasts and Operating Conditions
     Based on the traffic volume data obtained from future conditions model,
     the future traffic conditions at buildout of the General Plan were analyzed.
     The results of this analysis are contained in Appendix 14, Traffic Analysis
     Summary (Table 4 for intersections and Table 5 for roadway segments).
     The following illustrate the key observations from the analysis of
     projected traffic conditions for the build-out of the General Plan:
            Table 4 of Appendix 14 shows that the following intersections are
             expected to perform at an unacceptable level of service and require
             mitigation:
             •   Northpark Boulevard @ University Parkway
             •   Hunts Lane @ E Street
             •   Waterman Avenue @ 30th Street
             •   Waterman Avenue @ SR-30 EB Ramps
             •   SR-30 WB Off-ramp @ 30th Street
             •   Harrison Street @ 40th Street
             •   Waterman Avenue @ 36th Street
             •   Waterman Avenue @ 34th Street
             •   Valencia Avenue @ 40th Street
             •   Tippecanoe Avenue @ Rialto Avenue
             •   Rancho Avenue @ 5th Street/Foothill Boulevard
             •   Mountain View Avenue @ San Bernardino Road
            Table 5 of Appendix 14 shows that the following roadway
             segments are projected to show unacceptable LOS:
             •   Base Line Street between Palm Avenue and Valencia Avenue
             •   E Street between 9th Street and Kendall Drive
             •   Sierra Way between I-10 Freeway and Foothill Boulevard
             •   Sierra Way between Waterman Avenue and 40th Street
     Mitigation and improvement measures are required for the intersections
     and roadway segments that show unacceptable LOS. Typically,
     improvements at intersections result in improvement in traffic conditions
     on its approaches and thereby mitigate impacts on roadway segments.
6-18                                                         City of San Bernardino

                                                                            6 Circulation
Therefore, a number of mitigation measures have been identified for a
total of 13 intersections where traffic analysis indicated circulation
deficiencies. These mitigation/improvement measures would improve
intersection performance to an acceptable LOS during peak hours.
Appendix 9, Circulation Plan Changes, contains a list of these
improvements.
Future Circulation System
Based on the analysis at the theoretical buildout of the General Plan and
the deficiencies and mitigation identified, our Future Circulation System
has been developed to meet our future needs. The proposed Circulation
Plan is shown on Figure C-2, Circulation Plan.
Our objective is to achieve this circulation system if merited by the
conditions on the ground. It is important to remember, the traffic analysis
performed for this General Plan was a projection of future conditions and,
as we all know, actual conditions may vary in the future. For instance,
some streets may experience less traffic than were projected at this time
and future roadway reconfigurations may not actually be necessary. We
will use this plan as our guide and make sure changes are actually required
before making them.

GOALS AND POLICIES
The following presents the goals and policies for mobility and circulation
in the City of San Bernardino.
Street System
We expect a lot from our street system. We want a street system that
provides convenient access, is safe, is not too congested, looks good, is
multi-functional, and is not designed only for cars.
The City’s street system should provide access to our homes and
businesses and allow convenient intra-city travel and access to regional
transportation facilities. In addition, the street system should be designed
to provide the necessary capacity to accommodate the traffic generated
from the future buildout of the General Plan as well as regional traffic, not
a potential maximum level but within acceptable levels of service. Our
street system needs to be safe, not only for vehicular travel, but for
pedestrians and bicyclists too.
Our street system needs to accommodate more than cars. Pedestrians,
bicyclists, as well as landscaping, signs, gateways, and infrastructure all
need to coexist within our street right-of-ways in a manner that is safe and
aesthetically pleasing. Advanced technologies in traffic control and
operations should be employed to maximize the capacity and efficiency of
the arterial system.
Our circulation plan is designed to accomplish these vary goals. The
ultimate goal for our circulation system is shown on Figure C-2,
Circulation Plan. Taken with the typical cross sections (Shown in the
Roadway Section of this Chapter) and the policies in the Community
Design Element, a clear picture of the roadway system is provided.
Goal 6.1         Provide a well-maintained street system.
Policies:
6.1.1            Maintain and rehabilitate all components of the circulation
                 system, including roadways, sidewalks, bicycle facilities
                 and pedestrian facilities. (A-2)
6.1.2            Develop list of priorities for maintenance and
                 reconstruction projects. (A-2)
City of San Bernardino                                                          6-23

     6.1.3     Coordinate maintenance or enhancement of transportation
               facilities with related infrastructure improvements. (A-2)
     Goal 6.2  Maintain efficient traffic operations on City streets.
     Policies:
     6.2.1     Maintain a peak hour level of service D or better at street
               intersections.
     6.2.2     Design each roadway with sufficient capacity to
               accommodate anticipated traffic based on intensity of
               projected and planned land use in the City and the region
               while maintaining a peak hour level of service (LOS) “C”
               or better.
     6.2.3     Keep traffic in balance with roadway capacity by requiring
               traffic studies to identify local roadway and intersection
               improvements necessary to mitigate the traffic impacts of
               new developments and land use changes. (LU-1)
     6.2.4     Review the functioning of the street system as part of the
               Capital Improvement Program to identify problems and
               address them in a timely manner. (A-2)
     6.2.5     Design roadways, monitor traffic flow, and employ traffic
               control measures (e.g. signalization, access control,
               exclusive right and left turn-turn lanes, lane striping, and
               signage) to ensure City streets and roads continue to
               function safely within our Level of Service standards.
     6.2.6     Improve intersection operations by modifying signal timing
               at intersections and coordinating with other signals, as
               appropriate.
     6.2.7     Install new signals as warranted.
     Goal 6.3  Provide a safe circulation system.
     Policies:
     6.3.1     Promote the principle that streets have multiple uses and
               users, and protect the safety of all users.
6-24                                                     City of San Bernardino

                                                                                6 Circulation
6.3.2           Discourage high speeds and through traffic on local streets
                through traffic control devise such as signage, speed
                bumps, etc.. as acceptable by the local neighborhood. (C-2
                and C-3)
6.3.3           Require that all City streets be constructed in accordance
                with the Circulation Plan (Figure C-2) and the standards
                established by the Development Services Director.
6.3.4           Require appropriate right-of-way dedications of all new
                developments to facilitate construction of roadways shown
                on the Circulation Plan. (LU-1)
6.3.5           Limit direct access from adjacent private properties to
                arterials to maintain an efficient and desirable quality of
                traffic flow. (LU-1)
6.3.6           Locate new development and their access points in such a
                way that traffic is not encouraged to utilize local residential
                streets and alleys. (LU-1)
6.3.7           Require that adequate access be provided to all
                developments in the City including secondary access to
                facilitate emergency access and egress (LU-1).
Goal 6.4        Minimize the impact of roadways on adjacent land
                uses and ensure compatibility between land uses and
                highway facilities to the extent possible.
Policies:
6.4.1           Work with Caltrans to ensure that construction of new
                facilities includes appropriate sound walls or other
                mitigating noise barriers to reduce noise impacts on
                adjacent land uses. (C-1)
6.4.2           Require, wherever possible, a buffer zone between
                residential land uses and highway facilities. (LU-1)
6.4.3           Continue to participate in forums involving the various
                governmental agencies such as Caltrans, SANBAG, SCAG,
                and the County that are intended to evaluate and propose
                solutions to regional transportation problems.
City of San Bernardino                                                            6-25
     6.4.4           Design developments within designated and eligible scenic
                     highway corridors to balance the objectives of maintaining
                     scenic resources with accommodating compatible land
                     uses. (LU-1)
     6.4.5           Encourage joint efforts among federal, state, county, and
                     City agencies and citizen groups to ensure compatible
                     development within scenic corridors.
     6.4.6           Impose conditions on development within scenic highway
                     corridors requiring dedication of scenic easements
                     consistent with the Scenic Highways Plan, when it is
                     necessary to preserve unique or special visual features.
                     (LU-1)
     6.4.7           Utilize contour grading and slope rounding to gradually
                     transition graded road slopes into a natural configuration
                     consistent with the topography of the areas within scenic
                     highway corridors. (LU-1)
     6.4.8           Develop appropriate protection measures along routes
                     frequently used by trucks to minimize noise impacts to
                     sensitive land uses including but not limited to residences,
                     hospitals, schools, parks, daycare facilities, libraries, and
                     similar uses. (LU-1)
     Trucks
     Truck traffic is a significant component of our overall transportation
     system. Many of the City’s vital industries rely heavily on regional and
     local truck transportation. Large volumes of heavy-duty trucks on the
     City’s transportation system and regional access facilities result in
     additional congestion and accelerated deterioration of the infrastructure.
     Many residential neighborhoods are impacted by the parking of trucks,
     especially in those areas near the foothills of the San Bernardino
     Mountains. The City prohibits the parking of trucks over 10,000 pounds
     from parking in residentially designated areas. Truck parking issues are
     addressed on a case-by-case basis in concert with impacted residents and
     businesses. In this manner, the most appropriate method of control, such
     as an outright ban, restricted hours, parking permits, or signage, can be
     employed.
6-26                                                          City of San Bernardino

                                                                                6 Circulation
Goal 6.5         Develop a transportation system that reduces
                 conflicts between commercial trucking, private/public
                 transportation, and land uses.
Policies:
6.5.1            Provide designated truck routes for use by
                 commercial/industrial trucking that minimize impacts on
                 local traffic and neighborhoods.
6.5.2            Continue to regulate on-street parking of trucks to prevent
                 truck parking on residential streets or in other locations
                 where they are incompatible with adjacent land uses. The
                 use of signs, restricted parking, limited parking times, and
                 the posting of “no overnight” parking signs are mechanisms
                 that can be employed depending upon the specific needs of
                 the affected area.
6.5.3            Prepare neighborhood protection plans for areas of the City
                 where heavy vehicle traffic or parking becomes a
                 significant enforcement problem. (C-2)
6.5.4            Require that on-site loading areas minimize interference of
                 truck loading activities with efficient traffic circulation on
                 adjacent roadways. (LU-1)
Public Transit
As the population grows, the level of congestion on streets will also rise.
As a result, it will become increasingly important to provide alternate
means of transportation.
Public transportation plays an important role in providing a well-balanced
transportation system for the City. A well planned and efficient public
transportation system provides an essential primary mode of transportation
to those without access to automobiles and an alternative mode of travel to
the motorists to help reduce the demand and congestion on the City’s
street network. The various modes of public transportation including bus,
commuter rail, demand responsive transportation, etc. should provide
efficient connectivity and integration via coordinated park-and-ride
facilities and multi-modal terminals.
City of San Bernardino                                                            6-27

                               The City plays a vital role in the use of transit through sound land
                               planning efforts and ensuring that developments are designed in a manner
                               that facilitates the provision of transit services.
                               Goal 6.6         Promote a network of multi-modal transportation
                                                facilities that are safe, efficient, and connected to

                                                improve the use, speed, and efficiency for transit services.
                                                These methods might include dedicated or priority
                                                lanes/signals, reduced parking standards for selected core
                                                areas, and incorporating Intelligent Transportation System
                                                architecture.
                               6.6.6            Support and encourage the provision of a range of
                                                paratransit opportunities to complement bus and rail service
                                                for specialized transit needs.
                               6.6.7            Encourage measures that will reduce the number of
                                                vehicle-miles traveled during peak periods, including the
                                                following examples of these types of measures:
                                                •   Incentives for car-pooling and vanpooling.
                                                •   Preferential parking for car-pools and vanpools.
                                                •   An adequate, safe, and interconnected system of
                                                    pedestrian and bicycle paths.
       6-28                                                                               City of San Bernardino

                                                                                6 Circulation
                •   Conveniently located bus stops with shelters that are
                    connected to pedestrian/bicycle paths. (A-1)
6.6.8           Promote the use of car-pools and vanpools by providing
                safe, convenient park-and-ride facilities.
6.6.9           Work with Omnitrans to create transit corridors, such as the
                one currently being explored on E Street linking CSUSB to
                Hospitality Lane, to increase transit ridership, reduce traffic
                congestion, and improve air quality.
6.6.10          Consider the provision of incentives, such as reduced
                parking standards and density/intensity bonuses, to those
                projects near transit stops that include transit-friendly uses
                such as child care, convenience retail, and housing.
Rail Service
Freight and passenger rail system have been an integral part of the City of
San Bernardino’s transportation network for decades. We intended to
keep them here for our immediate future. However, we need to be vigilant
to help reduce impacts, especially as rail traffic increases in the future.
We also need to create ways to separate train traffic from our other modes
of travel to reduce conflicts and improve emergency access.
Goal 6.7        Work with the railroads and other public agencies to
                develop and maintain railway facilities that minimize
                the impacts on adjacent land uses.
Policies:
6.7.1           Accommodate railroad services that allow for the
                movement of people and goods while minimizing their
                impact on adjacent land uses.
6.7.2           Coordinate with SANBAG, SCAG, the County and other
                regional, state or federal agencies and the railroads
                regarding plans for the provision of passenger, commuter,
                and high-speed rail service.
6.7.3           Encourage the provision of a buffer between residential
                land uses and railway facilities and encourage the
                construction of sound walls or other mitigating noise
                barriers between railway facilities and adjacent land uses.
City of San Bernardino                                                            6-29

     6.7.4            Identify existing and future high volume at-grade railroad
                      crossings and pursue available sources of funding (e.g.,
                      California Public Utilities Commission) to implement grade
                      separations where appropriate. (A-3)
     Aviation
     The San Bernardino International Airport and Trade Center (SBIA) is a
     regional influence and a benefit to our City. There is an opportunity for
     the properties surrounding the SBIA to develop with uses that are related
     to or can benefit from the proximity of an airport. We must also be careful
     to ensure that our quality of life is not degraded by the airport and airport
     related traffic. We desire to see this airport and our heliports develop into
     successful, safe, and considerate neighbors within out community.
     Goal 6.8         Support the safe operation of aviation and heliport
                      facilities within and in proximity to the City.
     Policies:
     6.8.1            Work with the San Bernardino International Airport
                      Authority (SBIAA) in the preparation of the Airport Master
                      Plan and Comprehensive Land Use Plan to ensure the
                      City’s interests are foremost in the improvement of the
                      airport.
     6.8.2            Coordinate with surrounding cities, the IVDA, and regional
                      agencies to ensure that access to the San Bernardino
                      International Airport is provided and maintained in a
                      manner that minimizes traffic impacts to the City of San
                      Bernardino.
     6.8.3            Work with the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure
                      that the existing or new Heliports within San Bernardino
                      operate in a safe manner and minimize impacts on adjacent
                      properties.

     An adequate supply of parking is necessary to accommodate the demands
     of developments in the City. Typically, on-street parking is permitted on
     major, secondary, and collector roadways and off-street parking
     requirements for designated zones are addressed in the Development
     Code.

The City has established a residential permit-parking program in response
to parking intrusion into neighborhoods from adjacent developments, such
as the Valley College. The City has numerous neighborhood permit
parking districts in this program. Within these districts, on-street parking
is regulated to ensure that spillover-parking demands from adjacent
developments do not prevent local residents from parking on the street.
The hours of enforcement vary between programs, as do the eligibility
requirements, but generally all residents of the neighborhood are entitled
to a parking permit.
Goal 6.9        Achieve a balance between parking supply and
                demand.
Policies:
6.9.1           Ensure that developments provide an adequate supply of
                parking to meet its needs either on-site or within close
                proximity. (LU-1)
6.9.2           Study the parking standards in the Development Code to
                determine if adequate flexibility is available to
                accommodate desirable situations, such as shared parking,
                Corridor Improvement actions, or transit oriented
                developments. (A-1)
6.9.3           Continue to expand the supply of public parking in off-
                street parking facilities in downtown San Bernardino.
6.9.4           Continue to provide an in-lieu parking fee option for
                developments in the Downtown area to satisfy all or part of
                their parking requirement through the payment of an in-lieu
                fee which will be utilized to provide parking in
                consolidated public parking facilities.
6.9.5           Require that new developments submit a parking demand
                analysis to the City Engineer for review and approval
                whenever a proposal is made to provide less than the full
                code requirement of parking. (LU-1)
6.9.6           Develop parking and traffic control plans for those
                neighborhoods adversely impacted by spillover parking and
                traffic. (C-3)

Chapter 7. Public Facilities and
Services
INTRODUCTION
Public services and facilities play an essential role in enhancing San
Bernardino’s quality of life. The presence of high quality public services
and facilities such as fire protection, law enforcement, libraries, and
schools significantly influence the health and viability of our residential,
commercial, and industrial communities.
The effectiveness of our community resources is the result of careful
planning, thoughtful decisions, and the provision of adequate funding. As
we continue to grow and mature, the public services and facilities
necessary to support our new development will need to be provided and
the existing facilities will continue to require maintenance, rehabilitation,
and replacement. Given our prevailing fiscal and economic constraints,
this is a challenging job.
Purpose
The Public Facilities and Services Element identifies the City’s goals,
policies, and programs concerning the provision of public facilities and
services, including the following:
        Fire Protection and Emergency Services,
        Police Services,                                                            Examples the types of public
                                                                                     services and facilities in our
                                                                                     community. Source: City of San
        Schools, and                                                                Bernardino Website.

City of San Bernardino                                                                                     7-1

                            Relationship to Other Elements
                            This element is not a legally mandated part of the General Plan, but its
                            inclusion demonstrates the commitment to our citizens’ quality of life. It
                            supports the Land Use Element by establishing the service standards
                            necessary to support a growing population. In addition, it provides leaders
                            and residents with an update of realistic standards to provide the highest
                            possible levels of service to all segments of the community commensurate
                            with fiscal realities.
                            As we were unfortunately reminded in 2003, the threat of wind driven
                            wildland fires is a real concern in the hillsides. A thorough discussion and
                            related polices can be found in the Safety Element.
                            ACHIEVING THE VISION
                            Our continued activities and improved quality of life are dependent on the
                            provision and maintenance of high quality public services and facilities.
                            The quality of our schools, police, and fire services are important to our
                            sense of community pride and to attract investment and redevelopment.
                            We have been successful in reducing our crime rates; however, crime is
                            still one of our major concerns, especially in our Sphere of Influence. We
                            value our fire services but need to ensure there is an adequate level of
                            personnel, strategies, building requirements, and mutual aide agreements
                            in place to prevent future disasters. For both our fire and police services,
                            the right amount of personnel and equipment must be available to ensure
                            rapid response times throughout the City.
                            Our schools, colleges, and universities represent our future and it is our
                            goal to collaborate them to ensure the best possible education. Our two
                            major educational institutions, California State University, San Bernardino
                            and the San Bernardino Valley College, must be fully integrated with the
                            rest of the City through physical linkages and increasing interactions with
                            the our grade schools and our community.
                            As our population continues to grow, we need to expand our critical
                            services and infrastructure in the appropriate manner and locations to
                            accommodate the new population. We must do so in the most cost
                            effective and equitable means possible. The Public Services and Facilities
                            Element is responsive to our Vision because it represents our desires to:

         development of quality K-12 schools and provide a valuable
         amenity to attract new residents and businesses.

The ISO rating for the San Bernardino is Class 3. The ISO rating is on a
scale from 1-10 with Class 1 being the best. In most instances, the fire

Chapter 8. Parks, Recreation,
and Trails
INTRODUCTION
San Bernardino enjoys unparalleled access to the San Bernardino
Mountains and National Forests. We are also blessed with the Santa Ana
River and Lytle Creek as well as several other drainages. We have Little
League Baseball West Region Headquarters/Complex, regional soccer
facilities, and parks. Despite these amenities, we still need to ensure that
sufficient parkland is provided within our neighborhoods, located within
convenient access to our residents, interconnected so our children can
easily gain access, and safely designed and maintained.
A Parks, Recreation, and Trails Element is not a required element of the
General Plan by state law, but a desirable one at the local level. By
assessing what it has and charting where it wants to go, the City of San
Bernardino aspires to develop a system of recreational opportunities that
improves the quality of life of its citizens by providing a variety of healthy
activities. A vibrant and diverse multi-purpose system of parks and trails
is one of the finest amenities that a city can provide for aesthetic, health,
and economic reasons.
Purpose                                                                              Examples the types of recreational
                                                                                     opportunities we enjoy in San
                                                                                     Bernardino.
The Parks, Recreation and Trails Element provides policy guidance that
addresses the acquisition, development, maintenance, and standards for
our recreation and trail resources.
Relationship to Other Elements
The Parks and Recreation Element is closely linked with the Land Use,
Circulation, and Natural Resources Elements. Together, these Elements
chart a course for our active and passive recreational pursuits.
City of San Bernardino                                                                                  8-1
                               ABOUT PARKS
                               There are many types of parks and recreational facilities in San
                               Bernardino, and their description provides the basis for setting future goals
                               and standards. Below is a description of the hierarchy of basic types of
                               parks systems.
                               Types of Parks
                               Existing recreational facilities within the planning area are categorized
                               into four classes: mini-parks, neighborhoods parks, community parks, and
                               regional parks. Each of the following parks is based on standards
                               commonly used by the park and recreation profession nationwide:
                                      Regional Parks. Regional parks are at least 50 acres in size and
                                       offer a wide range of amenities to attract the greatest range of users
                                       and interests within and outside of the city. Regional parks
                                       provide significant natural features and passive and active
                                       recreational features such as sports fields/courts, picnicking,
                                       fishing, hiking, and camping.
                                      Community Parks. Community parks are approximately 15 to 30
                                       acres in size with a service radius of 1 to 2 miles. Typical
                                       amenities include pools, lighted sports fields and courts, picnic
                                       facilities, hiking, play areas, restrooms, off-street parking, and
                                       service yards.
                                      Neighborhood Parks. Neighborhood parks are 5 to 15 acres in
                                       size with a service radius of ½ to 1 mile. Neighborhood parks are
                                       easily accessible by walking or bicycling to the surrounding

                                      Mini Parks. Mini-parks, pocket parks or play lots are less than 5
                                       acres in size with a service area of ¼ to ½ mile. Mini parks are
                                       easily accessible by walking or bicycling to the surrounding
                                       population. Typical amenities include court games, playground
                                       apparatus, picnic areas, passive green space, and off-street parking.

                                                                           8 Parks, Recreation, and Trails
Development and Parks
The City uses the State Quimby Act and its Development Code for fees
and land dedications as well as the Capital Improvement Program to
establish standards and schedules for acquisition and development of new
park or rehabilitation of existing parks and recreation facilities.
The Quimby Act allows the City to require dedication of land, impose
payment of fees in lieu, or a combination of both for neighborhood and
community parks and recreation purposes.
The City Development Code (Chapter 19.30) provides for the payment of
a fee for each new residential dwelling unit constructed. The fee is placed
in a specially designated fund and is used for acquisition and development
of new or improvement of existing neighborhood and community parks
and recreational facilities. The fee, which is imposed when a building
permit is issued, is based on the type of construction and a percentage of
its valuation.
The ordinance provides that in lieu of fees, the Mayor and Common
Council may grant credit for land and improvements that are dedicated in
fee to public recreation and park purposes. The amount of dedicated land
and any conditions are determined by mutual agreement between the City
and the dedicator.
Improvement of parklands is provided for through the City’s Capital
Improvement Program. Acquisition funding is limited and must compete
with funding needed for ongoing maintenance of existing facilities and
equipment as well as with other City needs. In addition to City funds,
federal and state grant programs provide funds for the purchase of new
parkland.
Park Standards
The City utilizes a park acreage standard of five acres per 1,000 residents.
This is one acre greater than the land required by the state’s Quimby Act,
which requires developers to provide land and/or fees for new parks based
on a standard of four acres per thousand residents. Based on the City’s
standard, 1,596.2 acres of total parkland are necessary to satisfy the
projected population at buildout.
With regard to types of parks these acreages are intended to accommodate,
no single set of accepted standards exist nationally or within the City.
Nevertheless, the National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA) has
City of San Bernardino                                                                          8-3

    published benchmark guidelines for communities to consider. These
    define acceptable ratios of per capita park space for local parkland
    including a proportion of neighborhood and mini-parks based on national
    averages. Regional parks, because of their variation in size and type, are
    not included. The standard for the neighborhood park portion is 1 to 2
    acres per 1,000 population and for mini-parks 0.25 to 0.50 per 1,000
    population. The standard for the community park is 2 to 3 acres per 1,000
    residents.
    To determine the amount and types of parks that will be needed to serve
    the population at buildout of the General Plan, population is projected as
    described in the Land Use Element. This projected need is then compared
    to the lands actually designated as parks on the Land Use Maps. In this
    manner, a surplus or shortfall is evident (see Table PRT-1).

    of 5 acres of parklands per 1,000 population.
    Using either the City’s parkland requirement or the NRPA standards, the
    City will experience a shortfall in required parkland at buildout if no
    additional parks are provided. As can be seen from this “snapshot” in
    time, at buildout of the General Plan there will be an approximate shortfall
8-4                                                                        City of San Bernardino

                                                                              8 Parks, Recreation, and Trails
of 1,368 acres of parklands based on the NRPA standards or 1,048 acres
based on the City’s parkland requirement unless additional park area can
be provided. It is important to note that buildout is based on current parks
and projected buildout and does not account for parks that may be
acquired by the City or provided in new subdivisions. For instance, at the
time of the writing of this General Plan, several mini or neighborhood
parks were in the planning stages in the Verdemont area. These were not
accounted for in these calculations. The projections also do not account
for the implementation of the policies of the General Plan, which are
intended to address this shortfall.
The projected shortfall in parks is lessened somewhat by the fact that there
are three regional parks totaling 158 acres that have active recreation
facilities, the many school sites in the City that are available for
recreational activities, special recreation facilities (community centers and
senior centers) and the presence of year-round passive and active
recreation opportunities in the nearby San Bernardino National Forest.
Existing Recreational Facilities
There are a total of 52 developed parks and recreational facilities in the
City including nineteen neighborhood, ten community, seventeen mini,
three regional parks and three special facilities. The parks contain a broad
range of facilities; including children’s play equipment, tennis and
volleyball courts, and athletic fields. The special facilities include
community buildings and senior centers. Table PRT-2 indicates the City
parks by type and size and Figure PRT-1 depicts the location of these
parks.
In addition to City parks, there are individual regional facilities such as the
Shandin Hills Golf Course, Arrowhead Country Club, and the San
Bernardino Golf Club, which are eighteen-hole courses. The planning
area also contains the Western Regional Little League
                                                                                     The Lytle Creek Park Community

the land, the City retains some rights for its usage when not used by the
Regional Little League program.
The City provides recreational services at the local schools, under a joint
resolution adopted by the Common Council and the school district. It
provides that schoolyard facilities will remain open in the daytime hours
after school for recreational use of the community. The City Parks,
Recreation, and Community Services Department operates a variety of
recreational programs on school grounds, including the Tiny Tot program,
City of San Bernardino                                                                                 8-5

    Senior Citizen leisure programs, and active and passive programs for all
    age groups including after school activities during the regular school year.
    For the use of school building facilities and pools, the City pays rental
    fees. The school district reserves the right for first priority for the use of
    all school areas.
    The City includes seven community centers that offer a variety of leisure
    and social activities for all ages and cultural interest such as youth and
    adult sports, summer and off track lunch program, teen and youth clubs,
    tutoring, arts and crafts, senior nutrition, family night, etc. The centers also
    act as a focal point for collaboration and partnership with other
    organizations and agencies to provide specialized services and resources
    such as the HeartSmart Program, ESL, teen pregnancy prevention
    programs, immunization, health screenings, food distribution, and
    Headstart.
    In addition to City facilities, the County Regional Parks system includes
    Glen Helen, Yucaipa, Lake Gregory, Cucamonga, Guasti, Prado, and
    Mojave Narrows, all within a range of approximately 10 to 40 miles of the
    City of San Bernardino. The nearest to the City is Glen Helen Park, which
    provides a multi-faceted recreation area for fishing, boating, picnicking
    and other activities for many City dwellers.

ABOUT MULTI-PURPOSE TRAILS AND
BIKEWAYS
Just as there are different types of parks for which to plan, there are also
different types of trails and bike paths for different uses. Our off-street
recreational trail system combines hiking, equestrian, and bike trails into
what we call Multi-Purpose trails. Our on-street trail system consists of
dedicated bike lanes along the pavement edge of streets. Pedestrian access
and recreation is provided through the City’s sidewalks and hiking trails.
Many of our trails are still in the planning stages, but our desire is to have
them completed.
Taken together, our off-street and on-street trails will provide a system
that interconnects our parks, schools, and civic facilities with each other
and with the surrounding area (see Figure PRT-2). The following multi-
purpose trails and bikeways are found San Bernardino:
        Primary Regional Multi-Purpose Trails. These multi-purpose
         trails serve an entire region and accommodate hiking, equestrian,
         and bicycle users. We have two Primary Regional Multi-Purpose
         trails: the Santa Ana River Trail and the Greenbelt Trail, which is
         located in the foothills adjacent to the City’s northern boundary.
        Regional Multi-Purpose Trails. These multi-purpose trails serve
         bicycle, pedestrian, and in some cases, equestrian users and
         provide regional connections. We have the Cajon/Lytle, the Mid-
         City, Sand Canyon, City Creek, and Loma Linda Connector trails
         in San Bernardino.
        Local Multi-Purpose Trails. These multi-purpose trails serve
         pedestrian, bicycle, and in some cases, equestrian users and
                                                                                     Examples of the types of off-
         provide connections within San Bernardino itself.                           street, multi-purpose trails we
                                                                                     desire in San Bernardino.
        Bicycle Routes. We have numerous existing and planned bicycle
         routes in our Community, both on and off-street. The Bikeway
         Facilities Master Plan, which was adopted in 1994, describes a
         process in which we will develop a safe and efficient network of
         bike paths for recreation and commuter use. The following
         system, which is derived from the State of California, categorizes
         bicycle facilities into the following three classifications:
         •    Class I Bikeways. A Class I Bikeway is a dedicated travel-way
              for bicyclists. The most common applications for Class I
City of San Bernardino                                                                                  8-11

          Bikeways are along rivers, canals, and utility rights-of-way,
          within college campuses, or within and between parks. They
          may also be provided as part of planned developments. Our
          Class 1 Bikeways are included in the Multi-Purpose Trails
          described above and share right-of-way with other users.
       •  Class II Bikeways. Class II Bikeways delineate the right-of-
          way assigned to bicyclists along roadways. Bike lane signs and
          pavement markings help define these “bike lanes.”
       •  Class III Bikeways. Class III Bikeways are shared facilities
          that serve either to provide continuity to other bicycle facilities,
          or designate preferred routes through high demand corridors.
          Bike routes are normally shared with motor vehicles on the
          street, or with pedestrians on sidewalks. In either case, bicycle
          use is secondary.
      Pedestrian Facilities. In addition to the planned and existing
       Multi-Purpose Trails described above, pedestrian circulation in San
       Bernardino is primarily provided for on our sidewalks, which are
       available on the vast majority of our improved streets.

ACHIEVING THE VISION
We acknowledge our current lack of trails and bikeways and our potential
deficit in our park space at buildout of the General Plan. However, we are
creatively addressing this issue and are creating a system of parks,
bikeways, trails, and recreation facilities that serve our needs and connect
different neighborhoods to the City and the region.
The Parks and Recreation Element is responsive to our Vision because it
represents our desires to:
        Realize a system of high quality recreation and community
         services for all segments of the population, especially youth and
         senior citizens;
        Expand our supply of public parks and trails in creative and
         effective ways to meet future demands;
        Develop a system of open spaces, bikeways, and trails to connect
         individual neighborhoods into the fabric of the entire community;
        Upgrade and maintain our recreational and trail facilities in a safe
         and functional manner;
        Utilize our significant opportunities to use non-developable open
         spaces for recreational uses (e.g. Cajon-Lytle creek washes, Santa
         Ana River, Devils Canyon, and other flood control areas);
        Realize one of Southern California’s extraordinary watershed
         features in the Santa Ana River as a recreational feature; and
        Continue to provide a rich slate of recreational programs.
City of San Bernardino                                                                            8-15

     GOALS AND POLICIES
     The following presents the goals and policies for parks and recreation
     related issues in the City of San Bernardino planning area.
     Recreational Facilities and Services to Meet
     Future Demands
     As described above, there is a potential shortfall of parklands to meet the
     future demands of the City. Not only does the amount of land needed to
     serve our recreational need to be acquired, but also parks need to be
     distributed evenly and designed to meet the needs of surrounding
     residents. In addition, new parks and recreation facilities need to be
     connected to the bicycle and trail network. To meet these goals, the City
     must aggressively find parklands and continue to work with developers
     through the project review process.
     As San Bernardino’s population continues to change, so will its needs for
     different types of parks and recreation programs. The challenge is to stay
     in touch with residents and use pro-active planning to be several steps
     ahead of them.
     Goal 8.1        Improve the quality of life in San Bernardino by
                     providing adequate parks and recreation facilities and
                     services to meet the needs of our residents.
     Policies:
     8.1.1           Establish a comprehensive parks master plan, which
                     accomplishes the following:
                     a. Establishes the standard of 5 acres of parkland for every
                         1,000 residents;
                     b. Establishes guidelines for the types and amounts of
                         recreational facilities and services necessary to
                         adequately serve future residents;
                     c. Defines park development standards based on types and
                         sizes of parks (mini, neighborhood, community,
                         regional) and their service area (e.g. Mini- ¼ to ½
                         service radius);
8-16                                                           City of San Bernardino

                                                                              8 Parks, Recreation, and Trails
                d. Describes the steps necessary to achieve the park
                    standards and guidelines;
                e. Defines existing and anticipated recreational needs
                    (based on population size, density, demographics, and
                    types of facilities);
                f. Identifies areas in need of new or expanded recreational
                    facilities and the types of facilities needed;
                g. Disperses park facilities and equipment throughout the
                    City to prevent an undue concentration at any location;
                    including sports fields, basketball courts, tennis courts,
                    swimming pools, picnic areas, and other facilities;
                h. Identifies appropriate park fees;
                i. Identifies potential locations and types of new or
                    expanded facilities; and
                j. Identifies potential funding sources. (PRT-1)
8.1.2           Provide a variety of park “experiences”, including those
                developed for intense recreational activity, passive open
                space enjoyment, and a mixture of active and passive
                activities. (PRT-1 and PRT-4)
8.1.3           Pursue the development of portions of the Santa Ana River,

Multi-Purpose Trails and Bikeways
As of 2003, there were no Class 1 bikeways in San Bernardino. We will
change this situation. Our goal is to realize a complete system of safe,
interconnected trails and bikeways that connect San Bernardino internally
and with our surrounding region.
City of San Bernardino                                                                             8-19

     Importantly, we want to do so in a cost effective and planned manner.
     Due to the developed nature of parts of our community and the cost
     involved in right-of-way acquisition, a concentrated effort should be made
     to develop safe dual use of existing roadways. The use of parks, drainage
     channels, and utility easements should also continue to be explored.
     Every trip starts with a pedestrian movement; however, pedestrians often
     have to compete for safe space. Pedestrian safety as well as amenable
     pedestrian environments are important quality of life factors in San
     Bernardino. Sidewalk access is sometimes reduced by the intrusion of
     various sidewalk impediments such as benches, newspaper boxes, signs,
     plantings, and garbage cans. It is important to have a safe pedestrian
     system that links commercial residential and open spaces land uses.

Funding
The provision of parks, trails, and recreational facilities and services
requires funding for acquisition, development, ongoing maintenance, and
ongoing programs. To promote the desired lifestyle, our recreational
programs must be adequately funded.

Chapter 9. Utilities
INTRODUCTION
Utilities serve as a functional base and provide access to resources our
community needs to thrive and remain a desirable place to live and
conduct business. The efficiency with which these services operate and
are provided ultimately can affect the quality of life for our residents or
the ability of businesses to thrive in our City. These essential utilities also
play a significant role in the protection and preservation of the safety and
welfare of the City from hazards such as flooding and fires. As the City’s
population grows and urban activity increases, additional investments in
capital improvements will be necessary to maintain a thriving community
and attract new investments or development. The Utilities Element
incorporates strategies to ensure the City maintains the ability to provide
and expand these basic services to its existing and future residents and
businesses.
Purpose
The Goals and Policies in this element are intended to maintain and/or
improve the level of utility services provided to existing and future
residents. The goals and policies governing utilities in San Bernardino are
also intended to ensure that utility services in the City keep pace with new
development. This element addresses the following topics:
        Wastewater Collection and Treatment,
        Water Transmission, Distribution, Storage, and Treatment,
        Storm Drains and Flood Control,
        Solid Waste Collection and Disposal,
        Electricity,
        Natural Gas,
City of San Bernardino                                                          9-1

           Telecommunications, and
           Geothermal Resources.
    Relationship to Other Elements
    The Utilities Element is not a state mandated element, but it is closely
    linked to several other elements including Land Use, Public Facilities and
    Services, Economic Development, Housing, and Safety. Any new land
    uses or developments will need to be served with adequate utilities, and
    the ability to provide utilities will allow businesses to thrive, which
    directly affects the economic vitality of the City. Geologic and seismic
    constraints identified within the City can also affect the way in which the
    City can provide services such as wastewater collection and treatment,
    water transmission, distribution and storage, and the construction and
    placement of storm drains and flood control facilities within the
    community.
    ACHIEVING THE VISION
    The Utilities Element helps to carry out the third component of the City’s
    Vision “Creating Opportunities for the Future.” As San Bernardino
    continues to develop, the City will need to enhance and expand utilities to
    meet the needs of residents and businesses. With strong infrastructure
    systems in place to support redevelopment and new development, San
    Bernardino can position itself to be a premiere place to live and work.
    The Utilities Element is responsive to our vision because it represents our
    desire to:
           Meet the utility needs of our citizens and businesses;
           Identify and address service needs/gaps so we can proactively
            attract desirable development;
           Ensure the safety of our businesses and residents through the
            construction and maintenance of necessary infrastructure and
            facilities; and
           Ensure new development pays for their fair share of new utilities.

                                                                                9 Utilities
GOALS AND POLICIES
The following goals and policies address the provision of utilities in the
City of San Bernardino planning area.
Wastewater Collection and Treatment
The sewer system plays a crucial role in ensuring that the community
remains clean, healthy, and enjoyable. Although most of the sewer system
is adequate for existing and future development, a number of areas will
require additional facilities to keep pace with future needs. The City’s
sewer system must be able to accommodate the quantity of wastes
generated by residents and businesses if San Bernardino is to continue to
grow and prosper.
Presently the City permits the limited use of septic tanks for developments
within its boundaries; typically in older portions of the City or on large lot
residential development such as:
        Northwest of Little League Drive;
        Portions of the Verdemont area with parcels larger than one (1)
         acre;
        Palm Avenue and Industrial Parkway Area;
        Cajon Boulevard and June Street Area; and
        Northwest of the Interstate 215/30 Interchange.
Any new septic systems must comply with the Santa Ana Regional Water
Quality Control Board’s minimum lot size requirements (Currently one-
half acre).
Water Reclamation
The San Bernardino Water Reclamation Plant (WRP) has been operated
by the City of San Bernardino Municipal Water Department since 1973,
and ensures that all water is properly treated prior to discharge into the
Santa Ana River. In March 1996, the cities of San Bernardino and Colton
wastewater treatment plants jointly opened the Rapid Infiltration and
Extraction (RIX) facility, where secondary-treated water undergoes the
final filtering and disinfecting process to produce wastewater that is
superior or equivalent to that produced by conventional filtration systems.
City of San Bernardino                                                         9-3

    The Water Department’s Water Reclamation Plant and Rapid Infiltration
    and Extraction (RIX) Facilities reclaim millions of gallons of water a day
    so it is ideal for many commercial and agricultural uses. This water can be
    used for things like industrial cooling systems, watering crops, and large
    scale landscaping such as at golf courses. Like the Department’s
    geothermal assets, reclaimed water is a valuable economic resource for the
    City. The reclaimed water is currently discharged into the Santa Ana River
    where it contributes to other existing water flows and adds to the habitat
    for several kinds of fish and birds. The Water Department sees this water
    as a commodity that can be used to the economic benefit of the Inland
    Empire and the City of San Bernardino in industry, agriculture, and
    landscaping.
    The water reclamation plant is a 33 MGD Secondary Treatment facility
    that serves a population of over 185,000 people in a service area that
    includes the cities of San Bernardino, Loma Linda, East Valley, San
    Bernardino International Airport, Patton State Hospital, and parts of San
    Bernardino County.
    The City of San Bernardino Municipal Water Department owns and
    operates the San Bernardino Water Reclamation Plant (SBWRP). The
    SBWTP treats residential and industrial wastewater generated in:
            The City of San Bernardino;
            City of Loma Linda; and
            East Valley Water District.
    Service area boundaries are depicted on Figure U-1.
    Wastewater Collection Facilities
    The City Public Works Department is responsible for the design and
    construction of wastewater collection facilities in the City. Operation and
    maintenance of wastewater collection facilities is the responsibility of the
    Public Services Department.
    Wastewater collection facilities within the planning area are owned and
    operated by four different entities:
            City of San Bernardino (Public Works and Public Services
             Departments);
            East Valley Water District (EVWD);
9-4                                                         City of San Bernardino

        San Bernardino International Airport and Trade Center; and
        The City of Loma Linda.
Wastewater collection is provided within the eastern portion of the
planning area by the East Valley Water District (Figure U-2), which
operates and maintains its own wastewater collection system. Wastewater
collected by the East Valley Water District is transported to the City’s
collection facilities prior to treatment at the San Bernardino Water
Reclamation Plant (SBWRP).
The City of Loma Linda operates and maintains a wastewater collection
system within the southern portion of the planning area (Figure U-2).
Wastewater collected within the service area of the City of Loma Linda is
ultimately conveyed to the City of San Bernardino’s wastewater collection
system prior to treatment at the SBWRP.

Goal 9.1        Provide a system of wastewater collection and
                treatment facilities that will adequately convey and
                treat wastewater generated by existing and future
                development in the City’s service area.
Policies:
9.1.1           Provide for the construction of upgraded and expanded
                wastewater collection and treatment improvements to
                support existing and new development, and to meet usage
                requirements and maximize cost efficiency, especially in
                areas where existing systems are deficient.
9.1.2           Maintain and replace existing wastewater collection and
                treatment facilities as necessary.
9.1.3           Require new development to connect to a master planned
                sanitary sewer system in accordance with the Department
                of Public Works' "Sewer Policy and Procedures". Where
                construction of master planned facilities is not feasible, the
                Mayor and Common Council may permit the construction
                of interim facilities sufficient to serve the present and short-
                term future needs.
9.1.4           Evaluate the City’s Sewer Collection System Master Plan
                and the Board of Water Commissioner's Master Plan for
                Wastewater Treatment Facilities as necessary to accurately
                determine which collection and treatment facilities will be
                needed to serve present and future growth in the City.
9.1.5           Review development proposals for projects within the
                City’s Sphere of Influence and request the County to
                disapprove any project that cannot be served with adequate
                public wastewater collection and treatment facilities. (U-1)
9.1.6           Ensure that any proposed septic systems comply with the
                Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board’s
                minimum lot size requirements, which are one-half acre as
                of 2005. (LU-1)

     Goal 9.2          Ensure that all wastewater collection and treatment
                       facilities are operated to maximize public safety.
     Policies:
     9.2.1             Provide for the monitoring of toxic or potentially toxic
                       businesses to prevent contamination of water and
                       wastewater.
     9.2.2             Require, when necessary, pre-treatment of wastewater from
                       industrial sources prior to treatment at the Water
                       Reclamation Facility.
     Water Transmission, Distribution, Storage, and Treatment
     The San Bernardino Municipal Water Department (SBMWD) provides
     domestic water for the City and unincorporated areas of San Bernardino
     County as well as back-up to the City of Loma Linda. Water service is
     provided for single-family, multiple-family, commercial, light industrial,
     governmental, and landscaping purposes. Other water agencies in the
     planning area include East Valley Water District on the east, Redlands
     Mutual, Loma Linda Municipal, Riverside, and Colton water providers to
     the south, and West San Bernardino and Rialto to the west. Figure U-2
     shows the service boundaries of the water providers in the planning area.
     Since the City has no jurisdiction over water supply, transmission,
     distribution, and storage facilities administered by other entities, this
     discussion addresses facilities owned and maintained by the City.
     Groundwater from the Bunker Hill Basin is the primary source of water
     supply for the SBMWD. It has the capacity to provide 70,000 acre-foot
     per year of water from groundwater and surface water sources. The basin,
     similar to a very large underground lake, is replenished naturally by local
     precipitation and by stream flow from rain and snowmelt from the San
     Bernardino Mountains.1 While groundwater is the principal source of
     supply in the planning area, other sources of water supply include: the
     State Water Project (SWP), the Santa Ana River, Mill Creek, and Lytle
     Creek.
     The SBMWD distributes more than 16.66 billion gallons of water to over
     151,000 residents in the City. The Department produces over 497 gallons
     per capita per day with the average consumption use reaching 330 gallons

plants with capacity of 50 million gallons per day, 32 reservoirs with a
total capacity of more than 100 MG of domestic storage water capacity, 27
chlorination facilities, and 66 booster pump stations.
An important aspect of our water program is conservation and recycling
and it is discussed in two places within this Plan: recycled water is
addressed above while water conservation is detailed in Chapter 13,
Energy and Water Conservation.
Goal 9.3        Provide water supply, transmission, distribution,
                storage, and treatment facilities to meet present and
                future water demands in a timely and cost effective
                manner.
Policies:
9.3.1           Provide for the construction of upgraded and expanded
                water supply, transmission, distribution, storage, and
                treatment facilities to support existing and new
                development. (LU-1 and U-4)
9.3.2           Maintain and replace existing water supply, transmission,

9.3.3           Require adequate water supply, transmission, distribution,
                storage, and treatment facilities to be operational prior to
                the issuance of certificates of occupancy. (LU-1)
9.3.4           Monitor the demands on the water system and, as
                necessary, manage development to mitigate impacts and/or
                facilitate improvements.
9.3.5           Impose limits on new water hook-ups, if necessary, to
                comply with available domestic water supply.
9.3.6           Request the Board of Water Commissioners to evaluate the
                Water System Master Plan, as necessary, to accurately
                determine which water facilities will be needed to serve
                present and future growth in the City.

                Management Practices (BMPs) in all developments:
                •   Increase permeable areas, utilize pervious materials,
                    install filtration controls (including grass lined swales
                    and gravel beds), and divert flow to these permeable
                    areas to allow more percolation of runoff into the
                    ground;
                •   Replanting and hydroseeding of native vegetation to
                    reduce slope erosion, filter runoff, and provide habitat;
                •   Use of porous pavement systems with an underlying
                    stone reservoir in parking areas;
                •   Use natural drainage, detention ponds, or infiltration
                    pits to collect and filter runoff;
                •   Prevent rainfall from entering material and waste
                    storage areas and pollution-laden surfaces; and
                •   Require new development and significant
                    redevelopment to utilize site preparation, grading, and
                    other BMPs that provide erosion and sediment control
                    to prevent construction-related contaminants from
                    leaving the site and polluting waterways. (LU-1)

     Solid Waste
     Solid waste collection within much of the City and a portion of the
     unincorporated planning area is provided by the City’s Department of
     Public Services. Solid waste collection in the remainder of the planning
     area is provided by private haulers through franchise agreements with the
     County. Solid waste collected in the planning area is disposed of at
     landfills in Colton and Fontana owned and operated by the County of San
     Bernardino.
     When the Colton and Mid Valley Landfill eventually close, solid waste
     generated in the City will be transported to the San Timoteo Landfill also
     owned and operated by the County of San Bernardino. The Mid-Valley
     Landfill is projected to have approximately 40 years of capacity left.
     Regional planning for solid waste issues is conducted by the San
     Bernardino County Solid Waste Advisory Committee governed by the
     County Solid Waste Management Plan. The City has a representative
     serving on the Solid Waste Advisory Committee. Any future solid waste
     facilities, such as transfer stations and/or landfills, must be incorporated in
     the County Solid Waste Management Plan.

     generation is critical. State law currently requires that local jurisdictions
     divert at least 50% of their solid waste from landfills through
     conservation, recycling, and composting. Like all California communities,
     the City of San Bernardino is required to comply with State regulations.
     The challenge for San Bernardino, as well as communities throughout the
     state, is to continue to find diversion, recycling, and reuse strategies
     instead of relying on sanitary landfills as the primary method of managing
     solid waste. As the region grows, it becomes more difficult to site or
     expand landfills due to the unpopularity of these types of facilities.

                disposed of in area landfills, to conserve energy resources,
                and be consistent with the County Solid Waste
                Management Plan and State law.
9.5.4           Continue to support implementation of regional recycling
                programs through participation in the County Solid Waste
                Advisory Committee, the County Solid Waste Management
                Plan, and appropriate State programs.
9.5.5           Develop and participate in local recycling programs.
9.5.6           Develop and implement a program of public education
                regarding the benefits of recycling.
Electricity
Electrical service in the planning area is provided by the Southern
California Edison Company (SCE). SCE owns, operates, and maintains
both above ground and underground facilities in the planning area. Most
of SCE's facilities are located in the street right-of-way. SCE will extend
electrical service into unserved areas pursuant to SCE's current Rules and
Rates. The efficient use of energy and the building design/construction of
buildings with energy efficiency in mind are vital to our future. Please see
Chapter 13, Energy and Water Conservation, for relative discussion and

Natural Gas
Natural gas service is provided by the Southern California Gas Company.
The gas company owns, operates, and maintains underground gas lines in
most of the public streets. Extension of service is based on the initiation of
a service contract whose policies and extension rules are on file with the
California Public Utilities Commission.
Goal 9.7        Ensure an adequate supply of natural gas is available
                to support existing and future land uses within the City
                at a project level.

                install on-site pipeline connections to distribution facilities
                underground, unless such undergrounding is infeasible due
                to significant environmental or other constraints. (U-2)
Telecommunications
Telephone and Cable Television Service
Telecommunications is defined as communicating audio, video, and data
from one point to another. Since telecommunications includes voice, data,
and image transmission, this section includes policies relating to
telephones (voice transmission), fiber optics (data), and cable television
(data and image). Telephone service in San Bernardino is provided by
Verizon and SBC.
Verizon and SBCare regulated by Title 14 of the City’s Municipal Code,
which address the granting of franchises.
Cable Television is not legally classified as a “utility” and is not regulated
by the California PUC. Consequently, regulation of cable television is the
responsibility of local jurisdictions. The City’s Telecommunications
Division is responsible for franchise supervision and negotiation, in
addition to subscriber complaint resolution. Each of the cable providers
has been interlinked with the Telecommunications Division equipment for
emergency broadcasts. Adelphia Cable, Mountain Shadows Cable, and
City of San Bernardino                                                          9-21

     Charter Communications Cable channels service the City of San
     Bernardino and surrounding communities.
     Goal 9.8       Ensure the operation and maintenance of
                    telecommunications systems to support existing and
                    future land uses within the City.
     Policies:
     9.8.1          Provide for the continued development and expansion of
                    telecommunications systems including cable and, as
                    feasible, fiber optics, for entertainment, education, culture,
                    information access, two-way communication between
                    government and residents and businesses, and other similar
                    purposes.
     9.8.2          Require that all new developments underground
                    telecommunication facilities, unless such undergrounding is
                    infeasible due to significant environmental or other
                    constraints. (U-2)
     9.8.3          Cooperate with, and encourage public utilities to provide a
                    fiber optics network in the City that is linked to regional
                    systems.
     Geothermal Resources
     Use of geothermal resources results in substantial energy savings and
     generates revenue for the City. Approximately 90 to 100 geothermal wells
     and springs have been identified in the San Bernardino area. The
     geothermal wells and springs are concentrated in the Commerce Center,
     Central City, and the Tri-City areas (Figure U-3).
     The San Bernardino Municipal Water Department (SBMWD) is operating
     two (2) geothermal production wells which can pump 4,300,000 gallons of
     hot water per day. The usable supply of geothermal water, however, is
     much greater than what is currently used.
9-22                                                          City of San Bernardino

The SBMWD uses geothermal resources to provide heat to a number of
City, County, and State agencies, as well as private businesses. Use of
geothermal heat is resulting in a substantial savings on winter heating
bills.
Goal 9.9        Use the City’s available geothermal resources as an
                alternative to natural gas and electricity.
Policies:
9.9.1           Provide for the continued development and expansion of
                geothermal energy distribution lines. (U-3)
                Provide public funding to expand the existing geothermal
                production and distribution system. (U-3)

Utilities Infrastructure Financing
The City’s responsibilities not only pertain to its ability to provide services
at appropriate levels, they also necessitate the exploration of ways to fund
existing and future facilities to keep pace with the City’s growth.
Ensuring that appropriate financing mechanisms are in place is one way
we can plan for the infrastructure needs of the future.
Goal 9.10       Ensure that the costs of infrastructure improvements
                are borne by those who benefit.
Policies:
9.10.1          Require that new development proposals bear the cost to
                improve wastewater collection and treatment facilities,
                water supply transmission, distribution, storage, and
                treatment facilities, and storm drain and flood control
                facilities as necessitated by the proposed project. This shall
                be accomplished either through the payment of fees, or by
                the actual construction of the improvements. (LU-1)
9.10.2          Collect adequate amounts of fees and charges to fund the
                operation/maintenance of existing facilities and to construct
                new facilities.
9.10.3          Review utility, capacity, and infrastructure fees, as well as
                development, acquisition of service, and monthly service
                charges on an annual basis to ensure that adequate amounts
                of fees and charges are collected to fund the operation/
                maintenance of existing facilities and to construct new
                facilities.
9.10.4          Provide public funding support for expansion and
                upgrading of public utilities and infrastructure when
                improvements will provide substantial public benefit to the
                City.
9.10.5          Allow the formation of benefit assessment districts and
                community facilities districts, where appropriate, in which
                those who benefit from specific improvements pay a pro
                rata share of the costs.
