Introduction
The City of Half Moon Bay recognizes the importance of providing adequate housing
opportunities while maintaining a high standard of living for all citizens in the community. As an
element of the Half Moon Bay General Plan, and in accordance with the California Government
Code, this Housing Element presents a comprehensive set of housing policies and programs to
address identified housing needs for the years 2015 to 2023. Based on assessments of housing
needs, constraints, and available resources, as well as input from the community, these policies
and programs are designed to increase and diversify housing options in terms of affordability,
type, and location, while encouraging the preservation and improvement of the existing housing
supply. This document is intended to guide the City of Half Moon Bay as it seeks to meet the
housing needs of its residents as well as its share of regional housing needs.
Purpose
The housing element is one of the seven required general plan elements mandated by California
state law. State law requires that each city and county adopt a housing element that conforms to
the detailed statutory requirements established in Article 10.6 (Sections 65580 to 65589.8) of the
Government Code, and which must be updated every five to eight years. According to state law,
all housing elements must identify and analyze existing and projected housing needs; state goals,
policies, quantified objectives, financial resources, and scheduled programs for the preservation,
improvement, and development of housing; identify adequate sites for housing, including rental
housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, and emergency shelters; and make adequate
provision for the existing and projected needs of all economic segments of the community. To
ensure compliance, each housing element is submitted to the California Department of Housing
and Community Development (HCD) at specified times during the update cycle for mandatory
review.
This Housing Element update corresponds to the planning period of January 31, 2015 to January
31, 2023, and the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) projection period of January 1,
2014 to October 31, 2022. It replaces the Housing Element corresponding to the planning period
of 2007 to 2014 that was adopted by City Council and certified by HCD in 2010.
                                                                                                  i
Plan Half Moon Bay
Relationship to the General Plan
California state law requires that all general plan elements be compatible and internally
consistent. This Housing Element update is consistent with the City of Half Moon Bay’s General
Plan and Local Coastal Program (LCP), as well as the Land Use Plan and the Noise, Circulation ,
Safety, and Park and Recreation elements that constitute those documents. The policies and
programs contained in the Housing Element are intended to support the development of decent
and suitable housing in areas designated as appropriate by the city’s established land use policy.
The housing sites inventory included in the Housing Element is a demonstration of the city’s
potential to accommodate the RHNA through development on residential-and commercial-
zoned sites, and does not propose changes to land use designations or policy as established in the
other elements of the General Plan or LCP. Additionally, the Housing Element is consistent with
the city’s residential growth allocation program as established by Measure D and the LCP, and
does not affect the number of residential units that could be developed in the city under that
program.
In September 2013, Half Moon Bay began a comprehensive update of its General Plan, LCP, and
Zoning Code (which is the Implementation Plan of the LCP). This process is expected to continue
through 2016, and may result in changes to land use designations and zoning. Zoning
amendments proposed in this Housing Element will be developed as part of the General Plan and
LCP update process along with any other zoning changes necessitated by the update, and will be
submitted for adoption accordingly. The General Plan and LCP update may result in changes to
land use designations, land use policy, and zoning districts that could potentially alter the number
and locations of potential housing sites. Though specific policy and zoning changes have not yet
been determined, the update will aim to meet the housing needs and desires of the community
while also ensuring the availability of adequate sites to meet the RHNA. The Housing Element,
General Plan, and LCP, will be checked for consistency throughout the update process, with any
necessary updates to the housing sites inventory of the Housing Element to take place at the time
of adoption of the updated General Plan and LCP.
Contents
Following this introduction, the Housing Element consists of the following chapters:
     1. Housing Needs Assessment – This chapter includes an analysis of population and
         employment trends, the city’s fair share of regional housing needs, household
         characteristics, and the condition of the housing stock.
     2. Constraints – This chapter reviews governmental constraints including land use controls,
         fees, and processing requirements, as well as non-governmental constraints, such as
         construction costs, availability of land and financing, physical environmental conditions,
         and units at-risk of conversion that may impede the development, preservation, and
         maintenance of housing.

                                                                                          Introduction
    3. Resources – This chapter identifies resources available for the production and
         maintenance of housing, including an inventory of land suitable for residential
         development and discussion of federal, state, and local financial resources and programs
         available to support the city’s housing goals.
    4. Effectiveness of Previous Housing Element – This chapter evaluates the City’s
         accomplishments under the 2010 Housing Element in order to determine the City’s
         progress in implementing that housing element and to assess the effectiveness and
         appropriateness of the goals, objectives, and policies of that housing element.
    5. Public Participation – This chapter describes the community outreach activities that
         informed the programs in this Housing Element, including the Housing Forum, meetings
         with City Council and the Planning Commission, 21 Elements outreach, and
         correspondence with community members.
    6. Housing Plan: Goals, Policies, and Programs – The Housing Plan establishes goals,
         policies, and programs to address the city’s housing needs, and was developed based on
         the assessments and public input discussed in the preceding chapters. The Housing Plan
         commits the City to the following five goals, which are supported with specific policies,
         implementing programs, and quantifiable objectives.
             •    Goal 1: Conserve and Improve Half Moon Bay’s Existing Neighborhoods and

1         Housing Needs Assessment
To successfully plan for housing needs, the demographic and socioeconomic variables of the
community must be assessed. This section discusses the components of housing need, which
include population characteristics, household characteristics, employment, and housing stock
conditions.
This section relies on data from the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, California
Department of Finance (DOF), Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), San Mateo
County Association of Realtors, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),
various City documents, and other sources, as well as data and information compiled by 21
Elements, a working group of all of the local governments in San Mateo County that assembled to
develop background data and consolidate approaches to Housing Element updates throughout
the county. Unless otherwise specified, the data in this section is specific to the City of Half Moon
Bay.
1.1 Population Characteristics
POPULATION GROWTH
The population of Half Moon Bay has increased significantly since the city’s incorporation in
1959, growing from 1,957 persons in 1960 to 11,842 persons in 2000. In 2011, there were 11,228
persons in Half Moon Bay. ABAG’s current projections show a small increase in population of
414 persons from 2011 to 2040, an increase of approximately 4 percent. Compared to countywide
(22 percent), Half Moon Bay is projected to grow at a much slower rate during the same period.
Table 1-1 below identifies projected population growth from 2000 through 2040.

AGE
While overall age distributions between the primary age categories (child, adult, senior) are
similar between Half Moon Bay, the county, and the state, Half Moon Bay has a higher number of
persons in the seniors category and a lower number of children. The City of Half Moon Bay has a
higher median age (42.9) than San Mateo County (40.3) or the state (35.1).
In Half Moon Bay adults of ages 25 to 44 and 55 to 64 account for the two largest population
cohorts, 24 and 17 percent respectively. There was significant growth in the older adults
categories with persons of ages 65 to 74 increasing by 71 percent and persons of 85 years of age or
older more than doubling from 80 to 191 persons. All age cohorts under 55 saw a decrease in
population between 2000 and 2011. This may be due to high housing costs that are not affordable
to many young adults when they leave home, or to couples starting a family that want to purchase
a home. Table 1-2 compares the age distribution between the city, San Mateo County, and the
state, and Table 1-3 shows the age characteristics for Half Moon Bay in 2000 and 2011.

HOUSEHOLD SIZE
According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, the average household size in Half
Moon Bay is approximately 2.64 persons. Based on this data and that from the last three decennial
censuses, the average household size in Half Moon Bay has gradually decreased since 1990. Table
1-12 identifies average household size from 1990 to 2011. However, more recent data from the
2014 California Department of Finance shows an average household size of 2.8, indicating that
this trend may be reversing.
Renter-occupied households are, on average, larger than owner-occupied households with
average household sizes of 2.85 and 2.55, respectively. This is the reverse of the situation in San
Mateo County as a whole, where renter households are smaller on average than owner
households. The majority of households in Half Moon Bay are one and two person households.
Table 1-13 identifies household size by tenure.

The majority of households in Half Moon Bay earn in excess of $50,000 per year. The incidence of
households earning less than $35,000 per year is higher among renter households (28 percent)
than owner households (15 percent). Nearly half (48 percent) of the households in Half Moon Bay
earn in excess of $100,000 per year, and more than one out of four households earns more than
$150,000 per year. In 2011, the median income for an owner household ($113,375) was 70 percent
higher than that of a renter household ($66,439). Table 1-16 identifies household income by

OVERCROWDED HOUSEHOLDS
Overcrowding is defined as a situation where there is more than one person per room (e.g., living
room, dining room, family room, bedroom, office, etc.) in an occupied housing unit.
Overcrowding can result from a low supply of affordable and adequate housing. Households that
are unable to afford larger housing units may be forced to rent or purchase housing that is too
small to meet their needs. In 2011, 281 households (7 percent) were living in overcrowded
situations with more than 40 percent of these households—143 households—living in severely

1.4 Housing Stock Characteristics
RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION TRENDS
The majority of Half Moon Bay’s housing stock—62 percent—was constructed between 1960 and
1989, with the decade from 1970 to 1979 having the largest amount of construction of any decade.
Only 12 percent of the housing stock was constructed prior to 1959. Table 1-18 identifies the
number of housing units in Half Moon Bay by decade built. The rate of construction in Half
Moon Bay has decreased over the last two decades. While the change in the housing market has
affected Half Moon Bay, there are constraints to housing production beyond the City’s control,
such as the permitting process associated with the Coastal Zone designation and oversight of the
California Coastal Commission, and restrictions imposed by the US Army Corps of Engineers,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and California Department of Fish and Game on environmentally
sensitive habitat areas. The primary constraint for residential development is the availability of
domestic water, which is regulated by the Coastside County Water District. Residential
development is classified as non-priority development by the California Coastal Act and by Half
Moon Bay’s certified Local Coastal Program.
The City issued a total of 230 privately-owned residential building permits between 2007 and
2013. Of these, 80 units were single family (35 percent), six were in 2-unit structures (3 percent),
and 144 (63 percent) were in structures of five or more units. Table 1-19 identifies housing
permitted by number of units from 2007 through 2013.

COASTAL ZONE – NEW HOUSING AND DEMOLITIONS
No low- or moderate-income units have been replaced or demolished since 1982. During the
1982 through 1993 period, five rental units were converted to condominiums and were required
to remain affordable to moderate-income households. Since 1993, no additional low- or
moderate-income units have been converted. There is no requirement for replacement housing.

TYPE OF HOUSING STOCK
Most homes in Half Moon Bay are single-family detached homes. Single-family attached homes,
such as townhomes and condominiums, account for 11 percent of the housing stock. Mobile
homes account for 10 percent of housing. Duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes make up 9 percent
of the housing stock and multi-family complexes with five or more units compose the remaining
7 percent of housing. The composition of the housing stock by housing type is illustrated in Chart

CONDITION OF THE HOUSING STOCK
Without physical inspection, it is difficult to gauge the condition of the housing stock. Housing
indices, without physical inspection, can generally be used to determine units that are potentially
substandard. These substandard housing indices include units lacking complete kitchen facilities,
units lacking complete plumbing, and units constructed before 1960 that have not had significant
maintenance. Table 1-20 identifies the number of units in each substandard index. Based on the
2007-2011 American Community Survey, less than 1 percent of all housing units had inadequate
plumbing or kitchen facilities, and approximately 12 percent of housing units were built before
1960. Those units lacking complete plumbing were built after 1960. Thus, a total of approximately
557 housing units in Half Moon Bay may be substandard or require significant maintenance.

VACANCY
Vacancy trends in housing are analyzed using a "vacancy rate" which establishes the relationship
between housing supply and demand. For example, if the demand for housing is greater than the
supply, then the vacancy rate is probably low and the price of housing will most likely increase.
According to "Raising the Roof, California Housing Development Projections and Constraints,
1997-2020," the desirable vacancy rate in a community is considered to be 5 percent to provide
adequate housing choice. Generally, when the vacancy rate drops below 5 percent, the demand for
housing exceeds the supply of housing. Subsequently, prospective buyers and renters may
experience an increase in housing costs.

There are different types of housing vacancies. Some housing units are vacant while on the market
for sale or for rent, others may be seasonally or recreationally occupied, while others may have
been sold or rented but are not yet occupied. Sixty-one percent of the vacant units were available
for sale or rent, and approximately 38 percent of vacant units were homes for seasonal,
recreational, or occasional use. Table 1-21 identifies vacancy rates and Table 1-22 identifies types
of vacancies.

FOR SALE HOUSING MARKET
Beginning in 2008, the sub-prime loan crisis led to a decline in the residential real estate market.
The resulting foreclosures and short sales increased available housing inventory and led to a
decrease in housing prices between 2008 and 2012. Over the past four years in Half Moon Bay,
single-family home median sales prices have fluctuated from $725,000 to $849,950 as shown in
Chart 1-2, while the median sales prices of common interest development (CIDs) have increased
from a low of $365,000 in 2010 to a high of $450,600 in 2013. During the last quarter of 2013, the
median sales price of a single-family home in Half Moon Bay was $982,500. During this same
                                                                                                1-13

Income Groups
The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) publishes
household income data annually for areas in California. Table 1-25 shows the maximum annual
income level for each income group adjusted for household size for San Mateo County. The
maximum annual income data is then utilized to calculate the maximum affordable housing
payments for different households (varying by income level) and their eligibility for federal
housing assistance.

Housing Affordability
Table 1-26 identifies the maximum monthly housing costs affordable to households in Half Moon
Bay by income group. Affordability is based on a household paying up to 30 percent of their
monthly income toward housing. Compared to the rental rates in Table 1-24, the median rent in
Half Moon Bay is not affordable to extremely low-, very low-, or low-income households, but are
affordable to moderate-income households. The lower range of rents, particularly studio, one-
bedroom, and two-bedroom units are affordable to low-income households, but there are limited
units available at these rates. Moderate- and above moderate-income households can afford the
mid-range and upper range of rents.

Table 1-27 shows the maximum rents and sales prices that are affordable to extremely low-, very
low-, low-, and moderate-income households. Affordability is based on a household spending 30
percent or less of their total household income for shelter. Affordability is based on the maximum
household income levels established by HCD (Table 1-25). Maximum affordable sales price is
based on the following assumptions: 4.5 percent interest rate, 30-year fixed loan, 50 percent
annual salary as down payment, 1 percent property tax, and 0.5 percent homeowners insurance.
In order to provide an idea of affordable housing costs by income group, affordable home sales
prices are estimated for one- and two-person households, which are the two largest household
size groups in Half Moon Bay, and also for four- and six-person households for reference (see
Table 1-27). Median home sales prices are out of reach for extremely low-, very low-, and low-
income households. However, moderate-income households can afford the median
condominium prices. Above moderate-income households can afford condominiums; however,
even some above moderate-income households are priced out of the single-family home market.
The median single-family home sales price is not affordable to all above moderate-income
households; households at the lower end of the scale (120 to 150 percent of the area median
income [AMI]) can afford the median condominium sales price but not the median single family
home sale price.

Overpayment
Overpayment compares the total housing cost for a household to the ability of that household to
pay. Overpayment is specifically defined as monthly shelter costs in excess of 30 percent of a
household’s income. Shelter cost is defined as the monthly owner costs (mortgages, deed of trust,
contracts to purchase or similar debts on the property and taxes, insurance on the property, and
utilities) or the gross rent (contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities).
According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, 38 percent of owner households and
48 percent of renter households are overpaying for housing. This is likely due to the increased
difficulty in gaining entry-level single-family homeownership. Lower-income households have
much higher overpayment rates than moderate- and above moderate-income households.
Extremely low-income households, those earning up to 30 percent of the AMI, overpay at the
highest rate, 76 percent. Of the extremely low-income group, renter occupied households have
the highest rate of overpayment, with 82 percent of extremely low-income renter households
paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing and 60 percent paying more than half of
their income for housing. Table 1-28 identifies overpayment by income group and tenure,
illustrating that those households in the lower income categories are those that overpay the most.

1.5 Jobs-Housing Balance
The jobs/housing balance is a meaningful way to gain a sense of how many people will commute
to work, to or from where they will commute, and how far they will have to commute. An
unbalanced jobs-housing ratio implies employees will be spending more time on roadways that
may be better spent with their families, at work, or recreationally. Further examination of the
jobs/housing balance would identify types of industries that may be needed in a city in the future,
future trends of employment, future wage indicators, future housing needed to match the
projected incomes of new jobs, etc. and be a study in and of itself, beyond the scope of a housing
element. The jobs/housing balance is the ratio of jobs in a city compared to the number of
housing units in that city. If the jobs/housing ratio is greater than 1, then the city is likely to
import workers. If the ratio is less than 1, then the city is likely to export workers. However, a
better indicator of the jobs/housing balance may be the number of persons who work within their
city of residence compared to the number of housing units. A perfect jobs/housing ratio would be
1-18
                                                                                  Housing Element
                                                                          Housing Needs Assessment
the number of employed households working within a city equal to the number of housing units
in that city. However, there is no perfect scenario for a city and what works in one area may not
work in another.
In 2010, Half Moon Bay had a jobs/housing ratio of 1.2:1, meaning that there were 1.2 employed
persons for each housing unit. This ratio is projected to increase in future years (Table 1-29). A
more accurate indication of a jobs/housing balance may be the ratio of persons working in their
place of residence compared to the number of housing units. According to the 2007-2011
American Community Survey, there were 5,711 employed persons and 4,491 housing units in the
city, a ratio of 1.3 employed workers per housing unit, which indicates an imbalance in the
jobs/housing ratio. Table 1-8 indicates 64 percent of residents traveled more than 15 minutes to
their place of work. Commute times and the relationship of employed workers to housing (1.3:1)
versus jobs to housing (1.2:1) implies a lack of employment opportunities in the city, as most
residents have to commute to outside the city for employment.

1.6 Affordable Housing Inventory
There are eight affordable housing complexes in Half Moon Bay, which provide a combined total
of 99 very low- and 113 low-income senior units and 33 very low-, 43 low- (seven of these are
low/moderate), and 2 moderate-income family units. Details on each affordable housing project,
including number of units by bedroom size and affordability level as well as length of affordability
restrictions, are provided in Table 1-30.
AT RISK HOUSING UNITS
This section analyzes existing or potential “at-risk” assisted housing developments, which are
eligible to convert to market-rate housing over the next 10 years. The conversion may be due to
the termination of a subsidy contract, mortgage prepayment, or expiration of use restrictions.
“Assisted housing developments” are multi-family rental housing projects that receive or have
received government assistance under federal programs listed in the Housing Element Law, state
and local multi-family revenue bond programs, local redevelopment programs, the federal
Community Development Block Grant Program, or local in-lieu fees.
At Risk Assessment
Databases of federal and state agencies were reviewed for affordable housing projects, and each
property was assigned a level of risk of conversion, shown in Table 1-30. There are three levels of
risk: At-Risk, Lower Risk, and Low Risk. At-Risk properties are at risk of converting to market
                                                                                               1-19

Plan Half Moon Bay
rate when they are within five years of the end date of the most valuable subsidy or rent
restriction. Lower Risk properties are at lower risk of conversion when their most valuable
subsidy or rent restriction is scheduled to terminate within six to ten years of the current date.
Properties are designated low risk when their subsidies and/or rent restrictions will expire more
than 10 years in the future. If a property is owned by a nonprofit organization, the risk of
conversion to market is one level lower than it otherwise would be. While this is not always
accurate, on average the risk of conversion is lower when a property is owned by a nonprofit
whose mission is typically to maintain the affordability of apartments for lower-income
households.

At-Risk Units in Half Moon Bay
In Half Moon Bay, there are no affordable housing projects considered At-Risk. All affordable
housing developments are identified as Lower or Low Risk. The affordability restrictions affecting
the majority of Half Moon Bay’s affordable housing will not expire within 10 years of 2014.
Furthermore, all but one of the properties are owned by non-profit housing providers committed
to maintaining the affordability of existing units. The Nerhan Duplex is the only property
considered Lower Risk, as its affordability restrictions expire in eight years. Though the
affordability restrictions of Ocean View Plaza will expire in 2017, the project is owned by a non-
profit housing provider, which lowers the risk of conversion. The California Housing Partnership
Corporation maintains a database of units at risk of conversion. As January 2014, Ocean View
Plaza was listed with no risk of conversion, and no other units were identified as At-Risk in Half
Moon Bay.
Preserving or Replacing Affordable Units
Cities may take a number of approaches to preserving At-Risk housing, including rental subsidy
commitments, and replacement through new construction. One way to estimate the amount of
any potential subsidies is to compare the HUD-established Fair Market Rent (FMR) for San
Mateo County,1 which equals the rent for Project-Based Section 8 properties, to actual market
rents found in the city. Where the FMR is less than actual market rents, the owner realizes less
income from the property than he or she would without affordability restrictions. Thus, a subsidy
intended to incentivize a property owner to continue to contract out his or her buildings as
Project-Based Section 8 properties once mortgage restrictions expire would cover the gap between
FMR and actual market rent. Table 1-31 shows the gap per unit per month between FMR and
1
  FMRs are defined by HUD as the 40th percentile rent drawn from the distribution of rents of all units occupied by
   recent movers.
                                                                                                                      1-21

Plan Half Moon Bay
actual market rent in Half Moon Bay. The gap ranges from $137 per unit per month for a one-
bedroom unit to $1,363 per unit per month for four bedrooms. If the property owner were willing
to enter into a rental subsidy agreement with the City or some other entity that would subsidize
the rents on behalf of the lower-income renters, this would require an ongoing annual payment of
approximately $1,644 to $16,356 per unit. Currently, there are no units considered At-Risk in
Half Moon Bay. If the City were to implement a rental subsidy program, it would need to identify
potential funding sources. The City could also work to negotiate purchase of At-Risk properties
by area non-profit housing providers.

As an alternative to providing ongoing monthly rent subsidies, the City or another entity could
attempt to purchase or develop replacement housing units that could be rented to the displaced
lower-income households at similar rents. In order to make this possible, it would be necessary to
provide a subsidy for the purchase or construction of the replacement units that would be the
equivalent of the per-unit annual preservation cost for each unit to be constructed, in current
dollars. The initial investment in existing or new housing units that would be necessary to allow a
reduction in annual rent for each unit by the per unit annual preservation cost can be estimated
by calculating the net present value of mortgage payments equal to the monthly per-unit gap per
month, on the theory that if the owner (e.g., a non-profit housing organization) can reduce its
required mortgage payments by that amount per month, it could then reduce the rents that it
needs to charge its tenants by a similar amount. Hence, as shown in Table 1-31, based on a 30-
year mortgage term at 7.5 percent interest rate, it would take an initial investment of
approximately $19,400 to $193,200 per unit to reduce the monthly debt service by the necessary
amount.
This analysis likely understates the true cost of preserving or replacing the units, as it would be
quite difficult to assemble an appropriate combination of subsidies to acquire the property or
develop a similar project with the same mix of unit sizes and affordability levels. However, at this

time, none of the city’s affordable units are considered at-risk of conversion, and are therefore not
in need of replacement.
Resources Available to Assist in Preservation
The costs of preserving or replacing housing units that currently rent below market rates are
substantial. However, the City has access to a range of different funds that could potentially assist
in a preservation effort, including the following:
     •   Mortgage Revenue Bonds
     •   State Grant Programs, such as the Affordable Housing Innovation Program and the
         Transit Oriented Development Housing Program
     •   Federal Grant Programs (Section 202 funds only- Supportive Housing for the Elderly)
     •   Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC)
     •   HUD Section 8 “Mark to Market” Program
The City may also elect to use a portion of the Affordable Housing Fund based on the in-lieu fees
from the Below Market Rate program to assist in the preservation of At-Risk housing. Key
partnerships in the effort to preserve affordable housing include those with HUD as well as local
affordable housing providers and property managers such as the Mid-Peninsula Housing
Corporation, Lesley Senior Communities, and Mercy Housing, Inc. Additionally, numerous other
organizations working to preserve affordable housing units are listed in a database maintained by
the State Department of Housing and Community Development.
1.7 Future Housing Needs
A Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) is mandated by the State of California (Government
Code [GC], Section 65584) for regions to address housing issues and needs based on future
growth projections for the area. The RHNP is developed by the Association of Bay Area
Governments, and allocates a “fair share” of regional housing needs to individual cities and
counties. The intent of the RHNP is to ensure that local jurisdictions address not only the needs
of their immediate areas but also that needs for the entire region are fairly distributed to all
communities. A major goal of the RHNP is to assure that every community provides an
opportunity for a mix of affordable housing to all economic segments of its population.
The County of San Mateo, in partnership with all 20 cities in the county, formed a subregion and
designated the City/County Association of Governments (C/CAG) as the entity responsible for
coordinating and implementing the subregional Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)
process. C/CAG created its own methodology, issued draft allocations, and handled the revision
and appeal processes. They also issued final allocations to members of the subregion. These final
allocations were incorporated into ABAG’s San Francisco Bay Area Housing Needs Plan (HNP).
ABAG’s current RHNP schedule is from 2014 through 2022. Pursuant to the provisions of the
HNP and to adequately provide affordable housing for all income groups, specifically very-low-
and low-income groups, the City will need to plan to accommodate 240 new units from 2014
                                                                                                 1-23

Plan Half Moon Bay
through 2022. The City will need to identity sites to accommodate 83 new extremely low-, very
low-, and low-income units, 36 moderate-income units, and 121 above moderate-income units
through 2022. Table 1-31 summarizes Half Moon Bay’s allocation. Requirements related to
identification of adequate sites for the unaccommodated portion of the allocation from the
previous Housing Element cycle are discussed in Chapter 2.

Household groups with special needs include seniors, mentally and physically disabled persons,
large family households, female-headed households, agricultural workers, and homeless persons.
Households with special housing needs often have greater difficulty in finding decent and
affordable housing. As a result, these households may experience a higher prevalence of
overpaying, overcrowding, and other housing problems. Special housing needs are projected
through 2022. The special housing needs are a subset of the overall housing needs identified in
Table 1-31 above, unless otherwise noted.
SENIORS
Seniors are considered persons age 65 or older in this Housing Element. However, it must be
noted that some funding programs have lower age limits for persons to be eligible for their senior
housing projects. Seniors have special housing needs primarily resulting from physical disabilities
and limitations, fixed or limited income, and health care costs. Additionally, senior households
also have other needs to preserve their independence including supportive services to maintain
their health and safety, in-home support services to perform activities of daily living, conservators
to assist with personal care and financial affairs, public administration assistance to manage and
resolve estate issues and networks of care to provide a wide variety of services and daily assistance.
In 2011, 1,758 persons in Half Moon Bay (16 percent) were 65 years and older. Of the senior
population, 1,114 were 65 to 74 (63 percent), 457 were 75 to 84 (26 percent), and 187 were 85 or
older (11 percent). From 2000 to 2011, the 85 years and older age group increased significantly by

Most senior households own their home, 83 percent; 17 percent of senior households rent. The
incidence of renting decreases with age for the senior population; a higher percentage of
householders 75 and older rent than do householders in the 65 to 74 age bracket. Table 1-33
summarizes senior households by age and tenure.

Slightly over half of senior households, 55 percent, are in the lower income groups and one out of
seven senior households are in the extremely low-income group. Table 1-34 summarizes senior
households by income group. Four percent of senior households were at or below the poverty
level in 2011. In 2011, the median income of senior households (65 years and older) was $55,385,
which is 42 percent less than the median household income overall. Projected senior growth and
income levels indicate that a portion of the city’s regional housing needs allocation should be
developed for senior households.

Senior Housing
There are four senior housing complexes in Half Moon Bay that provide 212 very low- and low-
income units. A search of the State of California Community Care Licensing Division (CCLD) in
March 2014 identified no residential care facilities licensed through CCLD in Half Moon Bay.
More details regarding affordable housing projects in Half Moon Bay are provided in Table 1-30
above.
     •    Coastside Senior Housing, 925 Main Street – 39 Very Low-Income Units
     •    Half Moon Village, 3 Bloom Lane – 60 Very Low-Income Units
     •    Lesley Gardens, 701 Arnold Way – 63 Very Low-Income Units
     •    Ocean View Plaza, 1001 Main Street – 50 Low-Income Units
Half Moon Village is part of a two-phased development project currently being undertaken by
MidPen Housing that will result in a total of 160 senior affordable units, including the
replacement of the 60 existing units.
Other Senior Resources
The Coastside Adult Day Health Center serves approximately 150 seniors in Half Moon Bay per
year. The Coastside Adult Day Health Center offers a range of senior services including nursing,
therapy, case management, group activities, respite for caregivers, daily hot lunches, and
wheelchair-accessible transportation. Thirty hot lunches are provided to seniors on a daily basis.
Referral services are provided for housing and to assisted living facilities, typically those in the
Montera area (Three Bells, Seton, and Cedar Lane).
Senior Coastsiders provides a range of services to senior households. They serve approximately 48
Half Moon Bay seniors per day through the hot lunch program and another through the Meals on
Wheels program. Senior Coastsiders provide home repairs to about 36 residents each year.
Human Investment Project (HIP) operates a Homesharing Program that matches individuals
with rooms to share with other individuals looking for housing. Elderly households are one of the
more typical clients.
DISABLED PERSONS
A "disability" includes, but is not limited to, any physical or mental disability as defined in
California Government Code Section 12926. A "mental disability" involves having any mental or
psychological disorder or condition, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome,
emotional or mental illness, or specific learning disability that limits a major life activity. A
"physical disability" involves having any physiological disease, disorder, condition, cosmetic
disfigurement, or anatomical loss that affects body systems including neurological,
immunological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory, speech organs, cardiovascular,

reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin and endocrine. In addition, a
mental or physical disability limits a major life activity by making the achievement of major life
activities difficult, including physical, mental, and social activities and working.
Physical, mental, and/or developmental disabilities could prevent a person from working, restrict
a persons' mobility or make caring for oneself difficult. Therefore, disabled persons often require
special housing needs related to potential limited earning capacity, the lack of accessible and
affordable housing, and higher health costs associated with disabilities. Additionally, people with
disabilities require a wide range of different housing, depending on the type and severity of their
disability. Housing needs can range from institutional care facilities to facilities that support
partial or full independence (i.e., group care homes). Supportive services such as daily living skills
and employment assistance need to be integrated in the housing situation. The disabled person
with a mobility limitation requires housing that is physically accessible. Examples of accessibility
in housing include widened doorways and hallways, ramps, bathroom modifications (i.e., lowered
countertops, grab bars, adjustable shower heads, etc.) and special sensory devices including smoke
alarms and flashing lights.
The 2008-2012 American Community Survey defined six types of disabilities including hearing,
vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and independent living. A disability is defined as a
mental, physical, or health condition that lasts over six months and persons may have more than
one disability. According to the 2008-2012 American Community Survey there were 890 people
reporting one or more disabilities in Half Moon Bay. Table 1-35 identifies disabilities by type of
disability and Table 1-36 identifies disabled persons by employment status.

In 2000, 496 households had one or more disabled persons. On average, a household with
disabled members had 2.9 disabled persons per household. Disabled renter households reported a
higher incidence of housing problems, such as overcrowding, overpayment, or lacking full
kitchen or plumbing facilities than disabled owner households. Thirty-three percent of disabled
households were in the extremely low- or very low-income brackets, 22 percent in the low-

Developmentally Disabled Persons
According to Section 4512 of the California Welfare and Institutions Code a “developmental
disability” is a disability that originates before an individual reaches adulthood (18 years old),
continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for
that individual. This includes intellectual disabilities (characterized by significantly sub-average
general intellectual functioning), cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term also includes
disabling conditions found to be closely related to other intellectual disabilities or that require
treatment (i.e., care and management) similar to that required by individuals with intellectual
disabilities, however it does not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in
nature.

Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a conventional
housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a group living environment
where supervision is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an institutional
environment where medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because developmental
disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally
disabled is the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
independence as an adult.
The California Department of Developmental Services (DDS) supports approximately 216,000
children and adults with developmental disabilities and 29,000 infants at risk of developmental
delay or disability throughout the state. Services are provided through state-operated
developmental centers and community facilities, as well as through contracts with 21 nonprofit
agencies called regional centers. The Golden Gate Regional Center headquartered in San
Francisco serves individuals with developmental disabilities in San Francisco, San Mateo, and
Marin counties. The regional center is a private, nonprofit community agency that contracts with
local business to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental disabilities and
their families.

There are a number of housing types appropriate for people living with a development disability:
rent-subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-family homes, inclusionary housing,
Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The
design of housing-accessibility modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the
availability of group living opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are
important in serving the needs of this group. Incorporating ‘barrier-free’ design in all new multi-
family housing (as required by California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially important
to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special consideration should also be
given to the affordability of housing, as people with disabilities may be living on a fixed income.

Resources for the Disabled
The Center for Independence of the Disabled provides supportive services for disabled persons.
The center’s programs include independent living skills, counseling and peer counseling, money
management, housing modification assistance, and work incentive.
The Golden Gate Regional Center provides individual programs for disabled persons based on
their stated goals and desired outcomes. In general, assistance is provided for life skills, job skills
and how to plan for independent living.
West Bay Housing Corporation (WBHC) advocates for policies that promote development of
affordable housing for persons with developmental disabilities. They also develop affordable
housing for disabled persons.
The city’s zoning laws, practices, and policies related to disabled households are addressed in
Chapter 3, Constraints.
LARGE FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS
Large family households are defined as households of five or more persons who are related. Large
family households are considered a special needs group because there is limited supply of
adequately sized housing to accommodate their needs. The more persons in a household, the
more rooms are needed to accommodate that household. Specifically, a five-person household
would require three or four bedrooms, a six-person household would require four-bedrooms, and
a seven-person household would require four to six bedrooms.
In Half Moon Bay, 509 households, 12 percent of all households, have five or more persons. Of
the large households, 61 percent own their home and 39 percent rent. Large households that rent
have a disproportionate rate of housing problems; “any housing problem” includes overcrowding,
units lacking complete kitchen facilities, and units lacking complete plumbing facilities. Almost
all large renter households, 87 percent, experience some type of housing problem. However, both
large renter and owner households are not disproportionately cost burdened. Table 1-39
compares housing problems and cost burdens for large renter and owner households with all
other households.
Large families can have a difficult time finding housing units large enough to meet their needs. In
Half Moon Bay, there appears to be an adequate amount of housing units available to provide
units with enough bedrooms both for larger households that own and rent their home. Table 1-40
identifies the number of large households by household size versus the number of large owner
and rental units.

SINGLE-PARENT AND FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS
Single-parent households are households with children under the age of 18 at home and include
both male- and female-headed households. These households generally have a higher ratio
between their income and their living expenses (that is, living expenses take up a larger share of
income than is generally the case in two-parent households). Therefore, finding affordable,
decent, and safe housing is often more difficult for single-parent and female-headed households.
Additionally, single-parent and female-headed households have special needs involving access to
daycare or childcare, health care, and other supportive services.
While the majority of households in Half Moon Bay are either married couple or single-person
households, 14 percent of family households are headed by a single male or single female. There
are 172 male heads of household with no wife present (6 percent) and 212 female heads of
household with no husband present (7 percent). An additional 4 percent of multi-person, non-
family households are headed by females. Table 1-41 identifies single-parent households by
gender of the householder and presence of children.

Fourteen percent of families with children are under the poverty level. Nine percent of female-
headed households, 25, are under the poverty level. An additional 27 single-parent households are
projected by 2014. Of these, 19 are estimated to be single female-headed households with children
present.

AGRICULTURAL WORKERS
In 2011, 192 residents (3 percent) were employed in occupations related to agriculture, forestry,
fishing/hunting, and mining (Tables 1-6). Census data does not identify how many of these
workers are employed only in farm industries and not fishing, forestry, or mining. In the county
as a whole, there is a significant amount of agricultural production. Chart 1-3 identifies crop
production by crop type within the County in 2012. In 2001, the County Agricultural
Commissioner reported that 70 percent of the 166 farms in the County were located in the coastal
area. However, the majority of these are located in the unincorporated county and are not in the
city limits. Half Moon Bay has no control over agricultural activities or farmworker housing in
the unincorporated area. The City did support development of a 160-unit farmworker housing
project, Moonridge I and II, adjacent to the city. Moonridge I and II provides 2-, 3-, and 4-
bedroom units affordable to households earning up to 60 percent of the area median income and
employed in the agricultural industry.

ABAG has projected that agriculture and natural resource jobs in Half Moon Bay will remain
static at 200 jobs from 2005 through 2035. As the city continues to urbanize and develop, it is not
anticipated that farming, including field crop and floriculture, will increase significantly within
the city. Based on this information, there will not be a need for additional farmworker housing in
the city.

HOMELESS PERSONS
Homeless individuals and families have perhaps the most immediate housing need of any group.
They also have one of the most difficult sets of housing needs to meet, due to both the diversity
and complexity of the factors that lead to homelessness, and to community opposition to the
siting of facilities that serve homeless clients.
In January 2013, the San Mateo County Human Services Agency’s Center on Homelessness
conducted a countywide survey to identify the number of homeless persons sheltered and on the
street. The survey was conducted by census tract; therefore, data for Half Moon Bay may include
persons counted outside of city boundaries. A total of 114 homeless persons were identified for
Half Moon Bay, all of whom were unsheltered. The 2013 survey shows an increase in
homelessness since the 2007 survey, which identified 83 total homeless persons, including 74
unsheltered. Table 1-42 shows details for selected survey characteristics.

The number of homeless persons in San Mateo County increased from 2,074 in 2007 to 2,281 in
2013. At least 94 percent of unsheltered homeless adults surveyed were single individuals or
couples who are not living with children, 71 percent were men, and 80 percent had at least one
disability. The most commonly cited disabilities were alcohol or drug problems, physical
disability, chronic health problems, and mental illness. Characteristics of unsheltered homeless
persons in San Mateo County are summarized in Table 1-43.

Sixty-five percent of unsheltered homeless persons countywide were “chronically” homeless,
meaning that they were disabled and had been homeless for longer than 12 months or four times
in the past three years, an increase from 46 percent in 2011. According to the survey, the rise in
chronic homelessness in the county is likely due to high unemployment, rising rents and lack of
affordable housing. Since 2007, the County and members of the Urban County/Housing Our
People Effectively (HOPE) Consortium (including Half Moon Bay) have funded and
implemented numerous programs to meet the needs of homeless individuals, such as the
Homeless Outreach Team, the opening of the Vendome Hotel, and the Mental Health Services
Act (MHSA) master-leasing program.
The 2009 countywide homeless survey conducted by HOPE indicated that the very high rates of
disability and unemployment among homeless people are the main reasons for homelessness,
with 39 percent of those surveyed indicating that their alcohol or drug use was a main factor
leading to their loss of housing and 15 percent listing mental illness. Many respondents also
indicated that disability was a barrier to employment, with 32 percent citing alcohol or drug use
and 22 percent mental health problems as reasons they were not employed. Among those
surveyed, 25 percent reported loss of a job or non-payment of rent as the main reason they
became homeless, while 37 percent indicated that their mental illness or substance use was the
main cause. The survey also highlighted the strong barriers that homeless people face in securing
employment. When asked what was keeping them from becoming employed, 22 percent said lack
                                                                                                        1-35

of a permanent address, 21 percent indicated lack of affordable transportation, 15 percent cited
lack of a phone number, and 14 percent noted a lack of needed tools and clothing. Notably, only 3
percent indicated they did not want to work.
The County Consolidated Plan addresses homeless needs from 2013/14 through 2017/18 for all
jurisdictions in the Urban County and HOME Consortium, which includes Half Moon Bay. The
Consolidated Plan identifies that there is no unmet need for emergency shelter or transitional
housing for either homeless individuals or families, but that there is a need for an additional 71
beds of permanent supportive housing countywide.
Of the 112 homeless persons identified in the 2013 survey, none were being served by existing
shelter options for the homeless in Half Moon Bay. In Half Moon Bay, the Catholic Workers
program operates a house that provides two bedrooms for homeless persons and also distributes
motel vouchers. Half Moon Bay does not provide a broad range of supportive services,
particularly job placement and training, necessary for most homeless persons and households to
achieve self-sufficiency.
Beginning in 2014, the Homeless Outreach Team (HOT), a countywide program, initiated
operations in the Coastside area to address chronic homelessness. Developed by InnVision
Shelter Network, a local housing shelter provider, HOT seeks to engage the most difficult to serve
homeless individuals, many of whom suffer from addiction and other debilitating mental
illnesses. As part of its Coastside expansion, the HOT added outreach professionals for Half
Moon Bay. The program works in conjunction with the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office and
Coastside HOPE staff to identify the target homeless population to be served by the local HOT
team.
In addition to persons and households that are homeless, there are also households at risk of
becoming homeless. Loss of a job, dissolution of a marriage or long-term relationship, onset of or
increase of the severity of a disability, and increase in rental rates or other housing costs are all
potential causes of a person becoming homeless. Households that would be most affected by any
of these conditions are households that are experiencing a severe cost burden. In Half Moon Bay,
14 percent of owner households and 18 percent of renter households pay more than 50 percent of
their income toward housing. Extremely low- and very low-income households experience the
highest incidences of overpayment (Table 1-44) and are at risk of becoming homeless or
temporarily homeless.

In Half Moon Bay, homeless persons should be housed primarily in emergency shelters due to the
lack of supportive services, such as job training, medical care, substance abuse counseling, mental
counseling, and financial independence classes. However, if transitional or supportive housing for
homeless or households at-risk of homelessness is developed, the overall need for emergency
shelter would decrease by a commensurate amount. There is an additional need for increased
motel vouchers and a network of supportive services to assist at-risk households. Program 3-6 in
the Housing Plan would revise the Zoning Ordinance to allow emergency shelters, transitional
housing, and supportive housing consistent with the requirements of state law (Government
Code Section 65583(a)(4,5). Emergency shelters would be allowed by right in the Commercial
General zoning district, which has multiple sites with capacity to meet the city’s homeless needs.
Available Homeless Resources
The Coastside Opportunity Center provides a food pantry, rental assistance, and motel vouchers.
The Catholic Worker House provides on-site homeless housing, weekly distribution of food and
necessities (e.g. diapers, underwear, socks, etc.). The Kelley Avenue Catholic Worker House,
which re-opened in August 2008, has two bedrooms for the homeless.
The Human Investment Project offers a range of services, including home sharing which pairs
unrelated persons in housing units, self-sufficiency assistance for low-income families
transitioning to self-reliance, home equity conversion counseling and services for senior
households, and acquisition and rehabilitation of property to expand the pool of affordable
housing for low-income persons and families in San Mateo County.

2        Constraints
New housing development can be affected by economic forces in the private market as well as
regulations and policies imposed by public agencies. These constraints can limit the production of
housing and increase its cost, and can also affect the maintenance and/or improvement of existing
housing. Governmental and non-governmental constraints that can affect the housing market
and stock in Half Moon Bay are discussed below. Where constraints to the maintenance,
improvement, and development of housing for all income levels are identified, the Housing Plan
will identify ways to reduce or overcome these constraints, where feasible.
2.1 Governmental Constraints
Governmental regulations, while intentionally regulating the quality and safety of development in
the community can also, unintentionally, increase the cost of development and thus the cost of
housing. These governmental constraints include land use controls, such as policies, standards,
codes, and requirements, as well as development fees, processing procedures, and other exactions
required of developers.
Land use controls may limit the amount or density of development, thus increasing the cost per
unit. They may also require improvements and/or off-site mitigation that increase the cost of
development. Processing procedures, including review by multiple agencies and permitting
requirements, may delay the approval process and increase the cost of development.
FEDERAL AND STATE
Federal and state programs and agencies play a role in the imposition of non-local governmental
constraints. Federal and state laws, including the federal Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act,
Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and state Alquist-Priolo Earthquakes Act,
Clean Air Act and California Endangered Species Act as well as many other laws and policies
regulate development and the decisions surrounding development. For example, many areas in
Half Moon Bay provide habitat for special-status species (as discussed under environmental
constraints), and development that affects special-status species and sensitive habitat is regulated
by a variety of agencies, depending on the resource, that may include the California Department
of Fish and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Protection
of habitat for special-status species can reduce the developable area of a site, increase the cost of
development—particularly if a habitat conservation plan, off-site conservation, long-term
monitoring of species and/or relocation of species is required—and lengthen the entitlement

government, and their effects on housing costs cannot be effectively mitigated by the Housing
Element.
California Environmental Quality Act
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) was developed to protect the quality of the
environment and the health and safety of persons from environmental effects. Discretionary
projects are required to be reviewed consistent with the requirements of CEQA to determine if
there is potential for the project to cause a significant adverse effect on the environment. As part
of the CEQA review of a project, its potential to affect the environment is considered based on
local policies, as well as federal and state regulations, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water
Act, and Endangered Species Act. Depending on the type of project and its potential effects,
technical traffic, noise, air quality, biological resources, and geotechnical reports may be needed.
If potential adverse effects can be mitigated, a mitigated negative declaration is required. If
potentially adverse effects cannot be mitigated, an environmental impact report is required. These
documents have mandated content requirements and public review times. Preparation of CEQA
documents can be costly and, despite maximum time limits set forth in the Public Resources
Code, can extend the processing time of a project by a year or longer and may result in significant
revisions to a project.
Prevailing Wage Laws
Public works projects and affordable housing financed through the use of public funds are
required to pay prevailing wages, which create a significant cost impact on the construction or
rehabilitation of affordable housing units for low- or moderate-income persons and the
infrastructure to support such housing. The rehabilitation of certain qualifying affordable housing
units for low- or moderate-income persons is exempted from this requirement. SB 972 provides
for exemptions from prevailing wage requirements for the construction or rehabilitation of
privately-owned residential projects.
Land Use Controls
California Coastal Requirements
In order to approve development within the California Coastal Zone, a local government within
the Coastal Zone boundary must prepare a Local Coastal Program (LCP) that consists of a Land
Use Plan, zoning ordinance and map, and policies and actions that meet the requirements and
implement the provisions of the California Coastal Act. The California Coastal Commission
(CCC) reviews the LCP to determine its consistency or inconsistency with the requirements of the
Coastal Act. As set forth in Sections 30512 and 30512.2 of the Coastal Act, this is an
administrative review, allowing the CCC to impose requirements on the local government in
order achieve the basic goals of the Coastal Act and substantial conformity with the Coastal Act
requirements relevant to LCPs. Once the Coastal Commission’s requirements are accommodated
and the review is final, the CCC is required to make findings that the LCP is consistent with the
Coastal Act and certify the LCP. After certification, the development review authority is returned
to the local government.

Statutory Conflicts
Some of the Coastal Act’s statutory requirements do inevitably conflict with the statutory
requirements of the state’s planning and zoning laws. For instance, the Government Code
requires the City to provide for its fair share of the regional housing needs, while the Coastal Act
places significant restrictions on new development. Most local governments that are within the
Coastal Zone also have land that is not within the Coastal Zone. These agencies are able to shift
the regional housing needs burden to those areas that are less restricted. The City of Half Moon
Bay does not have this benefit; rather it is restricted to trying to accommodate its housing needs
within the constraints of the Coastal Act. The next section, describing local constraints, contains
more detail on specific policies that are intended to support the requirements of the Coastal Act,
but which constrain the City’s ability to accommodate new housing within its jurisdiction.
Constraints on City Approvals
The city’s LCP consists of the Land Use Element of its General Plan (Land Use Plan) and Title 18
of the city’s Municipal Code (Implementation Plan). The LCP is prepared in accordance with the
state’s planning and zoning laws as well as with the Coastal Act, and any amendments require
certification by the CCC. This is a significant constraint on the City’s ability to revise land use
designations and make changes to its General Plan and Zoning Code in order to accommodate
housing needs.
LOCAL
Local Coastal Program/Land Use Element
The entire City of Half Moon Bay is located within the Coastal Zone. The city’s LCP was certified
in 1993, allowing the City to regulate development within its segment of the Coastal Zone, subject
to appeal to the CCC in specified locations. The Coastal Act mandates the contents of the LCP,
and the CCC must certify any amendments to the existing LCP Land Use Plan land use
designations, Zoning Code (LCP Implementation Plan), and Zoning Map (LCP Implementation
Plan Map).
Residential development requires a Coastal Development Permit (CDP) to be issued by the City.
Single-family homes are permitted in the R-1 and R-2 zoning districts with the issuance of a CDP.
The residential designations in the LCP include: Low Density Residential, Medium Density
Residential, High Density Residential, Mobile Home Parks, and Planned Development.
Residential Land Use Designations
Low Density Residential
The intent of this designation is to provide for single-family residential development at relatively
low overall densities, although clustering of homes, including both detached and attached
dwellings, may be permitted and may result in higher densities on specific sites or parcels. Where
such designations coincide with the Planned Development District designation, the intent is that
the specified density should be applied on a district-wide basis, rather than to specific parcels or
sites.
                                                                                                 2-3

Plan Half Moon Bay
Medium Density Residential
This designation is intended to apply primarily to areas that are already partially developed and
have potential for infill development at densities comparable to those already existing. It is
intended to be consistent with existing zoning for single-family development with minimum lot
sizes ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 square feet. Detached and attached single-family dwellings and
duplexes are permitted. It is noted that a duplex permitted on a 5,000-square foot lot would have
two units per 5,000 square feet.
High Density Residential
This designation is intended to apply to areas suitable for, and generally already partially
developed with, multi-family development or high-density single-family development, generally
consistent with existing zoning for multi-family development with permitted development as
high as one dwelling unit for every 1,500 square feet of lot area.
Planned Development
The Planned Development designation is given to generally large, undeveloped parcels and areas
suitable for residential use, with possible inclusion of neighborhood recreational facilities,
commercial recreation, and office/industrial uses. The purpose of the Planned Development
designation is to prevent piecemeal development and to re-plan old subdivisions by requiring that
the entire area or parcel be planned as a unit. The use of flexible and innovative design concepts is
encouraged. The LCP identifies specific guidelines for each Planned Unit Development (PUD)
area, including number of residential units allowed. The LCP requires each PUD site to be
planned as a unit; preparation of specific plans may be required when parcels comprising a PUD
site are in separate ownerships.
A description of the status of approved and proposed residential development in the PUDs is
provided in Chapter 4: Resources, in the discussion of available sites. As described in Chapter 4,
the City Council has approved various projects in the PUD areas. However, the amount of
development approved by the City Council has been reduced by the Coastal Commission as part
of its consideration of appeals of Coastal Development Permits or through settlement agreements.
Residential Growth Limitation
In Half Moon Bay, residential growth is limited to, in any particular year, the number of dwelling
units that would result in an increase of 1 percent (with an additional 0.5 percent for units in the
designated Downtown Area) of the city’s population as of January 1 of that year. This residential
growth limitation was incorporated into the LCP by amendment after the passage of the Measure
D growth ordinance in 1999 and subsequent certification by the Coastal Commission in 2009. A
more detailed discussion of the limitation can be found later in this chapter, in the section titled
Residential Growth Ordinance.

Local Coastal Program Policies
In accordance with the Coastal Act, the city’s LCP sets forth policies related to coastal access and
recreation, the protection of environmentally sensitive habitat areas, the safety of the community,
the preservation of visual resources and agriculture, and the provisions for adequate
infrastructure. An overview of these policies is provided below.
Coastal Access and Recreation: The California Constitution guarantees the public’s right of
access to all beach areas below the mean high tide line. The LCP reinforces this right through
Policy 2-5, which prohibits structures within 15 feet of a beach accessway or the boundary of a
public shoreline recreation area.
Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas-Marine and Water Resources: The Coastal Act
establishes policies for the protection of areas that are designated as Environmentally Sensitive
Habitat Areas, including the marine environment and freshwater resources. The LCP establishes
local policies that are consistent with the Coastal Act. For instance, Policies 3-3 through 3-5
prohibit any development that would have a significant adverse impact in sensitive habitat areas,
and constrains development on adjacent sites. Policies 3-7 through 3-13 address riparian
corridors and associated buffer areas, in which development is limited. Policies 3-14 through 3-20
seek to protect the habitat functions of sand dunes and sea cliffs from development. Policies 3-21
through 3-36 address the protection of rare, endangered, and unique species and their habitat
from any development.
Hazards: There are policy provisions in the Coastal Act that minimize risks to life and property
from various natural hazards. The LCP includes policies in accordance with these provisions.
Policy 4-3, for example, restricts land divisions and new structures in proximity to the edge of a
cliff or bluff in order to provide a safe living environment. Policy 4-7 restricts new development
within a flood hazard area, which is generally described as not less than 100 feet of either side of
the centerline of a creek.
Visual Resources: Scenic and Visual Resources are to be considered and protected as a
requirement of the Coastal Act. This requirement is carried out in the LCP. Policy 7-1 seeks to
protect the scenic qualities visible within 200 yards of Highway 1. Policy 7-2 restricts development
on blufftops to minimize impacts to public viewsheds. Policy 7-9 restricts development that is
within or adjacent to certain plant communities. Policy 7-10 restricts hillside development in
areas visible from Highway 1 and Highway 92 to maintain the natural appearance of the hillsides.
Agriculture: It is the intent of the Coastal Act to maintain the maximum amount of Prime
Agricultural land in such use to assure the protection of the area’s economy and significant
coastal resources. The LCP bolsters this intent with Policies 8-2 through 8-5, which prohibit
cancellation of Williamson Act contracts on agricultural land prior to the contract’s expiration,
thus prohibiting development on land under such contract. Policy 8-6 also prohibits development
in areas designated Open Space Reserve until such time that there are no remaining infill
opportunities within the city.
Public Works: Chapter 10, Public Works, of the LCP sets forth policies to address water supply,
sewer, and roadway systems. Capacity for water and sewer service is reserved for priority coastal
uses identified by the Coastal Act, including coastal-dependent land uses, essential public services,
                                                                                                   2-5

Plan Half Moon Bay
basic industries, and recreation and visitor-serving land uses. Public works policies encourage
increased water supply and wastewater treatment capacity and improvements to the roadway
system only to the levels necessary to serve development allowed under the LCP.
Implementation of Local Coastal Program
The City’s experience has been that the CCC’s level of review in the local entitlement process is
often more than administrative. The CCC review period for a project is typically lengthy, and the
CCC imposes conditions on projects that generally result in development at a lesser intensity than
allowed under the certified LCP. The CCC imposes fees on projects, such as in-lieu traffic fees,
and has reduced the number of units approved by City Council. The CCC promotes a lot
retirement program, which has required new development to retire a commensurate amount of
density as that which is being built. For example, a 25-unit project could be requested to fund the
retirement of development rights on 25 existing lots (e.g., the lots would be purchased and
permanently restricted for open space uses or to remain in an undeveloped condition). The lot
retirement program has resulted in higher fees for projects that raise the overall price of
development, a reduction in the number of sites available for residential development, and
restrictions on development of privately-owned lots located in the same area as retired lots
because of the open space restrictions. The following are examples of projects that have been
constrained by CCC review or requirements:
     •   As described in Chapter 4, in 1999 the City Council approved the Wavecrest
         development, planned a mix of uses, and proposed 279 housing units, including 54 Below
         Market Rate units. The CCC considered appeals against the project and, during CCC
         review, the number of units in the project was reduced, commercial uses removed, and a
         number of new conditions imposed, including retirement of lots. After an extensive wait,
         revisions to the project, and on-going controversy, the developer sold the property to the
         Peninsula Open Space Trust as open space.
     •   The City Council’s approval of 197 units on the Pacific Ridge site was appealed to the
         CCC, which reduced the project size to 126 units. Following litigation, the Settlement
         Agreement with the Coastal Commission further reduced development potential to 63
         homes, and requires payment of in-lieu cumulative traffic fees of $45,000 per home (fee
         to be used by City to retire development rights on existing lots), and Terrace Avenue
         signalization and widening. The Settlement Agreement requires the City to seek to amend
         the LCP to include a lot retirement program.
Summary of Constraints Related to LCP and CCC
Coastal Development Permits issued within the Coastal Commission Appeals Jurisdiction of the
Coastal Zone can be appealed to the CCC, meaning that the City does not have final land use
authority throughout its own jurisdiction. The City’s decisions may be amended or revoked by
the CCC. CCC involvement can result in lengthy delays and reductions in development potential.
The CCC may require lot retirement or other restrictions that are not in the LCP and can reduce
the level of development that is permitted by the LCP. The ability of the CCC to override the
City’s land use decisions results in uncertainty regarding land use approvals and also means that,
while the City can make efforts to accommodate the Regional Housing Needs Allocation, the
CCC can severely limit the City’s ability to actually accommodate it.

Zoning Code
The city’s Zoning Code identifies five residential districts and three other districts that allow
residential development. Table 2-1 summarizes the uses allowed under each district.
Development standards for each district are identified in Table 2-2.
The residential zoning districts provide appropriately located areas for residential development
that are consistent with the General Plan and LCP. The residential districts include:
    •    Single-Family – R-1, single-family residential zoning district,
    •    Two-Family – R-2, two-family residential zoning district, and
    •    Multi-Family – R-3, multi-family residential zoning district.
Additionally, four commercial zoning districts allow residential uses with the issuance of a use
permit by the Planning Commission. These include:
    •    Commercial Downtown (C-D) – This district establishes a range of uses and
         development standards that maintain and are consistent with the historic patterns and
         pedestrian scale of development within the historic downtown.
    •    Commercial Residential (C-R) – This district provides a transition zone between the
         active commercial district and single-family residential areas. Development is limited to
         residential, low intensity professional offices, and semi-public uses.
    •    Commercial General (C-G) – This district guides the orderly development of commercial
         areas designated for the development of a full range of retail, service, commercial and
         professional office businesses serving both residents and visitors.
    •    Commercial Visitor Serving (C-VS) – This district designates recreational commercial
         areas that serve the needs of visitors attracted to coastal recreation, and emphasizes
         access, coastal resources, and neighborhood character. Single-family dwellings are
         allowed with the issuance of a use permit; multi-family dwellings are not allowed.
                                                                                                 2-7

Plan Half Moon Bay
The Zoning Code classifies the following types of residential uses, meaning that these are the only
types of residential uses that may be permitted in a zone (please note that 1 through 5 are
considered residential uses and 6, Residential Care-General, is classified under public and semi-
public uses):
     1. Accessory or second dwelling unit – an attached or detached residential dwelling unit.
     2. Group Residential – Shared living quarters without separate kitchen or bathroom
         facilities for each room or unit. This classification includes boarding houses and private
         residential clubs, but excludes residential hotels or motels.
     3. Multi-Family Residential – Two or more dwelling units on a site. This classification
         includes manufactured homes.
     4. Residential Care, Limited – Twenty-four hour non-medical care for six or fewer persons
         in need of personal services, supervision, protection, or assistance essential for sustaining
         the activities of daily living. This classification includes only those services and facilities
         licensed by the State of California. Note: This type of facility is commonly termed a small
         group home.
     5. Single-Family Residential – Buildings containing one dwelling unit located on a single lot.
         This classification includes manufacture homes.
     6. Residential Care, General – Twenty-four hour non-medical care for seven or more
         persons, including wards of the juvenile court, in need of personal services, supervision,
         protection or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living. This
         classification includes only those services and facilities licensed by the State of California.
         Note: This type of facility is commonly termed a large group home.
Manufactured Homes
Manufactured homes are permitted in any residential district where a single-family detached
dwelling unit is permitted, subject to the same restrictions on densities and development
standards. Manufactured homes must be placed on a permanent foundation. The classification
for Multi-Family Residential allows manufactured homes.
Multi-family Housing
Multi-family housing is allowed as a permitted use in the R-3 zone and with a use permit in the C-
R and C-D zones. Basic development standards for R-3, C-D, and C-R zones are identified in
Table 2-2 and include the following:
     •   Height regulations – The maximum of height of multi-family buildings in the R-3, C-R,
         and C-D zones is 40 feet, which will accommodate up to three stories.
     •   Minimum site area per unit – The minimum site area per unit is 1,500 square feet, which
         translates to 29.04 units per acre.
     •   Setbacks - Structures shall be set back 20 feet from all streets. Side setbacks must be at
         least 5 feet and rear setbacks must be 20 feet.
     •   Floor area ratio – No minimum or maximum.
2-10

                                                                                      Housing Element
                                                                                            Constraints
    •    Open space - Open space, including both private and common open space, must be at
         least 15 percent of the floor area.
The city’s development standards allow multi-family housing to be constructed at the maximum
allowed densities. The minimum lot size, height allowance, and setbacks allow projects to
maximize development and achieve allowable densities. The City also allows development
standards to be waived or relaxed for affordable projects. Parking requirements are discussed
separately below. The city’s standards for multi-family housing do not present a constraint to the
development of apartments, town houses, condominiums or other multi-family uses and do not
have a negative impact on supply of housing.
Substandard Lots
There are a significant number of lots, in the city that do not conform to the minimum lot size
and lot width requirements necessary for development. These lots are considered substandard or
severely substandard, depending on the degree to which a lot does not conform to the size and
width requirements of the Zoning Code. Severely substandard lots are defined as any lot that
provides 55 percent or less of the required lot width or lot area. The City has established standards
in the Zoning Code to regulate development on substandard and severely substandard lots.
Development of a substandard or severely substandard lot requires a use permit and is subject to
the Proportionality Rule (described below), with some exemptions. Lots exempted from the use
permit requirement include:
1. A substandard lot with at least 95 percent of the required lot width and at least 100 percent of
    the lot area in the underlying zoning district;
2. An accessory building or addition to an existing building not exceeding the lesser of 250
    square feet or the applicable lot coverage and floor area ratio requirement of the underlying
    zoning district; and
3. Exceptional lots are those that provide at least 50 feet of average lot width and 5,000 square
    feet of lot area, have an existing residence built prior to December 7, 2004, are located within
    the R-1-B-1 or R-1-B-2 zoning districts, and do not exceed the maximum FAR for
    exceptional lots.
Approximately 197 substandard and severely substandard lots may meet these requirements and
accommodate a single family home.
Zoning standards regulating the development of substandard or severely substandard lots are
intended to limit lot coverage and ensure adequate setbacks with respect to the smaller lot sizes.
The Proportionality Rule requires that the maximum FAR and lot coverage be reduced on
substandard lots by the ratio of the of the actual lot size to the required lot size or by the ratio of
the actual lot width to the required lot width, whichever is less. Severely substandard lots are
subject to reductions of maximum allowed lot coverage and floor area as defined by Table F:
Development Standards for Severely Substandard Lots, rather than by the Proportionality Rule.
Parking standards for severely substandard lots are also reduced to require one garage space and
one covered or uncovered space. Program 2-4 is provided in Chapter 6 to incentivize
development of the substandard lots with lower and moderate income housing.
                                                                                                  2-11

Plan Half Moon Bay
Affordable Housing
Section 18.06.050(H) of the Zoning Code states that development standards for residential uses
may be waived or relaxed for an affordable housing project. This provision allows developers
much flexibility in designing affordable housing projects. Minimum lot sizes, widths, setbacks,
parking, and other requirements can be reduced or waived, as long as the resulting development
conforms to the certified LCP and other applicable provisions of the Zoning Code outside of
Chapter 18.06. Using this provision, the City reduced parking requirement standards for the
Lesley Gardens development, which includes units specifically designed for disabled and senior
households. The Government Code includes Sections 65590 to 65590.1 that specifically pertain to
housing in the Coastal Zone. Section 65590(d) requires local governments to offer density
bonuses or other incentives, including, but not limited to, modification of zoning and subdivision
requirements, accelerated processing of required applications, and the waiver of appropriate fees
for low and moderate income housing in the Coastal Zone. Policy 2B in Chapter 6 states that the
City will continue to provide incentives for affordable housing. A number of the programs in
Chapter 6 contain provisions directly supporting affordable housing development, including
Program 2-1 and Program 2-7, which provide for the Below Market Rate program and Affordable
Housing Fund, and Program 2-8, which covers additional affordable housing resources.
Planned Unit Development (PUD)
The PUD district is intended to avoid piecemeal development, provide for the replatting of old
subdivisions under a comprehensive planning document, provide for coordinated development,
encourage the assembly of properties, encourage variety and diversification of land uses, and
provide flexibility required for the achievement of coastal, environmental, and safety goals. There
are not specific development standards, allowed uses, or development densities established for the
PUD district. Rather, the project applicant may identify the proposed land use pattern and
densities and proposed development standards that are appropriate for the proposed uses, taking
into account sensitive resources, necessary infrastructure, and provision of coastal access. A use
permit is required for implementation of a PUD. Before a use permit may be issued, a Planned
Unit Development Plan is required to establish the range of uses, development standards, and
performance criteria for the entire PUD site. Findings for a PUD must identify, per Sections
18.15.030 through 18.15.065 of the Zoning Code, that the PUD is compatible with surrounding
uses, will result in superior design and development of the site, is consistent with the General Plan
and all applicable policies and ordinances, provides for phasing of development to ensure that the
capacity of public services and infrastructure is not exceeded, and that mitigation measures are
incorporated to mitigate any potential adverse impacts.

Local Coastal Development Permits
A Coastal Development Permit (CDP) must be issued by the City for all development, with some
specific exceptions including the replacement of structures following disaster, repair and
maintenance of existing structures, additions to single-family residences, and other improvements
normally associated with single-family residences. Developments on tidelands, submerged lands,
and public trust lands require a CDP issued by the CCC. The City’s approval of a CDP may be
appealed to the CCC for any of the following development types or locations:
    •   Developments between the sea and the first public road paralleling the sea, or within 300
        feet of any beach or the mean high tide line where there is no beach, whichever is the
        greater distance;
    •   Developments that are located on tidelands, submerged lands; public trust lands; within
        100 feet of any wetland, estuary, stream; or within 300 feet of the top of the seaward face
        of any coastal bluff; and
    •   Any development that constitutes a major public works project or energy facility.
The approving authority of the CDP, either the City or CCC depending on the location of
development, may apply conditions to the CDP as necessary to ensure conformance with and
implementation of the LCP. Modification of the project and resubmittal of the plans may be
necessary to ensure conformance with the LCP.
Since the entire city is located within the Coastal Zone, all development within the city is subject
to CDP process as regulated by the CCC. While the City can amend the LCP and Chapter 18.20
(Coastal Development Permit Process), the CCC must certify these actions. Therefore, the City
cannot guarantee any reduction or easing of constraints associated with the CDP process.
Second Units
The construction of secondary residential dwelling units in Half Moon Bay is regulated by Section
18.33.030 of the Municipal Code. Secondary residential dwelling units are permitted by right in
the C-G and C-VS districts without a use permit and are allowed within R-1, R-1-B-1, R-1-B-2, C-
D, and C-R districts subject to approval of a use permit. New second dwelling units are subject to
the same requirements as any dwelling located on the same parcel in the same zoning district,
including but not limited to the requirements of coastal development districts and general zoning
provisions, with the following differences:
    •   The minimum lot area per dwelling unit required by the applicable district shall not
        apply, provided that the minimum building site requirements shall be met.
    •   A second dwelling unit may be constructed within or above an existing building or
        detached accessory building.
    •   One off-street parking space must be provided for the second unit.
    •   The floor area shall not exceed 700 square feet.
    •   Architectural review (design approval) is required for second units.
                                                                                                2-13

Plan Half Moon Bay
     •   On the date of the application for a building permit to construct a second dwelling unit
         on a property that contains a main dwelling unit, the main dwelling unit shall be owner
         occupied.
     •   An existing residence, in conformance with the above regulations, may be converted to a
         second dwelling unit in conjunction with development of a new primary dwelling unit.
     •   A maximum number of second units are allowed to be developed in each neighborhood.
         The general formula is that the number of second units in a neighborhood shall not
         exceed 20 percent of the estimated primary units at buildout of the neighborhood. A
         review of the 16 total secondary units in Half Moon Bay in 2008 indicated that they are
         scattered through the city’s neighborhoods and that no neighborhood in the city is close
         to reaching its maximum number of second units. There is ample opportunity in all city
         neighborhoods for the development of additional second units.
A use permit may be issued by the Planning Commission provided the following findings are
made:
     1. The second dwelling unit is constructed within or above an existing building or detached
         accessory building (constructed prior to the effective date of this section for the zoning
         district(s) in which the structure is located);
     2. The unit does not extend further into the required setbacks than the existing foundation
         of the building and is not within three feet of a property line;
     3. The structural height shall be the minimum to accommodate the second unit, and in all
         cases shall not exceed thirty feet at the highest point of the roof;
     4. The second dwelling unit will not significantly impact adjacent properties adversely;
     5. The number of doors and windows facing the reduced side or rear yards are minimized;
     6. The proposed second dwelling unit is approved by the fire department for emergency
         access;
     7. The proposed addition can be accommodated with the existing water service;
     8. The existing sewer lateral can accommodate the proposed addition;
     9. The requirements of Chapter 18.33 of the Zoning Code have been met.
Summary
The City of Half Moon Bay’s Second Dwelling Unit ordinance (Chapter 18.33 of the Zoning
Code) is consistent with the requirements of AB 1866, except that second units are currently
subject to approval of a use permit and are subject to the Residential Growth Limitation (Chapter
18.04 of the Zoning Code). The provisions of Measure D did not preclude second units from any
exemption from the Residential Growth Limitation program implemented by the City. Program
2-3 is included in Chapter 6 and requires the Zoning Code to be amended to allow second units
through ministerial approval consistent with Government Code Section 65852.2(a)(3), and
addresses the Residential Growth Limitation requirement.

Facilities for Disabled Households
In compliance with SB 520, the city's zoning laws, practices, and policies were thoroughly
evaluated as a part of the Housing Element update process. The requirement for a secondary or
accessory dwelling to obtain a use permit was the only constraint identified, as this requirement
may constrain the development of accessory structures for caretakers of disabled persons.
The city’s Zoning Code allows small group homes (limited to 6 or fewer persons) for day care or
residential care in all residentially zoned districts without a use permit. Residential care and day
care facilities for 7 or more persons are allowed in R-3, C-G, C-D, and C-R areas with a use
permit. Group residential facilities, which provide for shared kitchen and plumbing facilities, but
individual living space for persons or households, are permitted by right in the C-G district and
with a use permit in the C-D and C-R districts. No special design or permitting standards have
been established for residential care facilities other than the required use permits. There are no
specific constraints or additional requirements imposed for developments that assist disabled
households. The only condition for the use permit is that the use is limited to non-medical care. A
public hearing is held, unless the Planning Commission finds that the granting of the application
will have no material effect upon adjoining property. The City requires no minimum distance
between residential care facilities and the conditions of the use permit do not result in additional
costs to the facility. The City does not have any occupancy standards that apply specifically to
unrelated adults and defines “family” as two or more persons living together as a single
housekeeping unit in a dwelling unit, provided that this shall not exclude the renting of rooms in
a dwelling unit as permitted by district regulations. The rental clause is directed at the
requirement that mobile home units within mobile parks be limited to use as permanent
residences and may not be rented for less than 30 days.
Parking standards for housing for disabled persons are the same as all residential development
and do not pose a constraint on development of housing for disabled persons. However, the
Zoning Code allows for the removal or reduction of development standards for affordable
housing, including affordable housing for disabled households. Program 3-2 is provided in
Chapter 6 to amend the Zoning Code to provide similar exemptions for housing for disabled
persons.
The City has not adopted any universal design codes. Policies3A, 3B, and 3C, and program 3-1
and 3-2 are included in the Housing Plan to assist in the development of housing accessible to
disabled persons.
Accessory dwellings are required to obtain a use permit, which could constrain the ability of a
disabled person to have an on-site caretaker. Accessory dwelling (second unit) requirements are
discussed below. Program 2-3 is included in the Housing Plan to remove the requirement for a
use permit for accessory dwellings and second units consistent with Government Code Section
65852.2(a)(3).
Half Moon Bay follows the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in regard
to the development of accessible housing. Housing rehabilitation assistance and accessibility
improvements are provided through the County’s housing rehabilitation program and the Center
for the Independence of the Disabled for qualified residents (see Chapters 1 and 4).
                                                                                                 2-15

Plan Half Moon Bay
Program 3-1 is included in the Housing Plan to require the removal, or reduction to the extent
feasible, of any future constraints to housing for disabled persons that are identified by the City.
Facilities for Homeless and Households at Risk of Homelessness
Facilities and housing for homeless persons and those at risk of homelessness fall into three
categories:
     •   Emergency Shelter (per Health and Safety Code 50801): housing with minimal
         supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to occupancy of six months or
         less by a homeless person. No individual or household may be denied emergency shelter
         because of an inability to pay.
     •   Transitional Housing (per Health and Safety Code 50675.2(h)): buildings configured as
         rental housing developments, but operated under program requirements that call for the
         termination of assistance and recirculation of the assisted unit to another eligible
         program recipient at some predetermined future point in time, which shall be no less
         than six months.
     •   Supportive Housing (per Health and Safety Code 50675.14(b)): Housing with no limit
         on length of stay, that is occupied by the target population as defined in subdivision (d) of
         Section 53260, and that is linked to on-site or off-site services that assist the supportive
         housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or her health status, and
         maximizing his or her ability to live and, when possible, work in the community.
Chapter 633, Statutes of 2007 (also known as SB 2) considerably strengthened the requirements
on zoning for emergency shelters and transitional housing, with an effective date of January 1,
2008. The law not requires that all jurisdictions have at least one zone which permits at least one
year-round emergency shelter without a conditional use permit or other discretionary action.
Where this requirement is not met, the local government must designate an appropriate zone
within one year of the adoption of the Housing Element. Additionally, transitional housing and
supportive housing must be considered residential uses, and be subject only to those restrictions
that apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.
The City currently does not identify emergency shelters as an allowed use in any zoning districts,
as housing for homeless persons is not discussed in the Zoning Code. Transitional housing and
supportive housing developments would be considered a single-family, multi-family, small group
home, or large group home use, depending on how the individual project is designed. Thus,
transitional and supportive housing would be allowed by right in the zoning district appropriate
for the proposed type of transitional or supportive housing project.
Policy 3E is provided in Chapter 6 to encourage the protection of homeless persons and
households at risk of homelessness. Program 3-6 is provided in the Housing Plan to amend the
Zoning Code to allow emergency shelters and provide adequate sites as required by Section
65583(a)(4), and to incorporate specific language identifying transitional housing and supportive
housing as permitted uses and subject to the same standards as other residential dwellings of the
same type. The Commercial General (C-G) and Public and Quasi-Public (P-S) zones were
determined to be most appropriate for emergency shelters due to: 1) the proximity of available

                                                                                      Housing Element
                                                                                            Constraints
sites in these zones to public services and transportation, 2) the compatibility of emergency
shelters with the types of uses allowed in these zones, and 3) the adequate number of sites
available in these zones to accommodate the city’s needs. The C-G zone currently contains three
vacant lots ranging in size from 0.28 acres to 0.63 acres, and 16 underutilized sites (where the
value of the land is greater than the value of permanent improvements on the land, indicating
potential for redevelopment) ranging in size from 0.13 acres to 3.29 acres. The P-S zone contains
three underutilized sites ranging in size from 0.22 acres to 1.71 acres.
Farmworker Housing
The Agricultural Land Use A-1 district permits single-family dwellings that are accessory to the
permitted uses (i.e., nurseries, greenhouses, and field flowers; no retail sales), including buildings
for help employed on the premises. The Agricultural Land Use A-2 district permits residential
structures accessory to the primary agricultural uses.
Extremely Low Income
Extremely low-income households can be housed in affordable housing developments with deep
subsidies, such as Section 8 or Section 232. These types of units are most likely to be constructed
in the R-2 or R-3 zones. Other housing opportunities for extremely low-income households
include housing with shared facilities, such as living or dining areas, with private sleeping areas
and are often referred to as single room occupancies (SROs). This type of development allows
rents to be much lower than those associated with typical apartment complexes. The Group
Residential use allows for facilities such as SROs and is permitted in the C-G zone by right and in
the CD and CR zones with a use permit. There are vacant sites zoned R-2, R-3, CG, CD, and CR,
as discussed in Chapter 4, that accommodate multi-family apartments and group residential uses.
Below Market Rate Ordinance (Inclusionary Housing)
The City of Half Moon Bay has a mandatory Below Market Rate (BMR) Housing Ordinance,
which is contained in Chapter 18.35 of the Half Moon Bay Municipal Code. The intent of the
BMR program established by this chapter is to require either the construction of dwellings that
are very low-, low-, and moderate-income households can afford to rent or buy, or the
contribution of an in-lieu fee to an affordable housing fund in an amount sufficient to provide
affordable housing opportunities for these income groups. Under the BMR program, residential
development projects of 10 or more lots or dwelling units, or the conversion of 10 or more rental
units to condominiums, are required to provide 20 percent of the units as affordable units in the
following ratios:
     •   6 percent affordable to very low-income households,
     •   7 percent affordable to low-income households, and
     •   7 percent affordable to moderate-income households.
Seventeen of the 21 jurisdictions in San Mateo County have an inclusionary housing requirement,
and typically require 10 to 20 percent of units to be affordable to very low-, low-, and moderate-
                                                                                                  2-17

Plan Half Moon Bay
income households. Most of these jurisdictions exempt smaller projects, with the minimum
project size required to provide inclusionary units ranging from 5 to 10 units.
Fourteen BMR units have been constructed in Half Moon Bay, consisting of the 12-unit Ocean
Colony Partners affordable development and Nerhan duplex described in Table 1-30. The
Carnoustie project paid an in-lieu fee for six affordable units. While the preferred method of
complying with the BMR program is to provide units, in-lieu fees are accepted in certain
instances as a substitute for the construction of units. Program 2-1 is included in Chapter 6 to
encourage development of BMR units on-site to the extent feasible.
In some communities, an inclusionary housing program such as Half Moon Bay’s Below Market
Rate program could be considered a constraint to developing housing because developers might
choose to develop elsewhere rather than have the responsibility of providing affordable units.
However, in Half Moon Bay, the market is so desirable that the BMR program does not constrain
development, but actually ensures that affordable housing will be built. Further, the BMR
requirements are consistent with Government Code Section 65590(d) which requires new
developments in the Coastal Zone to provide housing for persons and families of low and
moderate income, where feasible, and if it is not feasible, to provide the units elsewhere in the
jurisdiction within three miles of the Coastal Zone.
As part of the 21 Elements process, Economic Planning Systems (EPS) was retained to evaluate
the effects of inclusionary requirements throughout San Mateo County. EPS analyzed building
permit patterns before and after inclusionary requirements were enacted, but found no conclusive
information one way or another that inclusionary requirements posed a constraint to the
development of housing or affected the development levels. While the EPS report and analysis do
not indicate that the BMR unit poses a specific constraint to residential development in Half Mon
Bay, Program 2-1 will provide incentives and options for development of the BMR units in order
to offset hardships or burdens that may be imposed by the requirement. Program 2-1 will provide
incentives for development of BMR units including expedited processing, relaxation of
development standards, density bonuses, alternatives to the provision of BMR units including
land dedication, and assistance in seeking financing to assist in the development of the affordable
units. It is also recommended that some specific program actions be undertaken to preserve the
units that are produced. It is important that as the city increases its inventory of BMR units,
appropriate administrative procedures are developed. Examples of some of these procedures
include:
     •   Monitoring the units annually,
     •   Ensuring that rents, sales prices, and income limits are being maintained; and,
     •   Providing guidance for the marketing of units and selection of occupants.
Residential Growth Ordinance (Measures A and D)
In 1991, the voters of Half Moon Bay passed a Residential Growth Initiative titled Measure A.
This initiative limited new residential units to 3 percent of the population growth rate annually.
In 1999, the city’s voters passed Measure D which amended the Residential Growth Limitation by
limiting the number of new units to match a 1 percent population growth increase annually,

                                                                                   Housing Element

which can be increased by 50 percent for units in the designated Downtown Area. Reasons cited
for reducing potential population growth included: concerns that residential taxes would not
cover cost of basic services, traffic concerns regarding state highways 1 and 92, water supply
limitations, and jobs/housing imbalance. In 2001 and 2002, the City Council approved
amendments to the LCP Land Use Plan and Zoning Code that reduced development allocations
consistent with Measure D. The measure went into effect in 2009 after an extensive review by the
California Coastal Commission to certify the amendment to the Local Coastal Program
incorporating the revised allocation amount.
Although Measure D was passed in 1999 and City Council incorporated appropriate
modifications to the Zoning Code and LCP in 2001 and 2002, Measure D was not effective until
2009 due to an extensive review by the California Coastal Commission for certification of an
amendment to the Local Coastal Program to incorporate the revised allocation amount.
Residential growth is limited to, in any particular year, the number of dwelling units that would
result in an increase of 1 percent of the city’s population as of January 1 of that year. Use of US
Census data is required to calculate the average number of persons per household in order to
convert the allowed population growth to a specific number of units. The number of dwelling
units may be increased by 50 percent for additional dwelling units in the Downtown Area.
Applications outside the Downtown Area shall have priority for the base permitted 1 percent
growth rate. The following are exempt from the Residential Growth Limitation:
    •    Replacement of existing dwelling units on a one-for-one basis, and
    •    Density bonuses for the provision of low and moderate income housing as required by
         state law.
Second units are not exempt from the Residential Growth Limitation. Section 65852.2(a)(2) of the
Government Code requires that a second unit ordinance not be considered in the application of
any ordinance, policy, or program to limit residential growth. Program 2-3 in Chapter 5 would
revise the Zoning Code to clarify that second units are not subject to the Residential Growth
Ordinance, consistent with the requirements of Government Code Section 65852.2(a)(2).
Based on the formula established by Measures A and D and set forth in the Municipal Code,
Zoning Code, and LCP, up to 671 allocations can be issued from 2014 through 2022. According to
the growth initiative formula, the City shall use the most recent US Census for determining the
average number of persons per household. The 2010 US Census indicated a decrease in the city’s
population of 4.4 percent. As a result, the City used a new baseline for 2013 and 2014 based on the
number of building permits issued between 2010 and 2013. As shown in Table 2-3 below, the
end-of-year population is derived from the number of building permits issued to new units in that
year multiplied by the average household size (2.72) in 2010. The “new projected population”
estimate is used to calculate the total number of units within the city at year-end. With these
assumptions, the annual unit allocation only increases by one unit between 2014 and 2022.

In addition to the 671 allocations available to be issued by the City Council during the RHNA
cycle, there may be an additional number of allocations that have already been issued or required,
but for which development permits have not yet been issued. As of July 2014, this includes
allocations for two single-family projects that have submitted CDP applications which have not
yet been approved, and eight allocations for five single-family residences and one triplex that have
submitted building permit applications that have not yet been approved. Because the time clock
for allocations stops during the entitlement and approval process and resumes when entitlements
have been issued, it is possible for these allocations to carry over into the 2015-2023 RHNA period
before the permits for the projects are fully approved. This process is described further in the Use
of Allocations section below. As shown, the city’s available and previously-issued allocations will
be more than adequate to accommodate the 240 units that represent the city’s RHNA.
Allocation Process
Once a year, the City establishes the number of allocations that will be granted during that year,
based on the formula described above. The City collects a fee of $712 per residential unit to
process the application. During the last several years, the City has received fewer applications than
available allocations. It should be noted that the allocation process is only used in years when
applications exceed the number of available allocations. Developers seeking an allocation are
encouraged to apply from January 1 to January 31 each year. If the number of allocations
requested is less than the number of available allocations, no scoring is necessary and the
remaining available allocations will be distributed on an over-the-counter basis for the remainder
of the year. As discussed below, developers may enter into a phasing agreement with the City at
any time during a year. The phasing agreement will guarantee the developer a specific number of
2-20

                                                                                       Housing Element

allocations for a project and removes the need for the developer to apply for allocations on an
annual basis.
If the number of allocations applied for from January 1 to January 31 exceeds available allocations
for that year, City staff will score applications based on a point system set forth in the Municipal
Code. Each project will be scored based on 1) project location which is either: A) within the
Downtown Area or B) outside of the Downtown Area; and 2) project type, which is either A)
Residential Development (single-family residential, duplex, or multi-family per section 17.06.100)
or B) Subdivision (land divisions that include residential development per section 17.06.200).
Projects within the Downtown Area would compete only with other similar project types located
in the Downtown Area. Projects located outside of the Downtown Area would compete with
other similar project types outside of the Downtown Area. The Community Development
Director will review and score applications no later than April 1. The Community Development
Director’s scoring of the applications will be presented to the Planning Commission at their first
meeting in April. The Planning Commission will then ratify or modify the Community
Development Director’s recommendations.
The city’s R-3 sites are all located within the Downtown Area; thus, affordable projects on the R-3
sites would receive priority in the event that requests for allocations exceed available allocations.
The criteria for both project location types encourage developers to include affordable housing, as
a project can only obtain full points by providing affordable housing on-site. The Downtown
Area application also encourages high density development by providing additional points for
each 5 du/acre provided in excess of a base of 10 du/acre.
The application scoring standards for Downtown Area and Subdivision projects are identified
below. The criteria provided are clear and straightforward.

Residential projects involve infill development on existing subdivided lots within the urbanized
area of the city that are served by existing infrastructure. Subdivision projects involve new
development that may require the extension of infrastructure and may extend development
beyond the urbanized area of the city in some cases. For these reasons, subdivision projects have
more demanding standards. However, the standards used to score projects are not onerous and
will not deter development of affordable housing. The standards provided are intended to ensure
that development projects have adequate infrastructure, provide for their fair-share of municipal
services, and that development projects are designed to encourage safety of residents. As
discussed, the standards prioritize affordable projects by providing points for affordable units.
Because projects receive points commensurate with each development’s percentage of affordable
units, projects that are fully affordable will be the most competitive in the process. The scoring
criteria include components to reduce residential energy demand and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, by prioritizing in-fill development (development in the Downtown Area).
                                                                                                   2-25

Plan Half Moon Bay
Use of Allocations
Expiration dates are governed by Section 17.06.050 of the Half Moon Bay Municipal Code. A
Measure A or D allocation is valid for one year from the date of issuance. While the City does not
allow “rollovers” of allocations, the allocation can be extended beyond one year to accommodate
regulatory and other delays. In order to lengthen the one-year period of their allocation, the
developer submits documentation to the City identifying which entitlements/approvals the
applicant is seeking from the City of Half Moon Bay or other agencies. There is no application fee
or additional requirement, apart from the developer notifying the City of the entitlement that the
developer is seeking. The additional time to obtain the entitlements is added to the one-year
period. This approach allows developers to “stop the clock” on their one-year allocation to obtain
the entitlements and permits necessary to construct their projects. In this manner, a one-year
allocation can be extended for two or more years.
A developer may submit a request for an allocation after January 1, following the City Council’s
determination of the number of allocations granted in the preceding year. The allocation may be
requested prior to the developer requesting any entitlements or during the entitlement process.
This flexibility in the timing of an allocation reduces the impact of not rolling over allocations to a
less than significant level.
Typically, many growth allocation programs require that the developer request an allocation
either before entering into the entitlement process or only after entitlements have been received.
This requirement usually results in a shorter time window during which the allocation can be
used. In the case of Half Moon Bay, developers can request allocations for projects that they wish
to entitle during a following year or begin the entitlement process during the year. Once the
entitlement process is started, the time limit on the allocation is put on hold. The clock starts
when the allocation is received, then stops when entitlements are applied for, starts again when
entitlements are received, following all appeals periods, and may stop again if water and/or sewer
connections are necessary. Once the connection is obtained the clock starts again. A building
permit application must be submitted before the end of the 365-day clock. In this way, the City’s
approach to allocating growth does not require rollovers. As discussed below, developers can also
enter into a phasing agreement with the City to extend allocations over a period of time.
Table 2-4 illustrates how time extensions for regulatory approvals have been used successfully by
applicants in Half Moon Bay to extend the life of their allocation for several years. As shown
below, an applicant can receive an allocation, and then decide to redesign their project. The
allocation’s “clock” will be stopped during the time to process the approvals for the redesign. This
has benefited applicants in the current housing market, as it allows an applicant submit a
entitlement request to the City to scale back the size of a home or modify an overall project
without using up their one-year allocation period.

Family Residence)                           processed and approved. Subsequently, the applicant
                                            submitted a Coastal Development Permit application. Since
                                            the CDP was filed on the same day the allocation was
                                            obtained, the one-year time period of the allocation was put
                                            on hold and 365 days remained on the Measure A allocation.
                                            The City and applicant entered into a series of agreements
                                            that further extended the application. The CDP was
                                            approved, then appealed by Coastal Commissioners. The
                                            appeal was withdrawn on January 27, 2010 at which time the

                                            the property owner received approval of a water connection
                                            for the property and the allocation “clock” resumed. City
                                            staff received a Coastal Development Permit application on
                                            November 25, 2009, which again suspended the expiration of
                                            the allocation. Following receipt of the CDP, the allocation

                                            multiple extensions. On July 15, 2009, an application was
                                            submitted to amend the existing CDP previously approved

Plan Half Moon Bay
In addition to extending the one-year allocation to receive entitlements and regulatory approvals,
applicants may also request additional extensions. The City Council may grant a one-year
extension. There is no fee to request an extension and the extension request does not require any
findings from the City Council. Because the City stops the clock (no time is deducted from the
allocation period) during any processing of entitlements (which includes City entitlements such
as a Coastal Development Permit, subdivision map, lot split, use permit, design review, and other
agency approvals, such as water connections), an extension would only be requested when a
developer either wants additional time to request entitlements or if a developer has received
entitlements but wants to wait to construct the units. This does not add any costs to the
development process nor does it delay a development project. The multiple allowances for a time
extension, as well as the ability to stop the clock for additional entitlements/approvals, provide
flexibility to the developer and decrease a developer’s costs, since the developer does not have to
apply for a new allocation but rather requests an extension. The requirement to receive an
approval from the City Council beyond the initial extension does not constrain development
potential in the City, but rather provides a method for the City to track its active applications and
plan for growth by ensuring that the City is aware of the status of each allocation as well as a
developer’s intentions as to when they plan to utilize the allocation. The City Council has not
rejected any requests to extend the time period for a growth allocation.
Development Phasing Agreement
Most developers of larger projects do not need to apply for growth allocations and time
extensions as discussed above, but rather enter into a development phasing agreement with the
City. In order to provide certainty for development projects to receive growth allocations, the
Municipal Code provides for a phasing plan and development agreement. This process guarantees
the number of allocations a development project will receive and reduces the risk and uncertainty
for a developer. A development phasing agreement must be approved by the City Council at a
noticed public hearing. Other developers and projects are noticed of the request for the phasing
agreement so they can comment on whether it would adversely affect their projects.
The development phasing agreement provides for an applicant to receive a greater number of
annual allocations in any category by deducting those allocations from future years. Alternatively,
a development phasing agreement may provide for an applicant to receive a specific number of
allocations each year for a set number of years. Applicants that have a development phasing
agreement do not need to compete for points to receive their annual allocation, but are
guaranteed a specific number of allocations.
In 2007, the City Council approved a development phasing plan and agreement for the
Carnoustie residential subdivision consisting of 32 single-family residences. The parties agreed
that consistent with Municipal Code Section 17.06.050, the time period for submission of
complete building permit applications for any residential unit with a Measure A allocation will be
extended or tolled for the period of time spent by the developer securing any other approvals,
permits, subdivision maps, coastal development permits, utility connections, utility capacity
agreements, certifications or entitlements from the City or any other agency, commission, district,
board, or public entity. The agreement further established that in the event the developer does not
fully utilize a growth allocation in the calendar year in which it was issued, the unused allocation
will not expire or lapse, but will remain valid and be carried over and available to the developer in
2-28

                                                                                    Housing Element
                                                                                          Constraints
each succeeding year until utilized. This use of a development and phasing agreement allows a
developer to obtain a growth allocation then use it when they have obtained entitlements and
there is a market demand for their project. This provides flexibility and removes the need for any
rollover of the growth allocation, as the allocation remains valid until utilized.
Summary
The Residential Growth Limitation/Residential Dwelling Unit Allocation System (Chapter 17.06
of the Municipal Code) would only be considered a constraint on housing if it impedes the
development of units needed to meet the city’s housing needs. The city’s housing needs, based on
the 2014-2022 Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), total 240 units. The estimated 671
units that may be allocated during the 2014 through 2022 timeframe are more than sufficient to
accommodate the RHNA from the current Housing Element cycle. Further, density bonus units
are exempt from the allocation that will allow the very low-, low-, and moderate-income units to
be developed without an allocation, should the developer request a density bonus. Therefore, the
Measure A and Measure D processes are not a constraint to the provision of sufficient housing
units to meet the city’s housing needs.
The process of applying for an allocation also does not present any significant constraints. The
City has adopted updated scoring criteria to refine the process of distributing allocations. The
new scoring criteria prioritize allocations in the Downtown Area, which is where the city’s R-3
sites are located, and also provides points for the provision of affordable housing. Projects can
only score the full amount of points by including on-site affordable housing.
While allocations have a one-year lifespan, this year is put on hold while the applicant obtains
necessary land use approvals from the City and, if applicable, the Coastal Commission, as well as
any other approvals, such as water connections and sewer service, needed for the project. This
approach will extend the one-year allocation for as long as is necessary for the applicant to receive
entitlements. In some cases, applicants have taken four or five years to go through the permitting
process and receive all of their entitlements. The one-year allocation is extended to accommodate
this process. This allows a developer to proceed with entitlements at their own pace with
obtaining entitlements once they have an allocation, which is particularly useful in depressed
housing markets, and additional extensions may be granted by the City Council.
The City has established a process to allow developers to request a specified number of units and
enter into a development phasing agreement to assure that a specific number of allocations is
granted to the project each year. This increases certainty for developers and investors, and allows
projects to be financed and constructed in a timely manner. The phasing process also allows
allocations to be extended over a long-term period. It is anticipated that any larger projects will
enter into a phasing agreement with the City in order to secure their allocations up front and to
have the flexibility to increase the rate at which the development is built out to correspond to the
housing market.
As discussed above, the 671 allocations that will be available during this RHNA cycle are more
than adequate to accommodate the 240 units of the city’s fair share of regional housing needs.
                                                                                                 2-29

Plan Half Moon Bay
Because there are provisions for development projects, including affordable housing, to be
guaranteed a specific number of allocations, and because the City can extend the allocation
lifespan to accommodate delays due to various approvals needed during the development process,
the Residential Dwelling Unit Allocation System does not unduly constrain the development of
housing, including affordable housing.
While the City has concluded that the implementation of the provisions of Measure D do not
present an obstacle to the development of housing necessary to accommodate the city’s fair share
of regional housing needs, the City has included Program 2-9 in the Housing Element to provide
an annual evaluation of the Residential Dwelling Unit Allocation System. If obstacles to
accommodating the city’s fair share of regional housing needs are identified, the Municipal Code
will be revised to address the obstacle. Program 2-9 will ensure that the Residential Dwelling Unit
Allocation System will not constrain the development of the city’s fair share of regional housing
needs and that it will not present an impediment to the development of affordable and special
needs housing.
Water and Sewer Capacity Allocation and Reservation
The Coastal Act requires that priority be given to certain land uses with regard to the allocation of
public works capacities, including water and sewer. The LCP therefore establishes policies and
regulations that require the reservation of water supplies and sewer capacity for each of four
priority uses as defined in Chapter 18.05 of the Zoning Code:
     A. Commercial Recreation. Visitor serving commercial uses and services; hotels; motels;
         restaurants; bars; equestrian supply stores; equestrian facilities; clubs; guest ranches and
         lodges; recreational vehicle campsites; art galleries; fishing and boating supplies; beaches;
         and golf courses and ancillary uses.
     B. Public Recreation. Outdoor recreational uses such as parks, playgrounds, and ball fields
         for soccer, baseball, football, and similar activities; restaurant or food service stands,
         recreational vehicle parks, and retail concessions catering to visitors related to a permitted
         public recreational use; and information centers and structures ancillary to public
         recreation area maintenance; picnic facilities; and tent campsites.
     C. Indoor Floriculture. Greenhouses used for the propagation and cultivation of plants of
         all types.
     D. Outdoor Agriculture and Horticulture. Includes the propagation and cultivation of all
         field flowers, plants, trees, and vegetables.
The Planning Department is charged with monitoring the number of building permits issued
annually by use category to ensure that sufficient capacity is reserved, and may limit the number
of permits issued accordingly. As stated in LUP Policy 10-13, the amount to be reserved for each
phase of water supply development shall be the same percentage of capacity for priority uses as
that needed at buildout, until a determination is made that a priority use need is satisfied by the
available reservation. Similarly, Policy 10-21 requires the City to reserve capacity for priority uses
2-30

                                                                                        Housing Element
                                                                                              Constraints
in the sewage treatment plant at the same percentage of capacity for priority uses as will be needed
at buildout.
Government Code Section 65589.7 requires water and sewer service providers to grant a priority
for the provision of water and sewer services to proposed developments that include housing
units affordable to lower income households. However, affordable housing has not been
established as a priority use in the LCP. In Chapter 6, Policy 2F identifies very low- and low-
income housing as priority uses and Program 2-6 requires amendment of the Zoning Code and
LCP to include housing affordable to very low- and low-income households as a priority use
pursuant to the Government Code. Refer to the discussion of Water under Infrastructure
Constraints in this chapter regarding availability of water connections.
Parking Requirements
Chapter 18.36 of the Zoning Code establishes parking standards. Table 2-5 summarizes parking
requirements for single-family units, duplex units, and apartments. The city’s requirements for
single-family homes and duplex units are consistent with the median parking requirements of
jurisdictions in San Mateo County, as reported by the 21 Elements project. The city’s
requirements for uncovered spaces in apartment projects are higher by 0.25 to 0.75 spaces than
the county median, depending on the number of bedrooms in a unit. However, the City does
provide exceptions to parking standards in cases of practical difficulties and unusual hardships.
The Zoning Code also allows exceptions to the standards for affordable housing projects. Joint
use of parking facilities is allowed, provided that the total supplied collectively is not less than the
sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. The City will reduce parking
requirements for developments that have abundant street parking. For projects that demonstrate
lower than typical parking demand, such as senior and disabled parking, the City will reduce
parking requirements. Bicycle parking for mixed-use/apartment buildings may be required as a
condition for projects subject to discretionary approval.
Since the city’s standards for single-family and duplex units are comparable to other jurisdictions
in the county, and the City allows exceptions where there is a hardship, parking requirements do
not present a constraint to the development of moderate and above moderate income units.
The city’s height requirements allow multi-family development projects to provide larger units
and meet parking standards while still achieving maximum densities, so the parking requirements
will not inhibit a development from developing at the site’s capacity. While the city’s parking
requirements are higher than the county median for one- and two-bedroom apartment units, the
city does allow joint use of facilities, parking in an off-site lot, and exceptions for affordable units.
The parking requirement for two- to four-bedroom apartments is similar to the county median
and is not anticipated to affect the cost or supply of affordable or market rate housing. However,
if a project cannot demonstrate a hardship or is not an affordable project, the requirements for
studio and one-bedroom units (see Table 2-5) may constrain development of market rate one-
and two-bedroom units, as the parking requirement would have the effect of reducing the area of
the project site that can be developed and thus indirectly increase the cost of development. For
studio and one-bedroom units, this may present an increased burden, as the households
occupying these unit sizes are smaller than households occupying larger units. These smaller
                                                                                                    2-31

Plan Half Moon Bay
households may not require two parking spaces, and the cost to the development project to
provide this parking may be unnecessary.
While the parking requirements do not present a significant constraint to the development of
very low- and low-income units due to exceptions allowed for affordable units, Program 3-8 is
included in the Housing Plan to reduce parking requirements for studio and one-bedroom units
to ensure that market rate and affordable units are not unduly constrained by parking
requirements. This reduction in parking requirements is anticipated to result in parking levels
that will be commensurate with the demand for parking and will allow greater densities to be
achieved in multi-family projects. Therefore, Program 3-8 will reduce any impacts of the city’s
parking requirements on market rate or affordable housing projects to a less than significant level.

On-Site and Off-Site Improvements
Site improvement costs include the cost of providing access to the site, clearing the site, and
grading the pad area. In the case of a subdivision, such costs may also include major subdivision
improvements such as road construction and installation of sewer, water, and other utilities. As
with land costs, several variables affect the amount of such costs, including site topography and
proximity to established roads, sewers, and water lines. Engineering and other technical assistance
costs are usually included with site improvement, as these services are required to ensure that the
development is constructed according to established codes and standards.
Required street rights-of-way and street widths are based on the street classification. The city has
the following street classifications:
     •    Limited access (thoroughfares) streets serve inter-urban, statewide and interstate travel
          (Highways 1 and 92). Limited access streets are required to have an 80-foot right-of-way,
          including a 48-foot street section and 10-foot median;
     •    Arterial streets primarily serve intra-city travel, carrying traffic from collector streets to
          and from other parts of the city. Arterial streets are required to have an 80-foot right-of-
          way, including a 60-foot street section with controlled parking;
2-32

                                                                                       Housing Element
                                                                                             Constraints
     •   Collector streets directly or indirectly link local streets with arterials and are designed
         primarily to serve residential and recreational traffic. Collector streets are required to
         have a 60-foot right-of-way, including a 40-foot street section with sidewalks and parking
         provided on both sides of the street; and
     •   Local access streets provide direct access with abutting land uses. Local access streets are
         required to have a 50-foot right-of-way, including a 36-foot street section with sidewalks
         on both sides of the street.
Street cross-sections are typically based on 10-foot travel lanes and 8-foot parking lanes. The city’s
street standards are typical of other jurisdictions in California (in fact, they may be narrower than
many other jurisdictions) and do not require excessive rights-of-way or lane widths. To reduce
housing costs, the City attempts to require only those improvements that are deemed necessary to
maintain public health, safety, and welfare. The Municipal Code allows deferral of street
improvements where: 1) proposed development is adjacent to partially improved streets (existing
streets that do not have full right-of-way dedication and/or street section) if the City Engineer
determines that the street is capable of safe and adequate access by emergency vehicles, or 2) the
applicant agrees to construct an interim private street to agreed-upon standards prior to the
building’s occupancy. Parcels identified in Chapter 3 Resources as available sites for very low- and
low-income housing are adjacent to existing improved roadways, so future development on these
parcels will not have to construct full street improvements. The city’s street standards do not
present a significant constraint to the development of housing, and particularly do not constrain
the development of affordable housing.
The City requires that curbs, gutters, and sidewalks be installed along the frontage of every lot on
which new construction or significant alteration occurs. The absence of curbs and gutters may
contribute to unsafe pedestrian and vehicular travel. In addition, potential flooding problems may
result due to the lack of infrastructure improvements. Curb, gutter, and sidewalk improvements
are typical of all cities in California and do not impose a significant constraint to the development
of housing.
Off-site improvements may be required if the project creates significant impacts that require
mitigation. This is determined on a project-by-project basis.
Governmental Fees
The 21 Elements project surveyed the cities of San Mateo County to determine development fees,
including planning, building, and impact fees. The 21 Elements group provided basic
assumptions for the hypothetical projects (see the footnotes of Table 2-6) so that the fees could be
compared across jurisdictions. Based on the responses to the survey, the 21 Elements group
identified a countywide average of $26,926, and a countywide median of $23,143 in total fees for
the development of a single-family residence. In Half Moon Bay, fees for a single-family residence
total $40,399, which is nearly 75 percent higher than the median fees of jurisdictions in the
county. The 21 Elements assumptions for a multi-family development were for a 96-unit multi-
family project, which is not a pertinent form of development for Half Moon Bay. In 2009, fee
estimates for a 10-unit multi-family project in Half Moon Bay totaled $172,895, which was 2
                                                                                                   2-33

Processing Procedures and Times
The residential development process has various stages, each of which requires some form of City
approval. Residential development in Half Moon Bay requires a Coastal Development Permit.
Single-family subdivisions and multi-family projects, as well as some single-family homes, require
design review. Larger tracts of vacant land may be located in the PUD zone and require a planned
unit development plan. These development review processes are described below.
Coastal Development Permit
Single-family and multi-family development within Half Moon Bay typically requires a CDP as
set forth by the California Code of Regulations. Since the entire city is within the Coastal Zone, all
development projects that are not exempt require a CDP. Exempt projects include repair and
maintenance activities such as expansions to single-family residences.
Half Moon Bay has a certified Local Coastal Program, which allows the City to issue most CDPs,
except those for development below the line of the mean high tide or on submerged or public
trust lands, at the local level. A noticed public hearing is required for issuance of a CDP. The body
with the final approval authority for an entitlement request issues the CDP. A coastal
development permit may be approved or conditionally approved only after the approving
authority has made the following findings:

                                                                                         Constraints
    1. Local Coastal Program. The development as proposed or as modified by conditions
        conforms to the local coastal program;
    2. Growth Management System. The development is consistent with the annual population
        limitation system established in the land use plan and zoning ordinance;
    3. Zoning Provisions. The development is consistent with the use limitations and property
        development standards of the base district as well as the other requirements of the zoning
        ordinance;
    4. Adequate Services. Evidence has been submitted with the permit application that the
        proposed development will be provided with adequate services and infrastructure at the
        time of occupancy in a manner that is consistent with the local coastal program; and
    5. California Coastal Act. Any development to be located between the sea and the first
        public road conforms with the public access and public recreation policies of Chapter 3 of
        the California Coastal Act.
Design Review
Design review is required for the following improvements: construction of a new residence or
accessory within the downtown historic area; alterations or additions to an existing residence
within the downtown historic area; new residential structures within a planned unit development;
any new residential structure or modifications to an existing structure requiring a discretionary
permit; and construction of a new duplex or significant alterations to an existing duplex. Multi-
family developments and single-family subdivisions will typically require architectural review.
Depending on the location and consistency with the Zoning Code, a single-family residence may
require architectural review. For any exterior alteration not requiring a discretionary permit,
architectural review can take place as part of plan evaluation during the building permit process.
An architectural review application is processed in conjunction with other requested entitlements.
The design review process considers the character and quality of design; compatibility with
neighboring properties; development characteristics of the project, including building coverage
and use of open space; building materials and colors; disturbance of topography, trees, and other
natural features; accessory structures; exterior building features; and energy efficiency and
renewable energy design elements.
Design review is conducted by the Planning Commission, with the exception of exempted
projects that are reviewed by the Community Development Director. An application must be
submitted at least two weeks prior to a regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting in
order to be heard at the meeting. Public notice of projects that will be heard by the Planning
Commission must be published at least five days prior to the meeting. In approving any project,
the Community Development Director or Planning Commission shall find that such buildings,
structures, planting, paving, and other improvements shall be so designed and constructed that
they will not be of unsightly or obnoxious appearance to the extent that they will hinder the
orderly and harmonious development of the city, impair the desirability or opportunity to attain
the optimum use and the value of the land and the improvements, impair the desirability of living
                                                                                               2-35
Plan Half Moon Bay
or working conditions in the same or adjacent areas, and/or otherwise adversely affect the general
prosperity and welfare of the city.
In order to make the above-noted findings, the Planning Commission considers development
projects based on the following criteria:
     •   Where more than one building or structure will be constructed, the architectural features
         and landscaping thereof shall be harmonious. Such features include height, elevations,
         roofs, material, color and appurtenances.
     •   Where more than one sign will be erected or displayed on the site, the signs shall have a
         common or compatible design and locational positions and shall be harmonious in
         appearance.
     •   The material, textures, colors, and details of construction shall be an appropriate
         expression of the project’s design concept and function, and shall be compatible with the
         adjacent and neighboring structures and functions. Colors of wall and roofing materials
         shall blend with the natural landscape and be non-reflective.
     •   The design shall be appropriate to the function of the project and express the project’s
         identity.
     •   The planning and siting of the various functions and buildings on the site shall create an
         internal sense of order and provide a desirable environment for occupants, visitors, and
         the general community.
     •   Roofing materials shall be wood shingles, wood shakes, tile, or other materials such as
         composition as approved by the appropriate design review authority. No mechanical
         equipment shall be located upon a roof unless it is appropriately screened.
     •   The proposed development shall be compatible in terms of height, bulk and design with
         other structures and environment in the immediate area.
     •   The proposed design shall be consistent with the applicable elements of the general plan.
     •   If the project site is located in an area considered by the Planning Commission as having
         a unified design character or historical character, the design shall be compatible with such
         character.
     •   The design shall promote harmonious transition in scale and character in areas located
         between different designated land uses.
     •   The design shall be compatible with known and approved improvements and/or future
         construction, both on and off the site.
     •   The planning and siting of the various functions and buildings on the site shall create an
         internal sense of order and provide a desirable environment for occupants, visitors and
         the general community.
     •   Sufficient ancillary functions provided to support the main functions of the project shall
         be compatible with the project’s design concept.
     •   Access to the property and circulation systems shall be safe and convenient for
         equestrians, pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles.

                                                                                             Constraints
     •   The amount and arrangement of open space and landscaping shall be appropriate to the
         design and the function of the structures. Landscaping shall be in keeping with the
         character or design of the building, and preferably clustered in natural appearing groups,
         as opposed to being placed in rows or regularly spaced.
     •   Where feasible, natural features shall be appropriately preserved and integrated with the
         project.
     •   The landscape design concept for the site, as shown by the relationship of plant masses,
         open space, scale, plant forms, and foliage textures and colors, shall create a desirable and
         functional environment, and the landscape concept shall depict an appropriate unity with
         the various buildings on the site.
     •   Plant material shall be suitable and adaptable to the site, shall be capable of being properly
         maintained on the site, and shall be of a variety which would tend to be drought-resistant
         and to reduce consumption of water in its installation and maintenance.
     •   The design shall be energy efficient and incorporate renewable energy design elements
         including, but not limited to:
         1. Exterior energy design elements;
         2. Internal lighting service and climatic control systems; and
         3. Building siting and landscape elements.
The design review process does not regulate any specific uses, but requires all uses to comply with
specific design standards. The city’s design review requirements are clearly established in the
Zoning Ordinance and are written to allow applicants flexibility in achieving substantial
compliance. Most jurisdictions have a site plan review process; in Half Moon Bay, the design
review replaces the site plan review process. Thus, design review does not add time to the
entitlement process. As the city has clearly written criteria and compliance with the city’s criteria
will ensure that a project meets the required findings for design review, the design review process
does not add significant time or cost to the development process.
However, while the design criteria encourage high-quality design and are not onerous, the
findings to be made for design review are subjective and, thus, could pose a constraint to
development at some future date depending on how the findings are interpreted. For example, the
term “obnoxious” is subjective and could be used to reject a variety of projects that may otherwise
be consistent with the city’s Zoning Code, General Plan, and LCP. The finding that a project does
not “impair the desirability or opportunity to attain the optimum use and the value of the land”
could also be used to reject projects requiring significant subsidies, which may be construed as
impairing the opportunity to attain optimum value of the land. Program 3-9 has been included in
the housing plan to remove these subjective components from the design review findings to
increase certainty for projects.
Planned Unit Development
As shown in Table 3-7 sites in the PUD district provide capacity for a range of affordability levels.
While development in this district is not necessary to accommodate the city’s very low- and low-
income units, this district provides flexibility in terms of development standards and uses, which
makes it appropriate for a range of affordability levels. The PUD district is intended to provide for
                                                                                                   2-37

Plan Half Moon Bay
a variety of land uses, such as attached and detached single-family residential development, multi-
family housing development, professional and administrative areas, commercial and industrial
uses, institutional uses, and public and private open space and recreation opportunities through
the adoption of a comprehensive development plan as set forth in the Land Use Plan and Zoning
Code.
Prior to submitting an application for a planned unit development plan, or an amendment to a
previously approved and adopted planned unit development plan, the applicant must consult
with the Community Development Director to ensure that any proposal submitted will be
consistent with the provisions of Zoning Code and the General Plan and LCP Land Use Plan, and
to ensure conformance with the residential dwelling unit building permit allocation system
ordinance. A planned unit development plan must include a detailed description of the proposed
uses, densities, and intensities; figures illustrating the site plan, circulation plan, project
relationship with adjacent uses, environmental constraints, building elevations, preliminary
landscaping, and preliminary grading plans; description of proposed development standards; and
description of necessary on- and off-site improvements.
Approval of a planned unit development requires a use permit. In order for a planned unit
development to be recommended by the Planning Commission and approved by the City
Council, the following findings must be made:
     1. The planned unit development plan is consistent with the adopted general plan, Chapter
         18.15 of the Zoning Code, and all other applicable policies and ordinances of the city;
     2. The planned unit development plan is compatible with surrounding land uses;
     3. The adoption and implementation of the planned unit development plan will result in
         superior design and development of the site;
     4. The planned unit development plan meets the requirements of any annual dwelling unit
         allocation system adopted by the city;
     5. Adoption and implementation of the planned unit development plan will not exceed the
         capacity of existing or planned infrastructure systems, including but not limited to sewer,
         water, natural gas, electricity, and police and fire protection;
     6. If adequate utilities, infrastructure, and public services are not available to serve all of the
         proposed development possible under the planned unit development plan, the plan
         contains phasing controls or requirements for utility improvements that ensure that
         demands from proposed development does not exceed utility capacity; and
     7. The applicant, or Planning Commission and City Council, have incorporated all
         appropriate measures and conditions in the planned unit development plan necessary to
         mitigate any potential adverse impacts identified during the public review process.

Processing Times
Initial processing of a development application depends on the type of project proposed (e.g.,
Planned Unit Development, subdivision, single-family unit, etc.) as well as whether additional
requirements will need to be met (e.g., rezoning of land, environmental review, etc.). Therefore,
processing review times can vary depending on many different factors. Table 2-7 identifies the
average and 75th percentile application processing times for jurisdictions in San Mateo County.
The processing time required by the City for straightforward applications, such as applications for
ministerial review, design review, and use permits is generally close to the county average for
straightforward applications. The time period to process more complicated projects, including
those that require a Coastal Development Permit, is closer to the countywide 75th percentile
associated with complicated applications. The main delay that can occur, which is outside of the
City’s processing timeline, is obtaining CCC approvals on appeals and permits that are subject to
their purview. It is not atypical for larger developments in Half Moon Bay to be appealed and/or
litigated. These occurrences add to processing time delays that are outside of the City’s control.
Table 2-8 summarizes processing times for single-family and multi-family projects that do not
require a zone change or General Plan amendment. The City’s processing times are typically
within the 75th percentile of jurisdictions within the county. While typical processing times are
above the county average and can be considered a constraint, this is primarily due to the city’s
location in the Coastal Zone and the requirements of the Coastal Act. The requirements of the
Coastal Act and related processing times are codified by state law and are outside of the control of
the City. In order to reduce this constraint to the extent feasible and to encourage development of
affordable units, Policy 2G in the Housing Plan provides for expedited processing of affordable
housing projects and Program 3-2 provides for expedited processing of affordable projects for
senior and disabled households.

Infrastructure Constraints
Water
Half Moon Bay is served by the Coastside County Water District (CCWD), which also serves part
of the unincorporated area of San Mateo County, including Princeton-by-the-Sea, Miramar, and
El Granada. CCWD’s water supply sources include Pilarcitos Lake, Upper Crystal Springs
Reservoir, Pilarcitos Well Field, and Denniston Creek. The primary water supply source is
purchased from the SFPUC (Pilarcitos Lake and Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir), and other
supplies (about 28 percent) are Infiltration Well water from the District’s Pilarcitos well field and
surface water and groundwater from the District’s Denniston Project. Water is delivered to the
system through one of two treatment plants: the Denniston Water Treatment Plant near Half
Moon Bay Airport and the Nunes Water Treatment Plant in Half Moon Bay. The CCWD water
distribution system consists of 11 treated water storage tanks, which have a combined storage
capacity of 8.1 million gallons, and over 100 miles of transmission and distribution pipelines.
Water Supply
In its 2010 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP), CCWD estimated that in years of normal
precipitation, all sources of supply will have an average yield of 1,090 million gallons (mg) or
3,335 acre feet per year (AFY). The yield assumes that up to 800 mg (2,455 AFY) is purchased
from SFPUC and that 200 mg per year (mg/yr) (610 AFY) is available from Denniston surface
water, 40 mg/yr (120 AFY) from Denniston groundwater, and 50 mg/yr (150 AFY) from the
Pilarcitos well field.
CCWD water supplies may be affected by climatic factors such as drought, or by water quality
issues. Current supply reliability for dry water years are summarized in the 2010 UWMP. In a
single dry water year, or the first of multiple dry water years, supply from all sources is estimated
at 2,472 AFY, or 74 percent of the yield for a normal year. For Year 2 of multiple dry water years,
the estimated supply from all sources is 1,911 AFY (57 percent of normal year supply), and for
Year 3, the estimated supply from all sources is 1,765 AFY (53 percent of normal year supply. All
of CCWD’s water sources receive full treatment in accordance with federal and state standards,
and the district does not anticipate any changes in supply availability as a result of water quality.
Current and Projected Demand
Water demand projections in the 2010 UWMP were based on water use targets mandated by the
Water Conservation Act of 2009 (SBx7-7). In compliance with the act, CCWD has adopted an
interim per capita water use target of 124 gallons per capita per day (gpcd) by 2015, and a final
target of 120 gpcd by 2020, compared to a baseline per capita use of 128 gpcd in 2010. Based on a
comparison of projections based on these targets against another set of projections made using a
model based on existing and future water connections by water use sector and existing water
conservation programs, CCWD expects that its targets will be met through continued
implementation of the conservation programs. The 2010 UWMP’s supply projections are also
based on the per capita use targets, showing that CCWD intends to meet any variations in
anticipated demands by changing the amount of water purchased through SFPUC. Table 2-9
summarizes demand projections and planned supplies from the UWMP.
                                                                                                   2-41

Plan Half Moon Bay
Existing System Deficiencies
In April 2011 Coastside County Water District adopted a Water Shortage Contingency Plan
providing a response plan in the event of prolonged drought, water supply shortages or
emergency outages. During normal year comparison CCWD’s water supplies are adequate to
meet projected demands. CCWD currently has an ongoing pipeline replacement program to
replace sections of old and damaged pipelines with new ductile iron pipelines to reduce leaks and
minimize losses throughout the system.1
Potential Water System Improvements
CCWD has several options to reduce existing water use through conservation and to increase
water supply sources. These include, but are not limited to the following:
     •   Implementation of Best Management Practices (residential water surveys, plumbing
         retrofit, system water audits, etc.), high efficiency toilet rebate programs, lawn
         replacement programs and residential audits.
     •   Groundwater studies for the Midcoast area to identify the groundwater yield that may be
         safely taken. This study could eventually lead to the development of a Groundwater
         Management Plan (GWMP).
     •   The District may consider seawater desalination as a long-term option for water supply.
         However, at this time the District has concluded that water desalination would not be
         cost-effective.
     •   New well fields, well field improvements, creek diversion structures, pump stations,
         pipelines, and expansions to water treatment plants.

Water Connections
Development projects are required to have a water service connection in order to receive water,
but CCWD does not currently have an unlimited number of water service connections available.
Of the total 3,546 connections initially available to the district, 2,503 were available to non-
priority uses, and 1,043 were reserved for priority uses. Only 209 of these connections remain
unsold, all reserved for priority uses. For CCWD, priority uses include those identified in the Half
Moon Bay LCP and low- and very low-income housing as required by Section 65589.7 of the
Government Code. CCWD has reserved an additional 202.5 connections for low- and very low-
income residential units, meaning that a total of 411.5 unsold connections are potentially
available to accommodate the city’s RHNA for affordable housing development.
Though non-priority connections are no longer available for purchase from CCWD, property
owners and developers may find an entity with available allocations and arrange to purchase the
allocation at market rate. CCWD maintains a list of entities and details on the city’s uninstalled
                                                                                                           2-43

Plan Half Moon Bay
water connections. In 2009, the list contained five “owners” and the majority of entries had one
connection available. At the time, Ocean Colony Partners owned 71.5 water connections,
purchased in the late 1980s to finance part of CCWD’s Phase 1 improvements. The Carnoustie
project was anticipated to use 32 to 42 of these connections, with the remainder transferring to
another parcel within Ocean Colony or to an affiliated entity. The City contacted CCWD to
request an updated list of connections, but as of July 2014, no list has been received.
The district provides 3/4- and 5/8-inch connections. A single 5/8-inch connection may serve
more than one unit. For example, a 5/8-inch connection could serve a single-family home or a
multi-family building with multiple dwelling units. New service connections are quite expensive.
CCWD’s current FY 2013-2014 Rate and Fee Schedule indicates costs for new service connections
ranging from 5/8-inch to 4-inch at $15,169 to $455,069, approximately 4 percent to 55 percent
more expensive than equivalent connection sizes in neighboring Montara Sanitary and Water
District.
Summary
There is sufficient water supply and infrastructure capacity for Half Moon Bay to serve both
existing development and future development of housing units to meet its RHNA. CCWD has
water supplies and plans for conveyance infrastructure adequate to meet the service demand
projections of its service area, which includes the City of Half Moon Bay, through and beyond the
RHNA cycle. In the event that water demand increases at a rate greater than that projected by the
District in the 2010 UWMP, CCWD has options and opportunities to increase the amount of
available supply to meet demand.
Currently, CCWD has a limited number of connections available to serve new development. All
unsold connections are reserved for priority uses or affordable housing. Market rate development
projects that do not have an existing allocation may need to procure CCWD connections on the
open market, which will affect the timing and cost of development. Availability of water
connections is not considered a constraint to the development of lower and moderate income
housing.
Wastewater
Sanitary sewer service is provided by the City of Half Moon Bay and Granada Sanitary District
(GSD) for transporting sewage flows and Sewer Authority Mid-Coastside (SAM) for treating and
disposing the sewage. Sewer Authority Mid-Coastside is a public agency providing wastewater
treatment services to Montara Water and Sanitary District, Granada Sanitary District and Half
Moon Bay under a joint powers agreement. Each member agency of SAM is allotted maximum
capacity rights for Peak Wet Weather Flow (PWWF), Average Dry Weather Flow (ADWF),
Biochemical Oxygen Demand and Suspended Solids. These allocations correspond to the sewer
treatment capacity and the sewer transmission capacity.
Sanitary Sewer Infrastructure
The City of Half Moon Bay’s existing sanitary sewer system consists of approximately 37 miles of
sewer mains, approximately 3,100 laterals, and three lift stations. Granada Sanitary District’s

existing sanitary sewer system includes approximately 33 miles of sewer line and approximately
1,500 feet of force main running along Highway 1.
The Sewer Authority Mid-Coastside owns and operates an 8-mile stretch of transmission main,
also known as the Intertie Pipeline System (IPS). Four main lift stations are used to connect to the
three member agencies’ sewer distribution systems to the SAM Treatment Plant. Approximately
1.8-miles of the IPS are gravity mains, while the remaining portion is force main.
Treatment Capacity
The city’s Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan, amended in 1993, states that the wastewater
treatment plant will have insufficient capacity to meet projected growth based on the plant’s
Phase I projected capacity of 2.0 mgd. However, the wastewater treatment plant has since been
expanded and its current capacity is 4.0 mgd in ADWF. The 2008 SAM Sewer System
Management Plan (SSMP) indicates the treatment plant’s current ADWF is 1.7 mgd. According
to SAM, the ADWF discharged from Half Moon Bay for 2009 was 0.73 mgd, with average wet-
weather flows of 0.88 mgd, and an annual average flow of 0.8 mgd. This indicated flow increases
of more than 20 percent due to wet weather inflow, and adequate treatment capacity for average
flows.
According to the SAM 2008 SSMP, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Suspended Solids
are the parameters used to evaluate the treatment capacity required at the SAM treatment plant.
For any development project proposed in the City of Half Moon Bay, the average daily flow
would be based on the net increase produced by the site redevelopment and adjusted for BOD
and suspended solids.
SAM, the City of Half Moon Bay and the Granada Sanitary District have an ongoing capacity
management program to address hydraulic capacity issues within their District limits. The
Intertie Pipeline System that conveys wastewater from both districts to the SAM Treatment Plant
has had capacity issues, including surcharge in some manholes, during heavy rain periods in the
past.
The City of Half Moon Bay Public Works Department initiated a sewer system study in 2010 to
identify existing system deficiencies and prioritize improvements. The preliminary findings of the
study indicated that TV/video inspection of the 37 miles of sewer mains was necessary to help
identify locations causing capacity issues due to deteriorated pipes/joints, sags, blockages and tree
roots. Sewer main improvements/rehabilitation, flow monitoring, lift station upgrades, and map
updates are all items in the FY 2013/14 Capital Improvement Program budget.
The Granada Sanitary District has performed a sanitary sewer monitoring program that identified
inflow and infiltration at locations in the District’s collection system. Part of the proposed
mitigation measures for these locations include better mapping of the District’s collection system
followed by field verification of the locations and elevations to identify capacity issues.

Plan Half Moon Bay
Summary
The wastewater conveyance infrastructure in the City of Half Moon Bay and throughout the rest
of the SAM service area is in generally good condition, and various improvements have been
identified in order to ensure that the system continues to meet existing and projected wastewater
conveyance demands.
The SAM wastewater treatment system is permitted for 4.0 MGD in average dry weather flow
(ADWF). As of the 2008 SAM SSMP, SAM’s ADWF is 1.7 MGD. Therefore, there is adequate
treatment capacity to meet additional wastewater treatment demand, as the wastewater treatment
plant is currently treating less than 50 percent of its permitted ADWF treatment capacity. The
provision of wastewater treatment services to new residential development in the City of Half
Moon Bay does not constitute a constraint to implementation of the proposed Housing Element
Update.
Traffic and Roads
Half Moon Bay is connected to the region by state highways 1 and 92. The City’s policy, as
established in the LCP and the 2013 Circulation Element, is to maintain level of service (LOS) C
as the desired LOS on both highways except during the peak two-hour commuting period and the
10-day average peak recreational hour, during which times LOS E is acceptable.
LOS is a quality measure that describes operating conditions within a traffic stream. LOS
evaluation indicates the degree of congestion that occurs during peak travel periods and is the
principal measure of roadway and intersection performance. It is generally described in terms of
speed and travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, and comfort and convenience.
LOS can range from A (representing free-flow conditions) to F (representing extremely long
delays). LOS D is typically considered acceptable for a peak hour in urban areas. LOS E is
approaching capacity and LOS F represents conditions at or above capacity.
LOS evaluations for segments and intersections along the highways were conducted as part of the
2013 update to its General Plan Circulation Element. Analysis of LOS for 34 segments of the two
highways found that all surveyed segments were operating at LOS E or above during peak hours,
with the exception of the segment of Highway 1 between Terrace Avenue and Silver Avenue,
which was rated LOS F for PM peak hours. Analysis of 22 intersections along the highways found
all but two operating at LOS E or better during peak hours. The intersection at Highway 1 and
Terrace Avenue rated LOS F during Saturday peak hours, and the intersection at Highway 92 and
Main Street rated LOS F during AM, PM, and Saturday peak hours.
As individual development projects are proposed in Half Moon Bay, they are reviewed for their
potential to result in project-level traffic impacts or contribution to cumulative adverse traffic
conditions. Individual development projects are conditioned to provide traffic improvements to
reduce significant impacts, unless the City determines that there are considerations (such as
social, economic, or other benefits from a project) that override the project’s contribution to
adverse traffic impacts.

Environmental Constraints
Residential development in Half Moon Bay is constrained by the presence of environmental
resources and hazards, which are addressed by policies in the LCP.
The LCP prohibits development that would significantly impact environmentally sensitive habitat
areas (ESHAs) as defined by the California Coastal Act, and limits the types of land uses allowed
in such areas. The presence of sensitive habitats, specifically ESHAs, affects project design,
requires additional surveys and reviews, may require additional permitting from state agencies,
and may require development of measures to avoid and/or minimize impacts to sensitive habitats
and species. Addressing these impacts can increase the cost of a project and may delay the
timeframe for construction of a project.
The LCP also requires mitigation measures to minimize impacts to archaeological resources. An
archaeological report is required for projects located within any designated archaeological
resource area or within 100 feet of any recorded archaeological site identified in the LUP.
Necessary studies and mitigation measures may add to the cost of a project and add to the
project’s time requirements.
The city is subject to a number of hydrologic and geologic hazards, and is exposed to potential
coastal hazards related to sea-level rise. Constraints associated with these hazards will influence
future development efforts and may require measures to minimize impacts. Generally, areas of
particular hazard including flood zones, tsunami inundation zones, and dam inundation areas
located along the coastline and the city’s waterways, as well as areas with landslide and erosion
potential. Geologic hazards are generally moderate to low within the city, though some areas of
high landslide risk exist along the eastern edge of the city.
Some hazard types, such as flood and tsunami inundation zones, have been previously delineated
and policies have been adopted that discourage or regulate development proximate to these areas.
Delineation of areas susceptible to sea-level rise is underway as part of the city’s General Plan and
LCP Update process. The LCP requires Geological Reports for areas in geologically hazardous
areas as well as areas of coastal hazard, such as bluff edges, and where development may affect
coastal and geologic stability, with mitigation measures implemented where necessary. The LCP
also limits new development in areas where flooding due to tsunami or dam failure has taken
place, on bluff faces, and on bluff and cliff tops. Thus, hazards constrain development both in
terms of location, and in terms of affordability, as geotechnical engineering, grading and lot
preparation costs to reduce these potential hazards can increase the cost and time requirements of
development.

Plan Half Moon Bay
2.2 Non-Governmental Constraints
Non-governmental constraints are primarily market driven, and include land costs, the cost of
construction, and availability of housing. Such constraints can affect the city’s potential to develop
housing projects
LAND AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS
Land costs in San Mateo County are high, due in part to the desirability of housing in the county,
and because available land is in short supply. These costs vary both between and within
jurisdictions based on factors like the desirability of the location and the permitted density. For a
typical multi-family construction in San Mateo County, land costs add approximately $90,000 per
unit. Land for a single-family home often costs $400,000 or more per lot. In Half Moon Bay, costs
for entitled land may range from $60 to $70/sf. Costs for land without entitlements may range
from $45 to $55/sf. These land costs are approximate and were derived from conversations with
local developers.
Construction costs include both hard costs, such as labor and materials, and soft costs, such as
architectural and engineering services, development fees, and insurance. For multi-family homes
in San Mateo County, hard costs account of 60 to 65 percent of the building cost and soft costs
average around 15 to 20 percent (the remaining 15 to 20 percent is land costs). For single-family
homes, hard costs often are roughly 40 percent of the total cost, soft costs are 20 percent, and land
is 40 percent.
According to housing developers in San Mateo County, construction costs for multi-unit
buildings vary based on the form of parking (structured vs. surface) in addition to other
environmental factors such as topography, pre-existing structures etc. For a larger, multi-unit
building, costs can vary from $185,000 per unit to as high as $316,000 per unit. The cost per
square foot ranges from $172 to $200. For the least expensive production single-family homes, the
cost of preparing the vacant land is around $100,000 per lot, and the cost of construction is
approximately $145/sf. For more expensive, custom homes, however, the construction costs can
be higher than $435/sf. In general, soft costs add another approximate third to the subtotal. In
Half Moon Bay, hard costs for new construction can range from $200 to $300/sf, with single-
family construction generally costing less than multi-family construction.
MORTGAGE FINANCING
One of the most significant factors related to the provision of adequate housing for all segments of
the population is the availability of financing. Even small changes in the interest rate for home
purchases can dramatically affect affordability. For example, a 30-year home loan for $400,000 at
5 percent interest has monthly payments of roughly $2,150 while a similar home loan at 7 percent
interest has payments of roughly 20 percent more, or $2,660.
Table 2-10 shows the average annual mortgage interest rates for the United States in the years
2000 to 2013. As shown, since 2007 interest rates have dropped significantly to an average of 3.98
percent in 2013.

 on 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgages
Until mid-2008, home mortgage financing was readily available at attractive rates throughout San
Mateo County and California. Rates varied, but ranged around 6.25 percent to 7 percent from
2006-2008 for a 30-year fixed rate loan (HSH Associates Financial Publishers). However, rates
have been as high as 10 or 12 percent in the last decade.
As part of the aftermath of the subprime crisis in 2008, interest rates are very low. In San Mateo
County, 2013 rates range from 4.0 to 4.5 percent for a fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage. One
remaining challenge is that many mortgages in San Mateo County are for more than $417,000,
meaning that they qualify as jumbo loans and often have higher interest rates.
The data in Table 2-11 is from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and represents loan
applications in 2012 for one- to four-unit properties, as well as manufactured homes. More than
65 percent of the loan applications were filed by households earning above a moderate income
(greater than 120 percent of area median income [AMI]). Moderate-income households (80 to
120 percent of AMI) represented 18 percent of loan applicants, low-income households (50-80
percent of AMI) represent 12 percent, and very low-income households (less than 50 percent of
AMI) only 4 percent. Almost 75 percent of all loans were approved and accepted by the
applicants, and 10 percent were denied. Above moderate-income households had the highest
rates of approval of any group. Loan approval rates have improved since the subprime crisis.
                                                                                                2-49
Plan Half Moon Bay
CONSTRUCTION FINANCING
Construction loans for new housing are difficult to secure in the current market. In past years,
lenders would provide up to 80 percent of the cost of new construction (loan to value ratio). In
recent years, due to market conditions and government regulations, banks require larger
investments by the builder.
Due to Federal and state budget cuts, affordable housing developers have had a much harder time
securing funding. Since 2009, the Federal Government has cut programs such as Community
Development Block Grants, HOME, and HOPE VI funding by 27 to 50 percent (Association of
Bay Area Governments [ABAG]). Traditionally, these programs have been a large source of
affordable housing funds. In addition to Federal cuts, the State dissolved Redevelopment agencies
in 2012, leaving San Mateo County with a loss of $25.5 million in funds for affordable housing.
However, Low Income Housing Tax Credits still provide an important source of funding, so it is
important for jurisdictions to consider which sites are eligible for affordable housing
development. MidPen Housing Corporation has agreed to help jurisdictions identify appropriate
sites.

3         Resources
This section discusses resources available for the accommodation and development of the city’s
housing needs. One of the most important resources is adequate land to accommodate future
housing. Other resources include financial assistance programs for the development and
maintenance of housing, supportive services provided to special needs populations, and
incentives provided by the City to encourage the development of housing affordable to all income
levels.
3.1 Housing Site Inventory
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION
Half Moon Bay was allocated 240 housing units as part of the 2014-2022 Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) process. This allocation was determined by the San Mateo County Subregion,
an ad hoc Joint Powers Authority formed to locally administer the RHNA process using the
housing needs allocation established by the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) for
the subregion. Table 3-1 identifies Half Moon Bay’s portion of the 2014-2022 allocation.

Plan Half Moon Bay
ANALYSIS OF DENSITY AND UNIT YIELD
Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3) requires a jurisdiction to either: provide an analysis
demonstrating how adopted densities accommodate the need for lower-income households, or to
use default densities deemed appropriate for metropolitan, suburban, and rural areas. Half Moon
Bay is considered a suburban area and the default density for lower-income housing needs is 20
dwelling units per acre (du/ac) for suburban areas. However, Half Moon Bay is a fairly unique
suburban area in that it is entirely within the Coastal Zone, all development projects require a
Coastal Development Permit, and the road system serving Half Moon Bay is considered
constrained by the California Coastal Commission. For these reasons, development in Half Moon
Bay often occurs at lower densities than would be typical for most suburban communities.
In order to address the unique characteristics and achievable densities in Half Moon Bay,
historical densities of very low- and low-income units are analyzed in order to demonstrate the
appropriate zoning districts to use in determining adequate sites. The majority of very low- and
low-income housing units in Half Moon Bay have been constructed in the past 20 years, with a
number of senior affordable units constructed since 2012. Table 3-2 identifies the density range
associated with very low-, low-, and moderate-income units.

Very Low and Low Income
As demonstrated in Table 3-2, it is feasible to provide very low- and low-income units with
densities ranging from 14.3 dwelling units/acre (du/ac) to 29.0 du/ac. The average density for very
low-income units was 24.8 du/ac, and the average density for low-income units was 20.3 du/ac;
the combined average for very low- and low-income units was 23.7 du/ac. Based on the range of
densities that can be used to achieve production of very low- and low-income units in Half Moon
Bay, it is anticipated that the R-2 (16.13 maximum du/ac), R-3 (29.04 maximum du/ac), and
Planned Unit Development (PUD) (density ranges to be defined in planned unit development
plans at time of development) districts are appropriate to accommodate very low- and low-
income development.

Moderate Income
Moderate-income units that were restricted to a specific sales price or rental range had densities
ranging from 12.9 to 14.3 du/ac. However, it is noted that a median sales-priced market-rate
condominium is affordable to moderate-income households and market-rate rents are affordable
to moderate-income households. For this reason, it is anticipated that the R-2, PUD, and R-1
zoning districts are appropriate for moderate-income development. Maximum densities in these
districts range from 8.71 du/ac in the R-1 district to 16.13 du/ac in the R-2 district. Densities in
PUD districts are determined in the planned unit development plans submitted at the time of
development for each area, consistent with policies in the LCP.
Below Market Rate Ordinance
The city’s Below Market Rate (BMR) Ordinance requires all development projects of 10 or more
units to include a specified number of very low-, low-, and moderate- income units. The BMR
requirements for a 10-unit project would likely be one low- and one moderate-income unit while
a 70-unit subdivision would likely require four very low-, five low-, and five moderate-income
units. The BMR unit requirements may be satisfied off-site and in-lieu fees may be paid where
there is a requirement for a portion of a unit. In certain circumstances and upon request, the City
Council may also approve a contribution to the City’s in-lieu fee fund in an amount equal to 20
percent of the building permit valuation of the market rate units. Since subdivisions in Half Moon
Bay tend to be less than 70 units in size, the number of required BMR units for future
development is anticipated to be accommodated by smaller parcels and would not entail
development of large affordable housing complexes. For example, if future developments result in
BMR requirements from two to six very low-, low-, and moderate-income units, these units
would likely be accommodated through development of existing single-family and two-family
parcels.
AVAILABLE HOUSING SITES
Approximately 118 acres of residential or commercial land were identified that are both suitable
for residential development and constitute realistic sites for residential development. Available
sites could yield approximately 504 housing units (Table 3-3). There is adequate capacity on these
residentially- or commercially-zoned sites to accommodate Half Moon Bay’s 2014-2022 RHNA.
Appendix A includes an inventory of each site by assessor’s parcel number, acreage, General
Plan/LCP land use designation, zoning district, maximum unit yield, and realistic unit yield.
Figure 3-1 identifies the location of available housing sites in the city.

Sites considered appropriate for residential development included those zoned to allow residential
development. There are two primary types of sites:
      1. Residential Only – These sites allow only residential use and include sites zoned Single-
          Family Residential (R-1, R-1-B1, R-1-B-2, R-1-B-3), Two-Family Residential (R-2), and
          Multi-Family Residential (R-3). There is adequate capacity on these sites to accommodate
          the city’s RHNA, including adequate capacity in the R2 and R3 districts to accommodate
          the city’s very low- and low-income housing needs.
      2. Multiple Uses Allowed – These sites are designated to allow a range of uses, including
          residential uses, and include sites zoned as Commercial Downtown (CD).
The city also has a number of Planned Unit Development (PUD) areas which may be designated
for a variety of uses, including residential uses, by the LCP. The LCP also describes development
conditions for each PUD, including the maximum number of residential units that may be
anticipated. Due to the complexities of development in these areas, they have not been included in
the inventory of sites demonstrating the city’s ability to meet its RHNA. However, information on
these sites is included this chapter to show additional capacity.

Additional districts that allow residential uses include Commercial Visitor Serving, and
Commercial General and Urban Reserve. Available sites in these commercial districts were not
included because it is more likely that non-residential uses will be developed on the majority of
these sites than residential uses. The Urban Reserve sites were not included in the inventory
because these sites are not anticipated for development in the immediate future. These sites may
provide capacity for future Housing Element cycles when development of infill and PUD areas
has occurred to a much greater extent.
Density and Unit Yield Assumptions
For each site, a “maximum unit yield” is identified based on development of the entire site at the
maximum density allowed under the zoning designation. For the R-2, R-3, and commercial sites,
a “maximum units with density bonus” is identified based on development of the site with a
project eligible to receive a density bonus. These numbers are provided to exemplify the
maximum development that could occur on sites. Development at these maximum densities is
unlikely for many sites, so a “realistic yield” has been calculated for each site.
A number of assumptions, which varied by zoning district, were made to determine the realistic
unit yield anticipated for individual parcels. Where environmental constraints, such as stream
corridors and land above the 160-foot contour line, were identified on project sites, the
developable acreage was reduced accordingly.
R-1, R-1-B-1, and R-1-B-2: The parcels in the R-1, R-1-B-1, and R-1-B-2 zoning districts have
mostly been subdivided into individual parcels with infrastructure and roadway access available.
Realistic unit yield was calculated based on development at the maximum allowed density (5.81
du/ac in the R-1-B-1 district, 7.26 du/ac in the R-1-B-2 district and 8.71 du/ac in the R-1 district).
Most parcels would yield a single unit – if the density calculation indicated that 1.01 to 1.99 units
would be allowed, that figure was rounded down to a single unit as that is the most likely
development scenario for the parcel. If a parcel would yield less than one unit based on density,
the unit yield was determined to be 0 if the lot size was less than 2,500 square feet. Parcels of 2,500
square feet or larger can accommodate one unit, given the city’s development standards that are
intended to allow for the development of substandard and severely substandard lots. It should be
noted that area measurements for this inventory were based on a geographic information system
(GIS) analysis, and that there are a number of sites measured as less than 2,500 square feet that
may still be appropriate for residential development.
R-1-B-3: Parcels in the R-1-B-3 zoning district have mostly been subdivided into individual
parcels with roadway access available. The single parcel identified as a potential site for future
residential development is not currently served by formal roadways and is large enough to
accommodate more than one dwelling unit if further subdivided. Realistic unit yield was
calculated based on development at the maximum allowed density (4.36 du/ac). If the density
calculation indicated that 1.01 to 1.99 units would be allowed, that figure was rounded down to a
single unit as that is the most likely development scenario for the parcel.
R-2 and R-3: All R-2 and R-3 parcels are essentially infill parcels, located in areas served by
infrastructure and with existing roadways. These sites are not anticipated to lose much unit yield
in the site design process. Several sites were identified as having potential constraints associated
                                                                                                    3-7

Plan Half Moon Bay
with streams, potential flooding or wetlands, and rights-of-way, and the developable area of these
sites was reduced accordingly in determining development potential. To provide a conservative
estimate of unit yield, a ‘realistic unit yield’ was developed based on developing parcels at 90
percent of maximum allowed density (14.52 du/ac in the R-2 district and 26.18 du/ac in the R-3
district) after reducing the net developable area by any identified environmental constraints or
rights-of-way. To ensure that development potential is not overstated, the total number of units
was rounded down for each parcel, so a remainder of 0.01 to 0.99 units was reduced to 0. For
example, if there were three parcels that each could accommodate 4.65 units, only four units were
counted for each parcel.
Commercial Downtown: The CD sites are primarily parcels that have already been subdivided,
have available infrastructure, and provide infill opportunities. The CD sites were calculated to
develop at 90 percent of the maximum R-2 density, 16.13 du/ac, to account for any needed on-site
infrastructure improvements and open space, but the realistic unit yield anticipates that only half
of these sites would be developed with residential use, since the commercial zones allow
residential uses as well as offices and other low-commercial uses, and the CD zone allows for both
residential and commercial uses.
Very Low- and Low-Income Sites
Development of very low- and low-income units is anticipated to occur primarily in the R-2 and
R-3 zones, based on available sites and historical development trends. As shown in Table 3-4,
there are 5.34 acres of R-2 sites with a realistic yield of 61 units and 1.66 acres of R-3 sites with a
realistic unit yield of 27 units. Thus, there is adequate capacity to accommodate the 83 very low-
and low-income allocations from the 2014-2022 RHNA cycle.

Table 3-5 includes a more detailed summary of available R-3 sites, showing where some smaller
adjacent lots could be combined into single projects as well as individual infill lots. Consolidated
lots could allow development of a 12-unit project and a 7-unit project. The remaining R-3 lots
could be developed with three to four units apiece. Program 2-4 in the Housing Plan encourages
development of small, substandard, and extremely substandard lots with affordable housing
through relaxing the existing development standards that significantly reduced the buildable area
on these lots. Program 2-4 also encourages and facilitates the consolidation of smaller lots.

Moderate-income units are anticipated to be accommodated by the R-1, R-2, and CD zones based
on historical development trends, though if R-2 sites are required for very low- or low-income
developments, these would then be unavailable for moderate-income development. As shown in
Table 3-6, there is adequate capacity to accommodate the city’s 36-unit fair share of moderate-
income units, even after R-2 units are set aside for very low- and low-income development. Infill
opportunities in the R-1 and R-2 zoning districts will accommodate moderate-income units.

Above Moderate-Income Sites
Above moderate-income units are anticipated to be accommodated by the R-1-B-1, R-2-B-2, and
R-1-B-3 districts, which have larger lot size requirements than the R-1 district. As shown in Table
3-7, there are approximately 91 acres of land zoned solely for single family units—R-1-B-1, R-2-
B-2, and R-1-B-3—which would be appropriate for development of above moderate-income
units. These sites have a realistic yield of 308 housing units. There is adequate capacity to
accommodate the 121-unit allocation for the 2014-2022 cycle for above moderate-income units.

Additionally, the City is reviewing an application for the subdivision of an R-2 site (APN 064-
352-150) into eight residential lots. The site is currently being used as vehicle space for an
adjoining car dealership. If approved, the project would create the potential for eight additional
units not included in the inventory, at a density of 6.29 du/ac.
Extremely Low Income and Special Needs Households
Chapter 2, Constraints, identifies uses allowed by the Zoning Code and discusses the
accommodation of units for extremely low-income and special needs households, including the
disabled and homeless. Available sites in the R-3 and specified commercial zoning designations
will accommodate extremely low-income and special needs households.
Additional Residential Development Potential on PUD Sites
The capacity for each PUD area is based on the number of units identified in the LCP. Potential
unit yield is not determined for each PUD parcel but for each PUD as a whole because the LCP
specifies development potential for each entire PUD area. Capacity and assumptions for each
PUD area are discussed in the Additional Residential Development Potential subsection below.
There is additional development potential for 457 residential units in areas designated PUD, as
shown in Table 3-8. Program 2-5 in the Housing Plan encourages provision of affordable and/or
high density residential units on PUD sites in order to help ensure that lower-and moderate-
income units are part of any market rate development that may occur in these PUDs. As
previously described, the city has adequate sites in its residential zones to accommodate its
housing needs, and the PUD sites provide development capacity beyond that necessary to
accommodate the city’s housing needs allocation. These PUD sites are designated for
urbanization as part of the city’s long-term plan for growth as envisioned in the 1993 Local
Coastal Program. Development of most of the PUD areas is not expected to occur during the

2014-2022 Housing Element cycle. Some of the PUD areas are constrained by potential habitat for
special-status species, the need to extend roadways and improve intersections that will serve the
PUD sites, and water and sewer allocations. However, the city still has adequate sites to meet its
RHNA even if none of the PUD sites were to develop during the planning period.

The 1993 Local Coastal Program (LCP) identifies development that can occur on each of the PUD
areas and also describes the number of residential units and acreages or portions of each PUD
designated for residential uses. The PUDs allow for clustering of units to avoid wetlands, slopes,
and other site constraints. The general location of the PUD areas is shown in Figure 3-1. PUDs in
the figure generally follow the city’s PUD zoning districts which may differ from the PUD areas as
originally described in the LCP. Acreages have been updated to reflect the size of current PUD
delineations. The PUD areas described below are those where there is a potential for residential
development, or where residential development was discussed in the LCP. Other PUDs not
described here are not considered to have residential development potential.
Surf Beach/Dunes Beach
The Surf Beach/Dunes Beach PUD consists of approximately 51 acres, 25 of which are available
for residential development. LCP policies for this site allow development of up to 150 residential
units. The LCP notes that residential development could result in severe constraints on access and
                                                                                                         3-11

conflicts between residential uses and visitor access and identifies requirements to reduce impacts
to views and requires that development include commercial and recreation uses.
Venice Beach Area
The Venice Beach Area PUD is approximately 43 acres, 24 of which are available for additional
residential development. LCP policies for this site identify a maximum capacity of 75 residential
units. This PUD is partially developed and may accommodate additional residential units.
Wavecrest
The Wavecrest PUD area, which includes North Wavecrest and South Wavecrest, has a number
of paper subdivisions in scattered ownership. The North Project Area is the largest single
undeveloped area in Half Moon Bay, approximately 490 acres. The South Project Area consists of
approximately 130 acres. The LCP identifies this PUD as a site that will enable the city to meet its
fair share of existing and projected regional housing needs by providing up to 1,000 housing
units, at least 20 percent of which must be affordable to persons of low and moderate income.
Development is required to be clustered to the maximum extent feasible and no new residential
structures are allowed west of the extension of Miramontes Point Road.
In 1999, the City Council approved a project in the Wavecrest PUD. The project included 279
housing units, including 54 Below Market Rate units, commercial space, open space and
recreational areas, a new middle school, and a site for a Boys and Girls Club. The Coastal
Commission considered appeals against the project and, during Coastal Commission review, the
number of units in the project was reduced, commercial uses removed, and a number of new
conditions imposed, including retirement of lots. After an extensive wait, revisions to the project,
and on-going controversy, the developer sold the 206-acre property to the Peninsula Open Space
Trust (POST) for open space conservation. A number of other open space trusts, including the
Coastside Land Trust, have also acquired land in the Wavecrest area. These sites are not
anticipated to be developed.
Additionally, areas of the Wavecrest PUD have been identified as habitat for wildlife species
protected under state and federal laws. Development of these areas would require avoidance or
replacement of habitat and preparation of plans to conserve special-status species and their
habitat.
Due to the variety of constraints to developing the Wavecrest PUD, including habitat for special-
status species, a large number of paper lots and numerous owners, that would have to be
addressed in order to develop this site, this PUD is not included in the estimate of potential PUD
residential sites.
Dykstra Ranch (Pacific Ridge)
The Dykstra Ranch PUD is a parcel of 114 acres of gentle to steep slopes on the southern edge of
the city. Areas of steep slopes are not developable. The Pacific Ridge development has been
approved for this site and includes 63 units that have not yet been constructed. These units are
included in the sites inventory. The LCP would have allowed up to 228 residential units in this

PUD. Pacific Ridge was initially approved by City Council for 197 units. The approval was
appealed to the California Coastal Commission, which reduced the project size to 126 units.
Following litigation, the Settlement Agreement with the Coastal Commission further reduced
development potential to 63 homes (no more than 285,000 square feet total and each home no
more than 5,000 square feet), a requirement for payment of in-lieu cumulative traffic fees of
$45,000 per home (fee to be used by City to retire development rights on existing lots), and
roadway improvements in the vicinity of Terrace Avenue and Highway 1. The Settlement
Agreement also requires the City to seek to amend the LCP to include a lot retirement program.
Carter Hill
The Carter Hill PUD consists of about 56 acres in 10 parcels. This differs from the 47-acre, 4-
parcel area originally described in the LCP. Up to 50 residential units, including single-family
attached and garden apartments, are allowed under the LCP. However, given environmental
constraints, this site is only anticipated to yield approximately 25 units.
Miramar Beach
This PUD consists of about 2 acres and will allow up to 15 residential units, including existing
units, under the LCP. This PUD is mostly developed and is not anticipated to accommodate
additional residential units.
Guerrero Avenue
This PUD consists of about 5 acres and will allow up to 46 residential units under the LCP. This
PUD is mostly developed and is not anticipated to accommodate additional residential units.
Matteucci
This PUD contains 14 acres (now larger than the 5.5 acres described in the LCP) and will allow up
to 42 residential units under the LCP. However, some of the lots in this PUD have been sold with
adjacent single-family homes and are not anticipated to be developed. Therefore, this PUD may
accommodate an additional two units.
Podesta/Silvera
The Podesta/Silvera PUD contains about 35 acres of land, including a 30-acre parcel fronting the
Cabrillo Highway. LCP policies state that residential development is permitted up to 40 percent of
the gross area; the remaining area shall be industrial. The residential portion (up to 13.8 acres)
may have up to 125 units. The site can be built in up to three phases, with each phase required to
include both commercial/industrial and residential development.

Cypress Cove Undeveloped/Andreotti
The Andreotti PUD includes 24 acres and must be developed with commercial and residential
uses. Residential development is permitted on up to 40 percent of the site (9.6 acres) and the LCP
permits up to 130 residential units, an average of 13.5 units per acre. The Cypress Cove project is
located on the Andreotti PUD and has developed most of this site.
L.C. Smith
The L.C. Smith PUD contains about 5 acres of land between Cabrillo Highway and South Main
Street. An entry feature to the city is required to be placed on a 5,000 square foot area at the
southern end of the parcel. Residential development of two- to three- stories with densities
compatible with surrounding uses is allowed. Surrounding uses include Main Street Park Phases 1
and 2, developed at 18.3 and 14.8 units per acre, respectively. For purposes of the available sites
inventory, this PUD would be appropriate for very low- and low-income units due to the allowed
densities. A commercial development has recently been proposed for this site, so it has been
excluded from the PUD sites inventory.
Nurserymen’s Exchange
This PUD includes 36 acres and was limited by the LCP to residential development at an overall
density of one unit per 7,500 square feet, with a maximum of 80 units. This site is now occupied
by a horticultural operation.
3.2 Local Financial Resources
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND (INCLUSIONARY HOUSING FEES)
The Affordable Housing Fund is the only source of local funding that the City can directly access
to use towards the development of affordable housing. It is funded by the collection of in-lieu fees
from the Below Market Rate Housing program. The projected balance at the end of the 2013/2014
fiscal year is $1.05 million. Contributors to the fund include the Carnoustie and Spyglass
developments. Program 2-7 is included in the Housing Plan to facilitate the utilization of these
funds to support development of affordable housing in the city.
URBAN COUNTY AND HOME CONSORTIUM
The City of Half Moon Bay is part of the County of San Mateo’s Urban County and HOME
Consortium, which gives the City and city residents access to the housing rehabilitation, new
housing construction, and homebuyer assistance programs, as well as community services,
funded through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Housing Investments
Partnership Program HOME funds, which are administered by San Mateo County on behalf of
the Urban County and HOME Consortium. For the fiscal year 2014/2015, the Home
Consortium’s anticipated resources include a $3.2 million from the CDBG program (including
program income and prior year resources), $198,584 in Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG), and a
$1.1 million from the HOME program (including program income and prior year resources).
None of these funds goes directly to Half Moon Bay. Program 2-8 is included in the Housing Plan

to seek annual funding from the County and other sources to help the city plan for its housing
needs. Consortium funds have been provided to developments in the city.
The primary objective for CDBG funding is to develop viable urban communities, principally for
low- and moderate-income persons. Eligible CDBG activities include: housing assistance
programs; public improvement projects, such as parks and infrastructure; land acquisition;
business assistance programs that promote economic development; programs that support
community organizations that work directly with low- and moderate-income residents; and
planning and administration.
The HOME program is authorized under Title II of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable
Housing Act that was signed into law on November 28, 1990. The intent of the HOME Program is
to expand the supply of decent, safe, sanitary and affordable housing for very low- and low-
income households.
The ESG program is authorized under subtitle B of Title IV of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless
Assistance Act of 1987. This program is designed to prevent homelessness and to enable homeless
individuals and families to move toward independent living. Funds can be used toward essential
services, homeless prevention, and operation of homeless shelters and the overall program.
Housing Rehabilitation Program
The Consortium provides a housing rehabilitation program operated by the San Mateo County
Department of Housing. These loans are available to lower-income Half Moon Bay households
and cover moderate or substantial rehabilitation to single-family residences and rental properties
that benefit very low- and low-income households. A companion Hazardous Materials Rehab
Loan Program provides funding for the testing, assessment, mitigation and/or abatement of
hazardous materials and/or conditions (such as lead based paint, asbestos, mold, etc.). Funding is
limited based on overall funding levels received from the federal government.
Home Buyer Assistance
The Consortium is not currently providing home buyer assistance loans or grants. However, the
County does administer the Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (MCC) which provides a 15
percent federal tax credit to eligible homebuyers. The program is available throughout the county
and its cities.
Homesharing Program
The Homesharing Program is operated by Human Investment Project (HIP) Housing, a non-
profit organization whose mission is to enable people with special needs to live independent, self-
sufficient lives in decent, safe, low-cost homes. The HIP provides a homesharing program, which
facilitates a living arrangement in which two or more unrelated people share a home or
apartment. HIP also operates a self-sufficiency program, which provides housing help and
supportive services to low- income families transitioning to self-reliance. Additionally, HIP offers
a home equity conversion program, which allows senior homeowners to convert the equity in
                                                                                               3-15

their homes into monthly income, without giving up their property. Staff provides counseling
regarding housing options.
HOMELESS PROGRAMS
Center on Homelessness
As part of the Consortium, Half Moon Bay participates in homeless services funded through the
Consortium’s CDBG and ESG funds. The Center on Homelessness administers homeless services
on behalf of the Consortium, including the City of Half Moon Bay. The Center on Homelessness
provides the following:
     •   Coordinates the provisions of homeless services administered throughout the County,
         including those by non-governmental entities.
     •   Provides information and referral.
     •   Administers the County's Continuum of Care, as a service system to assist homeless
         individuals and families in attaining self-sufficiency.
     •   Develops resources to help the homeless individuals and families.
Housing Our People Effectively (HOPE)
HOPE is a 10-year action plan that brings together the business, nonprofit, and public sector
communities to address the challenging issue of homelessness at its core, rather than manage it at
the margins. This plan reflects the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors' goal that housing
should exist in the community for people at all income levels and all generations of families --
including those who are extremely low income or who are homeless. HOPE is based on a belief
that this goal can be achieved through proactive, coordinated action and investments in cost-
effective initiatives that solve homelessness.
Coastside HOPE
Previously known as the Coastside Opportunity Center, Coastside HOPE is chartered by San
Mateo County to be a core human services agency. It is headquartered in El Granada and
provides assistance to homeless individuals and families in the form of food pantry services, rental
assistance, motel vouchers, and referrals for homeless resources in Half Moon Bay and the
county. Motel vouchers are issued for a maximum of three days for families and individuals.
During fiscal year 2012-2013, Coastside HOPE served over 3,500 qualifying individuals, including
providing seven instances of emergency shelter service and issuing a total of 28 motel vouchers.

SECTION 8 HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS AND HACSM PROGRAMS
Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program
The Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo (HACSM) operates the County-wide Section
8 Housing Choice Voucher Program for the county and its incorporated cities. As of June 2, 2014,
there were 4,374 households in San Mateo County using Section 8 Vouchers, including 88
households in Half Moon Bay.
The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program provides monthly rental assistance payments to
private landlords on behalf of low-income families who have been determined eligible by the
Housing Authority. The program's objective is to assist low-income families by providing rental
assistance so that families may lease safe, decent, and sanitary housing units in the private rental
market. The program is designed to allow families to move without the loss of housing assistance.
Moves are permissible as long as the family notifies the Housing Authority ahead of time,
terminates its existing lease within the lease provisions, and finds acceptable alternate housing.
Section 8 Project-Based Program
The Section 8 Project-Based program is a component of the Housing Choice Voucher program.
The program's objective is to induce property owners to make standard housing available to low-
income families at rents within the program limits. In return, the Housing Authority enters into a
contract with the owner that guarantees a certain level of rents. As of 2013, there were 17 different
Project-Based properties, with 611 units in the county, including 60 units at Half Moon Village in
Half Moon Bay. Under the Project-Based program, the assistance is tied to the unit. A family who
moves from the Project-Based unit does not have any right to continued housing assistance.
Moving to Work Program
HUD introduced Moving To Work (MTW) in 1996 as a demonstration program for 24 housing
authorities. HUD grants MTW agencies exceptions to federal regulations to research whether
local innovation can provide incentives to families to become economically self-sufficient, reduce
program costs and achieve greater cost-effectiveness, or increase housing choice for low-income
families. HACSM is one of 33 housing authorities that participate in this program.
Under the original agreement with HUD, HACSM was authorized to design and carry out a
demonstration program for 300 families receiving tenant-based assistance. The demonstration
exempted HACSM from most of the regulatory requirements that would otherwise apply to these
families. In April 2008, HUD signed a 10-year MTW Agreement with HACSM to expand its
MTW program. Under the new MTW Agreement, HACSM is given the authorization to develop
policies that are outside the limitations of certain HUD regulations and provisions of the Housing
Act of 1937. This expansion applies to the original MTW demonstration program of 300 families
in addition to the other Housing Choice Voucher programs administered by HACSM. In April
2008, HACSM received approval from HUD to extend the MTW Program until June 30, 2018.
The three major goals for the MTW program are to provide incentives and assistance to families
to become economically self-sufficient, reduce program costs and achieve greater cost
                                                                                                 3-17

effectiveness, and increase housing choice for low-income families. The additional flexibility
offered by MTW allows HACSM to more successfully achieve its mission and program goals, as
well as enhance its ability to serve the needs of low-income households and communities in San
Mateo County. The Half Moon Village Redevelopment project in Half Moon Bay has received
support through this program.
Shelter Plus Care Program
The Shelter Plus Care Program is a collaboration between the Mental Health Association of San
Mateo County, HACSM, and the Mental Health Services Division of San Mateo County. The
Housing Authority provides housing subsidies for privately owned apartments throughout the
community; MHA provides support services; and the Mental Health Services Division of San
Mateo County provides clinical services. Combined, these services help provide housing to
homeless people with disabilities, primarily those with serious illness, chronic problems with
alcohol and/or drugs, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or related diseases. The
goals of the Shelter Plus Care Program are to assist the participants to achieve residential stability,
to increase their skill levels and/or income, and to be involved in making decisions that affect
their own lives.
Supportive Housing
The Supportive Housing Program provides rental assistance that, as part of the Continuum of
Care strategy, promotes the development of housing and supportive services to assist homeless
persons with disabilities in the transition from streets and shelters to permanent housing. The
goal of this program is to use housing as a vehicle to engage participants into support services,
remain engaged with services, and gradually move into mainstream health and other service
systems, that will result in greater self-determination and sufficiency.
Family Self-Sufficiency Program (FSS)
The purpose of FSS is to provide housing assistance using public and private resources that will
help families achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency. FSS believes that when a
family's basic needs for affordable and stable housing are met, the family can better focus on other
needs, such as skill development and job search.
FSS is designed for Section 8 program participants and/or public housing residents. Currently, the
HACSM manages the FSS program for Section 8 participants only, not public housing residents.
Though only the designated head of the household must sign the FSS Contract of Participation,
the program is designed for the whole family and everybody's needs are taken into account. FSS
programs partner with other service providers, such as employment and training agencies,
community colleges, job search and placement organizations, alcohol and drug services, childcare
providers, youth organizations, older adult services, health services, emergency services, credit
counselors, the local CalWORKs office, and many more.

HACSM Time-Limited Self-Sufficiency Program
The Time-Limited Self-Sufficiency Program provides time-limited housing assistance to homeless
individuals or families, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) recipients or low-
income families who are eligible to receive other county services. Housing assistance is time-
limited according to the specific program designs and the HACSM policy. Case management and
participation in self-sufficiency activities are mandatory. The Self-Sufficiency (SS) contract
requires program participants and all their adult family members to be off welfare assistance and
the head of household must be gainfully employed by the end of the contract term. Escrow
accounts will be established based on achievement of self-sufficiency goals. Application to the SS
program is by referral made by HACSM recognized referring agencies only.
HACSM Family Unification Program (FUP)
The Family Unification Program is a collaborative effort between the Housing Authority and the
San Mateo County Children and Family Services, a Public Child Welfare Agency (PCWA). FUP
provides housing assistance to families for whom the lack of adequate housing is a primary factor
in the separation (or threat of imminent separation) of children from their families, or is
preventing the reunification of children with their families. The Family Unification Program also
provides housing assistance to youth aging out of the foster care system. In order to qualify as a
FUP-eligible youth, individuals must be between the ages of 18-21, in foster care on or after their
16th birthday and currently lack adequate housing. The housing assistance provided to the youth
in this program is for a maximum of 18 months.
3.3 Other State and Federal Financial Resources
LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM (LIHTC)
In 1986, Congress created the federal low-income housing tax credit to encourage private
investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation, and construction of low-income rental housing.
Because high housing costs in California make it difficult, even with federal credits, to produce
affordable rental housing, the California Legislature created a state low-income housing tax credit
program to supplement the federal credit. The state credit is essentially identical to the federal
credit. The Tax Credit Allocation Committee allocates funds for qualified projects. State credits
are only available to projects receiving federal credits. Twenty percent of federal credits are
reserved for rural areas, and 10 percent for nonprofit sponsors.
To compete for the credit, rental housing developments have to reserve units at affordable rents
to households at or below 46 percent of area median income. The assisted units must be reserved
for the target population for 55 years. The federal tax credit provides a subsidy over ten years
towards the cost of producing a unit. Developers sell these tax benefits to investors for their
present market value to provide up-front capital to build the units. Credits can be used to fund
the hard and soft costs (excluding land costs) of the acquisition, rehab or new construction of
rental housing. Projects not receiving other federal subsidy receive a federal credit of nine percent
per year for ten years and a state credit of 30 percent over four years (high cost areas and qualified
census tracts get increased federal credits). Projects with a federal subsidy receive a four percent
                                                                                                 3-19
Plan Half Moon Bay
federal credit each year for ten years and a 13 percent state credit over four years. The City
supported tax credit funding applications for phases 1 and 2 of the Main Street Park development
as well as the Coastside Senior Housing project.
CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY (CHFA)
CHFA offers permanent financing for acquisition and rehabilitation to for-profit, non-profit, and
public agency developers seeking to preserve "at-risk" housing units. In addition, CHFA offers
low-interest predevelopment loans to nonprofit sponsors through its acquisition/rehabilitation
program.
FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM
The Federal Home Loan Bank System facilitates Affordable Housing Programs (AHP), which
subsidize the interest rates for affordable housing. The San Francisco Federal Home Loan Bank
District provides local service within California. Interest rate subsidies under the AHP can be
used to finance the purchase, construction, and/or rehabilitation of rental housing. Very low-
income households must occupy at least 20 percent of the units for the useful life of the housing
or the mortgage term.
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY
DEVELOPMENT
The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) conducts the
Urban Predevelopment Loan Program, which provides funds to pay the initial costs of preserving
existing affordable housing developments for their existing tenants. Priority is given to
applications with matching financing from local redevelopment agencies or federal programs.
HCD also conducts the acquisition and rehabilitation component of the Multi-family Housing
Program to acquire and rehabilitate existing affordable rental housing. Priority is given to projects
currently subject to regulatory restrictions that may be terminated. Assistance is provided
through low-interest construction and permanent loans. Eligible applicants include local
government agencies, private non-profit organizations, and for-profit organizations.
EMERGENCY HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EHAP)
EHAP is administered by HCD and provides funds for emergency shelters, transitional housing
and related services for the homeless and those at risk of losing their housing. The funds are
distributed to all 58 counties based on a "need" formula derived from factors including
population, unemployment and poverty.

3.4 Incentives for Affordable Housing Development
In addition to the affordable housing resources listed above, the City offers incentives to promote
the development of housing affordable to very low- and low-income households. The City assists
housing developers by providing support in the following areas:
    •    Exemptions from growth allocation requirements for density bonus units,
    •    Density bonus and related incentives,
    •    Sewer impact fee waiver for second units,
    •    Waiver or reduction of development requirements for affordable units, and
    •    Reduced development standards for substandard and severely substandard lots.
These programs are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2, Constraints.
3.5 Energy Conservation
Energy conservation associated with residential development primarily occurs in two ways: 1)
reduce the energy demands associated with the residence (e.g., efficient heating and cooling
mechanisms, insulation, “smart” switches and appliances, etc.) and 2) reduce energy demand
associated with vehicle use.
To reduce the energy demand associated with individual residential units, as well as other
development, the City has adopted Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations (the California
Energy Code) without amendment. In addition, Section 18.21.035 requires development to be
energy efficient and incorporate renewable energy design elements including, but not limited to,
exterior energy design elements, internal lighting service and climatic control systems, and
building siting and landscape elements.
The city’s Land Use Plan focuses on smart growth principles, prioritizing development in in-fill
areas and focusing high-density residential areas near transit stops and in or near the downtown
and central shopping areas. The City’s method of allocating growth provides an incentive to
develop in the downtown area, as additional allocations are set-aside solely for the downtown
area, which is developed at the pedestrian-scale and provides access to public services, shopping,
and transit.
The city’s Circulation Element includes a goal of encouraging alternative modes of transportation
and provides policies to coordinate with Samtrans in developing functional public transit and to
provide bicycle, pedestrian and transit connections between residential and commercial
development.
The Housing Plan provides methods to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions
through promoting smart growth, encouraging energy conservation in new development, and
reducing vehicle miles travelled through encourage denser residential uses that are proximate to
services and public transit. Program 2-11 promotes development of infill housing, higher density
                                                                                                3-21

Plan Half Moon Bay
housing, and mixed uses in the downtown area as well as other commercial areas served by public
transit. Program 2-4 reduces constraints to the development of small infill lots with affordable
housing, which serves to concentrate development in the urbanized core of the city. Program 5-1
provides measures to improve energy conservation and efficiency through: 1) developing design
standards for residential development that will exceed the requirements of the California Energy
Code, 2) encouraging LEED certification of private and public buildings; 3) continuing to
encourage mixed uses in the downtown area and location of higher density housing near services
and transit; 4) inclusion of weatherization activities in the Housing Rehabilitation Program; and
5) seeking funding to develop guidelines for energy conservation measures in residential
development and to provide financial incentives for smart growth techniques.

4        Effectiveness of Previous Housing
         Element
Accomplishments under the 2010 Housing Element are evaluated in this chapter in order to de-
termine the effectiveness of the previous housing element, the City’s progress in implementing
the 2010 Housing Element, and the appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies.
This evaluation is conducted pursuant to Government Code Section 65588.
4.1 Review of the Previous Housing Element
The 2010 Housing Element program strategy focused on the accomplishment of policies and im-
plementation of programs to encourage the production of new housing, including affordable and
special needs housing; to encourage the rehabilitation of existing housing; to provide housing op-
portunities for seniors, disabled persons, and large families through provision of appropriate pro-
grams and removal of constraints to development of units appropriate for these populations; and
to encourage fair housing and non-discrimination. Table 4-1 identifies the objectives, policies,
and implementation programs provided in the 2010 Housing Element; describes the results of
each policy and program; and recommends whether each policy or implementation program
should be kept, modified, or removed in this update to the Housing Element.
As described in Table 4-1, the City has begun implementation of most of the policies and pro-
grams in the 2010 Housing Element, but has fully implemented only small number of them. Ac-
complishments include steps taken to reduce constraints to the provision of housing—
particularly for affordable and special needs housing—and the approval of a number of affordable
units. Many of the incomplete programs are in progress, including several ordinance amend-
ments that have been locally approved, but which await certification by the California Coastal
Commission.
APPROPRIATENESS OF HOUSING ELEMENT
The 2010 Housing Element includes policies and implementation measures that have been im-
plemented, as well as outdated objectives that do not reflect current housing needs. As discussed
in Table 4-1, the majority of policies and programs continue to be appropriate and will either be
kept in the Housing Element and revised to address identified housing needs, constraints, or oth-
er concerns, or maintained without significant revision. The Housing Plan will also be revised to
provide clearly stated goals and to associate policies and programs with the most relevant goals.
Quantified objectives will be provided for each program. See the Housing Plan for the goals, poli-
cies, and programs of this Housing Element.

5        Public Participation
Community participation was solicited and encouraged throughout the Housing Element
process. Community participation efforts are described below for the development of the Draft
Housing Element and the adoption of the Final Housing Element.
5.1 Development of the Draft Housing Element
The City conducted a housing forum, two Planning Commission study sessions, and one City
Council meeting where input was gathered from the community to identify key issues, needs, and
desires related to the Housing Element. The City also participated in the 21 Elements project, a
collaborative effort of the 21 jurisdictions within San Mateo County to share resources, ideas,
data, policy direction, and outreach for the fifth Housing Element cycle, which conducted a
number of public participation activities on behalf of member jurisdictions.
OUTREACH
Notices for the Housing Forum, public meetings, and 21 Elements activities were sent to 53 local
agencies and organizations that serve or represent a wide range of stakeholders, including seniors,
persons with developmental disabilities, low-income households, environmentalists, and the
homeless. A list of these stakeholder organizations is included in Appendix B.
HOUSING FORUM
The City hosted a Housing Forum on March 11, 2014 that was designed to engage stakeholders
such as housing service providers, housing developers, and advocacy organizations in discussions
about the City’s long-term housing goals, needs, and policies. The 11 attendees included
representatives from the local development community, including architecture and real estate
professionals; landowners; affordable housing providers; and Planning Commissioner Phil
Rosenblatt and City Councilwoman Naomi Patridge. The Housing Forum was publicized in the
local print media and through the City of Half Moon Bay’s General Plan and LCP update website.
At the Housing Forum, the City described requirements for the Housing Element and provided
information on recent demographic trends, then asked participants to discuss the community’s
housing needs and constraints as well as ideas for programs and services. Major issues are
summarized as follows.
                                                                                               5-1

Plan Half Moon Bay
Housing Needs
Senior Housing: Senior households (55 and older) with moderate to above-moderate incomes
have limited housing opportunities in Half Moon Bay. Most do not income-qualify for available
senior housing units.
Unit Design: Many rental and condominium units cannot accommodate senior residents due to
accessibility issues.
Unit Size: Need for more diversity in unit size, such as small units that are more affordable.
Young Professionals: Many young professionals cannot afford to rent or purchase housing. Half
Moon Bay needs a greater variety of housing for young professionals such as small, independent
units and duplex units.
Governmental Constraints
PUD Zoning: PUD development in the Coastal Zone requires that the entire area be planned as a
unit, which requires the preparation of a specific plan when parcels in a PUD zone are in separate
ownership.
Coastal Commission: Costal Commission oversight within the Coastal Zone places additional
constraints on development within Half Moon Bay.
Measure A: Due to Measure A, securing a building permit is often a highly competitive process.
Non-Governmental Constraints
Land Assembly: The Local Coastal Program (LCP) requires that PUD areas be developed as a
unit. Fragmented ownership of parcels located within PUD zones makes development within
PUD zones difficult.
Traffic: Frequently there is community opposition to new housing development that could
generate additional traffic on local roads that are already at or near capacity during peak periods.
Ideas for Programs and Services
Second Units: Develop program to encourage development of second units and/or bring illegal
second units into conformance with the City’s Building Code.
Home Sharing: Seek to create opportunities for home sharing, which is a living arrangement in
which two or more unrelated people share a home or apartment. Outreach to non-profit
organizations such as HIP Housing.
Disabled Housing: Encourage development of housing for physically and developmentally
disabled residents such as single family homes shares, duplexes and fourplexes. Recognize that

                                                                                    Public Participation
sometimes “small” solutions like these can be appropriate—don’t have to build large complexes to
house the disabled.
Cohousing: Encourage cohousing development with shared common spaces in multifamily zones.
Check to see whether the Zoning Ordinance currently allows this type of development.
Walkable and Mixed-Use Development: Encourage walkable and mixed-use districts that meet
the needs of seniors and young alike. This also helps reduce traffic if more trips can be completed
without getting in the car. In general, ensure that new housing is supported by local services
(grocery, medical care, etc.) as well as jobs.
Inclusionary Zoning: Continue to require developers to reserve units for special populations such
as low-income families and those with disabilities.
Universal Design: Require developers to develop projects that are accessible to older residents and
people with disabilities.
Air Rights: Encourage development over existing parking lots (e.g., shopping centers).
PLANNING COMMISSION STUDY SESSIONS
The City held two study sessions with the Planning Commission. The first took place on April 22,
2014, early in the update process. At this study session, the Planning Commission reviewed
background information on housing element law and requirements and local housing needs and
constraints. The Planning Commission then provided input on issues that they have observed
regarding housing in the community, including gaps in existing policies and services. Issues
raised included the need for more diversity in the types and affordability of housing; the need to
plan housing comprehensively with transportation, recreation, schools, and economic
development; the need to identify sites for affordable and mixed-use development; and the need
for an implementation plan that prioritizes and incentivizes developments that meet the city’s
housing needs. Public comment was received at this meeting on issues regarding density and
opportunities for clustered development on the city’s periphery.
The second study session took place on July 8, 2014, once a draft version of the updated Housing
Element had been completed; the Planning Commission was asked to provide feedback on the
draft in order to fill any gaps in policy. Public comment was accepted at the meeting, and
included concerns that there should be sufficient capacity for affordable housing, a suggestion
that PUDs be removed from the RHNA inventory, and comment that mixed-use development is
still possible in the Wavecrest PUD. Following discussion and public comment, the Commission
approved the draft for consideration by the City Council with the following recommended
changes:
      •  Add a table to the Resources chapter comparing the RHNA with inventory capacity by
         zone.
      •  Change the language in Program 3-9 to reflect that design guidelines are currently in
         development.
                                                                                                  5-5-3

Plan Half Moon Bay
     •   Add an emphasis on water conservation to Goal 5.
     •   Strengthen language in Program 5-1 to incentivize LEED projects.
CITY COUNCIL STUDY SESSION
The City Council reviewed the draft Housing Element, along with comments and recommended
revisions from the July 8 Planning Commission study session, at its July 15, 2014 meeting. Public
comment was received expressing concern that the Housing Elements sites inventory should not
drive land use policy in the rest of the General Plan and LCP update, and suggesting that the
Wavecrest PUD can accommodate clustered and mixed-use development. The City Council
determined that the Housing Element sites inventory does not preclude housing development on
any sites not included in the inventory, that the Housing Element does not propose land use
changes, and that the sites inventory does not need to show sites that would be in excess of the
RHNA; and discussed the need to allow for more housing development in the city to improve
affordability for residents. The City Council accepted the Planning Commission’s recommended
changes and approved the draft Housing Element to be submitted to HCD for review.
21 ELEMENTS
At the request of local jurisdictions, 21 Elements organized four panels of experts to provide
information and policy suggestions on affordable housing and special needs populations. The
four panels focused on the needs and perspectives of:
     •   Developmental disabilities (October 2013)
     •   Developers (for-profit and non-profit, as well as architects) (December 2013)
     •   Advocates and funders (February 2014)
     •   Special needs and sustainability (April 2014)
These panels were well-attended by housing advocates, city representatives, and other
stakeholders from throughout San Mateo County, and provided valuable insight into the most
pressing needs and constraints that developers and other service providers in the area face.
Several themes emerged from all the panels. Many speakers talked about the importance of multi-
family housing in mixed-used, transit-oriented neighborhoods. This type of development is
necessary because it accommodates seniors and people with disabilities who cannot depend on
cars for transportation. The reduced dependence on cars and increased density also helps meet
sustainability goals. Panelists also discussed the importance of adding predictability to the
development process and the necessity of removing excessive regulations to encourage
development. The following policy suggestions emerged:
People with Developmental Disabilities: Collaborate with public agencies to identify sites and
adaptive re-use opportunities for developmentally disabled persons. Create inclusionary zoning,
mixed-use zoning and zoning overlays with requirements for ADA accessible
dwellings/development.
People with Disabilities: In Housing Elements and other policy, be sure to use the statutory
definition of people with disabilities. Include reasonable accommodation in Housing Elements.

                                                                                    Public Participation
Changes to Zoning Code:
   •   Examine density and FAR requirements. If they are out of balance, consider a variable
       density system where small units or senior units only count as a fraction of a unit. More
       generally, consider increasing the density beyond 30 to allow better design and
       accommodate more housing.
   •   Reduce parking requirements, or creating separate parking requirements for affordable
       housing. Affordable housing residents own fewer cars than the general population, and so
       parking requirements both add unnecessary costs to affordable housing development and
       also are not a very productive use of land.
   •   Benefit zoning and overlay zoning can be effective ways of incentivizing affordable or
       special needs housing development without altering the zoning code.
Other Policy:
   •   Consider implementing policies to protect tenants such as anti-displacement ordinances,
       strengthened condo conversion policies, just cause eviction ordinance, and rent control.
   •   Facilitate more public education and outreach. The political will and public support
       necessary to meet San Mateo County’s housing need is hard to generate only once every
       eight years. Additionally, ensure that public participation is accessible to all: pay attention
       to the location, time and languages of public events.
   •   Pay attention not only to creating new affordable housing, but protecting at-risk
       affordable housing such as mobile homes and older housing near transit.
   •   Continue to work regionally; the nexus study is a great example. In another example,
       Redwood City collaborated with HIP Housing to fund an affordable project in Menlo
       Park.
   •   Consider creating incentives for home sharing.
   •   Consider implementing programs to target the small group of chronically homeless
       individuals who generate the largest cost to the county through repeated ER visits.
CORRESPONDENCE
The City also received comments from community members through formal letters and e-mail
submissions. These included the following comments:
   •   The City should include HIP Housing’s Home Sharing program as a solution for
       providing a permanent affordable housing option for people who are homeless or at risk
       of homelessness, seniors, disabled, female heads of household, and low- to extremely-low
       income.
   •   The City should implement the policies that address the needs of adults with
       developmental disabilities for affordable housing, and improve the representation of the
       disabled community in the planning process.
   •   The Wavecrest PUD contains potential for housing and mixed-use development.
                                                                                                  5-5-5

Plan Half Moon Bay
     •   The City should consider revising its zoning regulations to encourage the use of in-law
         units, which would provide housing options for seniors, young professionals, and others
         looking for more affordable housing, and which would use the city’s existing
         infrastructure.
WEBSITE
The website for the General Plan and LCP update also served as a forum for community members
to post comments on housing. Comments pertaining to housing issues included the following:
     •   Explore the development of affordable live-work studios or a campus.
     •   Encourage apartment housing for lower-income residents similar to condo complexes,
         grouping services such as gas and electricity, and using green technology and community
         gardening.
     •   Issue a bond to fund the purchase of trailer parks so that they can be run as non-profit
         housing for farm labor and low-income housing.

6        Housing Plan: Goals, Policies and
         Programs
This section describes housing goals, policies, and programs for the City of Half Moon Bay. A
goal is defined as a general statement of the highest aspirations of the community. A policy is a
course of action chosen from among many possible alternatives. It guides decision-making and
provides a framework around which the housing programs operate. A program is a specific
action, which implements the policy and moves the community toward the achievement of its
goals. Programs are a part of the City’s seven-year action plan and constitute the City’s local
housing strategy.
6.1 State Housing Goals
According to the California Statewide Housing Plan Update, it is the goal of the state to “ensure to
all Californians the opportunity to obtain safe, adequate housing in a suitable living
environment.” Additionally, the State Department of Housing and Community Development has
established the following four primary goals:
     •   Provision of new housing;
     •   Preservation of existing housing and neighborhoods;
     •   Reduction of housing costs; and,
     •   Improvement of housing conditions for special needs groups.
6.2 Housing Element Goals, Policies and Programs
The City of Half Moon Bay Housing Element is consistent with, and addresses, the above-stated
state goals. The City's Housing Plan was developed to be consistent with the City’s General Plan
and Local Coastal Program. The goals of this Housing Element serve at the local level to enhance
and build upon State of California goals for providing safe, decent, and affordable housing
available for all City residents. These goals encompass new construction, conservation of existing
stock, affordability and provision of adequate housing for all persons.
                                                                                                6-1

Plan Half Moon Bay
     •   Goal 1 Conserve and Improve Half Moon Bay’s Existing Neighborhoods and Housing
         Supply
     •   Goal 2 Facilitate and Encourage Development of High-Quality Housing to Meet the
         City’s Housing Needs for a Range of Incomes and Special Needs
     •   Goal 3 Expand Housing Opportunities for the Elderly, Disabled, Homeless, and Persons
         with Special Housing Needs
     •   Goal 4 Promote Housing Opportunities for All Persons Regardless of Race, Age, Sex,
         Marital Status, Ancestry, National Origin, Color, or Sexual Orientation
     •   Goal 5 Encourage Energy Efficient Resources in New Residential Development as well as
         the Existing Housing Stock
Policies and programs from the 2007-2014 Housing Element have been incorporated herein or
updated, otherwise modified, or deleted as deemed appropriate. The funding source for all
programs is the City’s General Fund, unless otherwise noted. The Community Development
Department is the primary party responsible for implementation of the Housing Element
programs. Where programs require Planning Commission and/or City Council approval, such as
amendments to the City’s Municipal Code, Zoning Ordinance, and Local Coastal Land Use Plan,
the Planning Commission and/or City Council are also entities responsible for implementation.
The timing of implementation for each program identifies the time for the City to take the actions
described in the program. For programs that require California Coastal Commission (CCC)
approval (including amendments to the Local Coastal Land Use Plan and Zoning Code), the
timing of implementation identifies the time for the City to take action and submit the LCP to the
CCC for approval. The CCC’s processing and review time is outside of the City’s control.
TIMELINE FOR ZONING CODE AMENDMENTS
Zoning Amendments proposed in this Housing Element will be drafted and adopted as part of the
city’s General Plan and LCP Update process. The City anticipates submitting these amendments
to the Coastal Commission for approval by mid-2016. Table 6-1 summarizes the proposed
Housing Element programs associated with Zoning Amendments to be adopted on this schedule.

GOAL 1            CONSERVE AND IMPROVE HALF MOON BAY’S EXISTING
NEIGHBORHOODS AND HOUSING SUPPLY
Policy 1A         The City shall encourage the maintenance and improvement of its residential
                  areas.
Policy 1B         The City shall support the conservation and improvement of housing affordable
                  to citizens of modest means.
Policy 1C         The City shall promote the preservation and improvement of its affordable
                  housing supply, through promoting housing rehabilitation and home
                  improvement programs, providing proactive noticing of at-risk units, and
                  seeking funding to retain and improve lower income units.
Policy 1D         The City shall regulate conversion of housing stock that, by its nature, is
                  affordable to residents of modest means, such as apartments and mobile homes,
                  to either market-rate, for-sale, or non-residential uses, through requiring such
                  conversions to provide a housing relocation plan and replacement assistance to
                  residents that would be displaced by the conversion, and requiring that the City
                  make a finding of clear public benefit.
Program 1-1 Housing Rehabilitation
The City will continue to provide housing rehabilitation and repair opportunities for lower
income, elderly, disabled, and special needs households through:
    •    Participation in the County’s Housing Rehabilitation program, funded through the
         Urban County and HOME Consortium.
    •    Supporting the applications for County HOME and CDBG funds of local non-profit and
         service providers that provide housing rehabilitation and repair programs.
    •    Provide information on housing rehabilitation and housing repair programs available to
         lower-income, elderly, disabled, and other special needs households.
    •    Advertisement of availability of programs through distribution of the County’s
         promotional materials at City Hall, on the City’s website, and in conjunction with
         housing code enforcement activities.
         Implementation Schedule: Ongoing participation in County programs and support of
         rehabilitation activities; make information available on an ongoing basis
         Expected Results: 1 to 2 housing rehabilitation loans/year and home repairs to six senior,
         disabled, or special needs homes each year, subject to County program funding availability.

Plan Half Moon Bay
Program 1-2 Condominium and Mobile Home Conversions
As part of the City’s zoning ordinance update to implement the updated General Plan, revise
Chapter 17.62 of the Municipal Code to address both condominium and mobile home park
conversion. The revisions shall require: 1) analysis of rental rates, vacancy rates, and recent
growth or decline in the number of multi-family dwellings to determine whether there are
adequate housing opportunities for households that may be relocated as the result of a
conversion, 2) preparation and implementation of a relocation plan, and 3) relocation assistance
to occupants in the event that a mobile home park or apartment complex is converted from rental
to another type of housing or use.
         Implementation Schedule: Ordinance amendments adopted by mid-2016
         Expected Results: Not quantified
Program 1-3 Conversion of At-Risk Units
As part of the City’s zoning ordinance update to implement the updated Local Coastal Program
and General Plan, revise the Zoning Code to require a one year notice to residents, the City, San
Mateo County Housing Authority, and Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition of all proposed
conversions of assisted affordable (extremely low-, very low-, low-, and/or moderate-income)
housing units. Following revision of the Zoning Code, provide the owner of each assisted
affordable housing complex in the city with the noticing requirements. Draft any additional
protections for at-risk units using recommendations in resources such as the California
Department of Housing and Development and the California Housing Partnership Corporations.
         Implementation Schedule: LCP submitted to CCC by mid-2016
         Expected Results: Not quantified
GOAL 2           FACILITATE AND ENCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-
QUALITY HOUSING TO MEET THE CITY’S HOUSING NEEDS FOR A
RANGE OF INCOMES AND SPECIAL NEEDS
Policy 2A        The City shall encourage new housing development at rents and sales prices
                 suitable for a range of household incomes.
Policy 2B        The City shall encourage the production and availability of new affordable
                 housing, including extremely low-, very low-, and low-income, through a variety
                 of measures including the Below Market Rate ordinance, promoting mixed use,
                 encouraging single room occupancy and other types of development affordable
                 to extremely low-, very low-, and low-income households, promoting
                 substandard lot and second unit development, providing incentives such as
                 density bonuses, and relaxing zoning restrictions where appropriate.

Policy 2C         The City shall promote development of infill housing, higher density housing and
                  mixed uses in the downtown area and other commercial areas served by public
                  transit, as appropriate, through continuing to allow appropriate residential uses
                  in commercial zones and continuing to provide flexibility in residential density
                  and development standards for mixed use projects.
Policy 2D         The City shall maintain an inventory of appropriately zoned and designated sites
                  adequate to accommodate its housing needs, including housing for very low-,
                  low-, and moderate-income residents and housing for persons with special needs.
Policy 2E         The City shall continue to facilitate the construction of second dwelling units and
                  shall permit second units by right in the single-family residential zoning districts.
Policy 2F         The City shall give priority for water service connections to very low- and low-
                  income housing units and shall encourage water and sewer providers to give
                  priority to these developments pursuant to Government Code Section 65589.7.
                  The City shall also provide a copy of the Housing Element Update to local water
                  and sewer providers upon its adoption.
Policy 2G         The City shall expedite processing of affordable housing projects.
Policy 2H         The City shall actively pursue county, state and federal programs and funding
                  sources that provide housing opportunities for extremely low-, very low-, low-
                  and moderate-income households.
Policy 2I         The City shall encourage subdivision designs which maximize densities, where
                  appropriate, by continuing to provide for Planned Unit Developments in the
                  Zoning Code and by continuing to allow relaxation of parking and setback
                  standards, where appropriate, for affordable developments.
Policy 2J         The Planning Commission and City Council shall annually review progress in
                  implementing the Housing Element, including the progress in achieving its
                  objectives and meeting its share of regional housing needs.
Program 2-1 Below Market Rate Program
Implement the Below Market Rate Program by taking the following actions:
    •    Define administrative procedures that streamline the processing of BMR units.
    •    Ensure that BMR units are affordable in perpetuity by requiring affordability covenants,
         deed restrictions, or other similar means of guaranteeing affordability in the conditions of
         approval of developments with BMR units.
    •    Strongly encourage construction of units on-site, allow construction of units off-site
         when the development cannot feasibly accommodate the units on-site, allow construction
         of units off-site if the developer would provide excess BMR units, or allow collection of an
         in-lieu fee that is adequate to purchase land and construct the BMR unit(s) if the BMR
         units cannot be feasibly constructed by the project proponent on- or off-site.

Plan Half Moon Bay
     •   Provide density bonus or other incentives, including priority processing and review, to
         projects that construct the BMR units on-site rather than pay in-lieu fees or construct the
         units off-site.
         Implementation Schedule: Ongoing
         Expected Results: Specified percentage of affordable units will be based on total number of
         market rate units constructed during planning period (2015-2023)
Program 2-2 Density Bonus
Determine the financial feasibility of including fee waivers as a possible incentive for affordable
housing, in addition to those incentives detailed in Municipal Code Chapter 18.42.
         Implementation Schedule: Evaluate feasibility of fee waivers and, if appropriate, draft
         Ordinance amendments for adoption by mid-2016
         Expected Results: No quantified objective
Program 2-3 Second Units
Publicize the City’s Second Unit Program through handouts available at City Hall and on the
City’s website to encourage development of affordable second units.
         Implementation Schedule: Ongoing
         Expected Results: Two affordable second units per year
Program 2-4 Small Lot Development
To encourage consolidation of small, contiguous R-3 lots (see Figure 3-1) in order to provide
larger sites for development projects, the City will develop a list of property owners of small,
contiguous lots appropriate for consolidation and contact the property owners to encourage
consolidation. The City will also make the list available to affordable housing and BMR
developers interested in small development projects. If there is interest in developing the sites
with affordable housing, the City will assist the developer in pursuing adequate funding though
sources such as the available CDBG and HOME funds and the California Low Income Housing
Tax Credit small development set-aside fund, or offer other regulatory or financial incentives.
         Implementation Schedule: Develop inventory of small lots and contact property owners by
         mid-2016
         Expected Results: 16 substandard or severely substandard lots developed with affordable units
         (2 per year for the planning period)

Program 2-5 Adequate Sites
As part of the City’s current comprehensive update to the Local Coastal Program/General Plan
Land Use Element, the City will provide adequate housing sites through:
    •    Ensuring that there is adequate land zoned at residential densities that will support
         development of affordable housing consistent with the City’s RHNA allocation (R-2 and
         R-3)
    •    Encouraging the affordable units (very low-, low-, and moderate-income) and/or high
         density residential densities that are required through the inclusionary housing program
         to be provided on-site in each Planned Development (PD). If these units were provided
         on site, this would create at least 10 additional acres for affordable housing and/or high
         density residential uses. The affordable housing requirements will not exceed the
         maximum number of residential units approved in the Local Coastal Program/Land Use
         Element.
    •    Reviewing lands designated for single-family residential uses and non-residential uses (in
         particular, P-S) and, where appropriate, rezoning sites to R-2 or R-3 to as the
         LCP/General Plan Land Use Element is updated.
         Implementation Schedule: LCP submitted to CCC by mid-2016
         Expected Results: Adequate supply of residentially-zoned land at appropriate densities to meet
         2014-2022 RHNA
Program 2-6 Consistency in Planning Documents
As part of the City’s comprehensive update to its Local Coastal Program/General Plan Land Use
Element and accompanying zoning ordinance amendments, these documents will be updated to
ensure that existing conditions are reflected, internal conflicts are removed, and clarification is
provided regarding allowed uses and processing of applications. In addition to implementation of
Program 2-5, the Local Coastal Program will be updated to:
    •    Update Planned Development text in the Local Coastal Program to reflect current
         developed conditions and the remaining capacity in the PD areas.
    •    Remove inconsistencies that constrain residential development, such as the language in
         the LCP identifying that a duplex is permitted on a 5,000-square foot lot, but the
         development standards for the R-2 district require 2,700 square feet per unit. Section
         18.06.030 has been amended to require 2,500 square feet per unit in the R-2 district.
         Implementation Schedule: LCP submitted to CCC by mid-2016
         Expected Results: None quantified
    	                                             	                                                 6-7

Plan Half Moon Bay
Program 2-7 Utilization of Affordable Housing Fund
Work with the development community (for-profit and nonprofit), housing advocates, and
housing service providers to leverage the City’s affordable housing fund (created from collection
of in-lieu fees from the BMR program) in order to create additional affordable housing (including
extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income units) and other housing-related
supportive services in Half Moon Bay. This fund is a unique resource for the City, and the only
funding source for affordable housing over which it has complete control. In order to determine
how these funds should be used, this program will include the following actions:
     •   Conduct an RFP process when a target housing site or product has been identified aimed
         at nonprofit organizations for available funding for the development of affordable
         housing and related services (such as those that would accompany supportive housing).
         Hold a seminar for nonprofits on the application requirements and implement a broad
         outreach component in order to reach a wide variety of organizations.
     •   Evaluate proposals relative to the housing needs and priorities identified in this Housing
         Element and, if applicable, identified by the City Council and Planning Commission.
         Funding shall be prioritized for affordable projects that fulfill a need not yet met in Half
         Moon Bay, such as emergency shelters, transitional or supportive housing, housing for
         extremely-low income households, or housing that serves the disabled population.
     •   As future resources allow, consider allocating a percentage of the affordable housing fund
         towards developing a city-administered affordable housing rehabilitation program (to
         supplement that operated by the County) and/or a first-time homebuyer loan program.
         Implementation Schedule: Anticipated two rounds of RFPs issued during eight-year
         planning period; may be adjusted based on funding availability
         Funding Source: Below Market Rate (BMR) ordinance in-lieu fees
         Expected Results: Development of two or more affordable housing developments supported
         by City affordable housing funds; precise units and affordability level to be determined by
         successful project applicants
Program 2-8 Affordable Housing Resources
     •   Seek county, state, federal, or other funding or support funding applications for
         affordable and special needs housing programs, including the Affordable Housing
         Innovation Program funds, BEGIN, CalHome, Emergency Housing and Assistance
         Program Capital Development, Housing Related Parks Program, Low-Income Housing
         Tax Credits Multifamily Housing Program – General and Supportive Housing
         Components, Predevelopment Loan Program, and Transit-Oriented Development
         Housing Program.
     •   Prioritize funding applications that support the following needs not yet met in Half Moon
         Bay: emergency shelters, transitional or supportive housing, housing for extremely-low
         income households, or housing that serves the disabled population.

                                                                Housing Plan: Goals, Policies and Programs
     •    Notify developers of these programs as potential funding sources on at least a bi-annual
          basis, as well as when developers meet with staff early in the project entitlement process.
     •    Continue to work with affordable housing providers, including the County of San Mateo,
          to provide housing affordable to extremely low-income individuals and families through
          supporting efforts to increase subsidies for Housing Choice Vouchers, additional public
          housing units, and Section 8 units to meet the City’s fair share of extremely low-income
          units.
          Implementation Schedule: Annual funding applications 2015 through 2023
          Funding Source: Staff time; available grant funding
          Expected Results: Materials identifying affordable housing resources at City offices and online;
          two applications for funding for affordable new housing construction projects, if there is
          developer interest
Program 2-9 Annual Report
Prepare an Annual Report to the City Council and Planning Commission which describes 1)
implementation of Housing Element programs to date, 2) the amount and type of housing
activity as related to the Housing Element’s goals, policies, and programs, and 3) an updated
summary of the City's housing needs. Submit this report to the Department of Housing and
Community Development within 30 days after review by the City Council.
          Implementation Schedule: Report for prior year made January of each year
          Expected Results: Annual reports
Program 2-10         Annual Review of Residential Dwelling Unit Allocation System
The City will evaluate implementation of the Residential Dwelling Unit Allocation
System/Measure D on an annual basis. The review will analyze the impacts of the City's overall
Measure D process and method on the cost, supply, and timing of housing, including seeking
input from residential developers and affordable housing stakeholders in reviewing the effects of
the Measure D System. In addition, the review will also analyze the ability to accommodate the
city's regional housing need. The analysis will also identify requested allocations and interest in
allocations by types of units (single-family, multi-family, and mobile homes), approved
allocations by types of units and affordability level and whether the Residential Dwelling Unit
Allocation System presents an undue constraint to the development of affordable or special needs
housing.
The analysis for each calendar year will be completed no later than January 15 of the following
year. If the analysis identifies that the Residential Dwelling Unit Allocation System presents an
obstacle to the development of the city’s fair share of regional housing needs or to the
development of affordable or special needs housing, the City will revise the Chapters 17.06 and/or
18.04 of the City Code to address the identified obstacle(s). The revisions to the City Code will
     	                                               	                                                6-9

Plan Half Moon Bay
occur within six months of completing the analysis (no later than July 15th). Potential revisions
may include:
     •   Providing for a 6-month time extension for issued allocations that may be approved
         administratively by the Community Development Director;
     •   If there are unused allocations at the end of a year, up to 20 allocations will be made
         available to affordable and/or special needs housing projects in the upcoming year; and
     •   Prioritizing projects that assist the city in accommodating its fair share of regional
         housing needs.
         Implementation Schedule: Report for prior year made January of each year. City Code
         revisions, if necessary, within six months of completing analysis.
         Expected Results: Annual reports
Program 2-11          Mixed Use Development and Housing Stock Diversity
As part of the comprehensive General Plan/LCP Update process, the City will identify areas that
are appropriate for mixed-use development and other compact housing types such as garden
apartments and townhouses that are appropriate for small households (seniors, young
professionals, etc.). These sites should be close to existing clusters of local services, jobs, and
community facilities, such as in and around the Downtown area. Provision of a range of unit
types in a walkable, accessible setting can contribute to overall affordability by giving residents the
opportunity to reduce transportation costs and live in a unit appropriate to their household size
and needs.
         Implementation Schedule: LCP submitted to CCC by mid-2016
         Expected Results: None quantified

constraints and address changes in state law, particularly regarding housing for special needs
groups, including seniors, the disabled (consistent with requirements of SB 520), large families,
farmworkers, and the homeless.
         Implementation Schedule: Update codes and procedures as part of the zoning ordinance
         amendments that will implement the updated General Plan/LCP (anticipated 2016); continue
         to review annually beginning in 2017 (so that other programs to remove constraints included
         in this Housing Plan can first be implemented); and make appropriate amendments within
         four months of completion of review.
         Expected Results: No quantified objective; removal of constraints to special needs housing
Program 3-2 Senior and Disabled Housing
Continue to encourage development of housing for seniors and the disabled, including persons
with developmental disabilities, through the following actions:
    •    Provide priority processing of affordable projects for senior and disabled households.

supportive housing consistent with the requirements of state law (Government Code Section
65583(a)(4,5)). The City will seek sources of funding, including Emergency Housing Assistance
Program and Emergency Shelter Grant funds through the County, and interested
developers/operators to provide housing for homeless persons and households at risk of
homelessness.
As part of the ordinance amendments to implement the updated General Plan/LCP, the Zoning
Code will be amended to allow approval of emergency shelters in the Commercial General (C-G)
and Public Services (P-S) zoning districts as a permitted use without a conditional use or other
discretionary permit. Emergency shelters may only be subject to those development and
management standards that apply to residential or commercial development within the same
zone except that a local government may apply written, objective standards that include all of the
following:
     (i)     The maximum number of beds or persons permitted to be served nightly by the facility.
     (ii)    Off-street parking based upon demonstrated need, provided that the standards do not
             require more parking for emergency shelters than for other residential or commercial
             uses within the same zone.
     (iii)   The size and location of exterior and interior on-site waiting and client intake areas.
     (iv)    The provision of onsite management.
     (v)     The proximity to other emergency shelters, provided that emergency shelters are not
             required to be more than 300 feet apart.
     (vi)    The length of stay.
     (vii) Lighting.
     (viii) Security during hours that the emergency shelter is in operation.
The C-G and P-S districts have multiple available sites with capacity to meet the city’s homeless
needs, identified in Chapter 2.
Language identifying transitional housing and supportive housing as permitted uses and subject
to the same standards as other residential dwellings of the same type will be included in the
Zoning Code.

Plan Half Moon Bay
     •   Continuing to permit and encourage mixed uses in the downtown area and location of
         higher density housing near services and transit.
     •   Reviewing the City’s land use regulations and subdivision ordinances and, where
         appropriate, amend to include provisions which promote and/or require energy and
         water conservation measures and proximity of higher density residential uses to services
         and transit as a factor in project approval.
     •   Coordinate with San Mateo County to include loans and/or grants for weatherization
         activities including, but not limited to, insulation, siding, dual pane windows, in the
         Housing Rehabilitation program offered to city residents.
     •   Identify available grant programs to encourage smart growth, water conservation, energy
         conservation, and energy efficiency. If appropriate and feasible, apply for funding to
         develop guidelines for energy and water conservation measures in residential
         development and to provide financial incentives for smart growth techniques.
         Implementation Schedule: Ongoing
          Expected Results: 5 units/year, can be in conjunction with housing rehabilitation loans
6.3 Conclusion
The foregoing programs are considered appropriate and desirable to ensure that the city’s
housing needs are met in a timely and cost-effective manner through 2023. The programs
designate implementation schedules and expected results, including quantified objectives where
applicable. Table 6-1 shows an estimate of quantified objectives by income category for the
number of units to be constructed, rehabilitated, and conserved over the planning period, relative
to the RHNA.
To achieve these objectives, the community will require developer and non-profit participation,
use of the City’s affordable housing fund, and funding from external sources.

1. There are no at-risk units to be preserved in Half Moon Bay.
2. Totals in each category are estimated based on site inventory, income category of existing units to be conserved,
         past performance in rehabilitation, and current and projected funding availability.
3. The “extremely low-income” category is not formally included in the RHNA. However, cities are charged with
         addressing the housing needs of this population in the Housing Element. The extremely low-income totals are
         based on an estimated average of 50 percent of all very low-income households, per HCD direction.

Notes:
     1.   PUD sites were assumed to develop with the number of units identified in the LCP for each PUD area. The status of PUD parcels included in this table is subject to change on a
          continuing basis due to circumstances such as acquisition by conservation trusts. Therefore, PUD development potential for PUD areas is provided as an estimates only; actual
          development densities would be determined at time of development.
     2.   Commercial sites were assumed to develop up to half of each site with residential uses.
     3.   Constraints include potential environmental and other constraints. These constraints were determined using geographic information system (GIS) analysis and may not be an
          accurate depiction of actual conditions. In order to demonstrate the actual presence or absence of constraints, site-specific analysis will be required.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
OVERVIEW	
Purpose	
The purpose of a city’s Circulation Element is to provide a blueprint for accommodating 
circulation by all modes – vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, and transit– over a minimum of 
twenty  years.    A  Circulation  Element  is  one  of  seven  State‐mandated  elements  of  a 
jurisdiction’s  General  Plan.  The  Circulation  Element  should  be  considered  a  dynamic 
document  that  provides  the  conceptual  basis  for  decision  making  regarding  the 
continued development and enhancement of the transportation system for the current 
population of residents, employees and visitors; as well as for a community’s changing 
residential and commercial needs and future growth.   
Over  time,  needs  and  opportunities  change  and  jurisdictions  decide  to  update  one, 
several, or all of the elements of their general plans. In this case, in 2009, the Half Moon 
Bay  City  Council  determined  that  it  was  appropriate  to  update  the  City’s  Circulation 
Element,  which  had  previously  been  adopted  in  1992,  because  it  was  no  longer 
providing  adequate  direction  for  meeting  the  community’s  future  needs.  Many  of  the 
significant  improvements  identified  by  the  1992 
Circulation  Element  have  been  implemented;  while 
some  other  improvements  may  no  longer  be  relevant 
due  to  changes  in  property  development  scenarios  as 
well as the community’s interest in different priorities 
and  choices  for  circulation  infrastructure.  This 
Circulation  Element  update  explores  opportunities  for 
how the city’s streets are to be shared and enjoyed for 
the  maximum  benefit  of  Half  Moon  Bay  residents, 
businesses and visitors.  
A city’s street system is one of its most valuable assets. 
Streets are a conduit for the most basic needs of community members. Streets provide 
the  means  to  accomplish  on‐going  travel  to‐and‐from  workplaces,  schools,  and  the 
procurement of basic needs.  Because the role of streets may seem inherently obvious, 
their  significance  can  be  easily  overlooked.  Half  Moon  Bay’s  agricultural  and  fishing 
economies  require  dependable  access  to  markets.  The  city’s  downtown  and  retail 
shopping  centers  need  street  networks  that  provide  for  deliveries,  visibility,  and 
customers.  Communities rely on circulation for their economies, public safety, and the 
conduct of many aspects of social life. Streets knit together the unique physical, social, 
and  economic  fabrics  of  communities;  as  is  true  for  Half  Moon  Bay,  from  its  eastern 
hillsides to its Pacific Coast. 
The primary purpose, or task, of this Circulation Element update is to identify needs or 
issues with respect to the existing circulation system and present the desired outcome 
                                                                                    P a g e  | 1 
 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
for  these  facilities  in  terms  of  each  primary  type  of  travel  used  in  Half  Moon  Bay  – 
vehicular, pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit. Most streets in Half Moon Bay allow for 
multiple  types of mobility, or “modes.”  Cars, walkers, bikes and buses can all use the 
right‐of‐way  for  commuting,  convenience  and  recreational  trip  making.    However, 
existing  facilities  do  not  necessarily  provide  the  desired  quality  or  convenience  for 
community  trip  making  in  all  of  these  travel  modes.  Half  Moon  Bay’s  updated 
Circulation Element is an evolved blueprint for the city’s circulation system that specifies 
goals, policies and implementing actions for all circulation modes pursuant to the city’s 
vision.  Streets,  trails,  routes,  paths,  sidewalks,  lanes  and  thoroughfares  are  a  primary 
venue for community life, and as such, planning for them over the next twenty years is 
the vitally important purpose of the Circulation Element update. 
This  Circulation  Element  should  be  considered  a  dynamic  document  that  provides  the 
conceptual  basis  for  the  city’s  future  roadway  system.  The  improvements  outlined  in 
this  Circulation  Element  are  intended  to  accommodate  the  existing  and  future  travel 
needs generated as the city approaches build out based upon the General Plan and Land 
Use Plan. Implementing all of the identified improvements may not be necessary.  On‐
going monitoring studies will evaluate future needs as the land‐use patterns of the city 
evolve.  It  may  be  necessary  to  periodically  amend  the  Circulation  Element  to  include 
other  improvements  within  the  physical,  practical,  environmental,  fiscal,  and  social 
constraints  that  are  identified  at  the  time  implementation  of  any  improvement  is 
proposed.  
Authority	
California  state  law  requires  each  city  to  adopt  a  General  Plan  “for  the  physical 
development of the city, and any land outside its boundaries which bears relation to its 
planning.”    Changes  made  to  the  1992  Circulation  Element  in  the  Element  reflect  the 
Planning Commission’s direction regarding public comment, as well as the professional 
opinion of City staff and consultants. Generally, the Circulation Element brings forward 
many  of  the  1992  Element’s  Goals,  Policies,  and  Implementing  Actions  in  that  they 
remain relevant. Other Goals, Policies and Implementing Actions were either eliminated 
or revised to reflect  current conditions (e.g. several of the 1992 Implementing Actions 
and associated improvements have been completed).   
The  horizon  year  for  the  Circulation  Element  is  2035,  and  the  forecasts  of  population, 
employment  and  travel  are  based  on  the  assumptions  and  forecast  of  the  San  Mateo 
County  City/County  Association  of  Governments  (C/CAG)  and  the  Santa  Clara  County 
Valley Transit Authority (VTA) Travel Model.  This model is consistent with the forecasts 
of  the  regional  travel  model  supported  by  the  Metropolitan  Transportation 
Commission(MTC)  and  the  Association  of  Bay  Area  Governments    (ABAG)  used  in 
support of regional transportation planning.  The land use assumptions in the model are 
based on a set of projections prepared by ABAG in 2011 that reflected the effects of the 
recent recession.  The projections were made available to other agencies in the region

but not formally published by ABAG.  Consequently, the growth rate for Half Moon Bay, 
which  is  anticipated  to  be  modest  at  about  0.3  percent  per  year  for  the  period  from 
2010  to  2030,  corresponds  to  the  long  range  regional  population  and 
traffic/transportation projections for the region and the local level. 
Relationship	to	General	Plan	and	Local	Coastal	
Plan	
The  General  Plan  expresses  the  community’s  development  goals  and  embodies  public 
policy  relative  to  the  distribution  of  future  land  uses,  both  public  and  private1. This 
Circulation Element will be integrated into the existing General Plan for Half Moon Bay, 
an update of which was underway in 2013.   
As prescribed in the State’s General Plan Guidelines, each element of the General Plan 
must be internally consistent and consistent with other elements. The policies contained 
in  the  Circulation  Element  relate  to  all  elements  of  the  General  Plan,  but  consistency 
with the Land Use and Housing Elements warrants particular consideration because they 
establish  patterns  for  growth  and  development  which  will  be  served  by  the  city’s 
circulation system.  The Circulation Element should be expected to have connections to 
and  support  for  the  vision,  goals,  and  policies  in  all  other  portions  of  the  existing 
General Plan as it is updated in the future. 
In areas designated by the California Coastal Act and known as the “Coastal Zone”, Local 
Coastal  Programs  are  the  basic  planning  tools  used  by  local  governments  to  guide 
development. Local Coastal Programs contain the ground rules for future development 
and  protection  of  coastal  resources  in  the  76  coastal  cities  and  counties.  The  Local 
Coastal Programs specify appropriate location, type, and scale of new or changed uses 
of  land  and  water.  Each  Local  Coastal  Program  includes  a  land  use  plan  (LUP)  and 
measures  to  implement  the  plan  (such  as  zoning  ordinances).  Prepared  by  the  local 
government, these programs govern decisions that determine the short‐ and long‐term 
conservation  and  use  of  coastal  resources.  Following  adoption  by  a  city  council  or 
county  board  of  supervisors,  a  Local  Coastal  Program  is  submitted  to  the  Coastal 
Commission for review for consistency with Coastal Act requirements2. While each Local 
Coastal Program reflects unique characteristics of individual local coastal communities, 
regional  and  statewide  interests  and  concerns  must  also  be  addressed  in  conformity 
with Coastal Act goals and policies.  
The  City’s  Local  Coastal  Program  contains  a  number  of  transportation‐related  policies 
and  implementing  actions.  The  updated  Circulation  Element  is  consistent  with  those 
policies and implementing actions, as currently written. When the City updates its Local

Coastal  Program,  the  City  will  conduct  an  additional  consistency  review  to  identify 
appropriate modifications to the Circulation Element. 
Relationship	to	Other	Plans	
Plans, policies, and programs at the regional and county level pertain to Half Moon Bay’s 
Circulation Element and ability to provide improvements to the circulation system and 
its infrastructure.  
Regional	Planning	
The Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) is responsible for overseeing planning 
efforts in the nine‐county Bay Area region. ABAG prepares growth forecasts, establishes 
housing  needs  allocations,  and  informs  regional  transportation  planning  and  funding. 
Individual jurisdictions, including the City of Half Moon Bay, provide input to ABAG with 
respect to their growth potential in population, housing units, and employment. In turn, 
ABAG  and  other  regional  agencies  prepare  plans  that  consolidate  the  input  from  the 
individual  jurisdictions.  It  is  incumbent  upon  each  jurisdiction  to  ensure  consistency 
between  local  plans  and  polices  and  regional  planning  efforts.  The  primary  regional 
planning efforts in place at this time that pertain to Half Moon Bay’s General Plan and 
Circulation Element update include the following: 
Plan  Bay  Area  ‐  Sustainable  Communities  Strategy  –  Plan  Bay  Area,  will  serve  as  the 
Sustainable Communities Strategy (SCS) or “general plan” for the nine‐county Bay Area 
Region.  In  2008,  Senate  Bill  375  was  enacted  to  ensure  closer  integration  of  land  use 
and  transportation  planning  with  the  aim  of  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in 
California.  In  response,  ABAG,  the  Metropolitan  (MTC),  Bay  Area  Air  Quality 
Management District (BAAQMD), and Bay Conservation and Development Commission 
(BCDC)  have  been  collaborating  with  local  and  regional  partners  to  craft  a  Sustainable 
Communities Strategy (SCS) for the Bay Area.  The SCS will identify a target land use plan 
that  promotes  future  growth  in  areas  best  equated  to  provide  mobility  in  an 
environmentally  friendly  way.  The  SCS  will  be  consistent  with  the  modest  population 
growth  projections  used  to  determine  future  traffic  volumes  in  Half  Moon  Bay  due  to 
growth within and outside the city limits. The Draft SCS, Plan Bay Area, was circulated 
for public review in spring 2013 and adopted in July 2013. 
Regional  Transportation  Plan  ‐  The  Regional  Transportation  Plan  (RTP)  will  essentially 
serve  as  the  circulation  component  of  the  SCS.  The  RTP  is  updated  by  the  MTC  every 
two to four years and is the Bay Area’s region‐wide multimodal transportation plan for 
addressing  the  future  transportation  needs  of  the  Bay  Area  as  determined  by  AGAG’s 
regional  growth  forecasts.    The  RTP  is  a  blueprint  for  transportation  funding  twenty 
years  into  the  future  and  is  designed  to  be  consistent  with  countywide  transportation 
plans  and  the  transportation  plans  of  individual  jurisdictions,  such  as  Half  Moon  Bay.  
The  current  RTP,  Transportation  2035  Plan  –  Change  in  Motion,  was  adopted  in  April 
2009.  Work is now underway that will address the transportation needs of the Bay Area

though 2040 to support the SCS and the requirements of Senate Bill 375, which set goals 
for reduction of greenhouse gases from transportation sources. 
Regional  Transportation  Improvement  Program  ‐  The  Regional  Transportation 
Improvement  Program  (RTIP)  is  an  implementation  program  for  the  SCS  and  RTP.  It  is 
federally  mandated  and  defines  the  regionally  significant  transportation  projects  that 
are to be funded over the next four to six years in the nine‐county Bay Area.  The RTIP 
must include all projects that will receive federal funds and other projects deemed to be 
regionally  significant  even  if  no  federal  funds  are  required  for  their  implementation.  
The  projects  programmed  in  the  RTIP  must  be  consistent  with  the  Regional 
Transportation  Plan.    MTC,  in  cooperation  with  County  Congestion  Management 
Agencies (CMA) and Caltrans, adopted the 2012 Regional Transportation Improvement 
Program  (RTIP)  in  2011.  The  2012  RTIP  provides  about  $143  million  in  new  project 
capacity to the nine‐county MTC‐region. 
County	Planning	
San  Mateo  County  coordinates  both  regional  and  local  planning  efforts  for  the 
jurisdictions located in the county, especially with respect to the circulation system. The 
primary  county‐wide  planning  efforts  in  place  at  this  time  that  pertain  to  Half  Moon 
Bay’s General Plan and Circulation Element update include the following: 
San  Mateo  Countywide  Transportation  Plan  ‐  The  San  Mateo  Countywide 
Transportation Plan was developed under the leadership of the City/County Associated 
Governments  of  San  Mateo  County  (C/CAG)  to  provide  the  county  with  a  long‐range, 
comprehensive  transportation  planning  document  that  sets  forth  a  coordinated 
planning  framework  and  establishes  a  systematic  transportation  planning  process  for 
identifying  and  resolving  transportation  issues.  The  Countywide  Transportation  Plan 
now under development by C/CAG will reflect this collaboration in policies intended to 
address greenhouse gases and climate change which will be consistent with the SCS and 
RTP  at  the  regional  level.    The  Countywide  Transportation  Plan  is  intended  to  identify 
countywide  transportation  objectives  and  priorities  and  to  promote  consistency  and 
compatibility  among  all  transportation  plans  and  programs  for  jurisdictions,  including 
Half Moon Bay, within the county.  C/CAG is currently leading an update of the plan that 
will address transportation needs through 2035.   
Congestion  Management  Program  ‐  State  law  requires  that  each  county  develop  a 
Congestion Management Program (CMP) to qualify for state transportation funds. The 
CMPs  must  establish  levels‐of‐service  standards  for  roadways,  set  transit  service 
standards,  develop  trip‐reduction  and  travel  demand  management  programs,  perform 
land‐use  impact  analyses,  formulate  capital  improvement  programs,  and  monitor 
conformance in the County with the CMP.  The most recent CMP for San Mateo County 
was  adopted  in  2011.  The  existing  and  any  future  updates  of  the  CMP  will  reflect  the 
status of Half Moon Bay’s Circulation Element policies and implementation. 
                                                                                        P a g e  | 5 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
San  Mateo  County  Congestion  Relief  Plan  (Deficiency  Plan)  ‐  The  County  Congestion 
Relief  Plan  formulates  the  County’s  strategy  for  reducing  traffic  congestion  through 
transportation  demand  management  (TDM),  encouragement  of  transit‐oriented 
development  (TOD),  and  provision  of  additional  capacity  in  the  form  of  shuttle  buses. 
Support  for  these  initiatives  improves  mobility  countywide  without  dampening 
economic vitality. TDM and TOD strategies can be  evaluated and relevant policies and 
implementation  programs  are  reflected  in  the  Circulation  Elements  of  individual 
jurisdictions, including Half Moon Bay. 
Comprehensive Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan Bicycle Route Plan ‐ The San Mateo 
County Comprehensive Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan completed by C/CAG in 2011 
envisions  bicycle  and  pedestrian  networks  countywide  that  will  support  safe, 
comfortable,  and  convenient  travel  for  cyclists  and  walkers  of  all  skill  levels.  The  Plan 
sets  forth  an  integrated  set  of  policies  to  support  this  vision.    The  Plan  also  provides 
detailed  maps  and  tables  of  proposed  bikeway  projects  to  assist  local  implementing 
agencies  in  constructing  bikeways.  The  plan  includes  existing  and  proposed  facilities 
within and connecting to Half Moon Bay. 
Sales  Tax  Expenditure  Plan  (Measure  A)  ‐  The  voter  approval  of  Measure  A  in  1988 
established  the  San  Mateo  County  Transportation  Authority  (SMCTA)  which  is  focused 
on  improving  transit  and  relieving  traffic  congestion.    In  2004,  San  Mateo  County 
residents  voted  to  extend  the  measure  until  2033.  The  renewed  Measure  A  includes 
funds for specific transportation improvement projects, including more local community 
shuttle  service,  railroad/street  grade  separations,  ferry  service,  street  improvements, 
and  for  pedestrian  and  bicycle  projects.    Implementation  of  the  Circulation  Element 
update will include installation of various circulation improvements. Measure A monies 
are an important source of funding for these improvements.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
POLICY	FRAMEWORK	
The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  provide  background  and  context  for  the  policy 
framework of the updated Circulation Element, including the following key components: 
       1. Existing Circulation Patterns 
       2. Complete Streets 
       3. Community Input – Themes for Half Moon Bay’s Circulation Element 
Existing	Circulation	Patterns	
Consideration  of  Half  Moon  Bay’s  history,  setting  and  economy  help  to  explain  the 
primary  circulation  patterns  exhibited  in  the  city  today,  especially  with  respect  to 
vehicular  trips.  Incorporated  in  1959,  Half  Moon  Bay  is  located  in  San  Mateo  County 
along  the  Pacific  coastline  roughly  half  way 
between  San  Francisco  and  Santa  Cruz.    The 
population  of  Half  Moon  Bay  increased  slowly  but 
steadily  from  about  10,000  in  1992,  when  the  last 
Circulation  Element  was  prepared,  to  a  peak 
population  of  about  12,500  in  2009  (a  growth  rate 
of  about  one  percent  per  year).    During  the 
recession, the population dropped to about 11,300 
but  has  stabilized  and  is  increasing  slowly  again.  
The  estimate  of  population  in  July  of  2011  was 
roughly  11,5003.    Forecasts  for  2035  prepared  by 
the Association of Bay Area Governments indicate that the population will again rise to 
the pre‐recession level of about 12,500, representing a modest growth rate. 
Roughly  85  percent  of  Half  Moon  Bay  residents  work  outside  of  the  immediate  area.  
The  main  industries  within  Half  Moon  Bay  are  agriculture,  tourism,  recreation  and 
services;  and  the  total  employment  is  about  6000.  Examples  of  the  largest  employers 
within Half Moon Bay are4: 
              The Ritz‐Carlton, Half Moon Bay  ‐ 500 
              Bay City Flower Co.   ‐ 375 
              Cabrillo Unified School District  ‐ 300  
The remaining employment is in much smaller employers.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
The natural beauty of its beaches, marinas and harbor attract large numbers of visitors 
during warm days of spring, summer and fall. This is particularly true on weekends when 
the  limited  roadway  network  in  Half  Moon  Bay  frequently  reaches  capacity.    Special 
events such as the annual Half Moon Bay Art and Pumpkin Festival in October and the 
Maverick’s  surf  competition,  held  during  the  winter  months  in  Princeton‐by‐the‐Sea 
about  4  miles  north  of  Half  Moon  Bay,  also  draw  very  large  crowds  and  high  traffic 
volumes.  Coastside  events  between  San  Francisco  and  Santa  Cruz,  even  if  outside  the 
city  limits,  often  result  in  significant  spikes  in  traffic  volume  on  Highway  1  and  SR  92 
through  the  city.  Highway  1  provides  the  only  direct  access  to  such  events  and  SR  92 
provides  the  most  direct  route  to  Highway  1  from  the  bay  side  of  the  San  Francisco 
Peninsula. 
In  addition  to  vehicular  trips  associated  with  commuting  and  recreation,  an  important 
aspect of Half Moon Bay traffic is that a significant number of large trucks use the same 
routes.  Trucks  transport  agricultural  products  out  of  the  area  to  market.  Deliveries  to 
the  Ox  Mountain  landfill  as  well  as  transport  of  sand  and  gravel  from  the  Pilarcitos 
Quarry  –  both  of  which  are  located  north  of  SR  92  east  of  the  city  limits  –  further 
contribute  to  a  significant  presence  of  truck  traffic.  SR  92  is  a  curving  road  with 
increasing grade as it traverses east. Commercial and residential properties along both 
Highway  1  and  92  take  direct  access  from  these  routes.  Trucks  that  use  these  routes 
affect  visibility,  overall  speed  and  volume  characteristics,  especially  when  present  in 
concentrations and overlapped with commute or recreational traffic. 
Half  Moon  Bay’s  historic  pattern  of  development  further  establishes  local  trip‐making 
patterns,  especially  for  residents.  For  the  most  part,  the  city’s  neighborhoods  are  not 
connected  to  each  other  via  residential  streets  and  sidewalks.  Most  Half  Moon  Bay 
neighborhoods  were  once  formerly  agricultural  lands.  After  subdivision,  fields  were 
developed one‐by‐one. These tracts of land took access primarily from, and often only 
from,  Highway  1.  The  subdivisions  laid  out  within  these  properties,  continue  this 
pattern.  Thus, residents living in immediately adjacent neighborhoods cannot visit each 
other by means of a short trek from one block to the next; rather, due to lack of direct 
connectivity,  they  must  leave  one  neighborhood  and  travel  on  Highway  1  in  order  to 
enter another neighborhood.  
These  economic  and  geographic  characteristics  define  the  overall  weekday  and 
weekend  travel  characteristics  that  affect  the  city’s  residents,  workers,  and  visitors. 
Weekday  commuters  traveling  to  work  outside  the  city  are  dependent  on  Highway  1 
and SR 92. These routes experience congestion during commute hours, especially when 
mixed  with  slower  truck  traffic.  Weekend  congestion  can  be  significant,  particularly 
during  summer  months  when  good  weather  attracts  more  visitors  to  the  beaches. 
Weekend  traffic  congestion  is  especially  intense  during  major  coastside  events  as 
previously described. Half Moon Bay residents have explained that they avoid Highway 1 
and SR 92 during major weekend events. Because most Half Moon Bay neighborhoods 
P a g e  | 8 
 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
are accessed by one of these two routes, residents’ mobility is severely impacted during 
these occurrences. 
Complete	Streets	
As  a  primary  principle  the  Circulation  Element  reinforces  and  strengthens  the  City’s 
relationship to Complete Streets. As defined by the National Complete Streets Coalition, 
“Complete  Streets”  are  streets  designed  and  operated  to  enable  safe  access  for  all 
users—not  just  vehicles.  Pedestrians,  bicyclists,  motorists  and  transit  riders  of  all  ages 
and  abilities  must  be  able  to  safely  move  along  and  across  a  complete  street.  Each 
complete  street  is  unique  but  common  components  include  sidewalks,  bicycle  lanes, 
special bus lanes, comfortable and accessible transit stops, frequent pedestrian crossing 
opportunities,  and  design  elements  for  pedestrian  safety  such  as  median  islands  and 
curb extensions. While a Complete Street in a rural area will look quite different from a 
Complete  Street  in  a  highly  urbanized  area,  both  are  designed  to  balance  safety  and 
convenience for everyone using the road. 
Complete  Streets  can  offer  many  benefits  in  all  communities,  regardless  of  size  or 
location. Some of the benefits of Complete Streets include: 
        A balanced transportation system that bolsters economic growth and stability by 
         providing accessible and efficient connections between residences, schools, parks, 
         public transportation, offices, and retail destinations. 
        Reduced accidents through safety improvements. 
        Improved public health through increased walking and bicycling. Streets that 
         provide room for bicycling and walking help children engage in physical activity 
         and gain independence. 
        Increased capacity for the transportation network through a greater number of 
         travel choices, giving people the option to avoid traffic jams. 
The City seeks to “complete” its streets by recognizing that roadways are a community 
resource  that  is  integral  to  neighborhoods  and  commercial  areas  throughout  the  city.  
The streets provide gathering places used for travel as well as play.

Community	Input	–	Themes	for	Half	Moon	Bay’s	
Circulation	Element	
The  City  sought  input  from  resident  and  business 
community  members  to  prepare  the  update  to  the 
Circulation  Element.    The  public  input  process  was 
conducted  with  Planning  Commission  oversight.  A 
summary  of  that  process  is  provided  in  Appendix  A.  
Half  Moon  Bay  community  members  described  issues 
with respect to their mobility in and around Half Moon 
Bay.  They  also  expressed  their  desired  outcomes:    to 
travel  conveniently  between  neighborhoods;  to  and 
from downtown, schools, and shopping centers; and to 
the  community’s  renowned  ocean  beaches  via  foot, 
bicycle, and car. They sought more transit options for commuters and weekend tourists 
to  improve  mobility  and  reduce  congestion.  They  made  their  concerns  known  about 
neighborhood cut‐through traffic while also seeking new routes for emergency response 
providers  and  their  vehicles  to  support  the  community.    They  responded  positively  to 
the concept of Complete Streets. 
The  community  input  related  to  three  primary  themes  with  respect  to  the  city’s 
circulation system:  
        Safety  
        Connectivity 
        Multimodal Mobility  
These themes establish the community’s definition of Complete Streets for Half Moon 
Bay.  
The overall policy framework for Half Moon Bay’s Circulation Element takes into account 
existing  mobility  patterns;  the  principle  of  Complete  Streets;  and  the  community’s 
aspiration for safe, inter‐connected and multimodal circulation throughout the city.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
CIRCULATION	SYSTEM		
This  section  of  the  circulation  element  identifies  the  existing  facilities,  including 
approved  future  projects  and/or  policies  for  the  circulation  modes  relevant  to  Half 
Moon Bay. A list of issues is presented for each topic and the issues are identified with 
respect  to  their  relevance  to  one  or  more  of  the  three  policy  framework  themes  – 
safety,  connectivity,  and  multi‐modal  mobility  –  as  described  in  the  previous  section. 
The circulation system modes and topics addressed include: 
   Vehicle Circulation                    Transportation Demand Management 
   Pedestrian Circulation                 Emergency Access and Evacuation 
   Bicycle Circulation                    Scenic Routes 
   Public Transit                         Other Circulation Modes  
   Parking                                  
For  each  of  these  modes  or  topic  areas  a  Background  section  provides  some  of  the 
existing conditions and needs for the mode or topic area.  This is followed by a listing of 
the  Issues  to  be  addressed  by  the  Circulation  Element’s  Goals,  Policies,  and 
Implementing Actions as presented in the next section.   
Vehicle	Circulation	
Background	
Vehicular travel remains the primary transportation choice within Half Moon Bay.  The 
vehicular network for Half Moon Bay, illustrated in Figure 1, is rooted in the north‐south 
connectivity provided by Cabrillo Highway (Highway  1), and the east‐west connectivity 
provided by San Mateo Road (SR 92).  Both backbone roadways are Caltrans controlled.  
Highway 1 and SR 92 provide regional connections to San Francisco (north), San Mateo 
(east)  and  Santa  Cruz  (south).    The  Caltrans  facilities  are  constructed  as  arterial 
roadways, and continue to be managed by Caltrans, limiting potential changes desired 
by the City of Half Moon Bay.   
The  city’s  roadway  network  serves  to  connect  land 
uses and facilitates movement of persons and goods to 
and  from,  within,  and  through  the  city.    The  city’s 
hierarchy  of  roadways  identifies  roadways  to 
accommodate  traffic  and  goods  movement  at  higher 
speeds  and  roadways  serving  neighborhoods  with 
smaller cross‐sections and lower speeds.   
A  functional  classification  system  provides  the 
framework  for  the  design  and  operation  of  the 
roadway system.  The functional classification system used by  Half Moon Bay includes 
the following classification and existing roadway designations as illustrated in Figure 1. 
                                                                                     P a g e  | 11

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
Limited Access ‐ Limited or controlled access highways serve inter‐urban, statewide, and 
interstate  travel.  Planning  of  these  facilities  rests  largely  with  agencies  other  than  the 
City.  Highway  1  and  SR  92  are  limited  access  roads  in  Half  Moon  Bay.  Both  are  also 
designated as Truck Routes throughout the city.  Past City policy directed that access to 
existing  and  future  development  in  Half  Moon  Bay  be  consolidated  at  designated 
signalized locations when possible.   
Arterial ‐ Arterial streets primarily serve intra‐city travel, carrying traffic from collector 
streets to and from other parts of the city. Access to abutting property is subordinate to 
the  primary  function  of  moving  traffic  between  residential  neighborhoods  and  the 
downtown and commercial areas. Planning practice has been to minimize the number 
of direct access driveways on arterial streets. Main Street and Kelly Avenue are classified 
as  Arterials  within  Half  Moon  Bay.  The  portion  of  Main  Street  north  of  SR  92  is  also 
designated a Truck Route because of the importance of deliveries to the business in the 
downtown and south of the downtown.  
Collector ‐ Collector streets directly or indirectly link local streets with arterials and are 
designed to primarily serve residential and recreational traffic. This traffic may include 
trips between adjacent neighborhoods, but collectors are not intended to handle cross‐
town  traffic.  Stone  Pine  Road,  Purissima  Street,  Frontage  Road,  Fairway  Drive,  and 
Miramontes  Point Road are classified  as Collector streets. Typical design standards for 
new residential collector streets provide for two lanes (one travel lane in each direction) 
with  parking  allowed  on  both  sides  of  the  street  and  sidewalks  on  both  sides  of  the 
street in a total right‐of‐way width of 60 feet. 
Local Access ‐ Local Access streets are intended to provide direct access to abutting land 
uses.  Existing  roads  in  Half  Moon  Bay  not  designated  as  Collector,  Arterial  or  Limited 
Access will be classified as Local Access streets based on their current design and usage. 
Future  roads,  not  included  in  one  of  the  above  categories,  will  be  planned  as  Local 
Streets.  Typical  design  standards  for  new  Local  Access  streets  are  similar  to  Collector 
streets with respect to travel lanes, parking, and sidewalks; however, due to anticipated 
lower  traffic  volumes  and  speeds,  they  can  be  narrower  and  have  a  total  right‐of‐way 
width of 50 feet.  
Vehicle	Circulation	Issues	
Vehicle  circulation  concerns  primarily  relate  to  times  of  peak  roadway  use:    the 
commute  period  and  weekends,  especially  those  with  significant  traffic  for  events. 
Estimates of level of service (LOS) for key intersections along Highway 1 and SR 92 are 
provided in Table 1 for average weekday and Saturday peak hour conditions based on 
counts taken in 2010.  The table also provides estimates of expected peak hour levels of 
service  for  2035  if  no  new  improvements  are  made.    Estimates  of  segment  level  of 
service are provided in Appendix B. 
                                                                                         P a g e  | 13 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
LOS analysis was conducted using the criteria described in the City/County Association 
of Governments (C/CAG) 2011 Congestion Management Program.  LOS as defined in the 
Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) is a quality measure describing operating conditions 
within  a  traffic  stream.    It  is  generally  described  in  terms  such  as  service  measures  as 
speed  and  travel  time,  freedom  to  maneuver, 
traffic  interruptions,  and  comfort  and 
convenience.    The  LOS  evaluation  indicates  the 
degree  of  congestion  that  occurs  during  peak 
travel  periods  and  is  the  principal  measure  of 
roadway and intersection performance.  LOS can 
range from “A” representing free‐flow conditions, 
to “F” representing extremely long delays.  LOS D 
is typically considered acceptable for a peak hour 
in urban areas.  LOS E is approaching capacity and 
LOS F represents conditions at or above capacity. 
The City’s policy has been LOS C as the desired level of service on Highway 1 and SR 92, 
except  during  the  peak  two‐hour  commuting  period  and  the  ten‐day  average  peak 
recreational hour when LOS E is acceptable.  The City’s LOS criteria are consistent with 
the Congestion Management Program published by the C/CAG. 
The key issues for vehicular circulation primarily relate to the themes of congestion and 
connectivity but also address safety concerns for Highway 1. These are not considered 
issues  pertaining  directly  to  multi‐modal  mobility  because  the  vehicular  mode  of 
circulation is dominant. 
        Peak Hour Commute: During weekday peak commute periods, congestion occurs 
         at intersections along Highway 1 and SR 92 as was indicated in Table 1. This is due 
         to high commute traffic volumes, inadequate turn lanes, and lack of signal control 
         at some key intersections.  The congestion not only results in delay for residents 
         and visitors, but also increases the collision rate and reduces access to the 
         transportation system for residents. 
        Weekends and Special Events: As demonstrated in Table 1, the high volume of 
         traffic on weekends and during special events often overwhelms the roadway 
         network that was built to meet the average weekday needs of the city’s residents.  
         Growth in regional travel and increasing popularity of the attractions and special 
         events in Half Moon Bay have resulted in the highest levels of congestion being on 
         weekends and during special events.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
         Alternative Routes: Development has occurred in Half Moon Bay on a project‐by‐
          project basis over the years and has resulted in no functional parallel alternative 
          routes to Highway 1 and SR 92.  As a result, trips by automobile or truck into, out 
          of, within or through Half Moon Bay must use Highway 1, SR 92 or both regardless 
          of length of the trip.  This funneling of almost all vehicular traffic onto these two 
          roads results in congestion on both facilities and many of the streets that cross 
          them.   
         Highway 1 and SR 92 Safety: Safety is a concern in Half Moon Bay for travelers by 
          all modes.  The congestion on Highway 1 and SR 92 produces more collisions than 
          would otherwise occur.  Pedestrians and bicyclists often do not have separate 
          facilities and must use portions of the roadways or their shoulders.  Crossing of 
          major facilities like Highway 1 and SR 92 can be challenging because of the 
          separation of signalized intersections that provide pedestrians and bicyclists a 
          break in the traffic.  Shelter for transit users is also limited with bus stops on 
          Highway 1 and SR 92 because the stops are isolated and often adjacent to high 
          traffic volumes.  
         Greener Vehicular Transportation:  At the time of the preparation of this 
          Circulation Element, alternative fuel vehicles and super‐compact cars are 
          becoming increasingly popular and can be seen driving and parked throughout the 
          city’s commercial and residential areas. Various incentives, especially those 
          established to achieve State of California mandated greenhouse gas reduction 
          targets, have led to the development and sale of these vehicles throughout 
          California. Clean air vehicles and other improvements allow for convenient 
          circulation that is less prone to single occupancy vehicle trip making via more 
          common full‐sized gas‐powered cars.  Flexibility in the Circulation Element is 
          needed to support and encourage these forms of “greener vehicular 
          transportation” for which technology and trends should be expected to change 
          through the Circulation Element’s planning horizon of 2035.  
Pedestrian	Circulation	
Background	
As  discussed  in  the  San  Mateo  County  Comprehensive  Bicycle  and  Pedestrian  Plan 
(CBPP),  research  from  a  variety  of  disciplines  confirms  overwhelming  community  and 
public  health  benefits  of  walking  and  bicycling  and  stresses  the  importance  of 
retrofitting a built environment that has largely catered to the automobile for the better 
half  of  a  century.    Key  reasons  to  support  pedestrian  circulation  include  congestion 
reduction,  economic  competitiveness,  environmental  stewardship,  public  safety,  social 
equity, and public health. 
Pedestrian  infrastructure  typically  includes  shared  use  trails,  pedestrian‐only  trails, 
bicycle  and  pedestrian  bridges,  sidewalks,  and  other  public  spaces.    Depending  on  the 
P a g e  | 16 
 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
location  and  available  right‐of‐way,  sidewalks  consist  of  one  or  multiple  zones,  with 
each  zone  defined  by  the  predominant  activity  or  feature  that  occurs  there.  The 
Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  Accessibility  Guidelines  (ADAAG)  governs  the  minimum 
design for pedestrian facilities in the public right‐of‐way, and requires a minimum clear 
width of 36 inches. 
Existing  facilities  serving  pedestrians  within  Half  Moon  Bay  include  sidewalks  on  most 
roadways  and  multi‐use  trails  such  as  the  Coastal  Trail  and  the  Naomi  Patridge  Trail.  
Major existing facilities are illustrated in Figure 2.  The following is a brief summary of 
existing facilities serving pedestrians within Half Moon Bay: 
        Sidewalks – The downtown area of Half Moon Bay offers continuous sidewalks 
         along Main Street and surrounding streets. Several intersections also have 
         relatively new curb extensions with ramps to accommodate wheelchairs and 
         strollers. However, many other streets in the city, especially outside of the 
         downtown area, lack pedestrian sidewalks. 
        Paved shoulders – With the exception of the 
         sidewalks in the core village area, paved shoulders 
         serve as footpaths for pedestrians on Highway 1. 
         For most of the length, these shoulders are fairly 
         wide but several segments exist with substandard 
         width. For instance, the shoulder width has been 
         greatly reduced at points where Highway 1 crosses 
         a bridge or where the roadway has been widened 
         to accommodate an extra vehicular travel lane. 
        California Coastal Trail – Multi‐use trail from the 
         northerly city limits to Seymour Creek 
         (approximately 2 miles north of city limits), where 
         the trail continues unpaved and is informally used 
         by trail visitors.  Since the California Coastal Trail is a multi‐use trail, bicyclists and 
         pedestrians may use this facility concurrently. 
        Highway 1 Trail (Naomi Patridge Trail) – Multi‐use trail from Kehoe Avenue north 
         of downtown to SR 92. The trail then crosses over the Pilarcitos Creek via an 
         existing bridge and continues on‐street south along Pilarcitos Avenue, continues 
         on‐street east on Kelly Avenue and rejoins the off‐street trail at the Kelly Avenue/ 
         Highway 1 intersection.  The trail continues off‐street adjacent Highway 1 
         between Kelly Avenue and Seymour Street on the south.  The portion between SR 
         92 and Kelly Avenue is a Class III bike route as the trail passes through a residential 
         neighborhood.  Since the Highway 1 Trail is a multi‐use trail, bicyclists and 
         pedestrians may use this facility concurrently.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
          Pilarcitos Creek Trail – Multi‐use trail approximately 1,600 feet in length that 
           provides undercrossing of Highway 1 just south of SR 92.  Since the Pilarcitos 
           Creek Trail is a multi‐use trail, bicyclists and pedestrians may use this facility 
           concurrently. 
          Pedestrian connections are provided to Alvin S. Hatch Elementary School via a 
           walking path from Kelly Avenue to Miramontes Avenue, at the Correas Street cul‐
           de‐sac, the Valdez Avenue cul‐de‐sac, and through a striped mid‐block crosswalk 
           at Central Avenue. 
Pedestrian	Circulation	Issues 
All  of  the  primary  issues  identified  for  pedestrian  circulation  relate  to  the  themes  of 
safety, connectivity and multi‐modal mobility. 
          Neighborhood Connectivity:  Many of the residential neighborhoods in Half Moon 
           Bay are isolated and connect with other parts of the city only through their linkage 
           to Highway 1 or SR 92.   
          Infrastructure Facilities and Links:  The downtown is the only area of the city well 
           served by sidewalks. The trail system is incomplete and does not connect the 
           various parts of the city. 
          Safe Highway 1 and SR 92 Crossings: The limited number of signalized 
           intersections on Highway 1 and SR 92 results in few locations where pedestrians 
           can cross these roads. 
          Trails East of Highway 1:  The trail system in Half Moon Bay is entirely on the west 
           side of Highway 1 with the exception of a small portion of the Pilarcitos Creek 
           Trail.  There are no trails connecting the neighborhoods on the east side with each 
           other, to schools or to downtown.  There are also no trails crossing Highway 1 
           north of SR 92. 
          Access to Major Attractions:  The trail system in Half Moon Bay provides 
           recreational opportunities within certain areas of the cities, but does not provide 
           access to the major attractions in the city such as beaches, riparian corridors, 
           schools, recreation areas, downtown, and shopping centers for most residents. 
Bicycle	Circulation	
Background	
As  discussed  in  the  Pedestrian  Circulation  Section,  the  San  Mateo  County 
Comprehensive  Bicycle  and  Pedestrian  Plan  states  the  overwhelming  community  and 
public  health  benefits  of  walking  and  bicycling  and  stresses  the  importance  of 
retrofitting a built environment.  Many of the reasons to support pedestrian circulation 
apply  to  bicycle  circulation  as  well,  including  congestion  reduction,  economic 
competitiveness,  environmental  stewardship,  public  safety,  social  equity,  and  public 
                                                                                        P a g e  | 19 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
health.  Additionally, the distance traveled via bicycle is greater than walking, allowing 
for much of Half Moon Bay to be reached with a short bicycle ride.  Bicycle use in Half 
Moon  Bay  can  support  commuter  and  recreational  needs,  providing  connectivity 
between residents and schools, parks, shopping areas, jobs, and transit connections to 
areas beyond the city limits.   
The existing bicycle network, which was illustrated in Figure 2, includes both on‐street 
and off‐street facilities. The existing bicycle network includes the following categories: 
        Multi‐Use Path (Class I): An off‐street bike path that provides a separate right‐of‐
         way for two‐way travel by bicyclists, pedestrians, and other non‐motorized users.  
         Multi‐use paths are typically paved, but can also use decomposed granite (DG) 
         material or natural materials where appropriate. 
        Bike Lanes (Class II): An on‐street bike lane where a striped and signed lane is 
         provided for travel on a street or roadway.  
        Bike Routes (Class III): Typically referred to as a bike route where bicyclists and 
         vehicles share the roadway with no dedicated right‐of‐way for the bicyclist.  
         Signage is provided establishing the bike route.  Bike routes typically are used to 
         connect between Class I and Class III facilities where right‐of‐way is limited or the 
         context doesn’t require a Class II facility. 
Although bike lanes and bike routes are identified on only some streets, all of the streets 
within Half Moon Bay are open to travel by bicycle.   
Existing facilities serving bicyclists within Half Moon Bay include the following: 
        California Coastal Trail – Multi‐use path from northerly city limits to Seymour 
         Creek (approximately 2 miles north of city limits), where the path is unpaved and 
         informally used by trail visitors.  Since the California Coastal Trail is a multi‐use 
         path, bicyclists and pedestrians may use this facility concurrently. 
        Highway 1 Trail (Naomi Patridge Trail) – Multi‐use path from Kehoe Avenue north 
         of downtown to SR 92. The trail then crosses over the Pilarcitos Creek via an 
         existing bridge and continues on‐street south along Pilarcitos Avenue, continues 
         on‐street east on Kelly Avenue and rejoins the off‐street trail at the Kelly Avenue/ 
         Highway 1 intersection.  The trail continues off‐street adjacent Highway 1 
         between Kelly Avenue and Seymour Street on the south.  The portion between SR 
         92 and Kelly Avenue is a Class III bike route as the trail passes through a residential 
         neighborhood.  Since the Highway 1 Trail (Naomi Patridge Trail) is a multi‐use trail, 
         bicyclists and pedestrians may use this facility concurrently. 
        Pilarcitos Creek Trail – Multi‐use trail approximately 1,600‐feet in length that 
         provides undercrossing of Highway 1 just south of SR 92.  Since the Pilarcitos 
         Creek Trail is a multi‐use trail, bicyclists and pedestrians may use this facility 
         concurrently.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
        Main Street Bike Lane – Class II bike lane from Highway 1 to SR 92. 
        Kelly Avenue Bike Lane – On the north side of the Street, Class II bike lane from 
         Highway 1 to the point where the Half Moon Bay Coastal Trail meets Balboa 
         Boulevard.  
        Miramontes Point Road – Class II bike lane from Highway 1 west to Pelican Point 
         RV Park. 
Bicycle	Circulation	Issues	
The issues identified for bicycle circulation include all of those identified for pedestrian 
circulation in that both modes use some of the same facilities, especially trails. All of the 
issues  identified  pertain  to  the  three  themes  of  safety,  connectivity,  and  multi‐modal 
mobility. 
        Bicycle Circulation Issues:  Neighborhood Connectivity, Infrastructure Linkages and 
         Facilities, Safe Highway 1 and SR 92 Crossings, Trails East of Highway 1, and Access 
         to Major Attractions as described above under Pedestrian Circulation Issues are 
         also issues for bicycling.  
        Bicycle Parking:  The City does not have standards for bicycle parking.  Various 
         types of bicycle parking are needed for different types of bicycling trips including 
         commuters who need full‐day secure parking areas such as lockers and/or bike 
         closets and recreational cyclists who need convenient, highly visible and simple to 
         use racks. 
        Mixed Traffic:  Because bicyclists may utilize 
         any of the city’s streets, this mode mixes with 
         vehicles. Driver awareness, signage, lane 
         markers, and other means are needed to 
         ensure the safety of those utilizing the bicycle 
         mode throughout the city. 
Transit	
Background	
SamTrans  operates  bus  and  paratransit  service  for 
Half Moon Bay.  In 2013, the local bus fare for adults 
was $2.00 with discounts for youth, seniors, disabled, 
and Medicare cardholders.   Two bus lines serve Half 
Moon Bay, (illustrated in Figure 3): 
                                      
                                                                                      P a g e  | 21

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
        Fixed Route 17: Serves Moss Beach, El Granada, Half Moon Bay, Pescadero 
         (limited service), and Pacifica (weekends only).  As of January 2013, Route 17 
         operates in Half Moon Bay from 6:14 a.m. until 8:51 p.m. in the evening with 14 
         buses stopping in downtown Half Moon Bay in each direction.   Weekend service 
         includes eight buses traveling through downtown. 
        Fixed Route 294: Serves Linda Mar Park & Ride, Montara, El Granada, Half Moon 
         Bay, Hillsdale Caltrain Station, and Hillsdale Shopping Center.  As of January 2013, 
         Route 294 operates in Half Moon Bay from 6:05 a.m. until 8:24 p.m. in the evening 
         with 10 buses stopping in downtown Half Moon Bay in each direction.  No 
         weekend service is provided on Route 294. 
In addition to bus service, SamTrans also provides paratransit service for certain types of 
trips on a limited basis. Privately run options include tour buses and taxi service. 
Transit	Issues	
The issues identified regarding transit, both public and private, especially pertain to the 
multi‐modal mobility theme. 
        Transit Linkages to Major Transit Hubs:  Transit does not link to major facilities 
         such as BART and links to only one Caltrain station (Hillsdale).  
        Pedestrian and Bicycle Linkages to Transit:  There is very little connectivity for 
         pedestrians and bicyclists from Half Moon Bay’s residential neighborhoods to bus 
         stops.    
        Transit Infrastructure:  There are no bus shelters in Half Moon Bay. The lack of bus 
         shelters at transit stops leaves passengers unprotected from rain, wind, and sun 
         and reduces the overall appeal of this mode. 
        Changing Demographics and Needs:  As in other Bay Area communities, the 
         population in Half Moon Bay is aging and seniors are increasing as a percentage of 
         the population.  As the number of seniors increases, the need for travel options 
         other than driving one’s own car increases.  The need for transit options within 
         Half Moon Bay to get residents to and from stores, businesses, medical 
         appointments and social or recreational opportunities will increase significantly 
         over the next 25 years.  
        School Trips:  There are no school buses in Half Moon Bay. SamTrans service does 
         not align routes or schedule to support the journey to and from the areas schools.  
        Weekend Visitors: For most weekend visitors there are no convenient options for 
         accessing Half Moon Bay’s beaches, marinas, and special events other than by 
         automobile.  Weekend visitor traffic strains the capacity of the roadway system 
         and parking facilities near the major attractions.  At present, there are no shuttles 
         available from BART or Caltrain.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
Parking	
Background	
Parking standards and availability affect economic development, the character and use 
of  the  built  environment,  the  design  and  cost  of  new  development,  and  mode  share. 
When  parking  is  not  adequate,  overflow  into  other 
neighborhoods  and  even  illegal  parking  can  result. 
When parking is provided in excess, land is used less 
efficiently  and  the  design  of  the  associated 
development is often degraded by over‐emphasis on 
space  reserved  for  automobile  storage.  Parking 
standards  also  include  those  for  other  vehicles  and 
special  uses  including  motorcycles,  bicycles,  and 
loading zones for example. 
The  following  public  parking  areas  and  facilities  are 
located  in  Half  Moon  Bay  and  owned  or  maintained 
by the City and/or other public entities: 
         Downtown parking facilities include street side parallel and angle parking spaces 
          as well as parking lots adjacent to City facilities such as City Hall, the Ted Adcock 
          Community Center, and the Half Moon Bay Library. 
         School parking lots including drop‐off and pick‐up, teacher and staff parking, as 
          well as student parking in the case of Half Moon Bay High School. 
         Beach parking lots including those providing access to Half Moon Bay State Beach, 
          Poplar Beach, and Miramontes Point Beach. 
Private parking areas in Half Moon Bay primarily consist of the following: 
         Commercial Development:  In general, outside downtown, commercial 
          development with parking areas includes shopping centers with shared parking 
          areas; stand‐alone commercial buildings with individual adjacent parking lots 
          including lodging; as well as industrial and agricultural businesses which provide 
          parking for trucks, deliveries and customers. 
         Residential Development:  Residential land uses in Half Moon Bay are primarily 
          composed of single‐family homes which are required to provide two parking 
          spaces as well as street‐side spaces in most neighborhoods. Multi‐family 
          apartments and condominiums also provide parking for residents and guests. 
All of the above facilities (with the exception of smaller private residential properties), 
include  parking  spaces  pursuant  to  the  American’s  with  Disabilities  Act.  Many  of  the 
above  parking  areas  also  provide  parking  for  bicycles,  including  the  city’s  downtown 
sidewalk bike racks and the school and beach parking lots.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
In most cases, parking provisions adequately serve the uses they support. In the case of 
special events, such as the Pumpkin Festival, when significant numbers of visitors come 
to Half Moon Bay, parking is scare and special provisions are employed to address the 
need  which  include  allowances  for  parking  along  Highway  1  and  SR  92  and  use  of 
commercial  lots  that  serve  businesses  that  are  not  open  during  the  most  active 
weekend festivities. 
At  the  time  this  Circulation  Element  was  updated,  the  most  recent  information 
regarding public parking was a survey of the downtown parking areas conducted in May 
and July 2011. This parking survey was conducted to determine which streets, hours and 
days  of  the  week  have  the  highest  occupancy  rate.   The  survey  consisted  of  counting 
cars in parking spaces at certain times of the day to determine how many spaces were 
filled  (also  termed  occupancy  rate)  during  those  times. May  and  July  are  months  that 
Half  Moon  Bay  attracts  many  visitors,  especially  on  the  weekends.  During  this  peak 
season,  the  average  parking  occupancy  level  in  the  downtown  was  approximately 
50%.  During the low season from January to May, the occupancy levels averaged up to 
30%. The  survey  area  focused  on  Main  Street  between  the  Main  Street  Bridge  and 
Filbert Street as well as cross streets and parallel streets in the historic downtown core. 
The land use beyond the core area is primarily residential. 
Some of the key findings from the occupancy study are as follows: 
          The highest occupancy rate occurred during the midday lunch peak hours.  The 
           occupancy rate during this period was often 100% even on key side streets. 
          The peak weekend occupancy rate was consistently highest on Saturdays and 
           Sundays from late morning until early evening. 
          The commercial core streets parallel to Main Street, specifically Johnston and 
           Purissima Streets had much lower occupancy than Main Street and cross streets 
           near Main Street. 
          Feedback from some downtown merchants indicated that a number of downtown 
           business employees and/or owners park in the Main Street spaces.  
          Parking is limited on Main Street to two hours, which was found to promote 
           turnover to some extent.  
Parking	Issues	
          Downtown Parking:  While there is generally adequate parking for customers in 
           the downtown, access to the best spaces for customers is affected when business 
           owners and employees park in front of shops. 
          Event Parking: There is often not enough parking in Half Moon Bay to meet the 
           demand during special events.   
                                                                                     P a g e  | 25 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
         Beach Parking:  During periods of peak demand, parking at some beaches exceeds 
          the supply and this sometimes leads to parking overflow into adjacent 
          neighborhoods. 
         Substandard Properties: Occasionally, properties that would be otherwise viable 
          for development consistent with City land use and zoning regulations remain 
          underutilized because strict adherence to parking standards cannot be met due to 
          various conditions unique to these properties. 
         Right‐Sizing Parking Facilities:  The provision of more land or structures dedicated 
          to vehicle storage than is needed to support the use of the land is wasteful and 
          may encourage the use of single‐occupancy‐vehicles (SOVs).  Concerns about lack 
          of parking for peak periods such as during significant sized events could encourage 
          the provision of parking facilities in excess of typical peak need. 
         Appearance and Location of Parking Areas: Parking facilities can detract from the 
          aesthetic quality of the natural and built environment. 
Transportation	Demand	Management	
Background	
Transportation  Demand  Management  (TDM)  focuses  on  influencing  travel  behavior  as 
well as informing travelers about available mobility choices. The public purpose of TDM 
is  to  reduce  traffic  congestion  and  associated  air  emissions.  TDM  measures  cover  a 
broad spectrum, including subsidies for use of alternatives to the solo occupant vehicle, 
parking  and  road  pricing,  disseminating  information  about  travel  alternatives,  work 
scheduling  alternatives,  car  sharing  programs,  guaranteed  ride  home  programs,  and 
many  others.  In  San  Mateo  County  the  Peninsula  Congestion  Relief  Alliance,  which 
offers  a  wide  array  of  commuter  incentives,  provides  countywide  TDM  services  to 
employers  and  employees.    The  Alliance  sponsors  carpool  matching,  carpool  and 
vanpool incentives, commuter shuttles, bicycle parking subsidies, bicycle and pedestrian 
safety workshops, and other services. 
As of the drafting of this Circulation Element update, specific programs offered through 
the Alliance that can be utilized by Half Moon Bay include the following:  
Emergency  Ride  Home  Program:  Employers  can  provide  their  employees  with  the 
assurance  that  if  the  employee  takes  an  alternative  type  of  commute  to  work  (other 
than their car) the employee can be provided a ride home if an emergency arises during 
the work day. The Alliance pays for 75% of the ride home either by taxi or 24‐hour rental 
car and the employer pays the other 25%.  
Vanpool  Incentive  Program:  Employees  who  agree  to  drive  a  new  vanpool  for  six 
months  consecutively  will  receive  a  cash  incentive  ($500  at  the  time  of  this  writing). 
Other  employees  who  agree  to  become  passengers  of  the  new  vanpool  for  three 
months consecutively will be reimbursed for a portion of their vanpool costs.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
Carpool Incentive Program: Employees and residents of San Mateo County who commit 
to carpooling together for a minimum length of time receive a gas card as an incentive. 
The  incentive  is  increased  for  those  in  a  hybrid  or  clean  air  vehicle.  This  is  a  one‐time 
incentive to encourage solo drivers to carpool.  
Carpool  to  College  and  School  Pool  Program:  Students  who  commit  to  carpooling 
together at least two days per week for four weeks receive a gas card (per passenger) as 
an incentive. Similarly, parents who agree to take their children to school with another 
parent  and  child  of  another  family  for  the  same  frequency  and  duration  during  a 
semester of school will also receive a gas card as a one‐time incentive.  
Try Transit Program: Employees and residents of San Mateo County can try transit for 
free.  Many  of  the  local  public  transit  agencies  including  Caltrain,  SamTrans,  BART,  AC 
Transit and VTA provide tickets to get people who have not taken public transit, to try 
transit as a one‐time incentive.  
Bicycle Parking Incentive and Safety Program: Employers can provide accommodation 
for  employees  interested  in  bicycling  to  and  from  work  by  installing  bicycle  racks  or 
lockers  at  their  business.  The  Alliance  offsets  the  cost  of  the  bicycle  parking  facilities. 
The Alliance can also provide complimentary bicycle safety sessions for employees and 
for  local  residents  who  are  commuting  by  bicycle.  A  certified  bicycle  safety  instructor 
provides rules of the road information and bicycle repair and maintenance tips.  
Shuttle Program: The Alliance offers complimentary shuttle services to employees from 
BART and Caltrain stations through employer participation in shuttle consortium groups 
in  addition  to  management  of  community  shuttle  services.  This  is  a  cooperative  effort 
between  the  Alliance,  with  financial  assistance  from  SamTrans,  Caltrain,  San  Mateo 
County  Transportation  Authority,  C/CAG  of  San  Mateo  County,  Bay  Area  Air  Quality 
Management District, the  Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the cities that are 
sponsoring  the  program  and  local  employers.  This  partnership  has  fostered  eighteen 
sponsored shuttles operating in the cities of Brisbane, Burlingame, Foster City, Redwood 
City,  San  Carlos,  San  Mateo  and  South  San  Francisco.  These  shuttles  transported  a 
combined  537,000  riders  in  2008.  As  of  the  time  of  the  preparation  of  the  Circulation 
Element update, Half Moon Bay has not participated in this Alliance program. 
Commuter  Benefits  Consulting:  The  Alliance  assists  employers  with  setting  up  a 
commuter  subsidy  program  for  employers  as  a  pre‐tax  payroll  benefit  or  as  a  fully 
subsidized  program  for  commuter  checks  to  be  used  for  employees  who  take  public 
transit.  
The relevance of TDM to Half Moon Bay is largely for the long trips into and out of the 
city which include commute trips as well as weekend and special event trips.  These are 
the  trips  that  can  most  easily  be  influenced  though  pricing  of  parking,  provision  of 
alternative  modes  and  information  about  the  pricing  and  travel  options.    Shorter  trips 
within the city can also be influenced if land development and provision of services and 
facilities  are  aligned.    More  compact  housing  or  mixed‐use  development  near  major 
destinations  within  Half  Moon  Bay  (employers,  shopping,  beaches,  and  other 
                                                                                             P a g e  | 27 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
recreational  attractions)  can  be  effective  in  reducing  vehicle  trips  if  there  are  also 
improvements  in  transit  services  or  improved  pedestrian  and  bicycle  facilities  linking 
residences  with  these  attractions.    At  present,  the  level  of  transit  service  and  the 
connectivity of pedestrian and bicycle facilities within Half Moon Bay does not support 
this approach. 
Transportation	Demand	Management	Issues			
TMD  issues  pertain  to  all  of  the  key  themes  addressed  in  this  Circulation  Element 
update:  safety, connectivity, and multi‐modal mobility. 
        Awareness of TDM Programs:  A significant number of programs may be available 
         and appropriate for Half Moon Bay; however, the community may not currently 
         be aware of the options for TDM including support for use of transit, ridesharing, 
         bicycling and walking.   
        Fitness for TDM:  Half Moon Bay’s future growth and economy are not destined to 
         result in the need for major urban‐scale transit facilities. Half Moon Bay’s future 
         success with TDM will require matching facilities to needs and improvements in 
         linkages and infrastructure. 
Emergency	Access		
Background	
The City of Half Moon Bay is prepared for emergencies and hazards including wildfire, 
terrorism,  earthquakes,  or  tsunami.  The  City  follows  adopted  emergency  operation 
procedures and makes determinations for response on a case by case basis. In the event 
that evacuation would be required, the city is served by major State highways and there 
are  three  routes  out  of  town  ‐  Highway  1  north,  Highway  1  south,  and  SR  92.  For  the 
case  of  a  very  large  tsunami,  only  small  portions  of  the  city  would  be  required  to 
evacuate. The existing siren system would sound and emergency personnel would direct 
evacuation by foot (not automobile) from lower lying portions of the northwest part of 
the city to higher elevation (e.g. all land area east of Highway 1). The high school is also 
a designated safe zone for such an event. Most tsunamis would not cause inundation of 
developed areas in the city although they would cause larger waves on the city’s Pacific 
shoreline.  Additional detail should be developed as part of the Public Safety Element of 
the General Plan Update. 
Emergency	Access	Issues	
Emergency  access  issues  directly  pertain  to  the  safety  theme  for  this  update  to  the 
Circulation Element. 
        Alternative Routes:  Highway 1 and SR 92 provide the only routes into and out of 
         Half Moon Bay.  If these roads get shut down or so badly congested during an 
         emergency that traffic does not move, emergency access or egress can be lost for 
P a g e  | 28 
 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
         large portions of the population and businesses.  Similarly, many residential 
         developments have only one collector road linking homes to Highway 1 and SR 92.  
         If anything blocks the road during an emergency, access or egress for the residents 
         may be significantly restricted.  
        Emergency Response Times: Congestion on Highway 1 and SR 92 during peak 
         commute periods, on weekends and during special events can significantly 
         increase response times for emergency services such as police, fire and 
         emergency medical technicians. 
Scenic	Routes	
Background	
Many  of  Half  Moon  Bay’s  rights‐of‐way  including  streets,  trails,  and  sidewalks  offer  a 
special visual experience. Whether the route provides glimpses of the Pacific Ocean and 
its expansive beaches, views of fog mingling with native hillside vegetation and settling 
upon agricultural fields, or the colorful and historic fabric of downtown; the vistas and 
experience of traveling in and around the city are unique. Although there are no State 
designated scenic highways in Half Moon Bay the entire city is located within the Coastal 
Zone. The coast, hillsides, fields, and built environment provide a memorable and highly 
valued  landscape.  The  City’s  policies  with  respect  to  infrastructure  aesthetics  are 
certainly  influenced  by  the  Local  Coastal  Plan;  however,  they  are  also  of  great 
importance to the local community 
Scenic	Routes	Issues	
Scenic routes are a special class and the issues do not directly pertain to the themes of 
safety, connectivity and multi‐modal mobility.  
        Physical Characteristics of Infrastructure: Signage, signals, roadways, and other 
         aspects of circulation system infrastructure affect the visual environment. 
         Engineering standards are often rigid in terms of color, texture, materials, 
         location, size, height and other physical features of infrastructure which can result 
         in disruption to visual character.  
        Coordination with the Local Coastal Program (LCP):  The Visual Resources section 
         of the LCP should also apply to infrastructure, including the facilities of the 
         circulation system.  
Other	Circulation	Modes	
Background	
Aircraft ‐ The Half Moon Bay Airport is a municipal airfield owned and operated by San 
Mateo  County.  It  is  located  north  of  the  city  limits.  San  Mateo  County  identifies  the 
airport  as  an  important  business,  transportation  and  emergency  service  asset  to  the 
                                                                                      P a g e  | 29 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
community as well as an amenity for recreational pilots. The Half Moon Bay Airport is 
home to approximately 80 aircraft and several aviation related businesses. 
Watercraft  ‐  Pillar  Point  Harbor  is  a  protected  harbor  of  refuge  along  the  San  Mateo 
County California Coast and is overseen by the San Mateo County Harbor District. Pillar 
Point  Harbor,  located  north  of  the  city  limits,  is  home  port  to  Half  Moon  Bay’s  local 
commercial fishing industry. The harbor’s economic vitality is furthered by a number of 
additional  businesses  including  sport  fishing  and  pleasure  boating.  The  Harbor  has 
almost 400 berths and an inner and outer breakwater. 
Equestrian ‐ Horseback riding is a popular recreational activity in and around Half Moon 
Bay. Stables located near the public beaches rent horses by the hour for beach and trail 
rides.  Some  also  provide  boarding  facilities  for  other  owners.  Equestrians  from  out  of 
the area bring their own  horses to the Half Moon Bay beaches via trailer to enjoy the 
unique riding experience. 
Other	Circulation	Modes	Issues	
The  issues    for  aircraft,  watercraft  and  equestrian  modes  pertain  to  special  cases  of 
multi‐modal  mobility  that  are  important  to  Half  Moon  Bay’s  image,  economy,  and 
overall uniqueness. 
        Airport Compatibility:  From time to time there are concerns about noise that can 
         usually be addressed through various types of controls including hours of 
         operation. The airport provides critical services for emergency response and 
         transportation that need to be maintained at an appropriate level. The Half Moon 
         Bay Airport is a County facility, and so the City of Half Moon Bay has no direct 
         authority for its operation.  Instead, the City collaborates with the County on 
         issues related to the airport.   
        Marina Activity:  One of the key issues for water travel is the traffic generated by 
         the marina, particularly for special events.  Another issue is the traffic generated 
         by and services required for residents who live aboard their boats in the marina.  
         The issues at the Marina are outside the control of the City, but the City 
         collaborates with the County and the marina operators on issues related to the 
         marina. 
        Equestrian Opportunities:  Equestrian activities are generally not compatible with 
         other travel modes such as automobiles and bicycles. Equestrian activities require 
         separate facilities and maintenance from the City or other agencies may be 
         necessary.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
CIRCULATION	GOALS,	POLICIES	
AND	IMPLEMENTING	ACTIONS	
The policy framework for Half Moon Bay’s Circulation Element is established by nine key 
Goals;  each  further  defined  by  a  set  of  specific  Supporting  Polices  and  Implementing 
Actions.    These  Goals,  Policies  and  Implementing  Actions  have  been  formulated  to 
address  the  issues  and  opportunities  identified  for  the  city’s  circulation  modes  as 
described  in  the  previous  section.    These  Goals,  Policies,  and  Implementing  Actions 
intend to reduce congestion on Highway 1 and SR 92 by increasing their capacity at key 
bottleneck  points,  improving  their  operation  at  signalized  intersections,  and  diverting 
vehicular trips to other modes (transit, ridesharing, bicycle or walking), or by providing 
alternative traffic routes that allow drivers to bypass the most congested intersections.  
The  Circulation  Element  aims  to  enhance  the  mobility  and  safety  of  all  modes  by 
supporting a “Complete Streets” orientation and ensure adequate attention is given to 
all  modes  in  transportation  planning,  design,  funding  and  implementation  within  the 
city.  This includes guidance that will lead to adequate pedestrian and bicycle facilities to 
connect all part of the city, especially the connection of residential neighborhoods with 
schools,  parks,  beaches,  and  shopping  areas.    The  Circulation  Element  also  includes 
guidance for improving transit services and facilities, parking facilities and management, 
transportation  demand  management  services,  emergency  access,  scenic  routes  and 
other circulation modes such as air, boat and equestrian travel. 
A  statement  of  each  Goal  and  its  Supporting  Policies  and  Implementing  Actions  is 
provided in the remainder of this section.   
Goal	1:	Develop	a	Functional	and	Cohesive	
Transportation	Network

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
CIRCULATION	SYSTEM	
IMPROVEMENTS	
Infrastructure  improvements  will  be  necessary  to  implement  this  Circulation  Element 
update.  Most  of  the  improvements  from  the  previous  Circulation  Element  were 
implemented,  but  some  have  not  yet  been  completed.    Many  of  these  uncompleted 
improvements  remain  relevant  for  the  updated  Circulation  Element  and  are  therefore 
retained. Additional improvements have been identified before and during the process 
of preparing this Circulation Element update and are included in this section. 
A description of each Planned Improvements for the mode or topic area is provided in 
this final section of the Circulation Element.  The Planned Improvements are described 
in the following categories: 
        Near‐Term Improvements.  These improvements consist of funded improvements 
         that are currently or will be under construction in the near future as of the time 
         this Circulation Element was prepared in 2013.  These improvements also include 
         projects that are waiting for a Coastal Development Permit. 
        Long‐term Improvements.  These improvements are not funded at this time and 
         will be pursued when funding becomes available. 
        Conceptually Defined Improvements.  Improvements that have been defined at a 
         conceptual level to which the Element provides the over‐arching policy guidance 
         for implementation; however, the detailed design characteristics for these 
         improvements are not established at this time. In some cases, future studies will 
         be required. 
As  previously  explained  in  the  beginning  of  this  document,  this  Circulation  Element 
should be considered a dynamic document that provides the general basis for the city’s 
future  roadway  system.  The  improvements  outlined  in  this  section  of  the  Circulation 
Element are intended to accommodate the existing and future travel needs generated 
as the city approaches build out based upon  the  General Plan and Land  Use Plan. On‐
going monitoring studies will evaluate future needs as the land‐use patterns of the city 
evolve. It may not be necessary to implement all of the improvements identified. It may 
also  be  necessary  to  periodically  amend  the  Circulation  Element  to  include  other 
improvements within the physical, practical, environmental, fiscal, and social constraints 
that are identified at the time implementation of any improvement is proposed.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
Vehicle	Circulation	Improvements	
A  graphic  summary  of  the  planned  roadway  improvements  is  presented  in  Figure  4.  
These include specific near‐term and long–term improvements as well as improvements 
that have only been defined conceptually at this time. 
Near‐Term Improvements 
Funded  Improvements  for  which  a  Coastal  Development  Permit  has  been  issued  as  of 
the time of the preparation of the updated Circulation Element include the following: 
The  intersection  of  Highway  1  with  Poplar  would  be  signalized  which  would  include 
widening  of  Highway  1  a  distance  of  approximately  200  feet  on  both  sides  of  the 
intersection.  Previous studies have shown signals are warranted.  No new lanes will be 
added in the near‐term. Caltrans is scheduled to install this project later in 2013. 
Funded Improvements for which a Coastal Development Permit is being pursued include 
the following: 
        Highway 1 would be widened to four lanes at Terrace, the intersection would be 
         signalized, and the existing frontage road on the west side of Highway 1 would be 
         rerouted for Highway access at this intersection. 
        Highway 1 would be widened to three lanes with a center two‐way left turn lane 
         south from Wavecrest Road to the existing four lane section at Fairway Drive. 
Long‐Term Improvements 
Improvements  not  yet  funded,  to  be  pursued  at  a  later  date  when  funding  becomes 
available include the following: 
        Two lane segments would generally be upgraded to three lanes consisting of a 
         single through lane in each direction with shoulders on both sides and a 
         continuous two‐way left turn lane between intersections which would in turn 
         become an exclusive left turn lane at intersections.  Separate right turn lanes 
         would also be included at intersections experiencing significant right turn traffic 
         volumes. 
        Highway 1 would be widened to four lanes at all signalized intersections to 
         minimize delay associated with the installation of signals.   
        The intersection of Roosevelt Boulevard with Highway 1 will be reconfigured to 
         incorporate Gate 3 of the Nurserymen’s Exchange as a fourth leg and be 
         signalized.  The realigned Gate 3 would become the primary entrance to 
         Nurserymen’s’ Exchange to facilitate traffic safety.  Alternatively traffic 
         signalization may be at another intersection in this vicinity depending upon land 
         use changes and traffic signal warrant studies.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
At Young Avenue and Frenchmans Creek Road would be restricted to right‐only turning 
movements to Highway 1 from minor approaches. 
Conceptually Defined Improvements 
The  Circulation  Element  Update  includes  improvements  that  have  been  defined  at  a 
conceptual level. In these cases, the Element provides the over‐arching policy guidance 
for  implementation;  however,  the  detailed  design  characteristics  for  these 
improvements  are  not  established  at  this  time.  In  some  cases,  future  studies  will  be 
required. These improvements include the following: 
        Alternative Parallel Routes for Highway 1 and other New Roads:  Half Moon Bay’s 
         circulation system will consist of an interconnected network for all modes 
         including emergency egress which provides redundancy, convenience, and safety 
         in a neighborhood compatible context. The Circulation Element includes a new 
         Policy regarding the City’s interest in establishing routes parallel to Highway 1.  
         New roads will also be implemented along with new development as it comes 
         forward that could provide for parallel access or improved connectivity.  As a first 
         step when project funding becomes available or as development comes forth, a 
         feasibility study will assess potential routes for bicycles, pedestrians, emergency 
         access vehicles, and automobiles that allow for north‐south movement without 
         using Highway 1. One or more parallel routes may be assessed and the routes may 
         be deemed suitable for different combinations of circulation modes (e.g. all 
         modes including auto and transit, or only bicycle and pedestrian modes pursuant 
         to a new multi‐use trail that allows emergency vehicles). Plan lines will be 
         prepared at a future time for these routes dependent upon development and 
         other opportunities. 
        Improvements on Main Street and SR 92 – Analysis of level of service (LOS) on 
         Main Street and SR 92 indicated that additional improvements would be required 
         on SR 92 at the intersection with Main Street to bring the intersection within the 
         LOS standard of the City. 
Pedestrian	and	Bicycle	Improvements	
A graphic summary of the planned pedestrian and bicycle improvements is presented in 
Figure  5.  These  include  specific  near‐term  and  long–term  improvements  as  well  as 
improvements that have only been defined conceptually at this time.

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
Near‐Term Improvements  
Funded  Improvements  for  which  a  Coastal 
Development  Permit  has  been  issued  include  the 
following: 
At  the  time  this  Circulation  Element  was  drafted, 
the  Coastal  Development  Permit  for  the  Class  I 
multiuse  trail  segments  to  complete  the  trail  that 
currently  runs  along  the  west  side  of  Highway  1 
between  Kehoe  Avenue  and  Highway  92  and 
between  Kelly  Avenue  and  Seymour  Street  has 
been  approved.  As  a  result,  all  of  the  Class  1  Bicycle/Pedestrian  Trail  Segments 
Improvements  are  approved  for  construction,  and  are  awaiting  construction,  under 
construction or completed. These trail segments are as follows: 
         Between Roosevelt Boulevard and Ruisseau Francais Avenue on the east side of 
          Highway 1 (awaiting construction) 
         A new crossing of Highway 1 on the north side of the intersection of Highway 1 
          and Ruisseau Francais Avenue (under construction) 
         Between Ruisseau Francais Avenue and Kehoe Avenue (completed) 
         Between Highway 92 and Kelly Avenue (completed) 
         Between Kelly Avenue to Seymour Street (completed) 
         Between Seymour Street to Wavecrest Road (awaiting construction) 
The  approved  improvements  of  trail  segments  would  result  in  a  Class  I  multiuse  trail 
along Highway 1 extending the length of the City limits of the City of Half Moon Bay. The 
path will encourage walking/bicycling modes of transportation along Highway 1.   
         Traffic Signal Upgrades throughout the City: 
              o    Pedestrian count‐down indicators will be added for all signalized 
                   crosswalks  
              o    Crosswalk signal crossing times will be adjusted to allow for slower paced 
                   walkers  
              o    Bicycle signal detector loops or other appropriate improvements will be 
                   incorporated 
              o    Pedestrian refuge space will be provided in future pedestrian crossings of 
                   wider roads 
         Bicycle and Pedestrian System Planning:  Sharrow indicators will be added on 
          pavement and via signage where bike routes are encouraged but no bike lanes are 
          to be provided. 
                                      
                                                                                   P a g e  | 49 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
Long‐Term Improvements 
     Improvements not yet funded, to be pursued at a later date when funding 
         becomes available include the following: 
        Highway 1 multi‐use trail extension north of Roosevelt Boulevard to Alta Way. 
        Highway 1 multi‐use trail extension from Wavecrest Road to the south City limits. 
Conceptually Defined Improvements 
     Bicycle/Pedestrian Crossings of Highway 1:  The Circulation Element Update 
         proposes multiple, convenient and safe crossings of Highway 1 for pedestrians and 
         bicyclists. A variety of improvements could be made at various locations up and 
         down the highway; e.g. additional signalized intersections with crosswalks; high 
         visibility crosswalks; or pedestrian controlled crossing signals could all provide for 
         bicycles and pedestrians to more readily cross Highway 1. The potential for under‐ 
         or over‐passes is likely limited.  However, such facilities could also serve the intent 
         of the Element. The number, location, and specific design of such crossing 
         facilities are not known at this time.  Any such crossing would be subject to 
         Caltrans approval. 
        Bicycle/Pedestrian Way Connections:  
         Linkages for bicycle and pedestrian modes 
         between existing and planned bicycle and 
         pedestrian facilities will be identified and 
         implemented after future study. For 
         example, there are no defined 
         connections between the coast‐side 
         multiuse trail and the multiuse trail that 
         runs parallel to the west side of Highway 
         1. One or more such linkages will be 
         identified and the linkages may be 
         incorporated into existing facilities, or 
         developed as separate access routes, be 
         they trails, lanes, paths, routes, sidewalks, etc. Pedestrian infrastructure typically 
         includes shared use or pedestrian only trails, bicycle and pedestrian bridges, 
         sidewalks and other public spaces. Some of the recommended pedestrian and 
         bicycle trail connections and improvements are as follows: 
              o    A new off‐street multi‐purpose trail serving neighborhoods and 
                   destinations east of Highway 1could provide a connection(s) between 
                   neighborhoods and schools east of Highway 1 including Half Moon Bay 
                   High School. 
              o    Extension of the California Coastal Trail approximately 2,100‐feet south of 
                   Seymour Creek to connect to Wavecrest Road.

                  link with commercial areas downtown. 
              o   Designate certain key roadways within developments such as bike 
                  boulevards. The Circulation Element Update proposes these designations 
                  to provide possible connections between the California Coastal Trail and 
                  the end of Washington Boulevard. 
              o   Designation of additional streets as Class III bike routes with sharrows to 
                  establish connections between the California Coastal Trail, the Naomi 
                  Patridge Trail (Highway 1 Trail) and Main Street. 
              o   Designation of Main Street as a Class III bike route with sharrows.   
              o   Improvements to wayfinding and signage along all trails with trail map 
                  information and distances to travel to key destinations. 
Transit	Improvements	
Half Moon Bay will be a City where transit is a viable option for residents, workers, and 
visitors.  The  updated  Element  specifies  that  the  City’s  transit  service  will  be  improved 
overtime through a coordinated effort with SamTrans that will result in improvements 
to transit stops, routes and schedules, as well as the provision of other types of transit 
services such as shuttles and shall consider special populations such as the elderly and 
school age children. 
Parking	Improvements	
The City will need to review parking standards from time to time as conditions change in 
order  to  meet  certain  goals  and  needs  or  more  generally  to  achieve  balance  or 
outcomes desired by the City compatible with the General Plan (e.g. ensure that parking 
standards  do  not  hinder  good  development  or  appropriate  use  of  vacant  commercial 
space).    Implementing  actions  could  reference  staying  informed  about  changes  in 
parking  standards/  communication  with  chamber  of  commerce,  merchants,  residents, 
and  developers.  These  measures  would  have  the  goal  of  providing  efficient  and  safe 
parking  environments  while  servicing  the  unique  land  use  needs  of  the  City  of  Half 
Moon  Bay.  Smart  parking  technology  would  aid  in  identifying  shifting  demands  and 
capacities  depending  on  time  of  day  and  would  aid  in  reducing  the  amount  of  circling 
vehicles looking for parking spaces. 
Parking standards for a wide range of alternative‐mode vehicle and user types including 
bicycles,  transit,  hybrid  and  electric  vehicles,  motorcycles  can  be  implemented  as 
trends, technology, and other conditions change and emerge. 
                                                                                         P a g e  | 51 

Half	Moon	Bay	Circulation	Element		
Transportation	Demand	Management	(TDM)	
Improvements	
Future  enhancements  of  TDM  programs  for  Half  Moon  Bay  should  be  developed  in 
collaboration  with  the  Peninsula  Congestion  Relief  Alliance,  SamTrans,  employers  and 
advocates  for  pedestrian  and  bicycling  facilities.    TDM  programs  for  weekends  and 
special events should be developed in collaboration with California State Parks, the Half 
Moon  Bay  Coastside  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Visitors’  Bureau,  and  special‐event 
organizers. 
Emergency	Access	Improvements	
Emergency Access improvements for Half Moon Bay should be developed by the City of 
Half Moon Bay in collaboration with Caltrans and first responder organizations including 
police, fire and emergency medical. 
Scenic	Routes	Improvements	
Improvements  of  roads  or  other  transportation  facilities  with  scenic  views  should  be 
made  in  collaboration  with  the  Caltrans,  California  State  Parks,  and  the  California 
Coastal  Commission.    The  City  should  adopt  guidelines  that  will  protect  the  scenic 
quality  of  routes  that  provide  access  to  the  beaches  and  other  scenic  areas.    The 
guidelines should help protect the sense of openness that is characteristic of Half Moon 
Bay, and maintain the views of the ocean.  Circulation system improvements should be 
subordinate to the character of the visual resources of the area. 
Other	Modes	Improvements	
Future  improvements  for  air  and  water  transportation  will,  for  the  most  part,  involve 
facilities  that  are  outside  the  control  of  the  City  of  Half  Moon  Bay.    The  City  should 
continue to collaborate with Half Moon Bay Airport Authority and San Mateo County on 
issues related to air travel.  On issues related to water travel, the City should collaborate 
with the San Mateo County Harbor District and private operators of marinas.  The City 
has  more  control  over  improvements  to  equestrian  trails  and  other  facilities  in  Half 
Moon  Bay  and  should  work  collaboratively  with  local  stable  owners  and  equestrian 
enthusiasts on plans for improvement and maintenance of facilities.

COMMUNITY MEEING AND PUBLIC COMMENT SUMMARY REPORT
1. Purpose
The City of Half Moon Bay hosted a public meeting, in an open house format, on November 14, 2012 to
present and collect public input on the proposed circulation element update. The key topics of
discussion included the environmental process; bicycle and pedestrian access; and safe transit within
City limits. Over 40 local residents and elected officials attended the meeting.
2. Approach
The City of Half Moon Bay staff is proposing an update to the General Plan’s Circulation Element, which
was last updated in 1992. The circulation element update will re-examine circulation needs, deficiencies
and possible solutions to improve circulation for pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders.
Community input along with the incorporation of new requirements, guidance from City-hired
consultants and staff, and recommendations from the Planning Commission will be used to update the
element. The proposed circulation element is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA), and an initial study will be prepared to scope the potential impacts affiliated with the project.

         Dictated Comment. The project team noted 57 comments that community members brought
          to their attention during the public meeting.
In general, although the team noted a wide range of issues and concerns, there were several key themes
consistently identified by multiple individuals:
         Traffic dynamics along Highway 1
         Bike and pedestrian access
                                                           Public Transit
                                                           Safety along Highway 1
                                                   Within each theme, some comments were more
                                                   commonly expressed than others:
                                                   Traffic: The most common comment received from the
                                                   attendees was the need for traffic signals along Highway
                                                   1, specifically at Spindrift Way, Bay View, and Grandview
                                                   Blvd. Overwhelmingly, participants requested a traffic
                                                   signal at Spindrift Way to accommodate Sea Haven
                                                   residents exiting their neighborhood onto Highway 1.
                                                   The second-most common traffic-related issue raised at
                                                   the public meeting was the request for Foothill Boulevard
                                                   to be built in order to supplement traffic along Highway
                                                   1. Two other common topics included the need for
                                                   better left-turn accessibility to and from Highway 1 and
                                                   the suggestion of building a pedestrian and bike bridge
over Hightway 1. Of those who proposed a bridge over Highway 1, several suggested the bridge be
artistic. Other traffic-related comments included:
         Request four lanes of traffic on Highway 1 from Ruisseau Francais Avenue to SR 92
         Do not build Foothill Boulevard
         Build Boys & Girls Club near middle school to decrease vehicle traffic
         Roundabout before Main Street bridge for easier circulation and access
         Construct an additional bridge over the creek near Main Street and implement one-way
          downtown traffic flow
         Combine Highway 1/S Main St/Higgins Canyon Road into one intersection
         Construct roundabouts along Highway 1 at Coronado and at the RV Park (north side of HMB)
         Do not expand Highway 1 to four lanes unless traffic signals are included - residents from side
          streets will need to cross four lanes of traffic
         Need solution for congestion at Highway 1 and N Main Street
                                                                                                            5

        Include crash data in analysis
        Improve school drop-off zones
        Improve Terrace Boulevard intersection
        Construct Foothill Boulevard in a smaller scale and only for westbound traffic

         intersections
        Consider frontage roads on either side of Highway 1
        Increase in traffic along Terrace Ave/Siler Ave/Highland Ave due to parents dropping off
         students for HMB HS
        Include SB-left access from Highway 1 to Silver Avenue (one way direction only - not in opposite
         direction)
        Do not install traffic signals at Spindrift Way
        Connect all of the neighborhoods on the east side of Highway 1 with a “back road/trail” that
         connects to the high school or downtown
        Consider changing commute times
        Noise impact to surrounding neighborhood if Foothill Blvd. is built
        Consider constructing a road
         from 92 via Foothill Boulevard
         to Frenchman Creek Road to
         supplement Highway 1 traffic
Bike/Pedestrian: The most common
bicycle and pedestrian-related
comment received was the need for
safe Highway 1 pedestrian and bicycle
crossings. Several attendees noted
that many people, including students,
unsafely walk along the shoulder of
Highway 1 to reach downtown, and
that sidewalks should be added for
recreation access and for students
accessing schools.
The second-most common comment under this theme related to the lack of pedestrian, bicycle, or
horse trails on the east side of the city. Another commonly expressed concern was the need for
pedestrian crossing at Spindrift Way, Highland Avenue, Terrace Way, and Grandview Boulevard. Several
people noted that the Sea Haven neighborhood is fenced off and residents cannot access trails. Other
comments related to bicycle and pedestrian issues included:
        More bike/pedestrian access throughout the city with better connectivity
        Pave bike trails that are currently gravel-only

        Connect Kelly Avenue with the bike path
         under Highway 1
        Improve trail signage
        Request better lighting and safer access for
         path under Highway 1

         of the city currently exist
        Construct pedestrian/bike underpasses to
         improve safety and circulation
        Keep and improve Ailento path for students and residents
        Better maintenance of bicycle paths

Notes: a. MOE = Measures of Effectiveness. For two-lane highways and multilane highways MOE is measured in v/c ratios (volume to capacity ratios).
       b. LOS = Level of Service is based on 2009 C/CAG of San mateo County Final Congestion Management Plan criteria
       c. Highlighted segments include addition of lanes                                                                                                                                                Page 10

HALF MOON BAY NOISE ELEMENT
1.1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 OVERVIEW
1.1.1 Contgpts of E!ernent
The Noise Element follows the recently revised State guidelines in the State Government code
Section 653021(g) and Section 46050.1 of the Health and Safety Code. The element quantifies the
community noise environment in terms of noise exposure contours for both near and long-term
levels of growth and traffic activity. The information will become a guideline for the development
of land use policies to achieve compatible land uses and provide baseline levels and noise source
identification for local noise ordinance enforcement
1.1 .. 2 Key Issues
1. Transportation Noise Control- Within the City of Half Moon Bay are a number of
transportation related noise sources including major arterials and collector roadways. These
sources are the major contributors of noise in Half Moon Bay. Cost effective strategies to reduce
their influence on the community noise environment are an essential part of the Noise Element.
2. Community Noise Control for Non-Transportation Noise Sources -Residential
 land uses and areas identified as noise sensitive must be protected from excessive noise from non-
 tra;lspv-rtation sources including commercial and construction activities. Tnese impacts are most
 effectively controlled through the adoption and application of a City Noise Ordinance.
 3. Noise and Land Use Planning Integration -Information relative                 to the existing and
 future noise environment within Half Moon Bay should be integrated into future land use planning
 decisions. The Element presents the noise environment in order that the City may include noise
 impact considerations in development programs. Noise and land use compatibility guidelines are
 presented, as well as noise standards for new developments.
  HALF MOON BAY NOISE EI..EMEI'<! PAGE
1.2 PURPOSE
The Noise Element of a General Plan is a comprehensive program for including noise control in the
planning process. It is a tool for local planners to use in achieving and maintaining compatible land
use with environmental noise levels. The Noise Element 'identifies noise sensitive land uses and
noise sources, and defines areas of noise impact for the purpose of developing programs to ensure
that Half Moon Bay residents will be protected from excessive noise intrusion.
1.3 AUTHORIZATION
The State of California has mandated that each county and city prepare a Noise Element as part of
its General Plan. Section 65302(g) of the California Government Code requires specifically:
        "(g) A Noise Element shall identify and appraise noise problems in the community.
        The noise element shall recognize the guidelines established by the Office of Noise
        Control in the State Department of Health Services and shall analyze and quantify,
      - to the extent practicable, as determined by the legislative body, current and projected
        noise levels for all of the following sources:
                 Highways and freeways.
                 PrimarY arterials and major local streets.
                 Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and ground rapid
                  transit systems.
                  Commercial, general aviation, heliport, helistop, and military airport
                  operations, aircraft overflights, jet engine test stands, and all other
                  ground facilities and maintenance functions related to airport
                  operation.
                  Local industrial plants, including, but not limited to, railroad
                  classification yards.
                  Other ground stationary noise sources identified by local agencies as
                  contributing to the community noise environment.
         Noise contours shall be shown for all of the sources and stated in terms of
         community noise equivalent level (CNEL) or day-night average level (LDN). The
         noise contours shall be prepared on the basis of noise monitoring or following
         generally accepted noise modeling techniques for the various sources identified in
         paragraphs (1) to (6), inclusive. The noise contours shall be used as a guide for
         establishing a pattern of land uses in the land use element that minimizes the
         exposure of community residents to excessive noise. The Noise Element shall
  HALF MOON BAY NOISE ELEMENT PAGE                                                               2
        include implementation measures and possible solutions that address existing and
        foreseeable noise problems, if any. The atkJpted noise element shall serve as a
         guideline for compliance with the state's noise insulation standards."
The State Guidelines for Preparation and Content of Noise Elements of the General Plan
indicates that the Noise Element should present the noise environment in terms of noise
contours. For those areas identified as containing noise sensitive facilities, the noise
environment is determined by monitoring.
2.0 EXISTING CONDITIONS/ISSUE ANALYSIS
2.1 DEFINITION OF NOISE
1. Noise Definitions. Sound is technically described in terms of the loudness (amplitude)
of the sound and frequency (pitch) of the sound. The standard unit of measurement of the
loudness of sound is the Decibel (dB). Since the human ear is not equally sensitive to sound at
 all frequencies, a special frequency-dependent rating scale has been devised to relate noise to
 human sensitivity. The A-weighted decibel scale (dBA) performs this compensation by
 discriminating against frequencies in a manner approximating the sensitivity of the human ear.
 Decibels are based on the logarithmic scale. The logarithmic scale compresses the wide range
 in sound pressure levels to a more usable range of numbers in a manner similar to the Richter
 scale used to measure earthquakes. In terms of human response to noise, a sound 10 dBA
 higher than another is judged to be twice as loud; and 20 dBA higher four times as loud; and so
 forth. Everyday sounds normally range from 30 dB (very quiet) to 100 dB (very loud).
 Examples of va...-rious sound levels in different environments are shown in Exhibit 1.
 Noise has been defmed as unwanted sound and it is known to have several adverse effects on
 people. From these known effects of noise, criteria have been established to help protect the
  public health and safety and prevent disruption of certain human activities. These criteria are
  based on such known impacts of noise on people as hearing loss, speech interference, sleep
  interference, physiol()gical responses and annoyance. Each of these potential noise impacts on
  people are briefly discussed in the following narratives:
             HEARING LOSS is not a concern in community noise problems of this type.
             The potential for noise induced hearing loss is more commonly associated with
             occupational noise exposures in heavy industry or very noisy work

  CfiT OF HALF MOON BAY· NOISE ELEMENT

          SPEECH INTERFERENCE is one of the primary concerns in environmental
          noise problems. Normal conversational speech is in the range of 60 to 65 dBA
          and any noise in this range or louder may interfere with speech. There are
          specific methods of describing speech interference as a function of distance
          between speaker and listener and voice level. Exhibit 2 shows the impact of
          noise and speech interference.
          SLEEP INTERFERENCE is a major noise concern because sleep is the most
           noise sensitive human activity. Sleep disturbance studies have identified interior
           noise levels that have the potential to cause sleep disturbance. Note that sleep
           disturbance does not necessarily mean awakening from sleep, but can refer to
           altering the pattern and stages of sleep.
           PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES are those measurable effects of noise on
           people which are realized as changes in pulse rate, blood pressure, etc. While
           such effects can be induced and observed, the extent is not known to which
           these physiological responses cause harm or are signs of harm.
           ANNoYANcE is the most difficult of all noise responses to describe.
           Annoyance is a very individual characteristic and can vary widely from person to
           person. What one person considers tolerable can be quite unbearable to another
           of equal hearing capability.
2.2.1 Standards
Community noise is generally not a steady state and varies with time. Under conditions of
non-steady state noise, some type of statistical metric is necessary in order to quantify noise
exposure over a long period of time. Several rating scales have been developed for describing
the effects of noise on people. They are designed to account for the above known effects of
noise on people.
Based on these effects, the observation has been made that the potential for noise to impact
people is dependent on the total acoustical energy content of the noise. A number of noise
scales have been developed to account for tbis observation. These scales are the: Equivalent
Noise Level (LEQ), the Day Night Noise Level (LDN), and the Community Noise Equivalent
Level (CNEL). Thes.e scales are described in the following paragraphs.
         LEQ is the sound level corresponding to a steady-state sound level containing the
         same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given sample period. LEQ is the
         "energy" average noise level during the time period of the sample. LEQ can be
         measured for any time period, but is typically measured for 15 minutes, 1 hour or
         24-hours.

         LDN is a 24-hour, time-weighted annual average noise level. Time-weighted
         refers to the fact that noise which occurs during certain sensitive time periods is
         penalized for occurring at these times. In the LDN scale, those events that take
         place during the night (10 pm to 7 am) are penalized by 10 dB. This penalty was
         selected to attempt to account for increased human sensitivity to noise during the
         quieter period of a day, where sleep is the most probable activity.
         CNEL is similar to the LDN scale except that it includes an additional 5 dBA
         penalty for events that occur during the evening (7pm to lOpm) time period.
         Either LDN or CNEL may be used to identify community noise impacts within the
         Noise Element. Examples of CNEL noise levels are presented in Exhibit 3.
The public reaction to different noise levels varies from community to community. Extensive
research has been conducted on human responses to exposure of different levels of noise.
Exhibit 4 relates LDN noise levels (approximately equal to CNEL noise levels) to community
response from some of these surveys. Community noise standards are derived from tradeoffs
between community response surveys, such as this, and economic considerations for achieving
these levels.
Intermittent or occasional noise such as those associated with stationary noise sources is not of
sufficient volume to exceed community noise standards that are based on a time averaged scale
such as the LDN scale. To account for intermittent noise, another method to characterize noise
is the Percent Noise Level (L%). The Percent Noise Level is the level exceeded X% of the
time during the measurement period. Examples of various noise environments in terms of the
Percent Noise Levels are shown in Exhibit 5.
Noise Ordinances are typically specified in ten::ns of t.':ie percent noise ieveis. Ordinances are
designed to protect people from non-transportation related noise sources such as music,
 machinery and vehicular traffic on private property. Noise Ordinances do not apply to motor
vehicle noise on public streets or other transportation related noise sources that are preempted
 by the State or Federal government.
Noise/Land Use Compatibility Guidelines. The purpose of this section is to present
 information regarding the compatibility of various land uses with environmental noise. It is
 from these guidelines and standards, that the City of Half Moon Bay Noise Criteria and
 Standards have been developed. Noise/Land use guidelines have been produced by a number
 of Federal and State agencies including the Federal Highway Administration, the
 Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the

Cfl'Y OF HALF MOON BAY- NOISE ELEMENF

American National Standards Institute and the State of California. These guidelines, presented
in the following paragraphs, are all based upon cumulative noise criteria such as LEQ, LDN or
CNEL.
        The ENVIRONMENTAL PRO'IECTION AGENCY published in March 1974 a
        very important document entitled "Information on Levels of Environmental Noise
        Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare With an Adequate Margin of Safety"
        (EPA 550/9-74-004). Exhibit 6 presents a table of land uses and requisite noise
        levels. In this table, 55 LON is described as the requisite level with an adequate
        margin of safety for areas with outdoor uses, this includes residences, and
        recreational areas. The EPA "levels document" does not constitute a standard,
        specification or regulation, but identifies safe levels of environmental noise exposure
        without consideration for economic cost for achieving these levels.
        The FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION (FHWA) has adopted and
        published noise abatement criteria for highway construction projects. The noise
        abatement criteria specified by the FHWA are presented in Exhibit 7 in terms of the
        maximum one hour Noise Equivalent Level (LEQ). The FHWA noise abatement
        criteria basically establishes an exterior noise goal for residential land uses of 67
        LEQ and an interior goal for residences of 52 LEQ. The noise abatement criteria
        applies to private yard areas and assumes that typical wood frame homes with
        windows open provide 10 dB noise reduction (outdoor to indoor) and 20 dB noise
        reduction with windows closed.
        The STATE OF CALIFORNIA requires each City and County to adopt Noise
        Elements of their General Plans. Such Noise Elements must contain a Noise/Land
         Use compatibility matrix. A recommended (but not mandatory) matrix is presented
        in the "Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of Noise Elements of the General
        Plan," (Office of Noise Control, California Departtnent of Health, February 1976).
         Exhibit 8 presents this recommended matrix.
 2.2.2    Methods of Measurement
 The noise environment in Half Moon Bay was determined through the employment of a
 comprehensive noise measurement survey of existing noise sources and incorporating these
 results into computer noise models to model the noise environment (it is, of course, impossible
 to measure future noise levels so we must rely on computer noise models for future noise
 estimates). The noise environment is commonly presented graphically in terms of lines of
 equal noise levels, or noise contours. The following paragraphs detail the methodology used in
  the measurement survey and computer modeling of these results into noise contours.
 Measurement Procedure. Ten sites were selected for measurement of the noise
  environment in Half Moon Bay. Discussions with City staff and identification of major noise

sources in the community provided the initial base for development of the community noise
survey. The measurement locations were selected on the basis of proximity to major noise
sources and noise sensitivity of the land use.
The measurement locations are depicted in Exhibit 9. The Half Moon Bay Noise Element
measurement survey utilized the Bruel & Kjaer 2231 digital noise monitor. This instrument
automatically calculates both the Equivalent Noise Level (LEQ) and Percent Noise Level (L%)
for any specific time period. The noise monitor was equipped with a Bruel & Kjaer 1!2 inch
electret microphone. The system was calibrated with a Bruel & Kjaer calibrator with
calibration traceable to the National Bureau of Standards. Calibration for the calibrator is
certified through the duration of the measurements by Bruel & Kjaer. This measurement
system satisfies the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) Standards 1.4 for Type 1
precision noise measurement instrumentation.
Based upon the identification of the major noise sources and the location of sensitive receptors,
 a noise measurement survey was conducted. The function of the survey is threefold. The first
is to determine the existing noise levels at noise sensitive land uses. The second function is to
 provide empirical data for the correlation and calibration of the computer modeled noise
 environment A third important aspect of the survey is to obtain an accurate description of the
 ambient noise levels in various communities throughout the City. The noise measurements
 were divided into two categories; ambient traffic noise and stationary source measurements.
 The ambient traffic noise measurements were designed to provide a "snapshot" indication of
 the traffic noise at the measurement site. ('The noise contours based on the CNEL noise scale
 are perhaps a better indicator of the traffic noise at a given location.) The ambient traffic noise
 measurements were also used to provide an indication as to t.!Je validity of the FHWA traffic
 noise model used for the CNEL noise projections.
 Noise contours for all of the major noise sources in Half Moon Bay were developed based
 upon future traffic conditions. These contours were determined from the traffic levels for these
 sources. The contours are expressed in terms of the Community Noise Equivalent Level
 (CNEL). The existing conditions scenario is derived from 1987 traffic levels and
 environmental conditions. Future conditions are presented for the buildout of the General Plan.

2.3    EXISTING ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT
This section contains a detailed description of the current noise environment within the City.
This description of the noise environment is based on an identification of noise sources and
noise sensitive land uses, a community noise measurement survey and noise contour maps.
To define the noise exposure, this section of the report first identifies the major sources of
noise in the community. The sources of noise in Half Moon Bay include: State Highway 1,
State Route 92, Kelly Street, Filbert Street, Poplar Street, Higgins Pruisima Road, Miramontes
Point Road, Grandview Boulevard and Main Street. To completely assess the noise
environment in the City, noise sensitive receptors must also be identified. As mandated by the
State, noise sensitive receptors include, but are not limited to, residential areas, areas
containing schools, hospitals, rest homes, long-term medical or mental care facilities, or any
other land use areas deemed noise sensitive by the local jurisdiction.
2.3.1     Noise Sources and Levels
The predominant land use in the City is residential, and should also be considered the most
 noise sensitive. Other noise sensitive land uses include schools and parks. In some ways the
 tourist/commercial area might also be considered noise sensitive. Maintenance of a relatively
 quiet ambience is important to maintaining the overall atmosphere of the area.
 The predominant noise source in Half Moon Bay originates from motor vehicles. Some major
 arterial roadways pass through the City. State Highways 1 and 92 are by far the most
 significant noise sources in Half Moon Bay. Other roadways in the City simply do not have
 the traffic volumes sufficient to generate noise impacts. No significant sources of commercial
 or industrial noise were observed in the City.
 Other noise sources monitored during the noise survey included high aircraft overflights, birds
 and hnman speech. None of these noise sources monitored appeared to be excessively loud, an
 in fact, they always .contributed to the lower levels of ambient noise as opposed to the higher
 levels usually generated by traffic.
 The noise environment for Half Moon .Bay can be described using noise contours developed
  for the major noise sources within the City. The major noise source impacting the City is traffic
  noise. Existing and future noise contour maps have been developed for the City as part of this
  HALF MOON BAY NOISE ELEMENT PAGE                                                               g
noise element
The traffic noise contours for existing conditions are presented in Exhibit 10. (This map is
available for review at the City at 1" = 800' scale.) The noise contours in a tabular format are
presented in Table 3. The 55, and 60 CNEL contour levels are shown on the map. These traffic
noise levels were computed using the Highway Noise Model published by the Federal
Highway Administration (''FHWA Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model," FHWA-RD-77-
108, December 1978). The FHWA Model uses traffic volume, vehicle mix, vehicle speed, and
roadway geometry to compute the LEQ noise level. A computer code has been written which
computes equivalent noise levels for each of the time periods used in CNEL. Weighting these
noise levels and summing them results in the CNEL for the traffic projections used. The traffic
data used to project these noise levels are derived from the built-out projections in the City's
Local Coastal Program, Land Use Plan. The traffic mixes and time distributions for Highway
1, Route 92 and the arterials are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The traffic mix data for the
arterials are based on measurements for roadways in Southern California and are considered
typical for arterials in this area.

It apr...ars that 60 CNEL for outdoor living areas and 40 CNEL for indoor areas may be a very
reasonable noise standard for new developments, and a reasonable long term goal for existing
residential areas. Most cities have adopted 65 CNEL and 45 CNEL noise standards for outdoor
and indoor living areas, respectively. The 60 CNEIJ40 CNEL standard will provide a better
 noise environment that many residents in other communities have desired, but unlike most
 other communities it is readily achievable in the City of Half Moon Bay. The noise contour
 map indicates that currently and in the future 60 CNEL is only exceeded significantly along
 Highway 1 and 92. The remaining portions of the City experience noise levels generally of 55
 CNEL or less. Adoption of the lower noise standards would be a statement by the City that
 they view the current qniet in the City as very important and something that should be
 preserved and carried into new developments.

 2.3.2    Noise Sensitive Land Uses
 The most noise sensitive land use in Half Moon Bay is residential development. Residential
 development is spread throughout the City. It is considered especially noise sensitive because
 (1) considerable time is spent by individuals at home, (2) significant activities occur outdoors,
 and (3) sleep disturbaJ1Ce is most likely to occur in a residential area. Additionally, the City of
 Half Moon Bay has a number of public and private educational facilities, churches, and parks
 that are considered noise sensitive. These facilities are generally located in the center of the
 City. Some school facilities border Highway 1.
  HALF MOON BAY NOISE ELEMENT PAGE                                                                12
The tourist recreation/commercial area, sometimes referred to as the Spanish Town area, may
in some ways also be considered noise sensitive. Typical commercial areas are considered
relatively insensitive to noise. However, the tourist re..."relltion/commercial area in downtown
Half Moon Bay has attempted to establish a peaceful, "old California" atmosphere. Tourists
spend a considerable amount of time outdoors either window shopping or eating at the outdoor
restaurant areas. Therefore, this area is more sensitive to noise than other commercial areas.
The determination of the major noise sources and the identification of noise sensitive receptors
provide the basis of developing a community noise survey. The noise measurement survey was
conducted at locations which reflect the noise levels at these facilities.
 Noise contours represent lines of equal noise exposure, just as the contour lines on a
 topographic map are lines of equal elevation. The contours shown on the maps are the 60, and
 55 CNEL noise level for the traffic noise contours. The noise contours presented should be
 used as a guide for land use planning. The 55 CNEL contour defines the Noise Referral Zone.
 This is the noise level for which noise considerations should be included when making land
 use policy decisions. The 60 CNEL contour deScribes the areas for which new noise sensitive
 developments will be permitted only if appropriate mitigation measures are included such that
 the standards contained in this Element are achieved.
 The contours presented in this report are a graphic representation of the noise environment.
 Topography and intervening buildings or barriers have a very complex effect on the
 propagation of noise. This topographic effect is not included in these contours.
  2.4 FUTURE ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT
  2.4.1    Noise Sources and Levels
  Future traffic noise levels have been computed using the FHWA Highway Traffic Noise
  Prediction Model and projected traffic volumes presented in the circulation element. Table 4
  presents the noise contour data for the case with the southwest bypass. Exhibit 11 shows the
  traffic noise contours along the City's principal highways that are projected to occur following
  buildout of the proposed general plan.

 Based on current and future traffic levels the only area of the City that experiences noise levels
 in excess of 60 Ci'I"EL is along Highway 1. Some of the land uses along this roadway are
 commercial uses which have a higher tolerance to noise. However, there are a substantial
 number of residential areas along Highway 1 and 92 and some school sites. Therefore, future
 planning for the City should be directed at reducing noise levels along Highway 1, and 92.
 Limiting the future siting of noise sensitive land uses along these highways, requiring
 mitigation for new developments along these roadways, and taking advantage of any Caltrans
 funding to remediate problems are examples of potential solutions.
  The increases in roadway noise for future years was determined. The results of the analysis
  are presented in Table 5.

 In community noise assessment changes, noise levels greater than 3 dBA are often identified as
 significant, while changes less than 1 dBA will not be discernible to local residents. In the
 range of 1 to 3 dBA residents who are very sensitive to noise may perceive a slight change. No
 scientific evidence is, available to support the use of 3 dBA as the significance threshold. In
 laboratory testing situations humans are able to detect noise level changes of slightly less than 1
 elBA. However, in a community noise situation the noise exposure is over a long time period,
 and changes in noise levels occur over years, rather than the immediate comparison made in a
 laboratory situation. Therefore, the level at which changes in community noise levels become
 discernible is likely to be some value greater than 1 dBA, and 3 dBA appears to be appropriate
  HALF MOON BAY NOISE ELEMENT PAGE                                                                17

for most people.
The data indicate that the noise levels will not increase significantly for any streets over
currently planned noise levels in the vicinity of the project. Future noise levels with the Foothill
Boulevard extension will acrually be lower than currently planned noise levels for Highway 1
and Route 92 in the vicinity of the Foothill Boulevard project. Foothill Boulevard and
Bayview Avenue will relieve Highway 1 and Route 92 from future ttaffic by grnnting other
 access ways to future and existing developments. Therefore the Foothill Boulevard project will
 slightly decrease long term future noise levels for Highway 1 and Bayview Avenue around the
 project.
 The sources of noise in Half Moon Bay can be divided into two basic categories, transportation
 sources (primarily traffic) and non-transportation sources. A local government has little direct
 control of transportation noise at the source. State and Federal agencies have the responsibility
 to control the noise from the source, such as vehicle noise emission levels. The most effective
 method the City has to mitigate transportation noise is through reducing the impact of the noise
 onto the community (i.e. noise barriers and site design review). Mitigation through the design
 and construction of a noise barrier (wall, berm, or combination wall/berm) is the most common
 way of alleviating traffic noise impacts (Exhibit 12). The effect of a noise barrier is critically
 dependent on the geometry between the noise source and the receiver. A noise ba1Tier effect
 occurs when the "line of sight" between the source and receiver is penetrated by the barrier.
 The greater the penetration the greater the noise reduction.
  Another common approach to mitigating noise impacts is through the use of setbacks. This
  approach may be more desirable for the Cit"y of Half Moon Bay due to its low volume
  roadways and the desire to avoid a "walled in" look. The setback approach simply requires that
  the homes or noise sensitive uses be setback away from the roadway at a distance great enough
  so that they are outside the noise impact zone. The setback area is landscaped. The landscaping
  actually provides very little noise reduction, however, residents seem to become less aware of
  the noise probably because they can not see or have an obstructed view of the road.
  2.4.2    Noise/J 1and lise Compatibility
  Noise concerns should be incorporated into land use planning to reduce future noise and land
   use incompatibilities. This is achieved by establishing standards and criteria that specify
   acceptable limits of noise for various land uses throughout the City. These criteria are designed

to integrate noise considerations into land use planning to prevent noise/land use conflicts.
Exhibit 8, the California Noise Compatibility Guidelines, was presented earlier, and is the most
appropriate to evaluate projects with the General Plan L. c.P. and zoning levels. These criteria
are the basis for the development of specific Noise Standards. The proposed standards,
presented in Exhibit 13, represent (if adopted) City policies related to land uses and acceptable
noise levels. These tables are the primary tools which allow the City to ensure integrated
planning for compatibility between land uses and outdoor noise. The most effective method to
control community noise impacts from non-transportation noise sources ls through application
of a Community Noise Ordinance.
3.0 GOALS. OBJECTIVES. AND POLICIES
The following are statements of the goals of the City of Half Moon Bay for the control of
 community noise.
        TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE BY ELIMINATING
           EXISTING NOISE PROBLEMS AND BY PREVENTING SIGNIFICANT
           DEGRADATION OF THE FUTURE ACOUSTIC ENVIRONMENT.
  3.1 POLICIES
 In order to achieve the goals of the Noise Element the following policies should be considered by
 the City of HalfMoon Bay:
      Objective 1.0
      Incorporate noise considerations into land use planning decisions.
                 Poijcy I. a Establish acceptable limits of noise for various land uses
                   throughout the community. The City adopts the noise standards
                  presented in Exhibit 13 which identify interior and exterior noise
                   standards in relation to specific land uses; particularly residential areas,
                   schools, hospitals, open space preserves, and parks. The standards
                   would specify the maximum noise levels allowable for new
                   developments impacted by transportation noise sources operating on
                   public or quasi-public property. (Sources on private property would be
                   subj~ to the noise ordinance requirements, as called out in Policy 3.a.)
                 Poljcv l.b The City shall require a noise impact evaluation by a qualified
                   acoustical engineer (i.e., a Registered Professional Engineer in the State
                   of California with a minimum of three years experience in acoustics) for
                   all new residential subdivisions and for all new commercial
                   developments on any site within 300 feet of any residential district or
                   Planned Unit Development District where residential uses are proposed.
  HALF MOON BAY NOISE ELEMENT PAGE                                                              19
                            Exhibit 13
Interior and Exterior Noise Standards
              Noise from an intervening highway shall be considered as a part of the
              noise evaluation. Should mitigation be necessary, specific proposals
              shall be addressed by the Architectural Review Committee, Planning
              Commission, or both.                                                ·
            Policy l.c The City shall not approve projects that do not comply with the
               adopted standards.
            Policy l.d The California Department of Health Services recommends
               that noise elements be updated every 5 years.
            Policy l.e The City shall minimize potential transportation noise through
               proper design of street circulation, coordination of routing, and other
               traffic control measures.
    Qbjectiye 2.0
    Establish measures to reduce noise impacts from traffic noise sources.
             Policy 2.a The City shall require, for new development projects that are
               impacted by noise or cannot meet the standards specified in the Noise
               Element, the construction of barriers to mitigate sound emissions where
               necessary or where feasible. Action Items 1, 4, 5 and 6 provide specific
                measures for meeting this objective.
             Policy 2.b The City shall require, where necessary and feasible, the
                inclusion of noise mitigation measures in the design of new roadway
                projects in Half Moon Bay. The City shall request from Caltrans a
                noise study for any portions of Highway 1 or 92 that Caltrans proposed
                to modify, (e.g. widen to 4 lanes). Appropriate mitigation measures
                should be included in any final project plans.
             Policy 2.c The City shall ensu."'e the effective enforcement of City, State
                and Federal noise levels by ali appropriate City divisions.
             Policy 2.d The City shall consider the special nature of the Spanish Town
                 commercial area in its land use deliberations. Efforts to maintain low
                 levels of noise in this area should be continued. Continued use of
                roadway configurations that maintain a slow speed through the area will
                 be most effective in maintaining low levels of noise.
     Objective 3.0 ·
     Establish     measures to control non-transportation noise impacts.
              Policy 3.a The City shall a establish new Community Noise Ordinance to
                  mitigate noise conflicts from non transportation noise sources. The City
                  of Half Moon Bay does not currently have a problem with non-
HALF MOON BAY NOISE ELEMENT PAGE                                                           20

                  transportation sources of noise (e.g., industrial noise sources).
                  Therefore, it does not seem prudent to adopt a Noise Ordinance aimed at
                  the sources. However, in-fill constrUction is occurring throughout the
                  City, and this can impact existing residential areas. Therefore, it is
                  proposed to limit constrUction activities that occur within 500 feet of
                  existing residences to Monday through Friday from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M.
                  only. ConstrUction also should not be allowed on federal holidays.
4.0 THE PLAN FOR CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT OF NOISE
In order to achieve the goals and objectives of the Noise Element, an effective implementation
program developed within the constraints of the City's financial and staffing capabilities is
necessary. The underlying purpose is to reduce the number of people exposed to excessive noise
and to minimize the future effect of noise in the City. The following are the actions that the City
should consider implementing to control the impacts of noise in Half Moon Bay.
Issue I • Transportation Noise Control - The most efficient and effective means of
controlling noise from transportation systems is reducing noise at the source. However, since the
City has little direct control over source noise levels because of State and Federal preemption (i.e.
 State Motor Vehicle Noise Standards), policies should be focused on reducing the impact of the
 noise on the community. Cooperative efforts with State and Federal offices are essential.
        Action 1      Encourage the use of walls and berms, increased building setbacks, or
                      both, in the design of residential or other noise sensitive land uses tb..at a..re
                      adjacent to major roads, commercial, or industrial areas.
         Action 2 Provide for continued evaluation of trUck movements and routes in the
                      City to provide effective separation from residential or other noise sensitive
                       land uses.
        Action 3       Request Caltrans provide noise mitigation study as part of any
                       modification to Highway I or 92.
 Issue 2 • Noise and Land Use Planning Integration. Community noise considerations
 are to be incorporated into land use planning. These measures are intended to prevent future noise
  and land-use incompatibilities.
  HALF MOON BAY NOISE ELEMENT PAGE                                                                    21

      Action 4 Establish standa.n:ls that specify acceptable limits of noise for various land
                   uses throughout the City. These criteria are designed to fully integrate noise
                   considerations into land use planning to prevent new noise/land use
                   conflicts. Exhibit 8 shows criteria used to assess the compatibility of
                   proposed land uses with the noise environment. These criteria are the bases
                    for the development of specific Noise Standards. These standards,
                    presented in Exhibit 13, define the City policies related to land uses and
                    acceptable noise levels. These tables are the primary tools which allow the
                    City to ensure noise integrated planning for compatibility between land
                    uses and outdoor noise.
      Action S Incorporate noise reduction features during site planning to mitigate
                    anticipated noise impacts on affected noise sensitive land uses. The noise
                    referral zones identified in Exhibits 10 and 11 (areas exposed to noise
                    levels greater than 60 CNEL) can be used to identify locations of potential
                    conflict. New developments will be permitted only if appropriate mitigation
                     measures are included such that the standa.n:is contained in this Element or
                    any adopted ordinance are met.
       Action 6 Enforce the State of California requirement that indoor noise levels for
                     residential living spaces not exceed 45 dB LDN/CNEL due to the
                     combined effect of all noise sources. The State of California requires
                     implementation of this standard when the outdoor noise levels exceed 60
                     dB LDN/CNEL. Tne Noise Referral Zones (60 CNEL) can be used to
                     determine when this standard should be applied. This standard shall be
                     applied to all new hotels, motels, apartment houses and dwellings other
                     than detached single family dwellings, the City shall commit to meeting an
                     interior noise level standard of 40 dB CNEL.
Issue 3 • Community Noise Control for Non-Transportation Noise Sources. The
focus of control of n(!ise from non-transportation sources is the control of construction noise on
adjacent residential areas.
       Action 7       Amend and adopt a community noise ordinance that restricts construction
                      adjacent to existing residential areas per Policy 3.a.

APPENDIX B • GLOSSARY
A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL. The sound pressure level in decibels as measured on a sound
level meter using the A-Weighted filter network. The A-Weighting f!.lter de-emphasizes the very
low and very high frequency components of the sound in a manner similar to the response of the
human ear. A numerical method of rating human judgement of loudness.
AMBIENT NOISE LEVEL. The composite of noise from all sources near and far. In            this context,
the ambient noise level constitutes the normal or existing level of environmental noise at a given
location.
 COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL (CNEL). The average equivalent A-Weighted
 sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of five (5) decibels to sound levels in the
 evening from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. and after addition of ten (10) decibels to sound levels in the night
 before 7 a.m. and after 10 p.m.
 DAY-NIGHT AVERAGE LEVEL (LDN). The average equivalent A-Weighted sound level during
 a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of ten (10) decibels to sound levels in the night before 7
 a.m. and after 10 p.m.
 DECIDEL {dB). A unit for measuring the amplitude of a sound, equal to 20 times the logarithm
  to the base 10 of the ratio of the pressure of the sound measw.ed to t.'le reference pressure, which
  is 20 micro-pascals.
   dB(A). A-weighted sound level (see defmition above)
  EQUIVALENT SOUND LEVEL (LEQ). The sound level corresponding to a steady noise level
   over a given sample ~od with the same amount of acoustic energy as the actual time varying
   noise level. The energy average noise level during the sample period.
   FREQUENCY.       The number of times per second that a sound pressure signal oscillates about the

prevailing atmosphere pressure. The unit of frequency is the hertz. The abbreviation is Hz.
INTRUSIVE NOISE.        That noise which intrudes over and above the ambient noise at a given
location. The relative intrusiveness of a sound depends upon its amplitude, duration, frequency,
time of occurrence, and tonai or informational content as well as the prevailing ambient noise
level.
LlO. The A-Weighted sound level exceeded 10 pereent of the sample time. Similarly LSO, L90,
L99, etc.
 NOISE.    Any unwanted sound or sound which is undesirable because it interferes with speech
 and hearing, or is intense enough to damage hearing, or is otherwise annoying. The State Noise
 Control Act defmes noise as "... excessive undesirable sound..."
 NOISE A'ITENUATION. The ability of a material, substance, or medium to reduce the noise
 level from one place to another or between one room and another. Noise attenuation is specified in
 decibels.
 NOISE EXPOSURE CONTOURS. Lines drawn around a noise source indicating constant or
 equal level of noise exposure. CNEL and I.DN are typical metrics used.
  NOISE REFEP..RAL ZONES.        Such zones are defined as the area within the contour defming 11
  CNEL level of 55 decibels. It is the level at which either State or Federal laws and standards
  related to land use become important and, in some cases, preempted local laws and regulations.
  Any proposed noise sensitive development which may be impacted by a total noise environment of
  55 dB CNEL or more should be evaluated on a project specific basis.
  NOISE SENSITIVE LAND USE. Those specific land uses which have associated indoor and/or
  outdoor human activities that may be subject to stress and/or significant interference from noise
   produced by community sound sources. Such human activity typically occurs daily for continuous
   periods of 24 hours or is of such a nature that noise is significantly disruptive to activities that
occur for short periods. Specifically, noise sensitive land uses include: residences of all types,
hospitals, places of worship and schools.
SOUND LEVEL (NOISE LEVEL).            The weighted sound pressure level obtained by use of a
sound level meter having a standard frequency-fllter for attenuating part of the sound spectrum.
SOUND LEVEL METER.           An instrument, including a microphone, an amplifier, an output
meter, and frequency weighting networks for the measurement and determination of noise and
sound levels.

I.        Introduction
Half Moon Bay residents enjoy a high quality of life derived from the scenic, semi-
rural landscape around them. The undeveloped quality of open space is in great
contrast to the remainder of the Bay Area. Preservation of this character is a high
priority. At the same time, the need for adequate active sports facilities is acute.
While the area is rich in open space and regional parks, municipal parks are lacking.
In Half Moon Bay a guiding framework for the development of parks and open
spaces has been drafted to satisfy the demand for active and passive recreation.
Given anticipated increases in sewer and water capacities, population growth on the
Coastside will occur. It is important that a plan be developed and implemented
while so many opportunities exist. It will be too late to develop a quality park
system if the City waits until the area is built out.
Purpose of the Park and Recreation Element
This element is a guide to the acquisition, development, operation, and maintenance
of a park system that will adequately serve the needs of Half Moon Bay residents.
Existing conditions are evaluated, goals and long-term policies are established,
facility standards are set forth, community recreation needs are assessed, priorities
are established, and maintenance, operations, and funding needs are discussed.
Potential sites are identified for park development.
The element addresses neighborhood and community parks, active sports facilities,
passive recreation areas, trails, bikeways, linear parks, greenbelts, general open
space, cultural facilities, and space for recreation programs.
Regional parks are considered in the analysis to the extent that they provide local
recreation and open space needs; however, municipal governments do not typically
acquire land and develop regional parks. This document is directed towards the
needs of the local population, and because the area is already adequately served by
the State Beaches and County Parks, the provision of regional parks is not
recommended or discussed in this element.
Non-Mandatory Element of the General Plan
This element is not a general plan element mandated by the State Planning and
Zoning Law. Section 65303 of the law states that "the general plan may include any
other (i.e., non-mandatory) elements or address any other subjects which, in the
judgement of the legislative body, relate to the physical development of the county
or city". The City has included this element in the general plan to provide a plan for
the development of a park and recreation system.
It is important to note that this element provides a conceptual basis for defining
overall needs and identifying potential park sites, rather than a rigid framework that
must be adhered to. Although the "Master Plan Diagram" included in this element
shows a number of potential park sites, it is not the City's intention to preclude
development on those parcels where such development would be feasible under the
City's planning and zoning regulations.

  Purpose of the 1995 Element Update
  The 1990 element called for an update process at five year intervals to maintain the
  plan as a living policy document reflective of changing conditions. Formal revisions
  should be made every 15 years. This update, which focuses on a ten year planning
  horizon, has the following four main goals:
           1. Measure progress over the past five years.
           2. Update the population projections and resulting acreage requirements
              based on the adopted eight-acre standard.
           3. Revise the list of proposed development projects and cost estimates.
           4. Provide an opportunity for public, staff, and city government
              involvement.
  Progress 1990 to 1995
  New residential development has been a significant source of financing for
  municipal services and facilities in California in the 1990's. In Half Moon Bay,
  development has occurred at a relatively slow pace during the first half of this
  decade. Local limitations on water and sewer service, the recession of the early
  1990's, and a local slow-growth measure that limits new development to a 3% annual
  population increase have all contributed to development constraints. Although
  financial resources have been limited, significant progress has been made in
  realizing the master plan proposals.
  The City has developed two new facilities and has acqulred land for a third. A three
  mile length of the Coastside Trail, a multi-use blufftop recreation trail, has been
  developed from the northern city limits to Kelly Avenue. This project received an
  honor award for environmental planning from the California Park and Recreation
  society in 1994. Pilarcitos Park, a small passive-use facility located adjacent to
  Pilarcitos Creek in the downtown area, was constructed in part through the
  generous contributions of a private developer and a local landscape construction
  company. Five acres of land have been acquired in a first phase effort to provide
-community-wide active sports facilities.
  The City has also utilized the past five years for intensive planning and funding
  efforts for many projects described by the 1990 master plan. These include
  conceptual design for the five-acre parcel; grant funding for acquisition of an
  additional 9.8 acres adjacent to the five acre site; coordination with the Boys and
  Girls Club for development of a youth center on the five acre site; negotiations with
  the County of San Mateo for acquisition of a 45-acre blufftop site; design of the
  Coastside Trail segment from Kelly Avenue to Poplar Avenue; preliminary design
  and funding for the Pilarcitos Trail from downtown to the Coastside Trail; planning
  and improvements to the Johnston House historic site; and an accessibility and
  safety study _of parks city-wide.
                                         2
Modifications to the 1990 Element
The adopted standard of eight acres of parkland per one thousand residents remains
unchanged. This standard is important because it is the main determinant of the
number and size of new parks to be developed. It also determines the magnitude of
existing parkland deficiency relative to existing population.
Although the acreage standard is unchanged, greater flexibility is given for the
implementation of the mini park and neighborhood park types. Where the 1990
element called for one acre of mini park and two acres of neighborhood park per
thousand, these two types are now combined in the neighborhood park category
with a three acre standard. The emphasis should be on creation of an efficient system
of fewer, larger neighborhood parks, rather than on many small mini parks.
Properly sited, the larger neighborhood parks will provide needed facilities located
reasonably close to residents, and will be less costly to maintain.
Four neighborhood parks proposed in the West-Central Half Moon Bay planning
area are now shown in their actual location. These facilities are associated with
residential development projects having vesting tentative maps or development
agreements in place.
Because the City has begun acquisition of portions of the 65 acre community park
located in the East-Central planning area, the alternate community park location
shown in West-Central has been removed from the master plan diagram. An
additional community park site has been added to the North Wavecrest planning
area, to reflect the current development proposal. Because these two sites provide
the required community park buildout population acreage, the 1990 plan's Spanish
Town community park and alternate location have both been removed.
The acreage requirements at buildout have increased slightly, due to the increased
estimate for buildout population. Acreage for individual neighborhood parks has
increased or decreased in many planning areas to reflect the revised population
estimates for each area.
                                       3
II.      The Planning Process
The 1990 element was based on the "Half Moon Bay and Coastside Park, Recreation
and Open Space Master Plan". The 1990 planning process benefited from
considerable public participation and assessment of community needs .. The master
plan was reviewed and directed by a Technical Advisory Committee that included
one member each from the City Parks & Recreation Commission and Parks,
Planning and Public Works Departments.
The master plan was presented and reviewed at a series of City meetings where
public comment was taken and direction received from the Parks & Recreation and
Planning Commissions and City Council. Appropriate revisions were made based
on the direction received at each meeting. The Draft Master Plan represented the
consensus of the community, consultant, and City, and was conditionally approved
by the City Council on January 16, 1990.
The master plan was updated in 1995, and the revised proposals incorporated into
this revised element.
                                     4
 III.     Standards and Definitions
 The establishment of realistic and attainable standards was an important step in the
 planning process, and the standards address the types and numbers of facilities to be
 provided.
 The standards are an expression of the minimum facilities acceptable to the local
 population. They are used to set goals and measure levels of attainment. They serve
 as a guideline to determine land requirements and help structure the overall land-
 use pattern of the community. Establishment of specific acreage standards is also
 required for mandating park exaction ordinances ("park-in-lieu" or "developer"
 fees).
 National and State Park and Recreation organizations and individual governmental
  agencies have established a varying range of definitions and standards including
  park type, size, access requirements, and site development guidelines. The standard
  derived from early studies of park acreages located within urban areas was the
  expression of acres of park land per unit of population. Over time, six to ten acres
  per 1,000 population came to be the commonly accepted standard recommended by
. the National Parks and Recreation Association and used by a majority of
  communities.
  The national standards are intended as guidelines to be modified to fit local
  conditions. Existing land use, housing densities, demographic characteristics,
  economic feasibility, topography, and perceived needs are among the local factors
  that were considered in the establishment of the following standards for Half Moon
  Bay.
  As minimum guidelines, the standards are intended to be used as a flexible
  planning tool. In practice, the standards will most likely not be met in some
  portions of the City, while they may be exceeded in others.
  Proposed Acreage Standards and Park Oassifications
  The basic standard for developed parkland (neighborhood, and community parks)
  recommended by this Element is eight acres per 1000 people. This is a defensible,
  logical standard for Half Moon Bay. It falls midway on the six- to ten-acre range
  suggested by the national standards. It is higher than many California cities whose
  service areas are largely built-out, but lower than some nearby coastal cities. Eight
  acres represents· a desirable goal which is achievable due to the degree of
  availability of level, developable land which exists in the City.
  Regional parks are included in a separate category and assigned their own standard
  (10 acres per 1000 people) because they provide for other recreational needs than do
  the three developed local park categories. Regional parks draw people from a
  much larger metropolitan area than do local parks. They are characterized by
  unique natural resources and relatively large size, and provide outdoor recreation
  opportunities of regional significance. While regional parks may accommodate
  some of the local passive recreation demand, they frequently entail user fees and do
  not provide facilities needed, such as turf play areas or lighted ballfields. The
                                         5

Coastside is presently well served by regional parks including the State Beaches,
County marine reserve, and nearby County parks such as Memorial Park.
School facilities often provide valuable opportunities for active recreation. Several
constraints exist for the inclusion of schools in a first-rate recreation system,
however. Because educational use of the grounds is top priority, schools frequently
are not available for general public use or league sports play. School grounds are
often fenced and present an uninviting atmosphere to the general public. Funds for
maintenance are also often insufficient to provide safe, adequate facilities for active
sports. Because of these limitations, recommended totals for additional acreage
required to meet the eight acres per 1000 people standard do not include credit for
existing school grounds. Improvement and continued maintenance of school fields
are recommended, however.

Impact of the Standards
Tables 2 through 5 illustrate the impact of the adopted acreage standards.
Application of the eight-acre standard to the existing and future population levels
determines the amount of required parkland acreage. The "existing deficiency" is
the shortfall of acreage required to serve the existing population. The difference
between the additional acreage needed in future years and the existing deficiency
represents the new acreage required to serve future residential development.

 IV.      Existing Conditions
 Half Moon Bay's incorporated area is located between the ocean and coastal hills.
 The topography of the area is characterized by sandy beaches, dunes, ocean bluffs,
 flat coastal plain, creeks, canyons, and hills. The Pacific Coast Highway bisects the
 area, creating a barrier between the east and west, which is often difficult to traverse.
 The area is geographically isolated by the Coast Range and Devils Slide, and has
 remained underdeveloped relative to the remainder of the Bay Area.
 Approximately half of the area within the City limits consists of underdeveloped
 land or open space (Figure 1). Historically supported by farming, fishing, and
 timber, the area now is largely residential, with very little employment or industrial
 base, and is characterized by housing tracts interspersed among agricultural and
 floricultural fields. The open hills, beaches and underdeveloped flat lands create an
 atmosphere of "open space" that is in great contrast with nearby urban areas and is
 highly valued by residents.
 Geography, climate, and limited water and sewer capacity have restricted
 development and allowed the small-scale farming operations to persist. However,
 population pressure in the greater Bay Area and anticipated increases in water and
 sewer capacity are creating growth that may lead to "build-out" of the City within 20
 years.
 Population Projections
 The 1990 Census estimated the City population at 8,886. The current population
 estimate is 10,556 (California Department of Finance, January 1, 1995). This reflects an
 annual increase of just over 3%. This rate coincides with the 3% annual growth limit
 imposed by Measure A and Chapter 18.60 of the city zoning ordinance.
 City population forecasts for the years 2000, 2005, and 2020 (buildout) were
 prepared for this update based on the City General Plan, The Association of Bay
_Area Governments publication Projections 94, and the 3% annual growth limitation.
 For park planning purposes, the estimates have been rounded.

  Regional Versus Local Recreation Demand
  Local recreation resources receive pressure from Coastside residents and Bay Area
· visitors, who place a heavy demand upon the beaches, marine reserve, and Pillar
  Point Harbor. These regional facilities are well-developed and function to serve the
  needs of tourists, who generally make day trips rather than use the area as a
  weekend destination.
  The beaches and coastal bluffs also provide a valuable resource for the local
  population. The regional facilities partially satisfy the local need for passive
  recreational pursuits such as beachcombing, family picnicking, and hiking.
  However, developed City parks that provide for active recreation and additional
  passive pursuits are severely limited.

Neighborhood Planning Areas
Any given community is composed of several neighborhoods. The Park and
Recreation Element planning process considered the immediate needs of each
neighborhood as well as the overall needs of the entire community.
The neighborhood is the basic planning unit addressed in this Master Plan (Figure
2). Although neighborhoods have different geographic and demographic
characteristics, each has similar planning needs. Each neighborhood should contain
a neighborhood park within walking and bicycling distance so that active and
passive activities are readily accessible to all residents. In addition, community
parks intended to serve the entire City must be carefully planned and designed so
that the issues of noise, lights, traffic, and behavior do not create conflicts with
residential populations.
City Parks and Recreation Program
The City Parks and Recreation Department provides services to the entire Coastside
area including the residents of Montara, Moss Beach, Princeton, and El Granada. A
wide range of programs and classes are offered to youths, teens, and adults,
including dance, art, gymnastics, theater, photography, self-defense, tennis and
aerobics. The City also operates the outdoor pool located at the high school for the
use of the general public. The Department is run by a Director, assisted by one
Recreation Coordinator and one Youth Coordinator, and reports to the City
Manager and the five-member Parks and Recreation Commission.
Because the Department provides services to the entire Coastside but receives tax
revenue from only the City of Half Moon Bay, it is not able to provide the level of
service or variety of programs that most residents desire. This problem is further
exacerbated by a shortage of developed facilities. Recreation programs are
currently operating out of schools and the community center, which are overtaxed
by demand, poorly maintained, and not specifically designed for the current uses.
Existing Municipal Parks and Recreation Facilities
Currently there are seven developed municipal parks in Half Moon Bay totalling 14
acres. This provides approximately 1.33 acres per 1000 population, well below the
desired standard.
Table 9 describes the existing parks, school grounds, and other local facilities, which
are illustrated in Figure 3. A complete inventory which includes analysis and
recommendations·for each facility is presented in the Appendix to the 1990 City of
Half Moon Bay Park, Recreation and Open Space Master Plan.
Sports Programs and Facilities
Many leagues and sports programs are active on the Coastside, including adult
soccer, adult softball, Pop Warner football, American Legion baseball, Little League,
girls' softball, and boys' baseball. Half Moon Bay Sports Club soccer alone includes
over 60 teams.
                                       13

There is a shortage of available fields, with all games and practices occurring at only
four locations. Smith Field, which is on land leased from a private developer, is the
only facility operated by the City Parks Department. It includes four fields which
are used for baseball and softball. One field is lighted. Maintenance levels at this
facility are adequate.

       The three Half Moon Bay schools provide the only other facilities for active sports.
       School District funding for turf maintenance is limited, and the condition of the
       fields is a safety concern due to holes in the ground, broken sprinkler heads, broken
       glass and gravel on the fields. These conditions also diminish the quality of the
       playing experience, and have deteriorated to the extent that visiting teams from
       other areas are reluctant to play in Half Moon Bay.
       The City Parks and Recreation Department has contributed to the development of
       playing fields at Hatch Elementary, but inadequate maintenance has allowed the
       fielqs to deteriorate. Funding for school field main~enance must become a priority
       if active sports are to continue at those locations. Construction of additional sports
       fields is also needed to serve existing and future demand. Some of the new fields
       will include lighting for night play and should be constructed as part of the
       proposed community parks in locations where conflicts with residential areas can
       be avoided or mitigated.

V.       Opportunities for New Parks
Due to the relatively undeveloped nature of the City, many opportunities exist for
acquisition and development of new park and recreation facilities. Many
opportunity areas are privately owned lands which would require acquisition at
market value or alternative creative financing methods. Other opportunities exist
for incorporation of publicly-held lands into the park and recreation system, and for
preservation of open space and significant resources through land acquisition or
regulatory mechanisms.
The pace of residential development is accelerating throughout the Coastside. A
primary goal is to acquire or otherwise reserve sufficient land for anticipated
recreational needs before suitable parcels are made unavailable by development
pressure.
A series of "Planning Opportunities" diagrams (Figures 4, 5, and 6) were generated
to determine feasible locations for new parks. Because a variety of analysis criteria
were applied, overlap exists from one diagram to another. Therefore, a given parcel
of land with suitability for parks may be shown on one, two, or all three diagrams.
Areas not indicated on any of the three diagrams represent sites already developed
or otherwise restricted.
Natural Features
Existing natural features provide opportunities to preserve areas with scenic, open
space, and ecological value. Figure 4 illustrates the City's outstanding natural
features.
       Wetlands exist in two locations as coastal salt marshes.       These areas are
       protected from development by federal regulations.
       Riparian Corridors include ten creeks which terminate at the ocean. These
       areas contain significant natural vegetation and are highly valuable both as
       wildlife habitat and as potential trail corridors.
       Significant Vegetation includes both riparian corridors and tree resources
       which merit preservation.
       Beaches and Coastal Bluffs exist all along the coast. These open spaces and
       ecological resources are protected by inclusion in the State Beach and by the
       Local Coastal Program.
                                      18
Planning Designations
The Local Coastal Program, which serves as the City General Plan, encourages
recreation and park development in the following three planning designations
(Figure 5):
       Open Space Reserve includes hilly uplands with severely limited
       development potential.
       Commercial Recreation is intended to provide areas for commercially
       operated recreational facilities such as riding stables, golf course, swimming
       facilities, marinas and similar uses.
       Greenbelt - Stream Corridor restricts development along Frenchman's Creek,
       Pilarcitos Creek, and Canada Verde by establishing set-back distances.
Land Use and Zoning
Zoning designations and land ownership status reveal many opportunities for
development of new parks, as illustrated in Figure 6.
       Greenbelt zoning (GBl, GB2, and GB3 areas) preserves for park and open
       space use the beaches and adjacent bluffs within the City limits; Canada
       Verde, Pilarcitos, and Frenchman's Creeks; and the scenic Medio Hill area.
       Private-Undeveloped land indicates privately owned parcels which are
       generally now in agriculture and for which no subdivision or planned unit
       development plans have been filed with the City. These lands are candidates
        for acquisition for use as community or neighborhood parks.
        Private-Development Pending refers to privately owned parcels for which
        development plans or subdivision plans are currently on file. These future
        residential areas all possess opportunities for mini-parks, and in some cases
        for the development of neighborhood parks.
        County of San Mateo parcels are under County ownership and could be
        acquired or dedicated for park use.

VI.      Needs Assessment
The 1990 master plan utilized several vehicles to project needs and obtain an
accurate picture of what the actual park users (the community) would like to see
happen with regard to future park, recreation, and open space opportunities.
Demographic data was analyzed to ascertain future trends. Existing facilities were
inventoried and compared with proposed standards. Local geographic conditions
and existing use patterns were studied. City staff and local special interest groups
were consulted.
Attitudes and desires of the public were expressed through a series of public
meetings, written suggestions and comments, informal telephone conversations,
informal written questionnaire, and a professionally-conducted telephone survey.
The results of the telephone Attitude Survey are contained in the Coastside Parks,
Recreation and Open Space Master Plan.
Throughout the public partidpation process, a wide variety of interests and points-
of-view were expressed. The community did express a good deal of concurrence on
the central issues, however:
       1. Most agreed that there is a considerable need for new and improved
          recreation fadlities, and that this is one of the most important issues to be
          addressed by the region in the 1990's.
       2. There was a great deal of support for development of passive recreation
          opportunities such as the bluff top trail and open space areas.
       3. There was a great deal of concern that both adults and especially children
          be provided with well-designed, safe facilities for active sports.
       4. There was a desire that cultural facilities such as a theater, museum, or art
          gallery be made available for the local population to express their creative
          and artistic talents, and to enjoy cultural events produced by others.
       5. People agreed that it would be a good idea to connect the passive, active
          and cultural recreation areas with each other and with residential areas
          through development of a trail system.
       6. Most were concerned that the park system be sufficiently funded so that
          the facilities can be properly developed and maintained.
                                       23
VII. Goals, Objectives and Policies
Specific actions to be taken by the community are based on agreed-upon priorities
that reflect the long-term goals and aspirations of the population. The policy
statements that follow outline the Parks and Recreation Element and establish the
philosophy and direction for the park and recreation system.
Goals are broad statements of purpose that reflect the community's collective vision
of the future.
Objectives are the "yardsticks" by which the goals are measured. They describe
specific conditions that are desirable in order to attain a given goal.
Policies are specific statements which guide decision making and suggest action to
be taken to meet objectives and attain goals.

      2.2.4 Complete development of the Coastside Recreation Trail in the
              approximate location shown on the Master Plan Diagram. (Trail
              location is shown schematically). Trail location should generally be
              held at least 20 feet back from bluff edge, and should, in most cases, be
              within 300 feet of the bluff edge.
      2.2.5   Develop a Foothill Recreation Trail in the approximate location shown
              on the Master Plan Diagram.
      2.2.6 Construct a pedestrian/bicycle over- or under--crossing of Highway 1

              Frenchmans Creeks to connect the foothill trail and areas east of the
              highway with the coastal trail and areas west of the highway.
GOAL 3: IMPLEMENTATION
Develop a long- and short-term range program to achieve the policies set forth in
this element through a combination of public and private funding, regulatory
methods, and other strategies.
                                        26
Objective 3.1: Ensure that the City of Half Moon Bay receives its fair share of State
and Federal grants.
       Policies
       3.1.1  City staff shall pursue funding for direct, matching, and challenge
              grants from agencies as available.
Objective 3.2: Study the establishment of a landscape and lighting district to defray
costs of maintenance and operations.
       Policies
       3.2.1  The City staff should study establishment of an ordinance to create one
              City-wide assessment district or several smaller districts under the
              Landscape and Lighting Act of 1972 to provide funding for the
              acquisition, development, and ongoing maintenance of park and
              recreation facilities within the City.
Objective 3.3: Utilize bond issues or other funding mechanisms as necessary to fund
development of parks and special facilities.
       Policies
       3.3.1  City staff shall determine the feasibility of funding specific park
              projects through bond or tax measures and implement as needed.
Objective 3.4: Utilize ordinances and easements to ensure that significant natural
resources are protected during development.
       Policies
       3.4.1  Explore the use of open space easements, a voluntary program
              authorized by the Open-space Easement Act of 1974, through which the
              City can obtain the conservation value of property which it does not
              own.
       3.4.2 Explore the use of conservation easements, established through the
              California Conservation Easement Act of 1979. A conservation
              easement is similar to an open-space easement, except that it can be
              granted to a private organization or individual instead of a local
              government.
       3.4.3 Use transferable development rights (TDRs) to allow the development
              rights of a parcel located in an area of significant resource value to be
              transferred to another location with less resource value.
                                        27
Objective 3.5: Study the feasibility of establishing a "Friends of the Parks and
Recreation System" organization to provide funding resources.
     Policies
       3.5.1   Establish a City-wide organization and recruit individuals within the
              community who can donate or attract contributions to serve on the
              organization board.
       3.5.2 Explore methods to acquire funding and contributions of land through
               the organization, inc! uding wills and bequests, gifts of life insurance,
               charitable remainder trusts, and gifts catalogue.
       3.5.3. Explore methods for land acquisition, inc! uding life estates,
               contributions of surplus real estate, sequential donations or purchases,
               tax delinquent property, and purchase and leaseback programs with
               landowners.
       3.5.4 Explore an "Adopt-a-Park" concept with industry, service clubs, and
               citizens. Identify interested corporations, clubs, or individuals and
               create an action plan tailored to fit the adopting organization's budget
               and interest.
Objective 3,6: Revise the existing development impact fee ordinance to reflect the
total cost of improvements required to serve new development.
Objective 3.7: Explore availability of funds from corporate sponsors and private
foundations.
Objective 3.8: Explore the establishment of additional user fees or raising the
current amounts charged to sports groups, group picnics, and other organizations
or users. Consider charging non-residents higher fees than those charged to local
residents.
Objective 3.9: Ensure that the Parks and Recreation Department receives a fair share
of the revenue generated by the Half Moon Bay Redevelopment Agency.
       Policies
       3.9.1   City Parks and Recreation Staff should work cooperatively with the
               City Manager's office and the Redevelopment Agency to work towards
               earmarking a significant portion of the Redevelopment monies for
                park and recreation facilities acquisition and development.
                                        28
GOAL 4: OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
Develop the necessary organizational staffing and funding mechanisms to assure
that all parks, facilities, and open spaces are well-maintained.
Objective 4.1: Ensure adequate revenue for the maintenance of all facilities.
       Policies
       4.1.2   Establish a maintenance and operations budget sufficient for the given
              level of parks development in any given year, to be funded through the
              General Fund and other potential new sources such as an assessment
              district.
Objective 4.2: Provide for security and safe use of park facilities.
        Policies
       4.2.1   Maintain facilities at appropriate levels.
                                        29
VIII. Implementation
Achieving the goals set forth in this Element will depend in large part upon
securing sufficient funding for acquisition and development of new parklands,
improvement of existing parks, and operation and maintenance of the facilities.
Funding will come from existing sources and new public and private sources. In
addition to direct funding, various regulatory measures can help ensure
preservation of recreation lands.
J:mplementation of this element is a key to maintaining and improving the quality of
life now enjoyed by City residents. Implementation is an achievable goal that can be
made available at a reasonable cost per household. Throughout the planning
process, the community was supportive of the proposed program. Implementation
will require residents to support a portion of the projected costs as well.
Master Plan for Buildout
Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the system of parks and recreation facilities to serve the
buildout population of approximately 20,000. The system includes 100 acres of
community parks, 45 acres of neighborhood parks, three community centers, 15
miles of trails, and 34 acres of regional parkland (not including the state beaches).
The following parks are included in this system:
           Community Parks
          C1      Coastside Community Park                    65 acres
          C2      North Wavecrest Community Park              35 acres
           Neighborhood Parks
          N1      Dykstra Neighborhood Park                   2.5 acres

Development Plan Through the Year 2005
This 1995 update focu~es on the facilities needed to serve both the existing
population, and the-additional 3,500 increase anticipated over the next ten years.
These facilities are illustrated on Figure 9, and described below.
                                       30
CI-A Coastside Community Park Phase A (5 acres)
      The City has acquired five acres as a first phase of the proposed 65-acre
      community park. The site will provide facilities for active league sports,
      parking, picnic areas, and open turf. A city corporation yard will occupy
      two-thirds of an acre. A new 24,000 square foot Boys and Girls Club
      building is also planned for this site.
Cl-B Coastside Community Park Phase B (9.8 acres)
      An additional 9.8 acres located adjacent to the five-acre site will be
      purchased by the City and developed as a second phase of the proposed
      65-acre park.
C2    Wavecrest Community Park (35 acres)
      The current North Wavecrest Redevelopment Area proposal includes
      development of a 35-acre community park to provide both active and
      passive recreation opportunities. A community center should also be
      developed on this site and could include a community theater,
      community pool, and/or other special use facility.
Rl    Poplar Park (34 acres)
      The City has entered into an agreement to take over ownership of 45 acres
      of blufftop land from the County of San Mateo. The park will be primarily
      passive in nature, with a low intensity of development. It is recommended
      that an 11-acre portion of this site be developed as a neighborhood park to
      alleviate the existing deficiency in the West-Central planning area (see N5
      below).
Nl, N2, N3, N4     East-Central Neighborhood Parks (5.8 acres total)
      Four park sites have been identified and dedicated through the
      subdivision process. These sites range in size from one-half to two and
      one-half acres, and will provide facilities to serve the new and adjacent
      residential subdivisions.
NS    West-Central Neighborhood Park (11 acres)
      A portion of the 45-acre site should be developed to provide
      neighborhood scale facilities to serve this planning area. The existing
      deficiency within this planning area is 8.7 acres, and will reach 11.6 acres at
      build out.
N6    Spanish Town Neighborhood Park (7 acres)
      This planning area has reached 85% of its anticipated build out
      population. The area contains 1.4 acres of existing parks, has an existing
      deficiency of 5.9 acres, and will require a total of 8.8 acres at build out. A
      new neighborhood park should be developed.
Coastside Trail (Kelly Avenue to Ocean Colony)
      The existing trail willlJe extended through the 45-acre regional park and
      the North Wavecrest redevelopment area.
                                   31
Foothill Boulevard Trail
       The proposed Foothills Boulevard should include a Caltrans Class One
       bicycle and pedestrian pathway, separated from vehicular traffic.
Pilarcitos Creek Trail
       The City has prepared a preliminary plan and grant funding request for a
       creekside trail and habitat protection and enhancement project to extend
       from downtown to the Coastside Trail.

Costs for Operation and Maintenance
Development of additional facilities will require additional funding for operation
and maintenance. Table 11 shows the estimated costs for each type of facility for the
full ten-year development:

Funding Sources
The City currently finances its park system through the general fund, grant funding,
and two park funds which derives income from two municipal development
ordinances. In the next ten year period, these sources may be supplemented by the
North Wavecrest Redevelopment Area, which is anticipated to finance the park and
trail facilities located within its boundaries.
The ten-year program will likely require additional funding sources to achieve full
development. Bond issues are appropriate for financing large, capital intensive
projects such as community parks and community centers. Formation of a
landscape and lighting assessment district is appropriate for both facilities
development and financing of operation and maintenance. Although the popular
mood has been anti-spending thus far in the 1990's, communities throughout the
country have successfully implemented park financing measures that were carefully
designed with a real understanding of local needs. Unless additional funding
sources are supported by Half Moon Bay residents, the ten-year plan will not likely
be fully realized.
Table 12 outlines recommended funding sources for each of the projects contained
in the ten-year plan.

Park and Recreation Element Monitoring Process
This Element is intended to be evaluated and updated as local conditions change.
City staff should monitor changing conditions and develop appropriate revised
policies and implementation measures as the need arises. The goals, objectives, and
policies should be thoroughly evaluated every five years in light of changing public
attitudes and economic conditions.

I. INTRODUCTION
                                                                       5
                           PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
Sec!lon 65300 of the Californta Government Code requires every
city   and county to adopt a comprehensive,         long-term General Plan
for the phyS!cal development of land under its jurisdiction.                  The
Code requires the General Plan to .include several elements, one
of which Is a Safety Element
The purpose of the Safety Element is for the protection of the
community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects
of seismically induced surface rupture.            ground shaking,         ground
failure,     tsunami    seiche.    and  dam  failure:     slope     instability
leading    to    mudslides    and    landslides:    subsidence       and    other
geologic hazards known to the legislative body:                 flooding;      and
wildland and urban fires.         The Safety Element includes mapping of
known seismic and other          geologtc hazards.       It a 1 so addresses
evacuation      routes     peakload    water   suppl.y   requirements,         and
minimum road widths and clearances around structures                    as   those
 items relate to identtfied fire and geologic hazards.
The aim of       the Safety Element       is to reduce death,          injuries.
 property     damage,    and   the    economic   and    social      dislocation
 resulting from natural hazards including:              flooding; muds 1 ides
 and    soil    creep;    tsunamis     and   seiches;      land      subsidence:
 earthquakes; avalanches; other geologic phenomena; levee or dam
 failure·, certain types of urban and wildland fires: and building
 collapse.
 The Safety Element is the primary vehicle for identifying hazards
  that the City of Half Moon Bay must consider when making land use
 decisions       While the Safety Element focuses on identifying fire
 and geologic hazards. it may also address other locally relevant
  safety issues      such as    vehicle accidents.      hazardous       materials
  spills. power failure. and storm drainage.
  The City of Half Moon Bay has developed the Safety Element in
  accordance     with    the   California     State    code      in     order     t 0
  sufficiently detail the appropriate polices and programs for the
  City's planning area.        Upon adoption by the City Council. t hi s
  element will be submitted in accordance with State Code to the
  California Division of Mines and Geology of the Department of
  Conservation.
  This Safety Element may be amended in accordance with State                   Law
   as new, updated, or revised information becomes available.

                                                                                    6

likely to move again.          For planning purposes, "active fault" is
usually defined as one that shows movement within the last 11.000
years.

to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year:
sometimes referred to as the "base flood"                        or "100-year"             flood
area.
COASTAL CLIFF EROSION- Wearing                 away of coastal cliffs due                         to

CRITICAL FACILITY- Includes facilities housing or serving many
people or otherwise posing unusual hazards in case of damage from
or malfunction during an earthquake.                  such as hospitals.                   fire.

fires,    flooding,     and other ensuing hazards.            The er feet s could be
aggravated by        aftershocks     and   by   the   secondary    effects of      fire.
lands 1 ides, and dam failure.          The time of day and season of the vear
would also have a profound effect on the potential number of injuries
and the amount        of damage sustained.            Damage control and disaster
relief support would be required from other local governmental and
private organizations,. and from the state and federal governments.
Extensive      search    and   rescue operations       may   be  required    to   J.ssist
 trapped    or    injured     persons.      Emergency      medical   care.    food    J.nd
 temporary shelter would be required by injured or displaced persons
 Identification and burial of many dead persons •uould pose difficult
problems: public health would be a major concern.                  Evacuations may be
essential to save lives, particularly in dam inundation areas.                      Many
 families would be separated, particularly if the earthquake shoul?
occur during working hours, and a personal inquiry or locater syste
would be essential to maintain morale.               Emergency operations could be
 seriously hampered         by   the   loss   of    communications    and    damage     to
 transportation routes within, and to and from, the disaster area and
 by the disruption of public utilities and services.
Extensive federal assistance could be required and could continue for
 an extended period. These efforts would be required to remove debris
 and    clear      roadways,      demolish      unsafe     structures,      ass1sr       ln
 reestablishing public services and utilities, and provide contrnuing
 care and welfare         for   the affected population,         including     temporary
 housing for displaced persons.
 The San ~ndreas Fault, which traverses the San Franci sea Peninsula.

 the county just southwest of Palo Alto (see Natural Hazards \!apl
 Analysis of earthquake disaster and preparedness in San \lateo County
 has been based on a 8.3 magnitude earthquake as a reasonable worst-
 case event within the County.            The ground shaking of an 8.3 magnitude
 earthquake on the northern San Andreas Fault would result ln serious
 damage in San Mateo County.
 There is a 23 percent chance of a magnitude 7 earthquake occurring on
  the Peninsular segment of the San ~ndreas Fault within the next 3.0
 years,    and    there    is   a 67    percent   chance    for   one   or more     lar•-
 earthquak.es occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area for the same t i
 period.     The San Gregorio Fault which is closer to Half Moon Bay, rs

  to that of one on the larger San Andreas Fault

The following information obtained from the San Mateo Operational .~.rea
Office of E!Ilergency Services provides detailed estimates of possible
earlhquake losses     in all   of San Mateo County based on an 8.3 magn1tude

Since    studies    only     predicted     the  total    number   of    deaths    and
hospitalized injuries, (exclusive of dam failures) for the entire San
Francisco Bay Area.         it  is assumed that a proportionate number of

  Marine   facilities     at  Redwood Creek will       be closed.
  COIDIUNICATIONS
  Telephone    Syste~~
  Telephone communications will be adversely affected due to overloading
  resulting from post-earthquake calls within the area and from                            the
  outside, and many instruments will be off their hooks.                      This situation
  will be further complicated by physical damage to equipment due to
  ground shaking, loss of service due to loss of electrical power. and
  subsequent failure of some auxiliary power sources.
  Countywide key system facilities               are located near          the San Andreas
  Fault within the County areas projected to experience intense ground
   shaking.     It is likely that the telephone systems in and to the south
  of San Francisco will have systemic failures not readily bypassed by
                                                                          18
alternative traffic routing ..           1 t is also probable that           the :-ecovery
effort will be de 1 ayed because many telephone company e'!np lovees ':.:111
have difficulty getting access ro damaged areas to accomplish repa1rs
Radio systems will generally opera·te at 40 percent effectiveness for
the first 12 hours after the earthquake,                   increase to SO percent for
the second 12 hours,          then begin a slow decline to approximatelv 40
percent      within   36    hours.      The      long-term     implications       are   that
individual systems gradually will become less useful to the overall
recovery effort when supplanted by systems relocated from outside the
disaster area.       It is unlikely that public safety radio systems ·~auld
become saturated with noncritical communications from mobile units
Radio      traffic    densities      on     redundant       (nonemergency      deSlgnated)
channels would increase, particularly when remote base station and
 repeater failures woul<i tend to limit the number of redundant channels
available.      After 12 hours, at which time the number of operable units
will have declined (because of exhaustion of emergency power fuel) and
 because recovery efforts will have restored some order                          the rJdio
 traffic density problems will ease.
Commercial     Broadcaster~
 All radio and       television facilities            are anticipated to be out of
 operation in San Mateo County for 24 hours due to in-house problems
 and/or     power   supply     problems,      and/or     transmission     line     problems.
 Elsewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area, l/3 of the facilities are
 also expected to be out of service for 24 hours.                    After 24 hours. SO
 percent of the entire San Francisco Bay Area facilities are expected
 to be in operation.
 WATER SUPPLY AND WASTE DISPOSAL
 Several of the major aqueducts will sustain damage, causing temporary
  interruptions in water supply.             The numerous major reservoirs in the
  area provide ample storage to meet demands during the t !me required
  for   repairs.      Damage      to water      transmission      lines.    local     storage
  reservoirs, and pumping plants, as well as local distribution system.
 will    affect     water     availability        and   pressure.       The     absence    of
  electrical     power    for    the   extended       periods   will,    in    some    areas,
  preclude water deliveries where pumping is necessary.                          Many areas
  could be dependent on tanker truck to provide their basic needs
  Sewage collectfon systems will sustain widespread damage.                     Many sewage
  treatment facilities also located in structurally poor ground adjacent
  to   the    San   Francisco      Bay   will      be   damaged    and   will     experience
  elect.rical power losses, resulting in discharge of raw sewage into the
  San Francisco Bay.

Damage to power plants and their ancillary facilities                         in affe~ted
areas can be expected to reduce g.enerating capacity.                      The potential
impact     of      this    reduction        in   local  output    is  lessened     by  the
availability of power from other sources outside the affected area and
by the obvious significant                 reduction in consumer demand that ·vill
occur.      Immediate concerns will focus on repairs necessary to restore
power to areas of greatest need.
During some portion of the first 72-hour period following a major
earthquake. most areas would experience some temporary loss of power.
1\.ll critical facilities wi l 1 require standby generating equipment and
emergency fuel supplies.
Damage to natural gas facilities will consist primarily of Ia) some
 isolated breaks in the major transmission lines and (b) innumerable
breaks      in     mains     and    individual      service   connections      within   the
distribution systems, particularly in the areas of intense ground
 shaking and/or poor ground nearer the San Francisco Bay.                       These many
 leaks in the distribution system will affect a major portion of the
urban areas on the San Francisco Peninsula, resulting in a loss of
 service for extended periods.                  Sporadically distributed fires should
 be expected at the sites of a small percentage of ruptures both in the
 transmission lines and the distribution system.
 Transmission pipelines            serving      the San   Francisco  Peninsula    are  most
 vulnerable to damage.

                                  TSUNAMIS AND SEICHES
BACKGROUND
The phenomenon called ":sunami'' Ls J series of traveling ocean
waves     of    extremely        long     length.       generated      by     undersea
earthquakes,       volcanic     eruptions,       or    massive      landslides    into
adjacent bodies of water.              As a tsunami crosses the deep ocean
its length from crest to crest may be a hundred miles or more and
its height from trough to crest only a few feet.                      In deep water.
tsunamis may reach forward speeds of 600 miles per hour.                        As the
 tsunami enters shallow waters. such as along the coast, its speed
decreases but the wave height increases                    It is in these shallow
waters    that    tsunamis      become     a threat      to    life and property.
Following the arrival of              the first wave         subsequent waves       may
 increase in height and arrive minutes to hours later.
 Although there are no known recorded deaths from tsunami act1on
 in San Mateo County, it is probable that there was wave impact in
 1946. 1960. and again in 1964.                 In 1946 an earthquake in the
 Aleutian Islands generated a tsunami that                    caused one death in
 Santa Cruz County.             The    resultant      tsunami     from    the Alaskan
 earthquake of 1964 caused eleven deaths in Crescent City, just
 south of the Oregon border.             The United States Geological Survey
 (USGS) has produced a map delineating areas subject to tsunami
 inundation based on a 20 foot runup along coastal areas and also
 at the Golden Gate Bridge.            Such a runup is estimated to occur an
 average of once every 200 years.                The areas of the County which
 would be most heavily damaged by a tsunami are those along the
 Pacific Coast        Point Ana Nuevo, Pescadero Creek and San Gregorio
 Creek estuaries, and portions of Half Moon Bay, \liramar, and El
 Granada.       Within     the City of Pacifica.             affected areas       would
  include:     San Pedro Valley, Rockaway Beach. Linda \lar and Laguna
  Salada.    The degree of damage experienced bv these areas ·would
  depend    on    the     local     sea     bottom     and    coastal       topographic
  characteristics as well as the incoming direction of the tsunami
  CSee Natural Hazards Map)
  Seiches are oscillating waves in an enclosed or partly-enclosed
  body of water caused by earthquakes or landslides which displace
  part of the water body.            Four water bodies in San ~!ateo County
  are believed       to   be   large enough         to   pose significant        seiche
  potential:        Upper    Crystal      Springs      Reservoir.      Lower    Crystal
  Springs Reservoir, San Andreas Lake. Pi larci tos Lake, and San
  Francisco Bay.        If an earthquake similar in magnitude to the 1906
  earthquake were to occur at a time when these water bodies were
  at the high water mark. seiches could overtop the spillways of
   these water bodies by several feet causing large scale inundation
   downstream.

POLICIES
1.   Encourage  the San Mateo Area Office of        Emergency Serv1     es to

     television and radio media.
2.   New critical facilities should not be located in areas with
      the potential to be adversely affected by tsunamis and/or

      tsunami hazard zone,     ''tsunami-proof"  design and construction
      princ1ples should     be    incorporated   so  thal   it  can    resist

                                                                              23
                              INUNDATION FROM DAM FAILURE
BACKGROUND
Dam failures      can    result     from    J     number of natural        or    manmaae
causes      such    as     earthquake:            (ground      rupture     or      severe
groundshaking)       eros1on of :he            fJce or foundation.         landsliding
which displaces       J   lJ.rge volume of \Vater,             rapidly rising        ~load
waters     and structural/design flaws.
There are      three    general      types of        dams:      earth and rockfi ll
concrete arch or hydraulic fill                  and concrete gravity.           Each of
these types of dams has different failure characteristics.                             The
earth-rock.fill dam ·.,ill fail           gradually due to erosion of                   the
breach: a flood wave will build gradually to a peak and then
decline       until    the    reservoir       is    empty.      A concrete       arch or
hydraulic fill dam \l..'ill fail almost instantaneously: thus J very
 rapid build-up      ro a peak wave and then a gradual decline.                            _\
 concrete gravity dam will fail somewhere in between instantaneous
 and gradual, w1th corresponding build-up of flood wave.
 In   addition    to    the     above   mentioned         characteristics,        warning
 ability is generally determined by the frequency of inspections
 for structural integrity, the flood wave arrival time <the time
 it tak.es for the flood wave to reach its maximum distance of
 inundation), or        the ability       to notify persons downstream and
 their    ability    to    evacuate.         The      existence     and  frequency        of
 updating and exercising an evacuation plan that is site-specific
 assists in warning and evacuation functions.
 A dam failure will cause loss of life, damage to property. and
 other ensuing hazards,           as well as          the displacement of persons

POLICIES
 1.   Encourage the San Mateo Area Office of Emergency Services to
      develop and maintain a dam inundation warning plan to alert
      affected governmental agencies,      residents, and businesses
       located in the potential hazard areas.     This dam inundation
      plan should be coordinated with local television and radio
      media.
 2.    Land use considered to be appropriate in areas that            are
       subject to dam inundation hazards shall be consistent with
      Title 18 of     the Half \loon Bay Municipal Code         (Zoning
      Ordinance)
                                                                                26
                                      FLOOD HAZARDS
BACKGROUND
Floods are generally classed as either               slow-rise or        flash     f'    Jds.
Slow-rise floods may be preceded by a warning time lasting h''Urs
days, or possibly weeks.           Evacuati·on and sandbagg1ng for a                     low-
rise flood may lessen flood-related damage.                       Conversely.          :·lash
floods    are    the    most   difficult      to    prepare       for.     due            the
extremely short warning           time.    if any is        given at all              Flash
flood warnings usually require evacuation within the hour. Once
flooding begins personnel will be needed to assist                          in rescuing
persons trapped by flood water. securing utilities, cordoning off
flooded areas and controlling traffic.                 These actions may overtax
local agencies        and additional        personnel       and    resources        may be
required.      It is anticipated that existing mutual aid resources
would be used as necessary to augment               local     resources.
Watersheds in San \lateo County are relatively small and the run
 to the Pacific Ocean or to the Bay is relatively short                                    The
 typical    long,     slow-rising      floods     experienced        in     the    Central
Valley and along the great rivers of northern California do not
 occur here.      Watersheds flow1ng through the City of Half Moon Bay
 limits   to    the    ocean   are as      follows:          Arroyo Canada            Verde,
 Frenchmans Creek, Pi larci tos Creek. Arroyo Leon Creek., an unnamed
 creek north      of    Roosevelt     Road crossing          Balboa Boulevard.              an
 unnamed creek        south of      Kehoe Avenue         tributary       to    Pilarcitos
 Creek., and an unnamed creek at the southern portion of the City
 extending from north of Fairway Drive.
 In more densely populated urban areas                     the risks        to life and
 property from flood hazards are increased.                     A.s more development
 occurs within floodplain areas.               it often becomes necessary to
 finance expensive engineering solutions to the flooding problems.
 Urban areas      can also      be victimized         by    the    problem of debrts
 blockage     of     creek    channels.          In    many      areas,       residential
 neighborhoods border directly on creek channels.                            These areas
 could easily be         spot   flooded if        the channels         are not        clear.
 Decaying flood-deposited garbage or other organic material could
 create health hazards in the aftermath of a flood.
 A map prepared        by the United States Geological Survey in 1971
  indicated     that    the   Pilarcitos       Creek      and    ~rroyo       Leon      Creek
 drainages were potential          f1ood hazard areas.          These areas were not
  included in revisions to that map prepared by the USGS in 1973.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMAl prepared the Flood
  Insurance Study for the City of Half Moon Bay in 1986. The map
  prepared    as    a   part   of    this    Study     indicates        that     potential
  flooding is likely to occur only in a small area to the '"est of
  Alameda Avenue and north of Guerrero Avenue in the Miramar area·
  This map was used to delineate areas of potential flooding on the
  Natural Hazards Map.

                                  SOIL STABILITY
BACKGROUND
Soil Creep
Soil creep is the slow downslope movement of soil and weathered
bedrock..    The moving layer can range from a few centimeters to
several feet in thickness.          Rates of movement also vary r3.nging
from less than a centimeter per year to 10 centimeters or more
per week.      The rate of soil creep depends on ~everal                  factors
 including slope, slope materials, and climate. The rate of creep
can be increased or decreased by human activities,                    especially
when the load on creeping slopes is increased with buildings or
artificial     fill     Correct      placement      of   artificial    fill    can
decrease soil creep.
Although it is too slow to be perceptible, the cumulative effects
of creep are easily recognized:            cracked sidewalks. pavement and
walls,    leaning or    bent    trees    and    fences,    and   shifts    in   the
 alignment of linear features such as railroad tracks,                  streets,
 and fences.
 Landslides
 Landslides include all movements of soil, rock. or debris as a
 result of falling,     sliding, or flowing.            Most landslides are a
 combination of     two or more       types    of motion and/or material
 Landslides are categorized according to the types of motion and
 material involved.     They can be directly caused by earthquakes or
 be completely independent of them.
       Falls describe the sudden movement           of material from vertical
       or near-vertical slopes. and are             generally labeled bv the
       type of material displaced.
       Slides refer to movements in which the material moves more
       or less as a unit along recognizable shear surfaces                   If the
       shear    surface   is   concave.      the     slide   movement    will     be
       rotational and is denoted by the term "slump."               If the shear
       surface is planar. translation movement occurs and the term
       "slide" is used alone.         Both slides and slumps are further
       classified according to the type of material involved (e.g.
       earth slump, rockslide, debris slide, where "debris" refers
       to combinations of        soil,    fill,    weathered bedrock,        and/or
       organic material)
       Flows    describes    the    movement      of    material   in   which     an
        innumerable number       of   small-scale       movements    rather     than
       massive sliding is the dominant mechanism of transport                  This
       categorv is     further broken down by the              type of material
                                                                              29

      of ground materials (highly affected by rainfall)                        ond the
      density     of    vegetation.          Human       factors      include       the
      oversteepening and overloading             of    slopes.     the removal        of
      natural vegetation,        the addition of water to the soil by
      watenng of lawns and septic system drain fields, and ansi te
      ponding of storm runoff.
Cliff Erosion
Wave action remove~ materials from the base of coastal cliffs
along :he western edge of the County, causing varying degree~ of
landsliding ond cliff erosion.           This rate of erosion is dependent
upon several factors, including rhe steepness of coastal slopes
lithology, the degree of consolidation of cliff materials,                           the
response    to    precipitation        and     the    incoming      intensity        and
direction of waves         Most of the coastal cliff area of Half Moon
Bay is classified as having moderate stability.                        The southern
area has high stability and the northern area has low stability
characteristics as classified by San Mateo County.                      CSee Natural
Hazards Map)
Land Subsidence
Non-Seismic Land Subsidence and Differential Settlement
Subsidence and differential settlement (the uneven lowering of
 the ground surface) constitute minor natural hazards in the City
of Half M:oon Bay.           Differential       settlement       is a more common
hazard often occurring when bui !dings and bridges are built on
poor foundation materials.              Pilings are often used to anchor
 structures    to    firmer    deposits       below     the     surface      in    these
 situations.     Surface footings tend             to be used to support less
 important structures.         If surface footings are used to support
one part of a structure and pilings for another.                        differential
 settlement    will     occur,    with     the    area    supported       by     surface
 footings   setting      faster     than    the    piling      supported       section
 Differential settlement generally occurs slowly enough that its
 effects are not serious.
 Shrink/Swell Soils
 Shrink/swell      soils   are     those    which     can    expand      or     contract
 depending on moisture content and soil mineralogy.                           Expansive
 soils are associated with the presence of certain types of clay

Seismically-Induced Subsidence
Subsidence,     defined      as    the    sinking      or    lowering       of   a part       of   the
earth's    surface.       can     occur      as    a   result      of     or   independent          of
earthquakes.        Seismically-induced subsidence can be either                                      a
direct or an      indirect result of an earthquake.                           Direct tectonic
displacement       of     bedrock        can     result       from       strong       earthquakes
causing    either     subsidence         or   uplift     of    up    to    several       feet    over
relatively large areas of ground surface.                               Indirect subsidence
resulting from compaction of gradual soil layers caused by ground
 shaking is      more     common.           Such      shaking       causes       subsidence          by
compressing the soil deposit so that pore space formerly filled
 by groundwater or air is eliminated                       There must be an outlet for
 evacuation of these pore spaces in order for subsidence to occur.

BACKGROUND
Because of            the mix      of urban.           rural.    and   ·~ildland    areas     :n
California,           fire    protection is            a difficult       problem and       :ire
protection           systems      are     complex.           Large    tracts    of   sparsely
populated land must be protected from wildland fires in hot                                 dry
summers       at      the    same     time     that      adequate     protection must         be
provided to densely population urban centers.                           Fire protection in
urban areas must               also be designed             and equipped       to cope with
industrial            fires     with       any       associated      hazardous      materials
concerns, structures of varying height, density, and occupancy,
and transportation accidents involving hazardous materials. There
are     twenty        cities     within       San \!ateo        County.       Each   city      is
responsib1e for its Cire protection either by utilizing 1ts own

 protected by the Colma, Half Moon Bay, Menlo Park, Point \!ontara.
 and Woodside Fire Protection Districts.                           The South County Fire
 Authority is responsible for fire protection in Belmont and San
Carlos.        Unincorporated areas are the primary responsibility of
 the California Department                    of     Forestry,     along    with some       fire
 protection districts, and volunteer fire companies. Fires in both
 urbanized and forested settings can rapidly extend to the point
 that local resources are inadequate.                          All fire agencies in San
 Mateo      County         have    signed       the     California      Master     Mutual    Aid
 Agreement and participate in mutual aid operations as requjred.

 Fuel Loading
  In San Mateo County almost the entire unincorporated rural area
  is covered with woodland,                    brush, or grassland e:<cept             for    the
 cultivated lands in the Coastal Zone.                         In recent years, extensive
  study has been undertaken at the State level to classify the fire
  hazard severity of different regions of the State.                               One of the
  key components in measuring severity is the type and quantity of
  flammable vegetation within a given unit of land area.                                    This
  factor. also known as ''fuel loading characteristics," can then be
  comb.ined with weather and slope to obtain a measure of relative
  hazard.
  Three basic fuel loading characteristics have been identified by
   the State.              "Heavy"      fuel     loading      vegetation     is   assigned       to
  woodland and brushwood areas.                        This char act eri s tic is generally
   assigned to vegetation that                     is six feet or more in height Jnd
  which has a crown density of 20 percent or more of the ground

                                                                    33
area.    The heavy fuel loading vegetation types include conifer:.:
and mixed evergreen timberlands and chaparral which are found in
abundance 1n the rural Jrea of the County.
"\ledium"     fuel   loading    ''egetation    generally     includes     scrub
•regetation that is less than six feet in height but with similor
crown density characteristics          This category includes California
sagebrush, coyote brush. manzanita. and other chaparral species
common to the County.
"Light"     fuel   loading   vegetative     types  are    various   types     of
grasslands, herbaceous rangelands and irrigated pasture lands.
These areas are almost completely treeless and, although highly
flammable during       dry    seasons,   do   not  have    significant     fuel
content to Sustain any fire that might be started.
Weather Conditions
The second major        natural    characteristics    to consider      in   fire
hazard measurement are         local weather conditions.          In Northern
California, very little rain normally falls between mid-April and
 the beginning of November.          By September, many portions of the
 State are tinder dry from months of aridity.              It is not unusual
 for strong, drying winds to blow in from the north and east
The State has established three "critical fire weather frequency"
classes     to measure     the   weather-related    fire hazard      severity.
These classes basically measure           the annual number of days            in
which a cri t leal "fire load index"           is exceeded over a 10-year
 period, with Class I the lowest and Class III the highest level
 of danger.
 A. fire weather frequency class rating has been provided for 3 l 1
 of the USGS quadrangles in California.           Due to the high rainfall
 experienced by the portion of San Mateo County west of Skyline
 Boulevard. as well as the cooling influence of the summer coastal
  fog, no port ion of San Mateo County is given the most                  severe
 weather rating.
 Slope
 The third major characteristic of fire hazard measurement is the
 degree of slope present in a localized area.             The rugged terrain
  and steep slopes that characterize much of the County's rural
  area can create extreme access problems for fighting fires once
  they have started.        Generally, vegetation is more abundant              in
  steep canyon areas due to less severe sun and wind exposure and
  greater capture of rain runoff.          Fires that start in the bottom
  of canyons will burn 16 times faster upslope than if they begin
  at the top of ridges and burn downslope.
  The S t ate has divided        slope categories      into three     different
  classes of fire severity.         Class I includes slopes from 0 to 40
  percent      This category assumes that direct attack on the fire is

                                                                          34

hand crews, and J.ircrJ.ft          Class III includes slopes grea(er than
61    percent         This    class     includes    areas    mostly    beyond     the
capability of bulldozers which can only be directly attacked bv
hand crews and aircraft
Level    of Service
Since      1962,    the   County     has   contracted     with    the   California
Department of ForestrY (CDFl for structural fire protectton and
general rescue services in unincorporated areas of the County not
 served by other fire districts or departments                  Officially, this
 service is provided by CDF under the title of the County Fire
 Department          Tn
                     _    some    counties.     CDF   only   has   wildland      fire
 protection (for forest. brush. and grassland fires)                   in what are
 known as "State Responsibility Areas."                The general goal of the
 CDF/County Fire system is             to provide a response         time nf     five
 minutes or       less   to any fire occurring           in  the rural      area 90
 percent of the time.
 The Half Moon Fire Protection District serves the unincorporated
 areas of El Granada, 'Jiramar. Princeton, all of the incorporated
 area of the City of Half Moon Bay, and canyons east and south of
 Half Moon Bay.        The first backup call to the Half 'Joan Bay Fire
 Protection District for the northern portions of the City and the
 unincorporated area would be the Point Montara Fire Department
  (half paid/half volunteer staff) with the second backup being the
 City of Pacifica Fire Department                  To the south and east           the
  first backup call would be the CDF which has stations in Belmont
  and Pescadero.        For major calls San Mateo CountY has a "Central
  Strike" force which would include the cities of San Mateo. Foster
 City, Burlingame, Hillsborough, and Millbrae Departments.
  The Half Moon Bay Fire Protection District can provide a minimum
  response time of two minutes and a maximum response time of eight
  minutes to all portions of the City.              There is a maximum response
  time of approximately 18 minutes to outer service areas in the
  unincorporated areas of the County.               The Fire District currently
  has    21   suppression       employees,     one   Fire    Marshall,     one    Fire
  Prevention Officer,          one Administrative Officer.           one Assistant
  Fire Chief, one Fire Chief. and 22 Volunteer Firefighters. The
  Fire District maintains           two fire stations         Fire Station 40 is
   located at 635 Main Street. Half Moon Bay, and Fire Station 41
   located at 531 Obisbo Road. El Granada. Each has a manned engine
  comp[any     24    hours    per   day.    The   District     currently     has    one
   rescue/squad vehicle, one cliff rescue vehicle, four engines. and
   a combination engine/ladder.
   The District currently requires sprinklers in all commercial and
   industrial buildings 2,500 square feet or greater.                      There are
   currently no sprinkler requirements for residential development

cause a multitude of problems that can be discussed in a general
manner.       The significance of        the problem to the environment.
property, or human health is dependent on the type, location. and
quantity of the material released.              Although hazardous material
incidents can happen almost anywhere, certain areas of the state
are at higher risk.         Jurisdictions near roadways such as Routes 1
and    92   that    are   frequently     used   for    transporting      hazardous
materials and jurisdictions with industrial facilities that use,
store, or dispose of such materials all have increased potential
 for    major    mishaps,    as   do   jurisdictions       crossed    by    certain
railways, waterways, airways, and pipelines.
Releases of explosive and htghly flammable materials have caused
 fatalities     and injuries.      necessitated large scale evacuations
 and destroyed millions of dollars worth of                   property.       Toxic
 chemicals     in gaseous     form has caused         injuries    and   fatalities
 among    emergency     response     teams    and    passersby.       When     toxic
 materials have entered either surface or ground water supplies.
 serious health effects have resulted.                  Releases of hazardous
 chemicals have been especially damaging when they have occurred
 in     highly      population     areas     or     along     heavily      traveled
 transportation routes.
 San Mateo County has a popular ion of over 603,000 in an area of
 448    square miles.        The bayside port ions of           the county       from
 Brisbane to Menlo Park. contain a number of facilities closely
 associated with hazardous materials.                These industries include
  semi-conductor and related devices: paints, varnishes. lacquers
 enamels, and allied products; chemicals; and biological research
 activities.       The coastside sections of the county are primarily
  rura 1 and mast of this area is fares ted or agr icul tura 1                 There
  are concentrations of pesticides and related substances in these
  areas.
 Hazardous materials are also commonly found in residential and
  rural    areas    of  the   County.       Typical     residential      substances
  include pesticides       cleaning fluids and household solvents. which
  require     special    storage     and   disposal      practices         Table     E
  identifies common household substances classified as hazardous
  materials.      In rural areas of the County, pesticide and herbicide
  application is used in conjunction with agriculture and forestry
  operations.       San Mateo County ranks 36th out of the 58 counties
  in Statewide use of restricted pesticides, including both urban
  and rural application.

 There are four major highways in the county:                 State Route l which
 runs north to south along the western edge: Interstate ZBO which
 runs north to south through the center of the county along the
 San Andreas Fault          U.S. 101 which runs north to south along the
 eastern edge of the county: and State Route 92 which bisects the
 other three roads as it runs east to west at mid-county.                    Half

Incidents of toxic material spill and accidental discharge within
 the County are occurrtng ·~ith increasing regularity.                              Although
statistics are lower              rhan    the majority of Bay Area counties
there        are   ~n    estimated       250    major   hazardous        material        spill
 incidents annually Countvwide.                  The majority of recorded spills
occur •JTithin the urban developed area. particularly along the
Bayfront. with a group of spill sites clustered near Highwav 101.
The Highway 92 crossing at Crystal Springs Reservoir is used for
 transport of gasoline and agricultural chemicals to the coastline
and has been identified as a potential hazardous material spill
 location which could seriously affect a major water supply.
Approximately 90 percent of the hazardous material spills in San
Mateo County occur on-:-site. while the balance occur during truck.

 are considered significant and reported to fire departments, of
 which approximately half require response by outside agencies and
 one-tenth result in injury requiring immediate medical attention.
 Fatalities         associated       with     hazardous     material        relea~es      have

  spill substances <57 percent regionally), with corrosives. acids.
 pesticides, PCB and other chemicals making up the balance.
 Transportation of hazardous waste is limited under the State law
  to   registered haulers.                A monitoring        system,        known     as   the
  "manifest        system."      is    used     to   track     all     hazardous        •vastes
  transported         offsite        to     storage,      treatment.          or     disposal
  facilities.         The manifest accompanies the ~hipment, '>llith coptes
  sent to the State from both generator and receiving facility to
  ensure that the designated waste is received by an appropriate
  facility.        There are ten State licensed hazardous waste haulers

  landfill       sites.     and directly         into streams.         or dumping         along
  roadways is a growing problem and accounts                          for a substantial
  fraction of emergency responses by the County Hazardous Materials
  Response Team.          This type of incident is expected to increase as
  operating costs (and therefore use fees) for authorized disposal
  sites rise.         Industry generally is aware of hazardous materials
  regulations         and     appropriate         disposal      procedures         and     acts
  responsibly.          Small generators <small business and households)
  are largely unaware of the hazardous waste problem and tend to
  view current          regulations        as   not   pertaining        to    them.       Small
  generators        are also       less     able   to incur       the    costs of proper
  disposal       and    may    attempt       to cut    operating       costs      by    illegal

BACKGROUND
General     airport      safety,      especially     near      J.irport    fUTI\l/:1 . S   t s
recognized as a hazard concern.
Located approximately four miles north of the City of Haif '.loon
Bay     on   Route    1,     the     Half   \loon    Bay    ·"irport     accommodates
approximately 70,000 aircraft operations each year.                        This figure
is project to exceed 100.000 by 1995.                 The 60 CNEL contour I 1978)
 is    mostly within        the    present     airport    boundaries,        while        the
 projected     1995    contour        includes    approximately         16    acres         of
 residentially      zoned       property     north     of    the    Airport         in    the
 unincorporated area of the County outside of the City of Half
 Moon Bay.       Aircraft noise :s evident due                to low ambient noise
 levels and the high percentage of 1ow altitude training flights
 Areas of high accident potential usually occur at                         the ends of
 runways, in aircraft approach and departure zones, where forced
  landings    are   most      likely     to   occur.       The     Airport      Land      Use
 Commission      IALUC)      has    designated     these      high    risk      areas        as
  "approach zones"        at    the Half Moon Bay Airport                  The Federal
 Aviation Administration IFAAl               has   similarly designated                "clear
  zones" at each of the County's three airports.                    The approach zone
  is rectangular in shape, covering 2,000.000 square feet (1,000' x
  2,000'), located 200 feet off each end of the runway.                         The clear
  zone is trapezoidal in shape, 1,000 feet long, with area varying
  according to runway and aircraft size, also located 200 feet off
  each end of the runway.
  ALUC and FAA policy is to keep approach and clear zones free of
  structures       Nonstructural uses. motor vehicle parking, and open
   storage may be permitted              in approach       zones     provided        certain
  maximum density requirements are not exceeded.                     The FAA defines
   structural development in a clear zone as an ~obstruction to air
  navigation"      and,      pending      required      studv,      could      result          in
   modification of airport operation to ensure safety.
   All of the clear zone and a majority of the approach zone land of
   the Half Moon Bay Airport is publicly owned. outside of the City
   limits,    and   absent      of    structural    development           On      remaining
   privately owned        land     in   the approach zone.          several        buildings
   exist along the periphery, where they are least apt to pose a
   hazard risk.
   Sui !ding height beyond the approach and clear zone is a 1 so a
    safety concern,       as   tall structures can be hazardous to flight
    operations.     Accordingly, the FA.A and ALUC have defined height
    limits for buildings near airports.              The specific height limit is
    based upon an imaginary flat plane, sloping upward and outward
    from the runway <representative of flight                    paths).     known as an

                                                                                43

 surface mainra1ns a 34:1 slope. ;:hile large commercial approach
 surfaces involve slopes between -\0:1 and 50·                         Approach surfaces
 and    resultant     height    restrictions         are    based     primarily    on  F.\A
 standards.       Currently, there are no structures encroaching 1nto
designated       approach     surfaces      at     the    Half      \loon  Bay  .'.irport
 \!though the FAA sets obstruction criteria tn terms of maximum
 height, actual legal authority to control height rests ·~tth the
 ALUC and the local government where the structure is sttuated.
  If a structure or object exceeds                  the defined height,           the FAA
 would require preparation of an aeronautical study to determine
  the effect on navigable airspace and whether a hazard to air
  navigation ls present           As with clear zones, the FAA can modify
  airport operations       to ensure safety.
  POLICIES
