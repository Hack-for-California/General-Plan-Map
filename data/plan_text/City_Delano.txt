                                                                      10.0
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ELEMENT
10.1    INTRODUCTION
The Economic Development Element discusses how business activity and employment in
Delano may be enhanced. It also identifies key areas where efforts to promote new business
should be focused to best serve the city’s interests. The California Government Code does not
require cities to include economic development chapters in their general plans; however,
economic development is a key community objective, and is closely related to land use,
transportation, and other planning issues, and successful economic growth increases City
revenue and Delano’s ability to implement programs identified in other General Plan chapters.
Therefore, the City of Delano has chosen to devote a full General Plan chapter to economic
development in order to set forth a strategic policy for guiding the economic growth of the
community.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
10.2    POPULATION
As of January 1, 20045 the City’s population was estimated to be 45,056, approximately 6,006 of
which were in group quarters at the State prison. Population projections presently acknowledged
by the City indicate the average annual growth rate is expected to be five percent through the
year 2020 when the City’s population is anticipated to be over 62,000 residents. However, based
on trends since the completion of the 2000 U.S. Census, the City is currently experiencing an
average annual growth rate of 2.1 percent. Additional prison development will potentially
increase the City population by 5,000 more persons. Table 2-1 shows these projections.

10.3    SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS
Delano is the second largest city in Kern County. The Delano region ships hundreds of millions
of dollars worth of commodities throughout the United States and to over 80 foreign countries.
Delano’s rapidly growing population, temperate climate, low utility rates, centralized location,
affordable land costs, and large labor pool make it an outstanding location for business retention
and expansion. In late 2003 – early 2004 it was estimated that the total retail demand in the retail
trade area (a fifteen mile radius around the City) was $518 million and would grow to nearly
$697 million in 2005. Goods and services of the automotive group, general merchandise, food
stores and restaurants are, and are expected to continue to have a high demand.
The 2000 census identified that the civilian workforce was divided among the five following
occupational categories: 15.7 percent employed in management, professional and related
occupations; 15.2 percent in service occupations; 19.9 percent in sales and office occupations;
25.8 percent in farming, fishing and forestry occupations; and 18.6 percent in production,
transportation, and material moving occupations.              These five categories represented
approximately 95 percent of the employed citizens of the City. However, only 42.9 percent of
Delano residents 16 years and over (who are classified as “worker”) worked within the City of
Delano. Almost sixteen percent of those identified as employed outside the City reported that
they worked outside of Kern County.
Due to the continuing growth in retail sales within the City’s retail trade area it is important that
the City adopt a set of goals, policies and standards that recognize and support the City’s
economic development.
In addition to the inclusion of an optional economic element within the General Plan, a Strategic
Economic Development Plan has been prepared as an implementation tool to provide more
specific guidance in expanding current and/or generating new economic activity within the
community. The strategies in the Strategic Economic Development Plan are intended to be
implemented in the short term (five to seven years) and are to be prioritized on an annual basis.
Eight strategies were identified for inclusion in the Strategic Economic Development Plan by the
City after the review of various data and information including: a market analysis prepared by a
professional services firm; data from the City’s Community Development Department; input
from community leaders and members during an extensive visioning process in 2000-2002;
review of online demographic data; and a review of the City’s 1990 Strategic Economic
Development Plan. The strategies identified in the plan include:
    •   provide leadership;
    •   instill high community standards;
    •   building infrastructure through sound fiscal policy;
    •   invest redevelopment district tax increments; target geographic sites for business
        development;
    •   encourage interagency collaboration;
    •   attract, retain and expand business; and

    •    develop the workforce.
For the year 2002 the City had total taxable sales of $194,983,000, including $166,773,000 in
retail sales. Of the retail figure, auto dealers and auto supplies had commanding taxable sales of
$46,361,000. General merchandise stores and food stores had taxable sales of $28,210,000 and
$23,410,000 respectively.

PARKS AND RECREATION ELEMENT
11.1    INTRODUCTION
The Parks and Recreation Element establishes the goals, policies, and programs which guide the
development of parks, trails, bikeways, and other recreational facilities throughout the City.
Providing passive and active recreational opportunities is an important municipal service that
reflects and enhances the community’s quality of life.
The Parks and Recreation Element has a direct relationship with the Open Space and
Conservation Element of the General Plan, in that each of these elements seeks to conserve and
maintain the City’s open space and natural resources. The Parks and Recreation Element also
has connections ot the Land Use Element. The land use map identifies existing and proposed
park sites and recreational facilities, and helps determine the compatibility of adjacent land uses.
11.2    AUTHORIZATION
A number of California statutes address the provision of community parks and recreational
amenities. Government Code Section 65560 requires that the General Plan include a discussion
of areas particularly suited for parks and recreational purposes, including areas with links
between major recreation and open space reservations and trails. Section 65561 states that the
preservation of park land is necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy, but also for
the continued assurance of land for recreation and the enjoyment of scenic beauty. The statutory
references for park land delineations are found in the Subdivision Map Act. Specifically,
Government Code Sections 66477 and 66479 enable local governments to require park site
dedications, or fees in lieu of dedication, as conditions of subdivision and parcel map approval.
Recreational land uses are included in the description of land use elements in Section 65302(a).
Trail designations are also required as part of Section 5076 of the Public Resources Code.

        areas), neighborhood parks, pocket parks, community parks and community recreational
        facilities. Consideration should be given to development of active recreation and sports
        areas in conjunction with existing and new school facilities. Recreational facilities
        should be provided in accordance with the standards in Table 4-4. It is the City’s intent
        to utilize the maximum allowable park acreage standard (up to 5.0 acres per 1,000
        people) should the availability of school facilities for use by the public during non-school
        hours increase the amount of usable park land within the City above 3.0 acres per 1,000
        population.
7.      Parks shall be located along collector roads wherever possible.

8.      Where advantageous, parks should be developed in conjunction with school property to
        create a larger combined open space and recreation facility for the community and to
        reduce the costs for parks and recreation facilities.
9.      Where possible, parks should be developed in conjunction with existing and future
        drainage basins to create a larger combined open space along with additional space for
        active and passive recreation. Existing park ponds should be adapted for park use where
        possible. Safety concerns must be addressed and adequate space at or above street level

        implement such parks with financial aid management obligations in proportion to each
        other’s responsibilities.
21.     If a subdivision, site plan, general plan amendment or rezoning is proposed on land which
        is designated for potential park use, prior to entitlements, permits or other approvals, the
        City Council shall determine the feasibility of accelerating public acquisition of the
        property, or redesignate alternative areas.

LAND USE ELEMENT
2.1     INTRODUCTION
The Land Use Element for the City of Delano establishes the framework for the principal
development within the Study Area. The city is experiencing significant growth opportunities in
terms of new development and redevelopment. It is the city’s intent to guide new development
and redevelopment by a set of coherent development policies in order to achieve the
implementation of projects that contribute positively to all sectors of the community.
The Land Use Element describes existing land use characteristics and development patterns in
the Study Area. The Land Use Element contains general development standards and guidelines
for future development. The Land Use Element also contains a description of the Land Use Plan
which defines the general location and development intensity for a variety of land uses in the
Study Area. The Land Use Plan is intended to be consistent with the overall community goals as
well as reflective of the physical and environmental constraints affecting land use.
2.2     PURPOSE
The Land Use Element is intended to reflect the values of the community with respect to
development, redevelopment, and preservation of public and private properties within the Study
Area through the year 2020. The element encourages future urbanization while preserving the
environmental characteristics which contribute to a quality of life that attracts residents to the
community. The element sets forth policies and defines land uses to achieve a balanced
community, which offers a wide range of housing types, full-service business and commercial
centers, and a sufficient employment base to reduce the commute for residents. While it can be
expected that some existing development may not be consistent with the development policies
promoted by the Land Use Element and other general plan elements, new and future
development is required by law to be consistent with the general plan.
The Land Use Element encompasses the goals, objectives, policies and programs of the other
elements of the general plan. The Land Use Element provides city officials with a
comprehensive basis for decision-making and provides citizens with an understanding of the
long-range intentions of the city concerning future growth and development.

2.3     AUTHORIZATION
California planning law requires every city to adopt a Land Use Element that provides for the
long-term physical development of the community. Government Code Section 65302(a) requires
the General Plan to include:
        “A Land Use Element which designates the proposed general distribution and
        general location and extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry,
        open space, including agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment
        of scenic beauty, education, public buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste
        disposal facilities, and other categories of public and private uses of land. The
        Land Use Element shall include a statement of the standards of population density
        and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other territory
        covered by the plan. The Land Use Element shall also identify areas covered by
        the plan which are subject to flooding and shall be reviewed annually with
        respect to those areas.”
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
2.4     EXISTING LAND USE
As with most cities in California, the detached single-family home is the predominant residential
unit in Delano. Figure 2-1 is a zoning map of Delano showing concentrations of residential,
commercial, industrial, and agricultural land as prescribed by the current City Zoning ordinance.
Figure 2-2 shows the location of vacant land in the community.
2.4.1 Resources: Natural Features and Environmental Resources to Conserve
Water - Although Delano historically had drainage sloughs in the community, there are no
current surface water features in Delano, except for open irrigation channels. Groundwater
resources provide the City’s water supply, with distribution via eight municipal water wells. The
wells provide water for all uses including residential, commercial, and emergency service needs
Agricultural Land Use Soils - Delano is surrounded by farmland. Farms near Delano primarily
grow orchard fruits, grapes, almonds, cotton and corn. There are several locations within the
City where agricultural uses are being conducted on land that has been designated for residential,
commercial, or industrial uses. Most farmland is irrigated.
The soils in and near Delano are part of an extensive area of the San Joaquin Valley with
“prime” agricultural (Class I and II) soils. Delano has approximately 5,000 acres of prime
agricultural soil within the existing Urban Area Boundary. Approximately 1,500 acres of these
prime soils within the Urban Area Boundary are under Williamson Act preserve contracts.
City of Delano                                                                     December 2005
General Plan                                                                                  2-2

2.4.2 Visual Resources
Natural Visual Resources - The topography of the City and surrounding area is generally level
to gently rolling. However, on clear days Delano has beautiful views of the mountains and hills
to the east.
Developed Visual Resources - Delano has few older neighborhoods with streets lined with lush,
mature trees. The trees provide shade and help reduce summer temperatures. The older homes
are generally well maintained and add charm and elegance to the visual character of the
community. Poor visual quality, lack of landscaping and a deficiency of trees have been
identified as significant deficiencies existing in the community, based on citizen input.
The surrounding orchards and crop lands also provide visual relief from the built environment by
providing a backdrop of mature fruit trees and crops. During spring, the orchards provide
additional visual benefits when the trees are in full bloom. The orchards also give a sense of
rural character to the community.
The downtown central business district area includes the main street commercial core which
currently has landscape planters and street trees installed. The visual appearance of the
downtown will be improved in the near future when the recently prepared downtown master plan
improvements are implemented. The Redevelopment Agency is implementing a façade
improvement program which is enhancing the visual appearance of many downtown buildings.
2.5     POPULATION
Annual population estimates prepared by the State Department of Finance show that Delano is
currently growing at an average annual rate of approximately 5.2 percent since the 1990 U.S.
Census. As of January 1, 1998, the population was estimated to be 34,143, approximately 5,455
of which were in group quarters at the State prison. Population projections presently
acknowledged by the City indicate the average annual growth rate is expected to be five percent
through the year 2020 when the City’s population is anticipated to be over 62,000 residents.
Additional prison development will potentially increase the City population by 5,000 more
persons. Table 2-1 shows these projections.

2.6     SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS
A recent analysis of the industrial and economic trends in California and the Delano area
described the components of the regional agriculture business cluster and identified which
business sectors have grown well in recent years and which have not. The material below
evaluates growth opportunities in the region and outlines the types of development schemes that
could form the basis for the City’s industrial development strategy.
2.6.1 Growth Potential in Regional Economic Base Industries
As a part of the General Plan update process, Applied Development Economics (ADE) prepared
an analysis of the economic base for the region to be used as a guide for assessing the impact of
changes in the economic base expected to occur over the coming decade.
In conducting its analysis, ADE assumed that the agricultural cluster would continue to dominate
the local economy. However, it was also assumed that there would be a continuing shift in the
mix of businesses in the agricultural cluster toward the production of more high value added
goods and services, and that employment in farming and ranching would continue to decline
with the addition of labor saving technologies and processes.
The primary objective of this study was to identify those business sectors that are the most likely
to produce net new jobs and increasing levels of income for Delano residents. In conducting this
analysis, ADE used a methodology, which is based on detailed, industry specific data available
from the Labor Market Information Division of the California Economic Development
Department. This data permits employment and income trends to be analyzed over the past few
years and project future trends by location, type of business, number of employees and total
payroll. For this analysis, Kern, Tulare and Kings Counties were selected as the area in which
most buyer/supplier relationships take place, or could take place. Statistical techniques were
used to estimate the gaps in supply in the area that could be targets of opportunity for business
attraction. Similarly, the analysis identifies industries represented in the economic base that
offer prospects for business expansion. The following sections present the key findings and
recommendations resulting from this analysis.
The Regional Context
Growth in basic jobs in California is best seen as a regional phenomenon. While individual
jurisdictions are naturally primarily interested in those businesses located in their city or county,
they are increasingly aware of the importance of regional economic growth for achieving their
own economic growth objectives. For example, the expansion of an existing business in Delano
will draw employees from the three county region. Likewise, the attraction of a new business to
Delano will create the demand for goods and services from throughout the area.
Agriculture was the primary employer in all three counties, with Kern County accounting for
more than ten percent fewer workers in agriculture than the other two counties. Conversely,
Kern County exceeds the average for all counties and has the largest component of Services
City of Delano                                                                      December 2005
General Plan                                                                                     2-6

employment of the three, reflecting the significance of Bakersfield in the region’s economic
base.
Kern County has a significant mining industry, which employs 6.9 percent of the labor force
compared to less than one percent for the State and the other counties in the economic region.
The three county economic region is lower than the State in manufacturing employment with
only 8.6 percent of the labor force employed in this sector compared to almost 17 percent for the
State. Kern County has the least number of workers employed in manufacturing of the three
counties with six percent employed in this category compared to 12.3 percent for Tulare and 10.7
percent for Kings.
High growth rates for industrial sectors with high concentration factors signals good prospects
for expansion, while those with high growth and low concentration offers potential for business
attraction. Conversely, industrial sectors with high concentration and low growth may indicate
the need for business retention efforts. The industries in Figure 8 of Appendix C represent the
fifteen largest non-agricultural industries in each growth category.
The Agricultural Cluster
Professionals in the field of local economic development have recently come to understand that
cluster analysis provides a better picture of how an economy functions than simply looking at
individual business categories. Business clusters are the mix of businesses necessary to produce
a final product to be purchased by a consumer. Analysis of specific clusters, such as agriculture,
provides consumers with a variety of food and fiber products.
This level of detail provides an improved picture of the dynamic growth and decline in
employment that is not evident at a higher level of aggregation. For example, goods and services
necessary for the production of food and fiber products are hardly ever in perfect balance. There
are always shortages or overages in some of the elements of the cluster. Knowing this allows
public and private sector decision makers to fine tune their activities to maximize the return on
their investment.
This is particularly true with respect to the availability of a labor force equal to the requirements
of growing elements of business clusters, such as the agricultural business cluster, that is
providing, and will continue to provide, most of the net new basic jobs in the Delano economic
region. There are a number of manufacturing sectors that would be interested in expanding or
locating in Delano. For example, the general industry machinery and miscellaneous food and
kindred products industries are increasing net employment and could be candidates for expansion
of established firms, while paperboard containers and boxes and metal cans and shipping
containers, which are not well established in the area could be candidates for attraction of firms
from other areas.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The City of Delano could benefit from the adoption of specific targets for business attraction and
expansion. Selecting these targets would permit the assessment of the assets and liabilities of the
City of Delano                                                                        December 2005
General Plan                                                                                      2-7

City based on the specific requirements of the selected targets. For example, the availability of
land and facilities for business expansion and attraction can be matched against the specific
requirements of the businesses targeted. Similarly, the labor force requirements of the targeted
businesses can be ascertained and incorporated into the educational and training programs
provided by community institutions.
The recommended targets for Delano based on the agricultural cluster analysis and existing
industries in the Community include:
1.      Motion Freight Transport, Warehousing and Logistics
2.      Agricultural chemicals
3.      Farm labor, management and services
4.      Health care practitioners and services
2.7     OTHER PLANS AND POLICIES
2.7.1 Present City Land Use Controls
Development within the incorporated City limits is governed by the City zoning ordinance and
building codes. The Planning Commission and City Council cannot approve development
projects that are not in conformance with the General Plan and zoning regulations.
2.7.2 San Joaquin Valley Air Quality Attainment Plan
Delano is located within the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin (SJVAB) which consists of a basin
shaped like an elongated bowl approximately 250 miles in length and 120 miles in width. It
extends from the crest of the Sierra Nevada west to the crest of the Coast Range and includes the
San Joaquin Valley floor.
2.7.3 Kern County Policy Plan
Kern County’s Urban Boundaries Policies define the ultimate Urban Area Boundary (UAB)
around incorporated cities. The Delano UAB defines the area under county jurisdiction within
which Delano’s concerns are to be given serious consideration as part of the County’s land use
review process.
Development policy north of County Line Road is controlled by Tulare County. The
Comprehensive Policy Plan of the County of Tulare contains policies which guide growth in
unincorporated areas, includes the adopted land use plans for each incorporated city in the
County, and sets forth the framework for city/county cooperation in land use matters.
Tulare County and the City of Delano have entered into an agreement that a portion of the
urbanized area in Tulare County along the north side of County Line Road is to be planned
jointly by the City of Delano and Tulare County. In addition to a “County Line Service Area,”
the agreement also establishes a “Madonna Water Service Area.” Pursuant to the agreement
between Delano and Tulare County, Tulare County has authorized the City of Delano to provide

General Plan                                                                                  2-8

water, sewer, and local drainage services within the County Line Service Area, and to provide
water services within the Madonna Water Service Area. The City and County have also agreed
to maintain mutually agreeable General Plan policies within the joint planning area.
The joint planning of lands along the north side of County Line Road includes the principle of an
equitable allocation of development benefits and impacts resulting from development on both
sides of County Line Road. A guiding tenet of the joint planning effort between the Delano and
Tulare County is that both the benefits and impacts of land development must balance such that
neither jurisdiction is asked to bear the brunt of a development proposed by the other without
appropriate mitigation and commensurate benefit. The following text sets forth the City of
Delano’s policy direction toward development along both sides of County Line Road. The
provisions outlined below addressing requirements for development within the City of Delano
along the south side of County Line shall be effective upon their adoption by the Delano City
County and the adoption of equivalent provisions by the Tulare County Board of Supervisors
affecting development north of County Line Road.
2.7.5 Redevelopment Planning
The City has established a Redevelopment Agency and has adopted a Redevelopment Plan and a
Project Area. Within the project area, the Agency, in conjunction with the City, is removing
blighted buildings and is encouraging new development in the project area, both retail and
service oriented. The Agency has cleared a two block blighted area formerly know as the
“Chinatown” area, and is actively marketing this approximately 12 acre area for new commercial
development. The Redevelopment Agency has implemented a façade improvement program to
assist downtown businesses with improving the visual appearance of downtown buildings. The
Redevelopment Agency will continue to work closely with the City and Chamber of Commerce
to encourage and promote economic development and the creation of new jobs. The Agency and
City will implement a downtown improvement program which will include new street
landscaping, street lighting, and the installation of new street furniture to enhance the visual
appearance of the downtown.

2.      All development shall conform to the land use density and intensity standards depicted in
        the General Plan
3.      Changes to zoning shall be consistent with the General Plan. A zone district shall be
        deemed consistent with a land use designation when such zone district is specified as
        consistent in the Plan Consistency Table. In no case, however, shall the overall maximum
        density of the plan designation be exceeded.
        a.       Residential densities on a portion of a development site may exceed the maximum
                 densities, if the density for the entire site conforms to the Plan Consistency Table.
                 Variable residential uses and density incentives may be provided if adequate open
                 space can be provided on the project site. Site area shall be a minimum of two
                 acres and a Conditional Use Permit will be required.
4.      The City will maintain an updated Zoning Ordinance as appropriate to implement the
        General Plan.
5.      Development standards shall be adopted for the State Route 99 frontage and gateway
        streets to improve the practical function and aesthetic quality of those areas.
6.      Lands outside of the existing urban area that are designated for urban use may be
        developed if adequate infrastructure (water, sewer, etc.) is available, and the proposed
        uses will not be incompatible or detrimental to surrounding land uses.
7.      The City should undertake a review of the General Plan’s demographic, financial, land
        use demand and supply, and infrastructure assumptions no less frequently than once
        every five years to provide an opportunity for necessary modifications to the General
        Plan.
8.      Exterior area lighting for non-residential land uses shall be shielded to prevent line of
        sight visibility of the light source from abutting property planned for residential uses, or
        other sensitive uses.
Objectives
        B. Manage land uses along County Line Road to the mutual benefit of the City of
            Delano and Tulare County.
Policies, Standards
1.    Within the Delano-Tulare County joint planning area, establish a clearly defined Urban
      Improvement Area north of County Line Road within which urban development and the
      provision of urban services is to be confined. The Urban Improvement Area shall, at a
      minimum, include the County Line Service area established in the original joint planning
      area agreement between the City and Tulare County.
City of Delano                                                                        December 2005

2.     Development of the properties north of County Line Road within the Joint Planning Area
       shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Delano General Plan.
       a. Areas identified for Industrial use shall be compatible with the City’s Industrial land
           use classification.
       b. Areas identified as Commercial shall be compatible with the City’s Commercial land
           use classification. Commercial land uses north of County Line Road should be oriented
           to the freeway traveler, be served primarily by “pass-by” trips, and should not detract
           from the sales tax generation within the City of Delano.
       c. Areas identified for Agricultural use shall be compatible with the City’s Agricultural
           land use classification.
3. Provision of services by the City of Delano to development within the Urban Improvement
    Area and the Madonna Service Area as shown in Figure 2-3 shall be contingent upon such
    development being consistent with the provisions of the Delano General Plan and the Joint
    Powers Agreement between the City of Delano and Tulare County. .
    a.     Impacts of development within the joint planning area shall mitigate impacts that will
           result within the City of Delano pursuant to the City’s standards.
    b.     In cases where a development within the joint planning area would have significant
           unavoidable impacts within the City of Delano, ensure that there are overriding
           considerations that provide benefits to the City of Delano in excess of the impacts it
           will experience.
    c.     Development shall pay its own way in terms of its capital and ongoing service needs
           from the City of Delano. Development within the joint planning area shall be at least
           revenue neutral to Delano.
4. Work with Tulare County to expand the existing joint planning agreement to provide for
    development on either side of County Line Road to mitigate impacts occurring in the other
    jurisdiction and to pay its own way in terms of capital costs and ongoing services that would
    be provided by the other jurisdiction. This would mean that new development subject to this
    policy would:
    a. construct and/or pay their fair share for the new capital improvements that are required to
         meet applicable standards, regardless of the jurisdiction that such improvements are
         needed in;
    b. be phased so as to ensure that the capital facilities used by the new development meet
         applicable standards;
    c. be at least revenue neutral across jurisdictional boundaries; and

        services provided to existing development within the other jurisdiction.
5. In addition to coordination of land use planning and development review processes, Delano
    remains committed to working cooperatively with Tulare County for the upgrade and
    improvement of infrastructure, including and not limited to freeway offramps, to serve the
    area along County Line Road, including the establishment of funding mechanisms that
    ensure development on both sides of County Line Road pays its fair share for improvements
    needed in both the City of Delano and Tulare County. .
2.9     RESIDENTIAL LAND USE
Objectives
A.      Designate and allow for the development of a wide range of residential housing types in
        the City including housing for lower, middle, and upper income families to meet the
        needs of all Delano residents.

1.      The following residential density designations shall be used:
        a.     Agricultural/Urban Reserve and Agriculture Preservation Area. In order to
               maintain the integrity of farm activities, an Agriculture Preservation Area is
               designated along the interior of the Delano Sphere of Influence as depicted on the
               General Plan map. Activities within this area are limited to those uses permitted
               by the exclusive agricultural zone districts of Kern County.
        b.     Estate Residential (.4 – 2.75 dwelling units/gross acre). The Estate Residential
               land use category provides for a land use pattern characterized by single-family
               residential development with lot sizes larger than those in the low or medium
               density categories. The usual development pattern found in such areas is standard
               subdivision development. All residential development herein shall be served by
               City sewer and water services and shall have full urban improvements. This
               designation also includes former Rural Residential, which is intended for estate
               residential characterized by larger single-family residential lots one-half acre in
               size or larger.
               This land use is also appropriately used when “Estate Residential” developments
               are desired to promote larger lot homes and where the overall density of an area
               should be limited because of public facility, safety or aesthetic concerns. The
               estate residential area in Southeast Delano shall be developed in conformity with
               the community design element.
City of Delano                                                                    December 2005
General Plan                                                                                 2-14

        c.      Low Density Residential (up to 5.0 dwelling units/gross acre). The low density
                residential category provides for a land use pattern of predominantly single-family
                development as permitted in the R-1 district. This designation also provides for
                innovative designs, which utilize clustering, duplexes or half-plexes on corner
                lots, zero lot line, or planned development features. Developments in excess of
                7.0 units per acre are encouraged for infill parcels, in specific plan, master plan
                areas or with a PUD.
        d.      Medium Density Residential (up to14.0 dwelling units/gross acre). This land use
                category provides for a land use pattern characterized predominantly by small
                scale multiple family residential developments. The typical residential pattern
                includes duplexes and larger scale, high-amenity apartments. Areas designated
                medium-high density residential are to be integrated throughout the community
                adjacent to transportation, community services and commercial developments. To
                avoid inappropriate concentration of these facilities, such developments shall be
                limited to 25 contiguous units when integrated into a single family neighborhood
                and to 50 contiguous units when developed as a free standing development. New
                development shall conform to the Community Design Element of the General
                Plan.
        e.      High Density Residential (up to 24.0 dwelling units/gross acre). The high density
                residential land use category provides for the highest residential densities
                permitted in the City. It is intended that this category utilize innovative site
                planning, provide on-site recreational amenities, and be located near major
                community facilities, business centers, and streets of at least collector capacity.
                Such developments shall use high quality architectural design features, intensified
                landscaping, adequate open space, adequate parking, and adequate on-site
                recreational facilities.
2.      The City may use the planned unit development and          Planned Community District to
        provide density increases of up to 30%. Granting of all    or part of the bonus will depend
        upon the developer’s demonstration of the quality of       design in such areas as access,
        circulation, building placement, parking, provision         of adjacent open space, and
        architectural compatibility with the surrounding area.
3.      Manufactured and modular housing developments shall be permitted in accordance with
        state law subject to design regulations and existing ordinances.
4.      Housing may be permitted by Conditional Use Permit in the Central Commercial
        designation as part of a mixed-use concept. However, housing uses shall be discouraged
        on the ground floor of commercially designated properties.
Objectives
B.      Promote stable, high quality residential neighborhoods.
City of Delano                                                                      December 2005
General Plan                                                                                   2-15

Policies, Standards
1.      Multi-family residential developments with more than 25 units shall have direct access to
        a collector or arterial street.
2.      Where new residential development is proposed that adjoins existing commercial or
        industrial development, development along both sides of the land use boundary shall be
        required to provide appropriate buffers of architectural transitions through the use of
        building setbacks, landscaping and masonry walls.
3.      Site development techniques should be encouraged which ensure a mix of housing types
        throughout the community.
4.      In order to encourage infill development, flexible design standards should be developed
        which are tailored to the needs of the individual site, while meeting the intent of the
        General Plan.
5.      Where feasible, multi-family developments should be located near commercial and
        community services.
6.      Multi-family developments shall provide extensive landscaping. Block walls adjacent to
        the public right of way shall be discouraged unless they are found to be necessary for
        public health and safety.
2.10    COMMERCIAL LAND USE
Objectives
A.      Ensure the provision of adequate commercial shopping opportunities and office space
        locations to meet anticipated needs.
Policies, Standards
1.      Establish the following commercial land use designations:
        a.      Commercial. The Commercial land use designation provides for the development
                of neighborhood commercial uses within 5-10 acre clusters to serve the everyday
                convenience goods and personal service needs of a defined neighborhood. The
                service radius of a neighborhood commercial use is generally 1/2 mile. The
                Commercial land use designation also provide for the development of 10-acre or
                larger cluster of commercial establishments serving needs similar to the
                neighborhood commercial centers, but serving larger areas. These community
                commercial areas are intended to be clustered along State Route 99 and along
                arterial roadways within the community. The community commercial center
                generally serves a market area as large as ten miles, depending upon the its
City of Delano                                                                  December 2005
General Plan                                                                                2-16
                specific uses. Such facilities should be located along State Route 99, with center
                providing supermarkets within in each residential quadrant of the community to
                minimize cross-town traffic. The Commercial land use designation also provides
                for mixed use activity in the downtown area and within Block H between the
                downtown and State Route 99. It is intended to provide for a wide range of uses
                and to promote feasibility in the reuse of downtown buildings. Mixed use
                development, including residential development may be permitted within the
                downtown area and Block H, subject to approval of a specific plan by the City
                Council. The maximum allowable development intensity shall be a floor area
                ratio of 1.0 within the downtown and Block H area, 0.50in other portions of the
                City.
        b.      General Service Commercial. This designation provides for commercial areas
                with a wide range of retail and service activities along major traffic corridors.
                Properties abutting existing General Service Commercial properties may be
                developed to such use where they are combined with properties having frontage
                on Cecil Avenue. The maximum allowable development intensity shall be a floor
                area ratio of 0.50.
2.      Neighborhood Commercial sites, generally 5-10 acres in size, should be located at or near
        the intersection of collector and/or arterial streets with a minimum of overlap with other
        existing or planned neighborhood commercial uses. Only one neighborhood commercial
        development may be permitted at any one intersection. Such developments should also be
        directly accessible from adjacent residential developments.
3.      Community Commercial, in areas of 10 acres and larger, should be located along major
        traffic ways in consolidated centers that utilize common access and parking for
        commercial uses. Strip commercial uses are to be discouraged. Adequate pedestrian links
        to residential areas shall be required. New centers are proposed for Woollomes/State
        Route 99 and at Garces Highway and Browning Road. While adequate land needs to be
        reserved for community commercial use, care needs to be taken not to provide more
        commercial land than can reasonably be developed
4.      The Commercial land use designation has been applied to the downtown area to assist in
        attracting and accommodating a mix of commercial, financial, office, governmental and
        limited residential uses.
        a.      Rehabilitation of existing structures to accommodate residential and office
                facilities in the upper floors in the CBD Commercial district are encouraged.
        b.      Conversion of existing residential units is encouraged adjacent to the downtown
                to provide for smaller scale office space.
5.      Professional office land uses are encouraged within commercially designated areas,
        including new offices within unified centers, redevelopment of existing sites to office
        use, and the conversion of older homes to offices along major streets. Where homes are
City of Delano                                                                      December 2005
General Plan                                                                                  2-17
        converted to offices, such conversion should be a logical extension of existing or planned
        office/commercial uses, and the lot should be of adequate size to accommodate parking in
        the rear of the structure or outside of the front yard landscape setback. Zoning standards
        for conversion of existing residential structures should be developed.
6.      Commercial and office site planning shall be compatible with the surrounding
        neighborhood, signage, and landscaping.
Objectives
B.      Provide for the compatible integration of residential and commercial uses.
Policies, Standards
1.      Development along the interface between commercial or office uses and residential uses
        shall provide for the following:
        a.      A landscaped setback containing deciduous and evergreen trees shall be planted
                and maintained along the property line between commercial and office uses and
                residential properties that have a common property line.
        b.      A masonry wall shall be erected along the property line where commercial and
                office uses have a common property line with residentially designated properties.
        c.      All commercial loading and storage areas shall be screened from view of
                adjoining residential property by a combination of landscape planting and a
                masonry wall. Loading areas shall be enclosed and be located so that there are no
                noise impacts to adjacent residential properties. All storage shall be within an
                enclosed structure.
        d.      Roof-mounted and detached mechanical equipment shall be acoustically baffled
                to prevent noise from the equipment from exceeding 55 dB(A) measured at the
                nearest residential property line.
2.      In order to encourage the integration of neighborhood and community commercial uses
        into neighborhoods, designs should de-emphasize the usage of walls as buffers where
        they create barriers to pedestrian access. Continuous block walls shall be discouraged;
        offsets, landscaping pockets and openings shall be encouraged.
3.      In order to ensure continued viability of the downtown as the central business district for
        the community, residential development shall be directed so that the downtown remains
        the approximate geographic center of the community.

2.11    INDUSTRIAL LAND USE
Objectives
A.      Promote industrial sites which are functional, have adequate public services, and have
        access to major streets and railroads.
Policies, Standards
1.      The Industrial land use designation: is intended for uses such as fabricating, assembly,
        research and development, electronics, warehousing and other such similar industrial
        uses. Light industrial development, where all work, materials, and equipment storage is
        generally conducted indoors, is appropriate as a buffer between heavy industrial and non-
        industrial uses and where the site is visible from residential areas or major streets. Special
        landscaping, enclosures and other site development standards should be used. Industrial
        park development is intended on larger parcels to create distinct districts of industrial,
        office, and support uses. The industrial park area shall have high quality landscaping,
        architectural designs, and general site development requirements. Heavy industrial uses,
        including manufacturing with outdoor storage equipment or work areas and wholesale
        distribution involving intensive truck activity should be separated from residential areas
        and should be located with direct access to major streets or railroads, such that truck
        traffic will not impact residential neighborhoods. The maximum allowable development
        intensity shall be a floor area ratio of 0.75.
2.      Promote a mix of industrial uses that provide the City with a sound, diverse industrial
        base, and which is consistent with the City’s infrastructure constraints.
3.      Locate industry with access to major streets, truck routes, and rail service.
4.      Industrial development should not create significant off-site circulation, noise, dust, odor,
        visual, and hazardous materials impacts that cannot be adequately mitigated.
        a.      Major streets, which pass through industrial areas and serve as entrances to the
                City, shall receive special design treatment to reduce aesthetic impacts and traffic
                concerns.
Objectives
B.      Provide for the compatible integration of industrial uses in the Community.
Policies, Standards
1.      Industrial land shall be accessible by major and secondary arterials residential areas in the
        community. Truck traffic shall be routed to Hwy 99, Browning Road, Garces Highway,
        Woollomes, Schuster Road, or Albany St.
City of Delano                                                                       December 2005

Objectives
C.      Provide for the use and re-use of light industrial properties in the downtown to
        complement adjacent commercial, office and residential land uses.
Policies, Standards
1.      The City should encourage redevelopment of industrial properties which are near the
        downtown to provide for adequate on-site parking, loading and unloading facilities,
        vehicular and truck circulation.
2.      Limited expansion of existing non-conforming uses in this area may be permitted subject
        to an analysis of site area limitations, land use compatibility with surrounding land uses,
        environmental impacts and economic factors. Expansion or increases in intensity may be
        permitted through the Conditional Use Permit process.
2.12    PUBLIC AND INSTITUTIONAL LAND USE
Objectives
A.      Provide sites for adequate public facilities to serve projected growth.
Policies, Standards
1.      Establish the following public facility land uses:
        a.      Public Buildings and Grounds. This designation indicates areas owned and
                maintained by public or institutional agencies such as the city, schools, hospitals,
                and other special districts.
        b.      Parks and Open Space. This designation determines areas of permanent open
                spaces, parks and/or areas precluded from major development.
2.      Sites depicting Public Buildings and Grounds or Parks and Open Space are conceptual
        and may be located anywhere in the same general vicinity.
Objectives
B.      Provide for adequate school sites and school site expansion to meet school facility needs
        in a timely manner as provided by law.
Policies, Standards
1.      Provide information to the Delano Elementary School District and the Delano Union
        High School District regarding new residential development projects proposed to be
        constructed in the City.
City of Delano                                                                     December 2005
General Plan                                                                                  2-20
2.      Coordinate school location and site design with the school districts to ensure that
        adequate facilities are available.
3.      Delano will support school site identification, reservation, and acquisition that is
        consistent with California Government Code Sections 66479-66482. The City will adopt
        a school site reservation ordinance to be applied to proposed development projects.
4.      Elementary schools should be located on interior residential areas at collector/local street
        intersections. Additional street frontage is desirable to provide a transition area to
        adjacent residences. Schools should abut neighborhood parks with adjacent development
        backing or siding onto the school. Pedestrian and bicycle access should be provided.
5.      Intermediate or Junior High Schools should be located in residential areas with a central
        location for surrounding area elementary schools at collector/collector or collector/local
        street intersections. Additional local street frontage is desired for transition to adjacent
        residential areas. Maximize pedestrian and bicycle access and on/off-site circulation.
        These schools should be located so that there are future expansion opportunities.
6.      High Schools should be located at arterial-collector intersections with additional frontage
        on at least one other street. These sites should be located to provide for future expansion.
7.      New commercial development should be discouraged within a minimum of 1/4-mile of
        school sites.
8.      High Density Residential complexes abutting school sites should be discouraged.
9.      The City and school districts shall continue to encourage joint use of school multi-
        purpose facilities and open space.
10.     The school districts shall be encouraged to coordinate their school location, facility
        construction and phasing with the City’s development guidelines contained in the Land
        Use Element and the City’s Capital Improvement Plan to ensure that school facilities are
        located in areas where there are planned and programmed streets, sewerage, storm
        drainage systems and other necessary infrastructure.
11.     It is the policy of the City that adequate school facilities be available to serve new
        development. In implementing this policy both the City and school districts recognize
        that State law provides that the provision of school facilities is the exclusive
        responsibility of the State and the respective school districts. However, since the
        potential may still exist that sources of financing, including statutory developer fees, state
        and local school bond monies and other state funds will be inadequate, and the City shall
        work with the school districts to identify opportunities for joint funding of recreation and
        community facilities at school sites.
12.     The status of school impact mitigation shall be reviewed in accordance with Policy
        2.7.A.9.

NOTES:
1.      Zones may also apply elsewhere if an airport has atypical operational procedures or
        specialized aircraft activities.
2.      Residential parcels should not contain more than the indicated number of dwelling units
        per gross acre. Clustering of units is encouraged as a means of meeting the Required
        Open Land requirements.
3.      The land use should not attract more than the indicated number of people per acre at any
        time. This figure should include all individuals who may be on the property (e.g.,
        employees, customers/visitors, etc.). These densities are intended as general planning
        guidelines to aid in determining the acceptability of proposed land uses. Special short-
        term events related to aviation (e.g., air shows), as well as non-aviation special events,
        are exempt from the maximum density criteria.
4.      Open land requirements are intended to be applied with respect to the entire zone. This is
        typically accomplished initially as part of the community’s general plan or a specific
        plan.
5.      May be modified by airport-specific policies or decision of local governing body with
        appropriate adopted findings based upon evidence in the record.
6.      See Kern County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan Policy Section 3.3, Airspace
        Protection.
7.      Within the B1 and B2 zones, only the following flammable materials are permitted:
        aviation fuels, other aviation-related materials, and up to 2,000 gallons of nonaviation
        materials.
8.      These conditions do not apply to ministerial actions.
9.      These uses typically can be designed to meet the density requirements and other
        development conditions listed.
10.     These uses typically do not meet the density and other development conditions listed.
        They should be allowed only if a major community objective is served by their location
        in this zone and no feasible alternative location exists.

CIRCULATION ELEMENT
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS
3.1     INTRODUCTION
This section discusses the existing circulation system in the Delano area and reviews the current
plans and related issues that affect the Circulation Element. Also included is an analysis of the
operating condition of the current circulation system along with identification of traffic problems
within the community. Other alternative transportation modes including transit, aviation, rail,
bicycle and pedestrian, truck, transportation management systems, goods movement, and parking are
discussed.
3.2     PURPOSE
The Circulation Element was first required by state law in 1955. Since then, transportation technology
and needs in California have changed greatly, with the emphasis today on the development of a
balanced, multi-modal transportation system. According to state law, the policies and plan proposals of
the Circulation Element should:
       Coordinate the transportation and circulation system with planned land uses;
       Promote the efficient transport of goods and the safe and effective movement of all segments of
        the population;
       Make efficient use of the existing transportation facilities; and
       Protect environmental quality and promote the wise and equitable use of economic and natural
        resources.
The Circulation Element should cover the following to the extent that they pertain to the community:
       Streets and highways;
       Parking provisions;

       Transit and paratransit;
       Railroads;
       Air transportation; and
       Bicycle and pedestrian facilities.
The policies and plan proposals of the Circulation Element should be coordinated closely with those of
the Land Use, Housing, Noise, and Community Design Elements.
3.3     AUTHORIZATION
Government Code Section 65302(b) states the following as the mandatory requirement for General Plan
Circulation Elements:
        “A Circulation Element consisting of the general location and extent of existing
        and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals, and other
        local public utilities and facilities, all correlated with the Land Use Element of
        the plan.”

3.4.2 Existing Plans and Elements
The Delano Circulation Element has been prepared to be consistent with the other plans or elements
currently in effect. This consistency is a requirement of all elements of the community's General Plan.
The following are the plans that have been used in the development of this Element.

3.4.3 Streets and Highways
This sub-section describes the existing conditions of the community's street and highway network.
Also included is a discussion of functional classification, street capacity, and Level of Service. The
sub-section will close with an assessment of the system's existing operating conditions and problems.
Functional Classification
A community's street system is composed of a wide range of facilities. Street and highway facilities
serve two basic functions, mobility and land access. Mobility means the provision for the movement of
motorists between their points of interest or from one place to another. Land access means providing
for the parking, storage or driveway access at the origin or destination of a person's trip.
Each facility type in a circulation element is designed to emphasize to varying degrees the mobility
or land access function. Some facilities emphasize land access over mobility, while other streets
emphasize mobility over land access. The following hierarchy delineates the typical function of the
facilities used in this circulation element.
                                                    Table 3.1
                                          Functional Classification
  Facility Type                                                Emphasis
  Freeway                Mobility with no direct land access and access limited to interchanges.
  Expressway             Mobility with more frequent access to arterials but no direct land access.
  Major Arterial         Mobility with connections to freeways, arterials and other collector streets, and
                         limited access to traffic generators.
  Arterial               Mobility with connections to other arterials, collectors, some local streets and
                         major traffic generators.
  Collector              Connects local streets with arterials, also provides access to adjacent land uses;
                         balances mobility and access.
  Local                  Access to adjacent land uses only; no mobility function.
Freeways
Table 3.1 shows that freeways are designed to provide for higher volumes of traffic at higher speeds,
over longer distances. Greater volumes and speeds require limited access, which is generally regulated
by interchanges spaced at a minimum of one mile in urban areas, and two miles in rural areas. Within
the City of Delano, interchanges between Garces and Cecil do not meet this standard.

General Plan                                                                                                3-3
Expressways
Expressways, like Freeways, provide for higher traffic volumes, at higher speeds and longer travel
distances. Access is provided via at-grade intersections, generally spaced no closer than one-half mile
apart. Expressways are intended to provide a high level of capacity in selected high volume corridors.
Major Arterials
Major Arterials provide access to major travel generators and are typically designed with six lanes for
through traffic, a parking/transit/right turn lane, and a median with dual left turn lanes at intersections.
Access to adjacent land uses is limited. Arterials provide for moderate volumes at moderate speeds and
distances, with access to other arterials and collectors at half-mile intervals, and access to local streets
and collectors at quarter mile intervals.
Arterials
Arterials are intended to provide the majority of a community’s traffic carrying capacity. Arterials
provide connections via interchanges to the freeway system and to other arterials and collectors via
intersections. Arterials, more than any other type of street, illustrate the conflicts which may arise
between the provision of access and mobility. Typically, arterials are designed with two through lanes
in each direction, a median with a left turn lane, and transit stop/right turn lanes on each side.
Collectors
Collectors are intended to provide connectivity between local streets and the arterial street system.
Collectors also provide access to major activity centers (commercial or employment) and some
abutting land uses. Collector streets are typically designed with one through lane in each direction, a
left turn lane, and parking/right turn lane/transit stop areas on both sides.
Local Streets
Local Streets are intended to provide direct access to abutting land uses. Movement of traffic is the
secondary purpose for local streets. Local streets should not carry through traffic. Local streets also
serve as easements for utilities. Typically, these streets are designed with one lane in each direction and
parking is provided on both sides.
The proper designation of the community's street network can assist in the development of an efficient
system for both mobility and access. The proper balance not only ensures that a street is sized to
function properly, but it allows a community to properly allocate its resources to the streets needing
additional capacity or improvements. A properly designed system will also prevent the use of local
streets for through trips or the overburdening of freeways, expressways, and arterials with traffic.
Problems begin to occur in a system when a street that is designated to provide mobility is asked to
provide land access. Land access typically requires driveways and on-street parking to adequately
address the land access function. When many access points or on-street parking is provided, traffic

conflicts occur and the facility loses its ability to provide for mobility. Likewise, when a street
designed for access is asked to provide for mobility, conflicts occur. This generally happens on arterial
and collector streets that were not developed with adequate access control or on local streets that are
asked to carry through traffic.
Existing Street System
The following describes the existing circulation system for the community.
State Highways and Freeways
State Route (SR) 99 runs in a north-south direction through the center of the City. SR 99 is a major
freeway, which connects Northern California and Southern California. The facility provides for
regional movement and inter-regional access through the Central Valley from Bakersfield to
Sacramento. The freeway is a four lane divided facility that is currently being upgraded to a six lane,
divided freeway. A number of the interchanges along State Route 99, including Garces, Cecil, Fourth,
Avenue, Eleventh Avenue, and County Line Road are substandard, and in need of improvements.
SR 155 is a two lane, undivided highway in the study area. In the City of Delano, SR 155 is comprised
of a two-way couplet that runs north and south fronting SR 99 between the SR 99 at 9th Avenue ramps
and Garces Highway. The west portion of the couplet is designated as Ellington Street and the east
portion of the couplet is designated as Fremont Street in the City of Delano. Both portions of the
couplet are designated as collectors. SR 155 also runs in an east-west fashion through the City of
Delano east of SR 99. This portion of SR 155 is designated as Garces Highway and is classified as a
major arterial. SR 155 connects to the Sequoia National Forest entrance east of the City.
Arterials
There are six arterials designated in the Delano Urban Area. Generally, arterial streets are developed
with right-of-way widths of 90’ - 110’ depending on medians and turn lane requirements. Delano does
not have an arterial developed to full arterial standards, which is four lanes with a center median. Most
of the existing arterials in the community are two lanes in each direction and with some left turn lanes
at signalized intersections.
County Line Road, Cecil Avenue, Garces Highway, and a portion of Woollomes Avenue are the City’s
east-west arterials. Cecil Avenue and Garces Highway are the primary east-west arterials servicing the
City. The majority of Garces Highway is a two lane undivided facility. The majority of Cecil Avenue is
a four lane undivided facility where the street passes through the City. The area between Cecil Avenue
and Garces Highway, east of SR 99 is considered to be the City’s central business district.
The north-south arterials in the community are Albany Street, High Street, and Browning Road, which
are all located within the City limits. Albany Street delineates the City’s western boundary. High Street
runs parallel to SR 99 and serves as the primary north-south arterial in the central City area. Albany
Street, High Street, and Browning Road are two lane, undivided facilities. Browning Road marks the
current eastern boundary of the City limits.

Collectors
All or portions of the following streets are currently designated as collector streets in the Delano area.
Collectors are currently constructed on 60’ - 80’ right-of-ways with one lane in each direction and
parking on both sides.

Local Streets
The remainder of the streets in the community are classified as local. Local streets are typically 50’ -
60’ right-of-way with two lanes and parking on each side.
Gateways and Scenic Corridors
There are no designated scenic corridors identified in Delano. Gateway streets have been designated
for Fremont Street, High Street, Cecil Avenue, Glenwood, Ellington Street, Garces Highway, County
Line Road, Browning Road, Albany Street, and Woollomes Avenue.
Roads Of Regional Significance
Regional access to the Delano area exists through freeways and rural roadways. Roadways that
provide regional access to the community of Delano include Albany Street, Browning Road, Cecil

Avenue, Garces Highway (SR 155 east of SR 99), and State Routes 43, 46, and 99. Figure 3-1
identifies the Regional Roadway System for the City of Delano area.
Albany Street is a north-south arterial on the western edge of the Delano City limits. It provides
access to McFarland to the south. Albany Street is a two lane undivided facility. Browning Road is
also a north-south arterial located east of Delano. Browning Road extends south to McFarland and
provides access to SR 99 in McFarland. Browning is a two lane undivided road. Cecil Avenue is an
east-west facility running through the center of Delano that connects to SR 43 to the west and rural
areas to the east. It is a 2-4 lane undivided facility from Albany to Randolph and a two lane
undivided facility in the rural areas.
Garces Highway, designated as SR 155 from SR 99 east, is also an east-west facility that is located
to the south of Delano. Garces Highway extends to Corcoran Road and SR 43 to the west and to the
Porterville Highway (SR 65) and the Sequoia National Forest to the east. This is a two lane
undivided facility.
SR 43 is a north-south highway west of Delano. This highway provides access from Fresno and
Tulare Counties to the north, and Kern County to the south. SR 43 is a two lane undivided facility.
SR 46 is an east-west highway and is located south of Delano. SR 46 originates in the town of
Famoso, at SR 99, and continues west to SR 1 along the Pacific Ocean’s coast. SR 99 is a north-
south freeway that runs through the center of Delano. This major regional facility provides access to
Northern and Southern California. SR 99 is a four lane divided highway.
Existing Traffic Conditions
The existing traffic conditions were evaluated to develop a base line, or beginning point, for
understanding Delano's existing street network. This analysis was completed for freeways, selected
arterials and collector streets. The analysis focused on three specific issues: street capacity, classified
system pattern and connectivity.
The evaluation of street capacity was the central focus of the analysis process. The capacity of a street
or highway is affected by a number of factors. The number of lanes; the location and spacing of
intersections; the type of traffic control devices used (stop signs, traffic signs, etc.); the traffic signal
timing plan; the use of on-street parking; the percentage of trucks; the level of transit activity; and the
number and location of adjacent driveways all have an effect on the carrying capacity of a particular
street or highway segment. Table 3-2 defines carrying capacities of the street facilities in the
community. Each facility is presented with a different number of lanes and with different geometric
characteristics. The capacity shown for each facility represents the theoretical capacity of the street at
LOS “E.”

The table delineates the capacities of the various street segments to be evaluated. The capacity is
defined as the number of cars (vehicles) per lane that pass a specific point during a twenty-four hour
period.
The evaluation of a street's capacity introduces the concept of level of service (LOS), which is defined
as a qualitative measure describing operational conditions within a traffic stream, and the perception of
these conditions by motorists. A specific level of service definition generally describes these
conditions in terms of factors such as speed and travel time; freedom to maneuver; traffic interruptions;
comfort and convenience; and safety. There are six LOS designations ranging from “A” to “F,” with
“A” representing the best operating condition and “F” representing the worst. At LOS “E,” the street
begins to operate less efficiently and the driver is subject to excessive delays.

The Level of Service for each critical street segment has been calculated using volume capacities from
the Florida Department of Transportation's Florida's Level of Service Standards and Guidelines
Manual for Planning, April 1992 (Florida Tables). This manual provides a method for evaluating
freeways, expressways, arterials, and collectors. This method was selected for this analysis because of
its intended use in planning studies and its consistency with adopted procedures for the Kern Council
of Governments (Kern COG).
The Florida Tables are generalized planning tables based on the definitions and measurement
techniques of the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual. This methodology incorporates signalization
characteristics (number of signals per mile) and roadway characteristics (number of lanes, left-turn
pockets, divided/undivided) into the LOS determination. The Florida Tables separate facility types
into freeways, state arterials with both interrupted (signalized) and uninterrupted (non-signalized)
flow, and non-state roadways. Within these various classifications, the facilities are separated by
number of lanes and divided versus undivided. There are also adjustments for facility types not
given in the tables. For each facility type under each classification are levels of service A through F
with corresponding traffic volumes. These volumes are the maximum amount of traffic that a given
facility with given characteristics can carry and maintain a given LOS. This maximum volume per
LOS is also called the capacity of the facility. Appendix D contains copies of the Florida Level of
Service Tables used in evaluating the Delano circulation system.
As can be seen on the Florida Tables shown in Appendix D, higher level of service values may not
be achieved on interrupted flow facilities even with extremely low traffic volumes. As stated in the
Florida Tables manual, “these higher quality levels of service cannot be achieved primarily because
the signalization characteristics simply will not allow vehicles to attain relatively high average travel
speeds.” Therefore, when looking at the circulation tables in the General Plan and it's EIR, streets
labeled as collectors will never attain LOS “A” and “B.” Likewise, arterials with a higher number of
signals will never attain LOS “A”.
Existing Traffic Volumes
To complete the assessment of existing 1997 traffic conditions in Delano, the Kern COG traffic model,
the CalTrans 1995 Traffic Volumes Report, and 1997 count data was used. Kern COG’s model has the
capabilities to estimate traffic volumes for any given roadway based on actual counts taken in recent
years. The existing conditions assessment includes City streets and County roads. Traffic volumes
shown in Figure 3-2 reflect average daily traffic in vehicles per day.
Existing Level of Service
The traffic volumes delineated on the following page were used to evaluate the operating conditions of
the existing street and highway system. The analysis was based on the relation of the existing traffic
volume of the street to the current maximum capacity volume of the street.

The City has set its level of service standard at LOS “C,” except at freeway interchanges and other high
volume locations, where LOS “D” is used. CalTrans adopted level of service standard is LOS “D.”
Table 3-3 lists the analyzed streets by segment. A brief description of the existing geometrics (number
of lanes) and the facility type is provided. The existing traffic volumes shown in Table 3-2 are either
1997 counts supplied by the city, 1998 counts supplied by the City’s consultant ATE, estimated from
the 1997 Kern COG model, special speed/volume counts prepared by the City Engineer, or counts
taken from the CalTrans Count Book. The volumes that are actual counts or were taken from the
CalTrans Count Book are noted in Table 3-3. The current theoretical capacity, LOS “E,” of the
specific segment is given and was developed based on the geometrics of the facility in conjunction with
the Florida Tables. The current level of service shown was developed from the traffic volume
information, the geometrics and the Florida Tables.
The result of the existing level of service analysis shows that all of the major streets in the
community are currently operating at LOS “C” or above. There is a significant factor of note with
regard to the usage of the Kern COG projections to describe existing conditions. In at least several
significant circumstances (Cecil, Girard and Garces which have new traffic counts), the Kern COG
traffic model significantly under-projects traffic volumes on major roadways. Therefore the data in
Table 3-3 should be used to illustrate the pattern of traffic in the community and these projections
should not be construed as actual traffic volumes.

Existing Classified System Pattern
The pattern and spacing of a community's street system are as important as the proper designation of
the functional classification of the streets. Arterial streets located approximately every mile with
collector streets located between the arterials at approximately half-mile intervals are ideal for
communities like Delano that have developed their circulation system based on the automobile.
This pattern accomplishes several goals. It balances the system by providing for mobility with arterials,
thus not committing the community to an over expenditure of resources. It provides for movement
within an area with collectors at half-mile intervals. It protects neighborhoods from through traffic by
isolating local streets and promoting through movements on collectors and arterials, which are
designed to accommodate these trips. Finally, it complements the Land Use Element by providing
locations along arterials and collectors for traffic generating activities. The following sections discuss
the relationship of Delano's existing street pattern to the pattern described above.
Regional access to the Delano area is directly provided from SR 99, which runs through the
downtown area. As previously identified, Albany Street, Browning Road, Cecil Avenue, Garces
Highway (SR 155 east of SR 99), and SR 43 and 46 also provide regional access to the community.
Roadways providing regional access to Delano are either two lane undivided facilities which are
rural in nature or a four lane divided freeway.
One-mile spacing between the existing arterials is proving to be ideal for the type and intensity of
development in the community. Typical of rural cities in the Central Valley, Delano's collector street
system has not been fully developed. Overall, collector streets in Delano generally balance their
mobility and access functions adequately. In the core area of town, the collectors are through streets
such as 9th Avenue and 11th Avenue, which run through the central business district.
Connectivity
The success of a community's street system is greatly affected by the concept of connectivity.
Connectivity describes the continuity of a street system. Typically, street systems develop over a long
period of time and can develop missing links in the network. These missing links can create both local
and community wide problems as the traffic that would logically use the missing link must use another
street to complete a trip. Delano's street system has developed with some connectivity problems, which
center around the Union Pacific Railroad. The railroad bisects several streets between Cecil Avenue
and Garces Highway in the downtown area. The streets not providing connectivity due to the railroad
are 6th, 7th, 8th\, 9th, 10th, 12th and 14th Avenues.
Other than these downtown streets, Delano has developed its existing street system with excellent
connectivity. Most of the arterials are continuous within the community and the expansion of these
facilities to provide for future development can be accommodated.

Truck Routes
The City of Delano does not have any designated truck routes within the City. At this time, trucks are
allowed on all street segments within the City. A truck parking ordinance is in effect which generally
identifies restricted overnight truck parking areas.
According to City staff, most of the trucking activity occurs at the east end of the City. Browning
and Randolph Avenues have an abundance of heavy truck traffic from the outlying County areas. In
addition, the SR 99/Woollomes off ramp has a high level of truck activity.
Transportation System Management
Transportation System Management (TSM) is defined as the use of various traffic and demand
management strategies to maximize the use and capacity of the existing transportation system. The
goal of transportation management is to use low cost solutions to congestion problems delaying the
need for large capital outlays. As traffic and parking demand continues to increase in Delano, TSM
strategies can be used to assist in mitigating the associated problems. Traditional transportation system
management strategies include, but are not limited to:
•   the timing of traffic signals to more efficiently respond to traffic demand;
•   the striping of existing streets to include exclusive turn lanes or additional through lanes to
    maximize the carrying capacity of the street;
•   the use of flexible work schedules to shift or lengthen the peak hour of travel;
•   development of carpools and ridesharing programs to increase the number of people per vehicle;
    and
•   the use of public and private transit to reduce the number of vehicles using the streets during the
    peak hour.
Goods Movement
The movement of goods and services is a primary function of any circulation system. The movement of
goods and services includes those into, through, and within the community. Delano is home to DLS,
the western hub of distribution for Sears. Currently, the primary goods and services moved in Delano
are related to the agriculture industry. Delano is one of the country’s primary producers of kiwi fruit,
table grapes, and a variety of other fruit crops. In addition to agriculture, light and heavy industries are
located in Delano and the surrounding County areas. Some of the major employers in the Delano area
that would require goods movement include:

The State Highways, County roads and City arterial streets are the primary facilities for moving
goods and services. Other modes providing for the movement of goods and services include
railroads and package express. The railroad provides for limited shipment of agricultural products
out of the community and the shipment of goods into the community. Package express service is
provided to Delano by most package express companies and the U.S. Post Office.
3.4.4 Transit
Public Transit
The City of Delano is currently served by a number of public transit programs. These programs
include a demand-response, a fixed route, County of Kern service, a medical van shuttle, and Social
Service Transportation transit programs. The demand-response or Dial-a-Ride (DAR) service has been
operated by the City since 1988. Prior to 1988, the DAR service was privately operated by Gilbert
Transportation. The fixed route system was implemented by the City in 1995. The City’s transit
system provides service to the community within the City limits.
The existing fixed route transit system currently offers three bus routes. All routes begin at one central
point, the Delano Transit Center, 11th Avenue and Glenwood Street, adjacent to downtown Delano.
The Delano Area Rapid Transit (DET) operates on 30-minute headways, with the starting and ending
location at the Delano Transit Center. Figure 3-3 illustrates DET’s current service area boundaries and
existing route designations.
City of Delano                                                                          December 2005

City of Delano      December 2005
General Plan Update          3-20
The DET operates on a seven day service schedule. Service hours are as follows: Monday through
Friday from the hours of 7:00AM to 6:00PM, and Saturday and Sunday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
One-way fares for the fixed route service are 50 cents per person. Advance ticket purchases are
available for a reduced fare. Delano Express Transit services the local shopping, business areas,
medical centers and schools.
The Delano Dial-A-Ride (DAR) service is based on a first come-first serve basis. Clients call the
transit center to schedule a pick up.
Overall, combined ridership for the Delano Express Transit and DAR service totaled
239,145 passengers during Fiscal Year 1996/1997. Of this total, the fixed route carried approximately
156,000 riders, the demand response carried an estimated 30,000 riders, and the remaining
30,000 riders were comprised of County and Social Services passenger trips. Annual operating costs
for Fiscal Year 1997/1998 were $682,944. Delano Transit fares totaled approximately $113,000 and
the remaining revenue of $530,624 came from a combination of state and federal transportation
funding sources. These funding sources include Transportation Development Act (TDA) funds,
Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Section 5311(f) Grants (formerly known as Section 18), and
other state and federal funding.
Kern County Transit Service
The Delano Express Transit (DET) has an agreement with the County of Kern to provide services
outside the Delano City boundary to County residents who live within the service area. The City is
reimbursed by the County for providing these services to County areas. The Kern County service area
is bounded by County Line Road on the north, Kyte Road on the east, Pond Road on the south, and SR
43 on the west.
Tulare County Transit Service
The County of Tulare has recently revised their routing system in the Delano region. As of August
1997, the County implemented additional routing services to the areas of Earlimart, Richgrove, and
Delano. Service to these areas will be available five days a week, with two service times a day
(morning and afternoon). Currently, the Earlimart, Richgrove, Delano route operates only two days a
week.
There are two stops located in the City of Delano. They are the Regional Medical Center, and the
Delano Ranch Market. Recently, service stops at the local KMART and Greyhound bus station have
been discontinued due to lack of demand.
The cost to ride the Tulare Transit system is $1.50 per person, per trip. Tokens are available for
seniors, free of charge. Children six years of age and under ride free of charge with an accompanying
adult. Figure 3-4 displays the County of Tulare’s transit service area boundary.

City of Delano      December 2005
General Plan Update          3-22
Private Transportation
Regional transportation service in the Central Valley is provided by Greyhound. Greyhound provides
access to Bakersfield and Southern California to the South and Fresno, Sacramento, and the Bay Area
to the North. Greyhound is the only private transportation organization that services the City of
Delano. The Greyhound station is located at High Street and 11th Avenue in central Delano.
Greyhound provides services through Delano two times a day.
Social Service
The City also offers a “meals-on-wheels” program, which provides food to qualifying senior citizens,
as part of the State of California Nutrition Program.
Taxi Service
Currently, there are no private taxi companies operating in Delano. The City operates a Dial-A-Ride
system that works on a reservation basis. However, persons needing a ride may not always be
able to reserve the Dial-A-Ride vehicle when it is convenient for them due to previously made
reservations. Therefore, a taxi company may fill the gap in the demand responsive transit system that
currently exists.
3.4.5 Aviation
History/Ownership
The Delano Municipal Airport is located in the southeast portion of the City of Delano,
approximately two miles from the downtown center. The airfield was built in the 1930s and was
originally operated as a County facility. In 1941 the airfield was used as an active air base and was
operated by the United States Government. After World War II, the County operated the site until
1972 when the airport was transferred to the City. The City has owned and operated the airport from
1972 to the present day.
Airport Classification
The Delano Municipal Airport is classified by the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems as a
General Utility - 1 facility. Operation of the airport is the responsibility of the airport manager, a City
employee. Figure 3-5 displays the most recent Airport Master Plan. It is the City’s intent to maintain
an up-to-date Master Plan for the airport.
Existing Facilities
The airport currently houses single engine, twin engine, and helicopter operations. There are a number
of public and private hangers available, along with aircraft tie-down pads and shelters. Twenty-four
hour self-service aviation fuel is available on-site.
City of Delano                                                                             December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                   3-23

City of Delano      December 2005
General Plan Update          3-24
There is currently one runway in operation. The main runway is approximately 5,560 feet long and
50 feet wide. A second restricted runway is in need of deferred maintenance and repairs and may be
shut down in the near future. The airport is equipped with AWDS III navigation and lighting facilities
and is open twenty-four hours a day. The airport currently operates on a non-precision instrument
approach method.
The City has an existing 1,500 square foot terminal building, which is located at the airport. The
building consists of a small office, pilot lounge, and waiting area. The airport also has a restaurant on-
site.
In the past two years, the airport has undergone a variety of new construction projects as part of a
runway overlay program, which has allowed for better service. These projects totaled an estimated
$300,000 and included repair of existing ramps and other facilities, and the installation of reflectors on
taxiway lights.
The City is seeking Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) funding as part of the Airport
Improvement Program (AIP). The City has applied for $400,000 of grant funds for airport
improvements. The City desires to make improvements associated with updating the runway, such as
runway paving, implementation of a rotating beacon, and the installation of a new lighting system.
Based on future demand for aircraft services, the airport does have space available for expansion of the
existing airport operation. There are currently sixty ramp parking spaces available at the airport.
Existing Operations
Recently, there has been a decrease in crop dusting activity at the airport. The airport currently houses
the planes utilized for agricultural spraying. Mixing of the chemicals associated with said agricultural
spraying operation is now accomplished in the field, instead of on-site at the airport. One of the
reasons the airport has been able to support the existing aircraft stock is their competitive fuel prices.
The airport has shown an increase in itinerant business through the round-the-clock automated fueling
system. The airport does not currently offer air cargo services and has no plans to implement an air
cargo service within the next five years.
There are currently two fixed base operators located at the airport. These operations include private
maintenance/repair and helicopter services. The City plans to construct a maintenance and repair
facility at the airport when funding is available.
Commercial Passenger Service
There is no commercial air service operating to and from Delano Municipal Airport. The closest
service is available at Meadows Field in Bakersfield, approximately 30 miles south of the City.
Meadows Field is operated by Kern County Airport, where Commercial service is provided. These
commuter airline shuttles provide linkages to the large urban areas of Southern California and the Bay
Area.

The Delano Municipal Airport has no plans to implement a commercial passenger service within the
next five years.
Airport Master Plan
In 1992, the City of Delano adopted an update to the Airport Master Plan. The Plan states that the
general objective of the Airport Master Plan is to “prepare a long-range plan to guide development in
order to maintain the airport as a valued transportation facility for both Delano and those parts of the
surrounding area for which the Airport is the most convenient aviation facility.” Some of the principal
findings from the Plan are outlined as follows:
The City of Delano serves as an important economic center for Northern Kern County and Southern
Tulare County, providing major commercial and health care services for the surrounding communities
of Earlimart, Richgrove, McFarland, Wasco, Pond, Alpaugh and Pixley. Other major industries are
retail trade, professional services, and manufacturing, while agricultural employment accounts for over
one-third of the employment in Delano.
Population growth through the planning period is based on the City’s continuing economic
development marketing efforts and the impact of the new State Prison and the Return-to-Custody
facility. This new population segment will necessitate a substantial work force, as well as the
creation of ancillary businesses and industries. Additional population and employment opportunities
are anticipated by the relocation of businesses to the area.
The number of based aircraft at Delano Municipal Airport is forecast to increase from 49 in 1990 to 80
in 2010, with a larger percentage increase in multi-engine aircraft and helicopters than in single-engine
aircraft.
The number of annual aircraft operations at Delano Municipal Airport is forecast to gradually increase
over the planning period from 12,500 in 1990 to 38,000 by 2010. As airport operations expand and the
role of the airport evolves, the City will undertake updates of the Airport Master Plan to ensure that it is
up-to-date.
3.4.6 Rail
Existing Rail Service
Delano is currently served by the main line of Union Pacific Railroad, formerly the Southern Pacific
Railroad. The railroad runs essentially in a north-south direction, parallel to SR 99. There are
currently seven railroad crossings within the City as follows: Woollomes Avenue, First Avenue,
Garces Highway, 11th Avenue, 13th Avenue, Cecil Avenue, and County Line Road. It should be
noted that the rail line is situated adjacent to the City’s South Delano Industrial Park Area, allowing
for easy rail access to industrial sites. No changes have been made to the existing rail line since the
1982 Circulation Element. Additionally, there are no abandoned rail lines in the community.
The Union Pacific Railroad is the main freight train service in the Central Valley. Due to the vast
City of Delano                                                                           December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                  3-26

agricultural production in the region, the railroad is an essential transportation shipping mode.
Furthermore, cold storage facilities are located along the line allowing for quick service of local
agricultural commodities.
As mentioned above, there are a number of existing railroad crossings scattered throughout the City
limits. At certain times of the day, when a train is moving through the City, there are temporary
traffic congestion problems. The City is currently considering the construction of a grade separation
at either Cecil Avenue or Garces Highway to reduce traffic congestion when trains are present.
Passenger Rail Service
Delano is not currently served by AMTRAK passenger service. The closest station is in Wasco,
approximately 15 miles southeast of the City. Other AMTRAK stations are located in the nearby
communities of Corcoran and Bakersfield.
3.4.7 Bicycle and Pedestrian
Currently, the City of Delano does not have designated bicycle routes. Most of the bicycle activity
in Delano occurs around the schools by school children. Delano has one high school, one junior
high school, one middle school, and six elementary schools. A Draft Bicycle Plan was prepared for
the City in 1980, but has never been formally adopted. Approximately 12 miles of City streets were
proposed to be designated for bicycle use. Randolph Street, Eleventh Avenue, Lexington Street, and
Norwalk Street are all designated for bicycle use along with other local community streets. Due to
high volumes of traffic on the City’s arterial streets, bicycle travel is discouraged on these streets.
Updating and adopting the bicycle master plan is needed.
Pedestrian facilities in Delano are limited to sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian crossing lights.
These facilities are located to varying degrees throughout the community. Curb cuts and ramps are
being required on any new construction in the City.
3.4.8 Parking
There are six city off-street parking lots in the downtown area of the City of Delano, as well as
various striped and unstriped on-street parking. Figure 3-6 illustrates the location of the City’s off-
street parking lots. Existing parking in the downtown area is sufficient to serve the current parking
demand. Most of the available parking lots have minimal use during the day. Furthermore, some of
the lots remain empty. It appears that adequate on-street, diagonal parking and associated business
parking areas are currently meeting the parking needs of the community.
3.4.9 Circulation Issues
This section focuses on current issues affecting the circulation system in the Delano area, and those
issues that will have an effect on the system in the future. Understanding how the circulation system
works today will help determine how the system will work in the future, and assist the Community in
anticipating future issues that will affect the transportation network.

City of Delano      December 2005
General Plan Update          3-28
Issues are covered by area of concern; streets and highways, transit, aviation, rail, bicycle/pedestrian,
trucks, and goods movement. In addition, issues affecting the system are discussed in a State context,
regional context and from a local perspective. A final section on opportunities and constraints of the
1982 General Plan is also included.
Statewide Issues
Growth will continue to be one of the biggest issues facing the citizens of California for the next two
decades. The ability to accommodate population growth will be a major challenge facing the State in
the years to come. The San Joaquin Valley is faced with an even greater challenge than the rest of the
State. By the year 2040, the valley floor will increase by 9.48 million persons. Kern County alone is
expected to increase by approximately 2.1% annually through 2020 and reach a population of
approximately 1,220,300. Projections for population growth for the Valley are higher than that of the
State as a whole. The issues of growth, coupled with diminishing resources at all levels of government,
will adversely impact City budgets, requiring them to be particularly prudent in the administration of
services.
Air quality is also a major question that is facing California. Areas such as the San Joaquin Valley are
experiencing serious air quality problems. In the Valley the sources of this air pollution are wide
ranging. Pollution sources include the San Francisco Bay Area (which is responsible for up to 40% of
the pollution in the Valley), the Kern County oil industry, and mobile sources (interstate trucks and the
automobile). The Circulation Element is designed to have a positive effect on air quality by creating a
street network that will improve the operating efficiencies of the Community's street system. This is
accomplished by decreasing vehicle delays, travel times and engine idling time, all of which contribute
to vehicular emissions. The more efficient the Delano circulation system becomes, fewer delays will
occur and less fuel will be consumed. The Circulation Element can also contribute to improved air
quality by laying a framework for the development of a balanced transportation system. The
Circulation Element can ensure that resources are balanced to match the Community’s needs by
encouraging the use of all modes for the most efficient transportation of people, goods, and services.
Regional Issues
Regional issues are becoming more influential on their impact on the local circulation system. Several
issues bear notice as they relate to the future Circulation Element. These regional issues will have a
more dramatic effect on the development of the local circulation system.
Since SR 99 runs through the City of Delano, regional access to and from Delano is not an issue.
However, the off- and on-ramps to/from SR 99 are inadequate in several locations. Once the
inadequate ramp situation is addressed and corrected, SR 99 access will play a major factor in the
future growth of the City.
Like the State as a whole, the issue of growth will be central to the future of Delano. The growth
projections for the Community suggest that the valley-wide growth trend will affect Delano similarly.
The future Circulation Element must provide for the corresponding increase in travel by providing a
balanced transportation system.
City of Delano                                                                           December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                 3-29

The most critical issue may be the problem of air quality. This issue may have the greatest impact on
the development of the Circulation Element, requiring a careful evaluation on how to accommodate
the projected population growth with an adequate circulation system. Much of the Valley is considered
a non-attainment area for ozone and particulates. Mobile source emissions (cars and trucks)
contribute to both of these pollutants. The development of a system to effectively handle the increased
number of trips is an issue for all communities in the Valley.
The emergence of regional public transit in Tulare County and City service to Kern County will have a
great effect on the development of the local Delano Transit operations. The local system will be called
upon to provide both local commuter and social service transportation, but in the future will be asked to
play an expanding role in feeding ridership to the regional intercity service.
The issues associated with “jobs/housing balance” are emerging in the Central San Joaquin Valley.
The relationship between the location where people live and where they work has long been an issue in
the Bay Area and Southern California. Locally, the emergence of significant levels of commuters from
Bakersfield suggests that the transportation system will be asked to accommodate future commuters
with patterns historically seen in more urban areas of California. The relationship of the “jobs/housing
balance” and the future demands for transportation is a critical item. A number of people live outside
of the Delano area and commute into the City to work. Generally, these are professional people who
live in larger cities and work in Delano. A number of professional medical employees live in
Bakersfield and work in the Delano Regional Medical Center (DRMC) facility. The following chart
summarizes commuter profile information for the City of Delano.

Local Issues
Coupled with the concept of growth in the Valley, the creation of jobs within the community is of
critical importance. Equally important in the context of the Circulation Element is the location within
the community of these new jobs. Currently, industrial development is taking place primarily in
southeast parts of town. Housing developments are currently planned throughout the community. This
City of Delano                                                                          December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                 3-30

planned land use pattern will require residents and workers to use both north/south arterials for
commuting trips to and from work. This represents a fairly balanced approach to the jobs/housing
layout within the community.
The companion to the creation of jobs is the development of commercial growth. The level of retail
activity will influence the development of the future street system and require care in the location of
regional services. Commercial development exists mostly in the downtown area, which has placed
traffic on Main, High, 9th Avenue, 11th Avenue, and a number of other streets in the area. Traffic could
increase as growth and revitalization continues in these areas.
Street and Highway Issues
Several issues affecting the street and highway system have surfaced over the past 17 years since the
1982 Circulation Element was completed. Several of these items reflect the effects of outside changes,
while several indicate the need to address changes within the Community.
In the past, the Union Pacific rail line greatly affected the development patterns for the streets in
Delano. The layout of the downtown streets reflects the original layout of the rail line. Today the
railroad affects the circulation system through traffic delays as the trains pass through the City. The
railroad also impacts the circulation system by limiting the number and location of grade crossings
within the Community. This places added emphasis on selected street crossings to handle all traffic
wishing to cross the tracks.
The issue of the conversion of two lane streets to four lanes must be addressed in the future as traffic
volumes increase. Currently, arterials are typically constructed on a 90’ to 110’ right-of-way with a
72’ to 90’ curb-to-curb design. When streets are converted to four lanes with left turn pockets, one
design option is the removal of on-street parking. This will affect businesses, truck deliveries and
future transit operations in commercial areas. In residential areas, some homes lose the on-street
parking and are limited to on-site parking.
Increasing agricultural and other truck traffic along Browning Road and Randolph Avenue are
impacting circulation in the region. These streets were originally designed as rural two lane roads and
have now transitioned into use as urban two lane roads. These segments at the east end of town should
be upgraded to urban standards in order to accommodate this increase in traffic and use.
In addition, the northbound interchange of SR 99 at Woollomes Avenue is inadequate for truck traffic.
The current configuration of the off-ramp, in conjunction with the nearby Union Pacific Railroad
Crossing, does not allow for proper truck storage areas or ample turn space. This interchange was
developed as a rural interchange and should be upgraded to an urban interchange to accommodate
truck traffic to the airport and associated areas within the community. Part of the reason for increased
truck traffic on Browning and Randolph is due to the rerouting of traffic that would normally use the
SR 99/Woollomes interchange. Due to an insufficient facility, the alternate route is chosen, thereby
creating more traffic on the north/south City street system at the east end of the City. The existing
interchange at County Line Road is also inadequate due to an undersized northbound hook ramp.
Significant congestion results from northbound vehicles exiting the freeway and attempting to turn left
onto Girard Street. The Garces Avenue and Cecil Avenue interchanges are also substandard in that
City of Delano                                                                          December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                 3-31

they are partial interchanges, relying on two sets of hook ramps to the north and south of Eleventh
Avenue along both sides of the freeway.
The City is also concerned about existing freeway overcrossings, as well as the need for additional
overcrossings. Many existing overcrossings are too narrow and do not provide adequate space for
normal traffic flow. There is, however, little room for expansion of the overcrossings, and the City
does not have the funds available to undertake a major project such as widening of the overcrossings.
State funding is minimal, and the City has other immediate needs for street improvements in the City
which take precedent.
The City of Delano has two fire stations within the City boundary. One is located west of SR 99 and
one can be found east of SR 99. The potential exists for emergency access to be limited when a train is
passing through the City.
The City of Delano’s Regional Medical Center (DRMC) is located east of SR 99. DRMC serves as a
full service hospital for the community and encompassing region. An additional concern is access to
Interstate 5. No direct access in an emergency is available from Interstate 5 to the Delano Regional
Medial Center.
Another concern in the Community is the operation of local streets as collectors. This is a common
issue for communities the size of Delano. The designation of collectors well in advance of
development is one method for eliminating the continuance of this confusion. By determining where
and how the collectors will be developed, the street system can be designed to provide the proper
balance between mobility and access.
The future street system can also be used to further strengthen the concepts of neighborhoods by
physically defining the areas designated by the Land Use Element for growth. The relationship
between the location of arterials and collectors and the planned residential neighborhoods can be used
to define “neighborhoods.” Areas formed by arterials can be used to define distinct sections of the
Community.
In addition to the above listed issues, the City should implement certain policies to provide for an
overall growth management plan for the City’s street system. Some of the policies and goals related
to this issue are detailed in Section 4 of this report.
The following areas within the City are known “hot spots” where traffic congestion is a problem from
time to time:
        County Line Road at SR 99 intersection/ramps
        Girard at SR 99 ramps
        Cecil Avenue at SR 99/High Street/Union Pacific Railroad

Transit Issues
The City of Delano currently owns and operates its own transit system. Delano Transit operates both a
demand-response and fixed-route service within Delano’s City limits. The City also provides service
to the outlying Kern County areas. The County has a financial reimbursement arrangement for the City
to offer this service. The Tulare County Transit offers a rural route service to the City of Delano. The
routes operate daily and serve the communities of Earlimart, Richgrove and Delano.
The City is faced with the need for additional integration of transit systems to ensure adequate
transportation services to the community and adjacent County areas. The Transit Development Plan
Fiscal Year 1996/97 identifies the need for a downtown Transit Transfer Station, which should be
located as close as possible to the current transit hub.
Based on the projected 4.2% growth expected for the City of Delano, the transit service must be able to
expand their services to meet the needs of the population. Additional routes may need to be
implemented as ridership increases, and different areas of the City develop.
Aviation Issues
The City of Delano has land available for expansion of its existing airport facilities. The annual
operations at the airport are expected to steadily increase over the next two decades.
The primary focus for the airport will be the upgrading and improvements to existing facilities
currently at the airport. Based on FAA funding approval and allocation, the airport may undergo a
large-scale rehabilitation of current facilities over the next few years.
Due to the strategic location of the airport at the southeast corner of the City, and the restricted non-
airport use type of development, there are no noise, safety, or land use concerns related to the airport at
this time. However; the airport should be protected from future encroachment by incompatible noise
sensitive land uses or land uses involving large assembly of persons, especially in the approach zones.
Rail Issues
The long-term health of the rail industry continues to be affected by competition from trucking. The
rail industry is restructuring its organizations to become more competitive. The merger of Union
Pacific Railroad with Southern Pacific Railroad represents one restructuring example. Because
underlying economic demands are facing the Union Pacific Railroad, care must be exercised in
circulation and land use decisions that might affect current and potential rail shippers. The loss of the
rail shipment option would place additional demands on the street network as existing and future
businesses would be limited to only truck shipments.
The continuing development of industrial uses in southeast Delano could increase the demand for rail

General Plan Update                                                                                  3-33

service along the Union Pacific line. This increase in rail service will strengthen rail freight service to
and from the community. The need to strengthen the number and volume of shippers along both rail
lines is important to the long term economic health of the Union Pacific Railroad. Traffic studies have
also identified the need for railroad grade separations at Garces Highway, 11thAvenue, and/or Cecil
Avenue.
Bicycle and Pedestrian Issues
A lack of a comprehensive bicycle plan is typical of a community the size of Delano. As Delano has
grown, the need for formal bicycle routes has arisen. Although bicycle traffic comprises a small
percentage of the overall traffic in the City, it is anticipated that bicycle travel will grow as population
and employment increase in Delano. Bicycle routes could encourage people to use this alternative
form of transportation and provide recreation for citizens in the Community.
Some areas in Delano lack adequate pedestrian facilities. There are numerous curb returns in the older
sections of the City that are not handicapped curb returns. In addition, sidewalks are missing in some
areas and sidewalk replacement is needed in other areas.
Truck Route Issues
Trucking will continue to be the major mode for the movement of goods into and out of Delano. With
the continued urbanization of the area, the shipment of agricultural products will be augmented by the
ever increasing amounts of consumer goods. Major employers in the Delano area are located
throughout the community and not concentrated in a specific area. However, increased trucking
activity near the airport’s industrial area will continue to impact the existing roadway system.
Transportation System Management Issues
The use of transportation system management strategies is becoming more applicable in the cities in
the Central Valley. As cities continue to grow, the development of a wide range of strategies will be
seen. These strategies can be used not only to relieve congestion, but can be expected to assist in the
improvement of mobile source emissions. The application of existing strategies and the innovation of
new strategies will continue over the years to come. These management techniques will be essential to
facilitate continued development in the region. The implementation of new strategies, including the
use of lane restriping and traffic signal timing changes, would enhance the existing transportation
system management strategies already in place. Furthermore, the City has provided adequate parking
facilities in the downtown area not only for existing demand, but also to accommodate future
expansion and growth.
Goods Movement Issues
The efficient movement of goods and services will continue to be a primary issue for the circulation
system. As Delano's population grows, delivery truck traffic can be expected to increase, which will
place an added burden on the community's system. The location of major distribution or
manufacturing plants in the community will increase the regional and statewide shipping of goods into
City of Delano                                                                              December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                    3-34

and out of the area. The Delano Municipal Airport and the Union Pacific Railroad also provide a
transportation source for movement of goods throughout the region, state, and nation. The City will
most likely experience an increase in airplane and rail activity commensurate with growth and
expansion of the community.
3.5     CIRCULATION POLICIES
ESTABLISH A SAFE AND EFFICIENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES
ADEQUATE ACCESS THROUGHOUT THE CITY
Objectives
A.      Achieve and maintain Level of Service “C” all intersection throughout the City, with the
        exception of freeway interchanges and high volume intersections where the City’s objective is
        to achieve and maintain Level of Service “D”.
ROADWAY CLASSIFICATION, STANDARDS
Objectives
A.      Develop a circulation network of local roads, collectors, arterials and major arterials that will
        meet projected traffic needs.
Policies, Standards
1.      All street and roadway improvements shall be consistent with the Circulation Element of the
        General Plan.
2.      The Circulation Element shall determine the function of major streets. The City’s functional
        street classification system shall include major arterials, arterials, collectors, minor collectors
        and local streets.
3.      Designate streets according to the following functional classifications:
        a.       Arterials serve as the principal network for cross-town traffic flow. They connect areas
                 of major traffic generation within the urban areas and connect with important county
                 roads and state highways. They also provide for the distribution and collection of
                 through traffic to and from collector and local streets serving residential, commercial,
                 and industrial areas.
        b.       Collector streets provide for traffic movement between arterial and local streets, traffic
                 movement within and between neighborhoods and major activity centers, and limited
                 direct access to abutting properties.
City of Delano                                                                             December 2005

        c.       Local streets provide for direct access to abutting properties and for very localized
                 traffic movements within residential, commercial and industrial areas.
4.      Apply consistent standards for new street development, based on traffic carrying capacity and
        classification.
5.      Work with Caltrans to eliminate the existing hook ramps between Garces and Cecil, replacing
        them with “slip ramps onto one-way frontage roads along either side of the freeway. Modify
        the existing frontage roads along State Route 99 to function as one-way streets between Garces
        and Cecil.
6.      Arterial, collector and local street standards shall be developed which provide adequate
        capacity for their appropriate function, and these shall be incorporated into the Subdivision
        Standards for the City of Delano.
7.      Actual design and improvement to ultimate standards shall be achieved through inclusion of
        facilities as part of the City-wide Capital Improvements Program, or by new developers as
        areas adjoining the designated circulation system are developed, with allowance for bicycle
        lanes, in locations adopted by the City Council.
8.      The design of arterials, collectors, local collectors, and local streets shall comply with the
        Subdivision Standards for the City of Delano, as amended.
9.      Standards for new street development can be altered or refined through the specific plan or
        planned unit development process when it can be demonstrated that projected traffic flows can
        be accommodated.
10.     New street developments in areas of urban expansion should not be limited to a “grid system.”
        More efficient and varied street layouts should be encouraged, wherever possible.
11.     New arterial and collector streets shall be designed to operate at Level of Service “C” level or
        better for a period of at least 20 years following their construction, wherever feasible. Freeway
        interchanges and high volume intersections where it is not feasible to achieve and maintain
        LOS “C” shall be designed to achieve and maintain LOS “D” for a period of at least 20 years
        following their construction,.
12.     The right-of-way widths and construction widths of all classes of streets from local to arterial
        shall be updated as necessary to reflect the street classifications in the Circulation Element.
13.     Right-of-way essential to the circulation system should be dedicated and/or developed to the
        appropriate extent and width when a zone change to a greater density, division of property or
        development occurs.
14.     City circulation system street alignments shall be coordinated with the County of Kern and
        County of Tulare circulation system street alignments.
City of Delano                                                                            December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                  3-36

15.     Work with Kern and Tulare counties should incorporate Delano's Circulation Element into
        their Countywide General Plans.
16.     All land development proposals shall be reviewed to assure consistency with this Circulation
        Element.
Arterials
17.     The following streets are proposed to be arterial streets within Delano's urban area:
                      East-West Arterials                     North-South Arterials
                       County Line Road                          Wasco-Pond Road
                          Cecil Avenue                             Casey Avenue
             Garces Highway (SR 155 E of SR 99)                     Melcher Road
                       Woollomes Avenue                   Albany Street/Stradley Avenue
                          Schuster Road                            Garzoli Avenue
                           Pond Road                                High Street
                                                                   Browning Road
        These major arterials shall be developed with a minimum right-of-way of 110 feet, to include
        four travel lanes, parking, and a two-way left center turn lane or median. Where the Public
        Works director determines that a 110-foot right-of-way is not required to meet applicable level
        of service standards, arterials may be developed within a 90-foot right-of-way, eliminating
        either the center median or on-street parking, as determined appropriate by the Public Works
        Director.
18.     The primary purpose of arterials is to carry traffic. Parking should be discouraged on such
        streets and eliminated where it now exists, along existing arterials as traffic safety conditions
        warrant.
19.     Arterials shall be built in areas where traffic demand warrants the development of this facility
        to meet the adopted level of service standard.
20.     Arterial streets shall be built at a typical separation of one mile.
Collectors
21.     The following streets are proposed to be collectors within Delano’s Urban Area:

        and to major activity centers and should be provided with adequate separation.
Collector Street Standards
35.     Adequate separation of driveway access to major activity centers should be maintained. If
        driveways must be provided near intersections for facilities (such as service stations) these
        driveways shall not be serviced by median breaks.
36.     Adequate spacing between driveways and intersecting local streets should be maintained from
        the curb return to the nearest edge of the driveway. Where spacing pursuant to City standards
        is not practical, the development shall provide acceptable traffic mitigation measures in
        addition to those already required.
37.     Driveways to residential property along collectors should be consolidated whenever possible.
38.     Medians on collectors shall be provided by concrete where left turn control is needed and by

OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION ELEMENT
4.1      INTRODUCTION
The City of Delano is currently in a transitional stage of growth from a small, semi-rural town to a
medium-sized urbanized community. The City of Delano and its planning area have a number of
valuable resources, including those of biological and cultural significance. Delano’s unique
environment affords the city the opportunity to encourage development while at the same time
promoting the wise management of resources and open space for the benefit of the citizens of the
community.
The Open Space and Conservation Element is intended to identify natural and man-made resources
within the city, as well as to aid in the development of policies and implementation programs that
will encourage the conservation, protection, and proper management of these resources. By
identifying and encouraging the proper management of the community’s resources, the city can
assure their continual availability, appreciation, and enjoyment.
4.2      AUTHORIZATION
State legislation requires the inclusion of an Open Space Element (Government Code Section
65302(c)) and a Conservation Element (Government Code Section 65302(d)) in all local government
general plans.
State legislation (Government Code Section 65561) declares that the preservation of open space land
is necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of the state, but also for the assurance of
the continued availability of land for the production of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of scenic
beauty, for recreation, and for the use of natural resources. The legislation further mandates that
cities, as well as counties and the state, make definite plans for the preservation of valuable open-
space land and take positive action to carry out such plans by the adoption and strict administration
of laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
Land designated as open space may be utilized for the preservation of natural resources, including
plant and animal life, as well as waterways. The designation of open space is also required for the
managed production of resources including agricultural lands, areas required for recharge of

General Plan                                                                                      4-1

groundwater basins, and areas containing major mineral deposits. Open space may also be used for
outdoor recreation. Open space for public health and safety purposes may include areas which
require special management or regulation because of hazardous or special conditions such as
earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, floodplains, watersheds, and areas required for the
protection o water and air quality.
State legislation requires a Conservation Element for the conservation, development, and utilization
of natural resources. Significant resources may include waterways, agricultural soils, wildlife,
minerals, energy and air resources, cultural resources, and other natural assets. The Conservation
Element may further cover the prevention, control, and correction of soil erosion, the prevention and
conservation of watersheds, and flood control conservation methods to protect land in stream
channel areas.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
4.3     EARTH
4.3.1 Project Location and Description
The City of Delano is located within the northwestern portion of Kern County, thirty-two miles
north of Bakersfield, and 70 miles South of Fresno, California. The City is located in the southern
portion of California’s agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley, ten miles from the western foothills of
the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range and approximately twenty-five miles from the Coast Range to
the west. The natural resources and gentle topography of Delano has made it hospitable to
agriculture.
The City has surrounded by productive farmland and is known for production of table grapes,
almonds, and citrus. The Southern Sierra Nevada Mountain range is situated approximately 25
nautical air miles to the east. Recreational areas located nearby include Lake Isabella and the
Sequoia National Park and Forest.
4.3.2 Topography
Delano is situated in the San Joaquin Valley. The topography of this portion of Kern County is
typical of the relatively flat gradient encountered throughout the San Joaquin Valley, with uniform
east to west trending slopes of about three to ten feet per mile. The average elevation of Delano is
300-325 feet above sea level.
City of Delano                                                                       December 2005
General Plan                                                                                       4-2

4.3.3 Geology
Setting and History - The San Joaquin Valley is a structural trough, whose main axis trends
northwest-southeast. The San Joaquin Valley is bordered on the east by the granitic complex of the
Sierra Nevada and on the west by the folded and faulted sedimentary, volcanic, and metamorphic
rocks of the Coast Range. The relatively flat floor of the San Joaquin Valley overlies thousands of
feet of alluvial, lacustrine and marine deposits that have accumulated in the valley as the trough has
been lowered and the adjacent mountains have been elevated.
Throughout Late Cretaceous and much of Tertiary time, the San Joaquin Valley was the site of
marine deposition, and thousands of feet of shallow-water marine sediments were deposited in this
geosyncline. Presently overlying these marine sedimentary deposits are continental deposits of late
Tertiary and Quaternary age. In aggregate, these marine and continental deposits form an immense
wedge, which thickens from east to west and from north to south. The continental deposits have
been tilted to the west and down warped, and their base is now several hundred to many thousand
feet below sea level.
The low alluvial plains and fans in the Valley floor are relatively flat and featureless, occupying
most of the floor’s area. The extensive fans along the eastern margin of the Valley contain high
proportions of well-sorted gravel and sand, while the interstream areas between the fans are
underlain by poorly sorted, fine-grained fluvial sediment deposited by intermittent streams.
4.3.4 Earthquakes and Related Effects
Although no faults have been mapped immediately near Delano, several major faults can be found in
Kern County. These include the San Andreas Fault, the Garlock Fault, the Sierra Nevada Fault and
the Kern Canyon Fault. Most of the earthquake epicenters and faults are located in eastern and
southwestern Kern County. The City’s mild topography and low elevation negate threats of
landslides, liquefaction, settlement or other seismically-related hazards. Numerous canals, levees
and other earthen water containment structures within and near the City pose potential flooding
hazards to property and residents of Delano. This is discussed in greater detail in the Hydrological
Conditions Section.
4.3.5 Soils
Agricultural soil capacity is classified according to a number of criteria including prime farmland,
farmland of statewide importance and unique farmlands. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil
Conservation Service defines these farmlands as:
         Prime farmland is land best suited for producing seed, feed, forage, fiber, and
         oilseed crops and also available for these uses (the land could be cropland, pasture
         land, rangeland, forest land or other land but not urban built-up land or water). It has
         the soil quality, growing season and moisture supply needed to produce sustained
         high yields of crops economically when treated and managed, including water
         management, according to modern farming methods.

General Plan                                                                                      4-3

        Farmland of statewide importance is land other than prime farmland that has a
        good combination of physical and chemical characteristics for production of food,
        feed, forage, fiber and oilseed crops available for these uses (the land could be
        cropland, pasture range land forest land or other land, but not urban built-up land or
        water).
        Unique farmland is land other than prime and farmlands of statewide importance
        that is used for the production of specific high-value food and fiber crops. It has the
        special combination of soil quality, location, growing season and moisture supply
        needed to produce sustained high quality and/or high yields of a specific crop when
        treated and managed according to modern farming methods. Examples of such crops

As described by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, the soils of the Delano area fall primarily into
the associations shown on Table 4-1. Figure 4-1 shows the location of these soils in relationship to

4.4     CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY
4.4.1 Climate
The City of Delano is located within the northern portion of Kern County. Kern County is
characterized by a “Mediterranean” type climate; the winters are cool and moist and the summers are
dry and warm. Approximately 85% of the precipitation occurs during November to April.
Temperatures 24 hour average 86.5 degrees in summer and 45 degrees in winter. Rainfall averages
7.95 inches per year.
Kern County experiences foggy conditions during the winter. The formation of natural fog is caused
by local cooling of the atmosphere until it is saturated (dew point temperature). This type of fog,
known as “radiation fog” is more likely to occur inland. These fogs are more severe and persist
longer in the lower elevations of the Valley.
During the summer months, the Pacific high pressure cell is positioned over the ocean to the west of
the northern California coast. The clockwise flow of air around the high pressure cell results in
persistent northwest winds over most offshore areas. This northwesterly flow is enhanced by the
thermal trough through the interior valleys of California. The orientation of this trough and the
pressure gradient between coastal and inland stations determines the variability in the summer
weather pattern. Strong onshore pressure gradients occur with deep penetrations of marine air
through the Carquinez Strait area (the only sea level channel through the coast). Cooler
temperatures and stronger up-valley winds result from this distribution.
4.4.2 Air Quality Standards
Federal Regulations
The Clean Air Act of 1970 was the first major federal air quality regulation. Amended in 1977 and
1990, the Clean Air Act required the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for several pollutants. These standards are set
by law at levels that protect public health and welfare, with an adequate margin of safety. Areas
exceeding the federal standard more than two times per year are designated “nonattainment” areas
under the Clean Air Act, and as such are subject to more stringent planning and pollution control
requirements.
Under the 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act, nonattainment areas are divided into five
categories depending on future dates identified for meeting the standards. “Marginal” or “moderate”
violators only slightly exceed the NAAQS, whereas “serious,” “severe,” or “extreme” violators
exceed the standards by a much higher margin. Marginal areas are required to do little beyond what
they are already doing to attain clean air, but areas designated “moderate” through “extreme” must
adopt gradually tighter regulations. States with areas designated “moderate” or worse for ozone
nonattainment areas are required to show a three percent per year reduction in emissions of volatile
organic compounds.
City of Delano                                                                     December 2005
General Plan                                                                                    4-6

Areas close to meeting Carbon Monoxide (CO) standards are required to start a wintertime
oxygenated fuels program and to correct problems with existing vehicle inspection programs. Areas
with higher levels of CO must also start an enhanced vehicle inspection program, and those areas
with the highest CO levels must adopt transportation control measures.
The Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) requires an air quality control plan referred to as the State
Implementation Plan (SIP). The SIP contains the strategies and control measures California will use
to attain the NAAQS. The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require states containing
areas that violate the NAAQS to revise their SIPs to incorporate additional control measures to
reduce air pollution. The SIP is to be periodically modified to reflect the latest emissions
inventories, planning documents, rule and regulations of air basins as reported by the agencies with
jurisdiction over them. The EPA reviews SIPs to determine if they conform to the mandates of the
FCAA and will achieve air quality goals when implemented. If the EPA determines a SIP to be
inadequate, it may prepare a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the nonattainment area and may
impose additional control measures.
State Regulations
In 1988, the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) was passed. The act contains more stringent
guidelines for the attainment of air quality goals than the FCAA. The California Air Resource Board
(ARB) is the agency responsible for coordination and oversight of state and local air pollution
control programs in California and for implementing the CCAA. The CCAA classifies
nonattainment areas as moderate, serious, severe, and extreme based on severity of violation of state
ambient air quality standards as follows:
Ozone Nonattainment Classifications
       Moderate               0.09 to 0.12 ppm
       Serious                0.13 to 0.15 ppm
       Severe                 0.16 to 0.20 ppm
       Extreme                Greater than 0.20 ppm
Carbon Monoxide Nonattainment Classifications
       Moderate               9.0 to 12.7 ppm
       Serious                Greater than 12.7 ppm
Both the State of California and the federal government have established a variety of ambient air
quality standards. The state 1-hour ozone standard is 0.09 ppm (parts per million, by volume), not to
be equaled or exceeded. The federal 1-hour ozone standard is 0.12 ppm, not to be exceeded more
than 3 times in any 3-year period. The air basin is also a non-attainment area for PM10.

San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District
The City of Delano lies within the Kern County portion of the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin
(SJVAB). The San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) was
organized in 1991 by a Joint Powers Agreement of eight Valley counties, is the local lead agency for
formulating Federal and State Air Quality plans, promulgating rules that affect a variety of air
pollution sources, and reviewing local governments’ land use plans and development proposals in
order to estimate projected air quality impacts and suggest methods for reducing those impacts.
The San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District has jurisdiction over air quality
matters in the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin. Its headquarters are located in Fresno with regional
offices located in Bakersfield and Modesto.
The SJVUAPCD has adopted two attainment plans in an attempt to achieve state and federal air
quality standards: the 1991 California Clean Air Act Quality Attainment Plan (AQAP) for ozone and
carbon monoxide and the PM10 Nonattainment Area Plan. These documents provide the framework
for air quality planning in the Valley and lay out the District’s strategy to reduce emissions of
nonattainment pollutants. In August 1992, the ARB reviewed and approved several portions of the
1991 AQAP. The Air Resources Board (ARB) postponed a decision on the Plan’s ozone strategies
until more information could be collected. The District was re-designated as a serious nonattainment
area for PM10 by the EPA. The District approved and submitted a Serious Area PM10 Nonattainment
Plan in September 1994.
4.4.3 Air Quality Monitoring Data
Air quality in the project area is best represented by air monitoring data collected by the State of
California Air Resources Board at the Visalia air monitoring station. Based on air quality data for
1996, PM10 pollutants exceeded state standards twenty-five out of sixty-one days and federal
standards were not exceeded out of sixty-one days. Ozone pollutants exceeded federal standards
four days and state standards fifty-three days in 1996. No standard violations were observed for
sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, or nitrogen dioxide. The pollutants, which have exceeded state or
federal standards in the Kern County area, are provided below:
Ozone (O3)
Ozone is highly reactive secondary gas pollutant, which is toxic, colorless and has a pungent odor.
Ozone is photochemically produced through complex chemical reactions of certain hydrocarbons
and oxides of nitrogen (primary pollutants) in the presence of sunlight and temperatures above 59°F.
 In high concentrations, ozone and other photochemical oxidants are directly detrimental to humans
causing respiratory irritation and possible alterations in the functioning of the lungs and inhibits
vegetation growth.
City of Delano                                                                      December 2005
General Plan                                                                                     4-8

Ozone is a regional air pollutant. It is generated over a large area and is transported and spread by
wind. The worst ozone concentrations tend to be found downwind from emission sources in Valley
metropolitan areas. Ozone has been the San Joaquin Valley’s most obstinate air quality problem.
Particulate Matter (PM10)
PM10 refers to particulate matter equal to or less than 10 microns in diameter. This material, as
opposed to dust, cannot be adequately filtered by the human respiratory system. Inhaled
atmospheric particulates can, therefore, be harmful to humans by directly causing injuries to the
respiratory tract and lungs or by the reactive gases which were absorbed by the inhaled particulates.
Suspended particulates scatter and absorb sunlight, producing haze and reducing visibility. In areas
close to major sources including industrial and agriculture operations, PM10 is generally higher in
the winter when more fuel is burned and meteorological conditions favor buildup of directly emitted
contaminants.
The actual composition of PM10 varies greatly with time and location. It depends on the sources of
the material and meteorological conditions. Primary man-made sources of PM10 in the San Joaquin
Valley are agricultural operations, agricultural burning, demolition and construction activities,
entrainment of dust by motor vehicles on paved and unpaved roads, and residential wood burning.
Wind erosion of agricultural land also represents a significant source of air borne dust in the Valley.
4.5      HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS
4.5.1 Surface Waters
Delano does not have any actual surface water that runs through it. There are irrigation canals that
traverse peripheral properties. Lake Woollomes, located southwesterly of the community is a
storage facility for the Friant-Kern Canal.
In 1982, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) prepared a Flood Insurance Study
that investigated the existence and severity of flood hazards in the City of Delano. The hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses for this study were performed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This
initial work, which was completed in December of 1980, covered all significant flooding sources
affecting Delano.
The FEMA study used the national standard of the 100-year flood as the base flood-line for purposes
of flood plain management measures. For those areas subject to shallow flooding and deep ponding,
boundaries of the 100-year flood were delineated using the appropriate elevations, depths and
topographic maps at a scale of 1:24,000, with a contour interval of five feet. Flood boundaries are
indicated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). On this map, the 100-year flood boundary
corresponds to the boundary of the areas of special flood hazards; and the 500-year flood boundary
corresponds to the boundary of the areas of moderate flood hazards. Figure 4-2 is a flood map of the
Delano Area. The FEMA Flood Study depicted areas within the City limits which are classified as
Flood Hazard Zone “A”. The airport is in one such area.

4.5.2 Ground Water
The primary source of domestic water for the City of Delano is groundwater. In general the
groundwater quality of the City is relatively high. Production is generally low east of the
community based on recent test wells east of Browning Road. Two existing wells and new well
sites in the City will require treatment to remove DBCP, most likely using carbon filters. Other than
this contaminant, the City’s groundwater supply is suitable for domestic purposes without treatment.
Prior to agricultural and urban development, groundwater moved from areas of recharge along the
eastern rim of the Valley to areas of discharge along the Valley axis. Recharge was primarily by
seepage from stream flows. Under present conditions, groundwater is recharged primarily from
stream flow percolation, from percolation basins developed by agricultural irrigation districts, by
percolation from treated wastewater disposal facilities and from percolation attributed to excess
applied surface irrigation water. Data from the regional map produced by the State of California,
Department of Water Resources (DWR), San Joaquin District, entitled Lines of Equal Depth to
Water in Wells, San Joaquin Valley, depicts groundwater flowing toward the southwest.
4.6      BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
4.6.1 Plant Communities
Historically, the natural vegetation of the Delano area was characterized by vast stretches of
savanna, Valley Needlegrass Grassland, Valley Sacaton Grassland, and Non-native Grassland
natural vegetation communities. The range of these natural vegetation communities has been
significantly reduced from historic levels as a result of conversion of these lands to urban and
agricultural uses. The only remnants of these natural communities presently remain in the Central
Valley. The following natural community classifications are from Preliminary Descriptions of the
Terrestrial Natural Communities of California (Holland 1986). Descriptions are incorporated by
reference from Crampton (1974), Holland (1986), and Barbour and Major (1988).
         Valley Needlegrass Grassland is characterized by the presence of tussock-forming
         perennial purple stipa (Stipa pulchra) and nodding stipa (S. cernua). These native
         bunchgrasses are often surrounded by native and introduced annuals, which often
         exceed the bunchgrasses in cover. Aggressive, well adapted European annuals,
         introduced by 18th Century Spanish soldiers and missionary fathers, have largely
         replaced native perennial in California. Valley Needlegrass Grassland is often
         associated with Oak Woodlands on moister, well drained soils. Formerly extensive
         around the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Salinas Valleys, as well as the Los Angeles
         Basin, perennial grasslands are now reduced to scattered remnants in the foothills of
         the Central Valley and the hills along the coast in central and southern California.
          Valley Sacaton Grassland is characterized by the presence of tussock-forming
         perennial grasses alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides) and saltgrass (Distichlis
         spicata). Valley Sacaton Grassland flourished on the alkaline flats of the Central
         Valley. Some annuals also grow on the alkali, namely alkali barley (Hordeum
City of Delano                                                                      December 2005
General Plan                                                                                     4-11

         depressum) and California alkali grass (Puccinellia simplex). Formerly extensive in
         the Tulare Lake Basin and along the San Joaquin Valley trough north to Stanislaus
         and Contra Costa Counties, Valley Sacaton Grassland is now much reduced.
         Non-native Grassland is characterized by the presence of introduced grass species
         that may be interspersed with native forbs and shrubs. Typical species found in this
         natural community are wild oats (Avena fatua), slender wild oats (Avena barbata),
         the filarees (Erodium cicutarium and E. botrys), soft chess (Bromus mollis), ripgut
         brome (Bromus rigidus), red brome (Bromus rubens), and rye grass (Lolium
         multiflorum). This grassland community is often associated with numerous species
         of showy-flowered, native annual forbs ("wildflowers"), especially in years of
         favorable rainfall. Non-native grassland is found in the valleys and foothills of most
         of California, except for the north coastal and desert regions. Non-native Grassland
         formerly occupied large portions of the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Salinas
         Valleys, as well as the Los Angeles Basin, areas that are now agricultural and urban.
Plant species represented in the general vicinity are indicated in Table 4-2. Sensitive plant species
have been recorded and include the California Jewel Flower and the Valley Saltbush Scrub
community.
4.6.2 Agricultural Communities
The agricultural community surrounding the City of Delano consists of both large and small farms.
Crops typically grown in the area generally include grapes, plums, citrus, stone fruit, almonds, and
alfalfa.
Although not prime habitat, croplands in the area can provide a source of food, water, and shelter to
both native and introduced wildlife species. The lack of hedgerows, shelter-belts, wind breaks, and
natural vegetation buffers severely limits the habitat value of these man-made environs. In addition,
agricultural practices such as herbicide and pesticide application, monocultural cropping, and
intensive tillage further reduces the habitat value of these lands.
4.6.3 Sensitive Species
The above listed vegetation associations support a variety of wildlife, plant species and subspecies
indigenous to California. The conversion of native and naturalized plant communities to urban land
uses, agriculture, and industrial facilities has significantly reduced available wildlife habitat. As a
result of this conversion, several species of both plants and animals have been extirpated from
California, or their populations have declined significantly. As a result, the California Department
of Fish and Game (CDFG) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) have listed
some species as threatened or endangered. In addition, several species, which are currently
considered candidates for State or federal listing, have been included.

4.7       CULTURAL RESOURCES
A cultural resources records search was conducted for this project utilizing the database of the Southern
San Joaquin Valley Information Center, California State University, Bakersfield. The results of the
search indicated there was one recorded archaeological site in the vicinity (CA –Ker – 2989H), the
abandoned “domestic refuse” site in southwestern Delano. Artifacts have also been discovered during
airport construction. The “Weaver House” located at 330 Lexington has potential eligibility for the
National Register of Historic Places. A mortuary designed in 1962 by Frank Lloyd Wright for Cecil and
Betty LaCourse has been identified near Browning and 9th.
4.8       LIGHT AND GLARE
Generally, concerns over light and glare relate to the aesthetics of an area when a new light source is
introduced in a relatively undeveloped or rural area. In other instances, new light sources can become a
nuisance to adjacent land uses and possibly cause a hazardous condition for traffic. Delano is a small
rural community limited to primarily one- and two-story structures in commercial and residential
neighborhoods. Current sources of illumination in the community consist of street lamps, minor
identification signage and other lighting associated with existing development. There are no existing
glare impacts (i.e. buildings constructed of highly reflective materials) occurring within the Delano Area.

Development and growth in the City of Delano has resulted in increased night lighting in the region.
Much of this development has occurred in the southwest and southeast quadrants of the City.
4.9      PUBLIC SAFETY
4.9.1 Risk of Upset
Seismic Hazards - The most serious direct earthquake hazard is the damage or collapse of buildings
and other structures by ground shaking. Ground shaking is the vibration which radiates from the
epicenter of an earthquake. Damage to structures from ground shaking is caused by the transmission
of earthquake vibrations from the ground into the structure. The intensity of the vibration or shaking
and its potential impact on building and other urban development is determined by several factors:
        The nature of the underlying materials, including rock and soil;
        The structural characteristics of a building;
        The quality of workmanship and materials used in its construction;
        The location of the epicenter and the magnitude of the earthquake; and
        The duration and character of the ground motion.
Older buildings constructed before building codes were in effect, and even newer buildings
constructed before earthquake resistance provisions were included in building codes, are the most
likely to suffer damage in an earthquake. Most of Delano’s buildings are one or two stories high and
are of wood frame construction, which is considered the most structurally resistant to earthquake
damage.
Older masonry buildings without earthquake-resistant reinforcement are the most susceptible to the
sort of structural failure, which causes the greatest loss of lives. The susceptibility of a structure to
damage from earthquake ground shaking is also related to the foundation material underlying the
structure. A foundation of rock or very firm material intensifies short period motions, which affect
low-ridged building more that tall, flexible ones. A deep layer of logged soft alluvium may cushion
low ridged buildings, but accentuate the motion in tall buildings. The amplified motion resulting
from softer alluvium soils can also severely damage older masonry buildings. Some unreinforced
masonry buildings are located in downtown Delano. No assessment of these buildings has been
made.
Other potentially dangerous conditions include building projections, which are not firmly anchored,
such as parapets and cornices. These projections could collapse during periods of strong and/or
sustained ground shaking.

General Plan Update                                                                                 4-16

Fire is often a major form of damage resulting from ground shaking effects. Most earthquake-
induced fires start because of ruptured gas lines, damage to wood, gas or electric stoves and damage
to other gas or electric equipment.
Flooding Hazards - Flood hazards are addressed in the Safety Element.
Fire Hazards - Both structural and wildland fire hazards threaten life and property within the
Delano vicinity. Wildland fires resulting from both man-made and natural causes occur in brush, or
grasslands, primarily in sparsely developed or existing open space lands. Structures and urban
development may also be threatened or destroyed in the area of wildland fires. Structural fires
usually result from man-made causes and threaten industrial, residential and commercial structures,
especially those built before building and fire codes were established. These substandard structures
represent the highest potential for injury, death, or loss of property.
4.10    AGRICULTURE
Objectives
A.      To preserve prime farmland and farmland of statewide importance until logical and timely
        urban growth is appropriate.
B.      To provide a “greenbelt” around the City’s perimeter to maintain the physical separation
        between the City and nearby communities and to maintain the scenic beauty surrounding the
        City.
C.      To establish logical growth patterns as a means of protecting agriculture.
Policies, Standards
1.      Assure the continuation of agricultural production as an important economic activity by
        establishing areas to be designated and maintained as part of the City’s greenbelt.
2.      New residential development shall be encouraged as infill parcels and within areas adjacent
        or in close proximity to existing development where infrastructure and services can be easily
        extended. This measure is intended to reduce the unnecessary removal of finite natural
        resources, such as prime soil, to reduce the cost of community services provided to residents,
        and to eliminate “leap frog” development.
3.      Extension of urban improvements and services, including water, sewer lines and storm drain
        facilities, into agricultural areas shall be managed as a means to direct the location and
        timing of new urban development.
4.      The City shall give preference to new development projects that are proposed for non-prime
        agricultural soils.

5.      To protect human health from potential impacts due to agricultural spraying, dust, and traffic
        congestion, the City will encourage lower density developments adjacent to land planned for
        long-term agricultural uses.
6.      Maintain an appropriate minimum parcel size for agricultural and urban reserve designated
        parcels to encourage viable agricultural operation and to prevent parcelization into rural
        residential or “ranchette” developments.
7.      Increase residential densities on infill parcels by encouraging the development of PUD's.
4.11    NATURAL RESOURCES
Objectives
A.      To protect natural resources including groundwater, soils, and air quality, to meet the needs
        of present and future generations.
B.      Ensure that environmental hazards including potential flooding and impacts from
        agricultural practices are adequately addressed in the development process within the City.
Policies, Standards
1.      Protect areas of natural groundwater recharge from land uses and disposal methods, which
        would degrade groundwater quality. Promote activities, which combine stormwater control,
        and water recharges.
2.      Expand programs that enhance groundwater recharge in order to maintain the groundwater
        supply, including the installation of detention ponds in new growth areas.
3.      No urban level development shall be approved in the City unless the development is, or can
        be served by the City sewer system.
4.      Water conservation methods shall be continued.
5.      To assist the City in meeting the clean air quality requirements of the federal and state Clean
        Air Acts, the City will provide community planning guidance to help reduce potential air
        quality impacts.
6.      Promote biological diversity and the use of plant species compatible with the bio-region.
7.      If street trees are removed, they shall be replaced with tree species specified on the City’s
        Street Tree Master Plan.

HOUSING ELEMENT
5.1     INTRODUCTION
5.1.1 Regional Location
The City of Delano (population 39,489) is located in the southern portion of San Joaquin Valley, in
the northern part of Kern County just south of Tulare County. Delano is within a short driving
distance of several metropolitan areas. To the north are the Cities of Fresno (75 miles), Sacramento
(240 miles), and San Francisco (250 miles). To the south are the Cities of Bakersfield (30 miles) and
Los Angeles (140 miles).
Agricultural fields and open space, a typical characteristic of towns in the San Joaquin Valley,
physically separate Delano from these neighboring communities. Irrigated agriculture, the signature
characteristic of the valley, is found throughout the valley on its highly fertile alluvial soils.
5.1.2 Background and Purpose of the Element
Many Californians with average or less than average incomes find it difficult to secure adequate
housing they can afford. Since the early 1980s, the problem of finding adequate housing for lower-
income groups has been compounded by high housing costs, lack of readily developable land in
many communities, and the decreased ability of the State and Federal governments to fund housing
programs.
Although general plan housing elements were mandated by State legislation enacted in 1967, the
State undertook a major revision of housing element law in response to rapidly increasing housing
prices. As a result, each city and county must analyze local housing needs, and provide a realistic set
of programs to meet those needs. The State housing policy that sets forth this requirement includes
the following:
    a.    “…The availability of housing is of vital Statewide importance, and the early
          attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every California
          family is a priority of the highest order.” (Section 65580, State of California
          Government Code.)
    b.    “… The early attainment of this goal requires cooperative participation of government
          and private sectors in an effort to expand housing opportunities and to accommodate
          the housing needs of Californians of all economic levels.” (Ibid.)
City of Delano                                                                         December 2005
General Plan                                                                                       5-1

    c. “... Local and State governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them to facilitate the
    improvement and development of housing to make adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic
    segments of the community.” (Ibid.)
    d.         “... in carrying out this responsibility, each local government also has the responsibility
               to consider economic, environmental, and fiscal factors and community goals set forth in
               the General Plan and to cooperate with other local governments and the State in
               addressing regional housing.” (Ibid.)
The City of Delano is therefore required to:
•   Identify and analyze the current and projected housing needs of “all economic segments of the
    community;”
•   Evaluate current and potential constraints to meeting those needs, due both to marketplace and
    government operations;
•   Assess the availability of land suitable for residential use and opportunities for energy
    conservation in residential development;
•   Set forth objectives, policies, and programs that set forth a 5-year schedule of actions to meet
    identified housing needs,1 and to remove governmental and non-governmental constraints on the
    production of housing, the administration of land use and development controls, provision of
    regulatory concessions and incentives, and the utilization of appropriate federal and State
    financing and subsidy programs and, when available, funds in a low and moderate income
    housing fund of a redevelopment agency; and
•   Address needs for emergency shelter for the homeless.
5.1.3 Citizen Participation
The legislature requires that local housing elements be prepared with the participation of all
economic segments of the community. The preparation of the Housing Element included the
following citizen participation activities:
1. A workshop with local affordable housing providers and housing/ farm worker interests with
    a Spanish/English interpreter provided;
2. Public notices and announcements in both English and Spanish; and
3. Public hearings, including the Planning Commission and City Council.
To ensure that all economic segments of the community, including lower income individuals and
organizations, would be involved in the development of the Housing Element, the City of Delano
1
    “Identified housing needs” includes production of new housing to meet the needs of new households of all economic segments of
    the community, conservation of existing sound housing, improvement of existing substandard housing, protection of existing
    housing affordability, promotion of equal housing opportunities, and meeting the needs of identified “Special needs” groups
    (e.g., elderly, homeless, large families, farm workerfarm workers, one parent households, handicapped). The needs of the
    homeless are also required to be addressed in municipal housing elements.

encouraged the following organizations to attend the community workshop by inviting these groups
directly. Additionally, notices of these public workshops were posted in both English and Spanish at
the senior and recreation centers, library, City Hall, and throughout the community in public places.

organizations.
5.1.4 Definitions
Several terms are used throughout the Housing Element that have particular meanings under
California law. The following presents definitions of key terms to facilitate understanding of the
Housing Element. Words appearing in italics in a definition are defined elsewhere in this section.
Existing (Housing) Need         The unmet potential demand for affordable housing in a community;
                                assumed to be the number of very low- and low- income households
                                that are overpaying for housing (spending more than 30 percent of
                                their gross income on housing costs).
Family                          A household consisting of two or more persons who are related by
                                blood or marriage or who constitute a single bona fide housekeeping
                                unit.
Future (Housing) Need           New construction needed to provide housing for all income groups
                                that will accommodate new households (growth), replace housing
                                inventory lost to demolition or other causes, and achieve a vacancy
                                rate that will allow the housing market to operate efficiently and
                                provide mobility opportunities.
Goal                            A statement describing the desired condition that should exist in the
                                housing environment. A goal is typically not stated in quantitative
                                terms, in contrast to an objective.
Household                       All the persons who occupy a single dwelling unit, such as a detached
                                house, townhouse, or apartment. A household may consist of one
                                person, unrelated individuals, or a family.

Housing Production Needs See existing need and future need.
Objective                      The numerical target for some measurable outcome to be achieved by
                               the end of the planning period (2005). Objectives must be stated for
                               the rehabilitation, conservation, and development of housing.
Overcrowding                   A household living in a housing unit that lacks sufficient space to
                               meet basic needs of daily living. It is measured by the ratio of
                               persons to rooms in a housing unit (excluding bathrooms, kitchens,
                               and halls). A unit is considered overcrowded if the number of
                               persons exceeds the number of rooms.
Overpayment                    A household that is paying more for housing than it can reasonably
                               afford, given other life necessities such as food, transportation, health
                               care, and child care. The rate of overpayment is measured by the
                               proportion of households spending more than 30 percent of their
                               gross income on housing costs. The problem of overpayment by very
                               low- and low- income is often cited as an indicator of housing
                               assistance needs.
Policy                         A broad statement, consistent with a goal, that guides and shapes
                               actions in order to achieve an objective under that goal.
5.1.5 Consistency with Other General Plan Elements
The proposed goals and policies of the Housing Element have been reviewed for consistency with
the other elements of the updated General Plan. As a result, the Housing Element is internally
consistent with the balance of the General Plan.
5.1.6 Format of the Housing Element
The Delano Housing Element is organized into four chapters in addition to this introductory chapter
and the Executive Summary.
Section 5.2 includes a discussion of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the previously prepared
Housing Element (adopted by the City Council in 1992), and the City’s progress in implementing the
goals and policies of the previous Element.
Section 5.3 provides a detailed analysis of housing needs, resources, and constraints in the City of
Delano. Included in this analysis is an inventory of population, households, and housing
characteristics, including an evaluation of housing affordability.
Section 5.4 sets forth an analysis of housing opportunities and constraints. The discussion of
housing opportunities focuses on an evaluation of land available for the development of new housing
within Delano. The discussion of housing constraints addresses those factors that serve as barriers to
the construction of affordable housing. These include both governmental and market constraints to
the production of housing.

Section 5.5 presents housing goals, policies, and action programs to address the housing needs of
existing and future residents of the City. While goal and policy statements are general in nature, the
housing programs are specific actions necessary to achieve the goals and policy statements adopted
in principle. The City’s quantified objectives for construction, rehabilitation, and preservation
follow the discussion of housing actions.
5.2     PROGRESS REPORT
5.2.1 Introduction
Section 65588(a) of the Government Code requires that each city shall review its housing element as
frequently as necessary to evaluate all of the following:
(1) The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to the attainment of
    the State housing goal.
(2) The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community’s housing goals and
    objectives.
(3) The progress of the city in implementation of the Housing Element.
The City of Delano’s existing Housing Element was adopted in January 1992. Because of revisions
to State law, a new update of the Housing Element was not required until 2002. The purpose of this
Chapter is to evaluate the effectiveness of Delano’s Housing Element, the progress in the
implementation of the existing Housing Element, and the appropriateness of existing Housing
Element goals, objectives, policies, and programs.
5.2.2 Appropriateness and Effectiveness of the Existing Housing Element’sGoals,
        Objectives, Policies, and Implementation Programs
This section evaluates the effectiveness of the goals, objectives, policies, and actions of the 1992
Housing Element. There were many factors that affected the City’s ability to meet the goals and
objectives it established in 1992, including the effects of an ongoing recession, the availability of
State and Federal funding, and staffing needs. Since the adoption of the 1992 Housing Element,
several programs and projects have been completed. Between 1992 and 2002, 2,467 dwelling units
were issued permits for construction within the City.
The following provides a review of each action program defined in the 1992 Housing Element. The
review summarizes the success or failure of each program. If a program was unsuccessful, a
summary of the reasons has been provided.
a.      Programs To Conserve And Improve Existing Housing
Code Enforcement. The existing Housing Element sets forth a code enforcement program to ensure
the health and safety of the City’s residents. No quantified objective was adopted. Since adoption of
this program, the City of Delano has hired a new Code Enforcement Officer to aggressively identify
and respond to complaints about substandard housing conditions. Violations are promptly identified
City of Delano                                                                             December 2005
General Plan                                                                                            5-5

and action initiated to require property owners to correct the situation prior to issuing citations into
court.
        Recommendation. Continue the existing code enforcement program.
Neighborhood “Clean-up/Fix-up” Campaigns. This program is related both to the prevention of
neighborhood deterioration through the encouragement of continued home maintenance and to the
stimulation of housing rehabilitation activities. This program consists simply of the periodic
designation of a “neighborhood clean-up/fix-up” day or weekend. The City sponsored these
designated days to demonstrate the commitment of the public to the objective, and to encourage
trash elimination, tree pruning, yard cleaning, fence painting, and similar minor fix-up activities.
The City will cooperate with neighborhood groups, civic organizations, and others willing to assist
in program publicity and to help the elderly and disabled, who might be unable to perform minor
maintenance tasks themselves. Since the adoption of this program, the Police Department has staged
three “City Pride” neighborhood clean up campaigns per year, where residents have been involved in
cleaning up litter and debris, including large household discard items. A high level of resident
interest and participation has been achieved in these efforts.
        Recommendation. Continue the program.
Rehabilitation Programs – Owner and Renter Programs. Through Self Help Enterprises, a non-
profit corporation, the City participates in a homeowner rehabilitation and reconstruction program.
The program has been funded for $300,000 for two years, and third year funding in the same amount
is pending. Supplemental funding is provided by the City’s Redevelopment Agency. The eligibility
limit for participating households is no more than 80 percent of the current regional income. Eight
units have been funded for rehabilitation loans from the first year’s funding, while additional funding
applications are in process for subsequent years.
The City administers a rental rehabilitation loan program for low and moderate-income units.
Funding is set for $500,000 per year over a two year span. This program has gone through its start
up stage and inquiries have been made. No projects have yet been initiated. Funding for the owner
and renter rehabilitation and reconstruction program is provided through a combination of federal
Block Grant funding allocation, and federal HOME funds, which are allocated at the state level.
b.      Affordability Conservation
Low-Rent Public Housing Program. This program is administered and carried out by local public
housing authorities which develop, own, and operate low-rent public housing, which is subsidized by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The Housing Authority of the
County of Kern administers this program in the Delano area. The voters must authorize public low-
rent housing in the State of California. The Housing Authority of the County of Kern is the regional
agency authorized to construct publicly owned housing for the benefit of households in need within
the City. The Authority is constrained in its ability to produce new units by the funding allocated by
federal and state housing agencies. The Housing Authority has recently undertaken the conversion
of approximately 15 agency-owned rental units into ownership status available for purchase by its
City of Delano                                                                         December 2005
General Plan                                                                                         5-6

residents. In 2001, the City granted approval for an 84 detached unit rental project with community
facilities, in the south part of the City. Construction is expected to begin within 1-2 years.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Section 8 Rental Assistance. At the time of the 1992 Housing Element, a total of 209 households
were assisted with Section 8 Rental Assistance. Of these 42 were for elderly households. The
existing Housing Element calls for continued assistance to those 209 households. The Housing
Authority of the County of Kern administered Section 8 certificates/vouchers for 25 households in
Delano, of which 6 were elderly households, as of October 1992. Currently, there are 24 Section 8
vouchers in effect in the City of Delano. This includes nine vouchers for disabled households with
Social Security income. The number of Section 8 vouchers in Delano has been consistent since
1992. The Housing Authority of the County of Kern is the implementing agency for both the
voucher and agency-owned programs. The continued provision of certificates and vouchers to
Delano households is dependent upon continued federal funding levels for this specific program.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Rental Housing Production. This is one of several model programs under the National Affordable
Housing Act of 1990. An allocation of HOME funds will be utilized by HUD to make repayable
advances to public or private sponsors for up to 50 percent of the cost of construction, acquisition,
or substantial rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
Interest payments of up to 3 percent on the advances would start one year after project completion.
Principal and any accrued interest are repayable from “surplus cash” (to be defined in regulations) on
an annual basis.
HUD is to establish criteria to be used by participating jurisdictions to select projects. Specific
requirements may include addressing a shortage of rental housing for lower income families in the
area; the extent to which large families with children will be served; and/or the extent to which the
project provides congregate services to the elderly or persons with disabilities, among others.
Since the adoption of the existing Housing Element, Redevelopment Agency funds have been used
to develop the Jasmine Heights Apartment complex, which includes 128 rental units that are tied to
income criteria, based on an agreement with the redevelopment agency and Casa Hernandez
complex, which includes 80 senior citizen units, with an emphasis on farm workerfarm worker
needs. Additionally, the State Tax Credit Allocation Program has been used to fund the Villa Santa
Fe complex, which includes 81 family rental units that are either 3- or 4-bedroom units. This
complex was approved in 2001 and is now under construction.
         Recommendation. Continue the program.
Infrastructure Improvement Program. While the use of this program will be somewhat limited,
funds could be used to assist in the preservation of neighborhoods by upgrading selected public
City of Delano                                                                       December 2005
General Plan                                                                                       5-7

improvements. In order to meet the intent of the law, a nexus would be required linking the
improvements to the preservation of housing units for lower and moderate-income households.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Compensating Balance Program. This proposed rehabilitation program is a traditional amortized
loan program, the maximum loan amount being $15,000 per unit, but in no case exceeding more than
25 percent of the appraised value of the property. This bank program would be implemented in
association with a lending institution and is known as a “Compensation Balance” program. This
program is unique because it allows the Agency to leverage its residential housing set-aside funds to
enable these loan funds to be borrowed at below-market rates and still replenish the initial original
outlay of capital by the City of Delano Redevelopment Agency through the establishment of a
revolving pool of funds.
Initially under this program, the Agency would establish an interest-bearing account or accounts, the
amount to be determined by the Agency, at a qualified financial institution. Each time a loan is
funded by the financial institution at an interest rate determined by the Agency, according to the yet
to be established “General Program Guidelines,” a specified percentage of the total loan amount is
taken out of the interest-bearing account. The City/Agency bears no liability if a borrower defaults
on a loan, since it is the financial institution that finally approves the loan and assumes the risk of
recapturing its loan investment. The borrower will incur costs associated with normal loan
processing charges.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Deferred Payment Loan Program. The Deferred Payment Loan (DPL) Program is designed so
that lower-income, single family homeowners may borrow money for needed home repairs. No
repayment, however, is made until the real property is sold, assigned or transferred or the financial
situation of the borrower has improved. The term of the DPL is three years. When the term is near
expiration, the borrower must go through a reapplication process to determine if he or she is still
eligible under the “General Program Guidelines.” If the borrower is still eligible, the DPL will be
renewed for another three years and so on until there is a change in title to the property. If the
borrower is no longer eligible for this program at the end of one of these three-year renewal terms,
the borrower has the following options:
1. Pay off the loan balance in full.
2. Apply to the bank to borrow the necessary outstanding balance at the market rate for such a loan.
3. Arrange to borrow the money from a lender or source of his or her choice.
This program is structured to assist only lower-income participants and, unless a transfer of the
property occurs, the Agency, depending on the circumstances of the loan, could have an interest in
the real property for a period longer than 15 years. Both the Compensating Balance and Deferred
Loan Program would require recordation of the appropriate interests in the subject properties.
City of Delano                                                                         December 2005
General Plan                                                                                       5-8

         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Substantial Rehabilitation Loan Programs. This program is designed to cover those properties
that have deteriorated to a point where the funding limit of the above-described rehabilitation loan
programs is inadequate to cover the cost of needed repairs and rehabilitation. The costs of repairs to
properties under this program would exceed 25 percent of the appraised value of the property and
would be considered substantial rehabilitation under the provisions of California Community
Redevelopment Law. Owner-occupied units rehabilitated under this program would be required to
be available at affordable housing costs to persons and families of Very Low, Low, or Moderate
Income for a minimum period of no less than 30 years or for as long as is feasible. These restrictions
would have to be recorded, run with the land and be enforceable against the original owner and
successors by the Agency. This requirement would be longer should the Agency consider a merger
of its two redevelopment plans due to a recent change in State law.
Sales of owner-occupied units in this program, occurring prior to the expiration of the restricted
period, would result in the Agency sharing in sales proceeds in excess of an Agency-adopted
program. The substantial rehabilitation loan program would be available for lower and moderate
income persons and would be administered as a deferred loan program, payable at the time of
transfer of title or forgiven at the end of the restricted period.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Older Resident Rehabilitation Grant Program. Under this program, older residents identified as
possessing Very Low and Low Incomes who are owner-occupants of single family housing units
would be eligible for qualified home repairs and rehabilitation efforts. This would be a grant
program, with no repayment to the Agency. The program would have a maximum grant limit of
$2,500. Restrictions are related to program participant’s income and would require a structural
review of each real property to provide evaluation of total need and a subjective evaluation of
additional referral services. This grant program is envisioned as a mechanism to allow seniors
within the community to correct minor defects in their living environments and enhance the physical
quality of their home environments. The use of a nonprofit community organization or organizations
may be helpful in implementing this program.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Redevelopment Agency Rental Assistance Programs. The City of Delano Redevelopment
Agency might own, lease or contribute the value of a piece of property in exchange for a certain
percentage of units to be rented to Very Low and Low Income seniors or families. In addition, the
Agency may want to issue multifamily mortgage revenue bonds, which would provide first trust
deed monies at below market interest rates. In exchange for issuing the bonds, at least 20 percent of
the units would have to be set aside for Very Low and Low-Income individuals or families.
In certain instances, the Agency might wish to rehabilitate existing rental housing units. Low-cost
loans can be made to multifamily unit owners if said owners will reserve a certain number of units
City of Delano                                                                       December 2005
General Plan                                                                                       5-9

for Very Low and Low-Income families. Variations of the rental housing programs can be
developed should the Agency so desire.
        Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Low Income Tax Credit Programs. The Low Income Tax Credit Program provides for a 9 percent
annual tax credit for a 10-year period of time, based upon the total development cost (TDC). In
other words, a developer can get a 90 percent return on its TDC investment if it agrees to lower and
maintain rents at affordable rates as prescribed by the State Tax Credit Allocation Committee.
        Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
c.      Assist in Low/Moderate Income Housing Development
Density Bonus Ordinance and Implementation. The existing Housing Element includes a pro-
gram for adopting a density bonus ordinance. This ordinance was adopted by the City Council in
1990. The density bonus ordinance has been utilized several times within the City. In
February1995, within the Almond Tree Village development, 69 density bonus units were approved.
In April 1999, within a multiple family development near the intersection of 12th Street and Ellington
72 density bonus units were approved.
        Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
California Self-Help Housing Program. The California Self-Help Housing Program utilizes the
self-help concept to assist families to build and rehabilitate their homes. The program consists of
mortgage assistance for new construction and rehabilitation technical assistance may be available.
        Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Supportive Housing for the Elderly. The HUD Section 202 program has been available for many
years, primarily to build housing for seniors and to provide long-term rental subsidies for these units.
Assistance to the elderly is given in the form of non-interest bearing capital advances and contracts
for rental assistance. Assistance need not be repaid as long as the housing remains available for
Very Low-Income households, which are those 50 percent below the County’s median household
income.
        Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Mello-Roos and/or 1913 Act Programs. City of Delano Redevelopment Agency housing has
set-aside funds, which could be utilized to reduce the cost of assessments or special taxes for a
selected number of housing units designated for lower and moderate-income homebuyers within
a new subdivision.
        Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
City of Delano                                                                        December 2005
General Plan                                                                                       5-10

Infill Housing Write-Down Program. City of Delano Redevelopment Agency housing set-aside
funds could be utilized as follows:
1. To purchase a selected number of lots from a developer or property owner for sale at a “below-
     market” price to qualified lower and moderate-income homebuyers.
2. To purchase completed homes from a developer for sale at a “below-market” prices to qualified
     lower and moderate-income homebuyers.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Mortgage Loan Interest Write Down Program. Through this program, the City of Delano
Redevelopment Agency would use a portion of its housing set-aside fund to subsidize conventional
mortgage interest rates for qualified program participants for a given period of time, thus making it
easier for a homebuyer to qualify for a mortgage.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Tax Exempt Bond Program – Single-Family. The Tax Exempt Bond Program for single-family
housing provides below-market mortgage rates for first-time homebuyers in certain income groups.
This program can “take out” a developer from his construction loans and provide first-time
homebuyers with affordable financing.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
Tax Exempt Bond Financing – Rental Construction. Tax Exempt Bond Financing for rental con-
struction is a developer-driven program. The purpose of this financing is to provide below-market
“take out” financing for developers of affordable rental property. Basic requirements are that 20
percent of the units must be made affordable to lower and moderate income persons. Presumably,
the remaining 80 percent can be at market rate, thus carrying the development. This type of
financing has been made more difficult since the 1986 Tax Reform Act but the use of this program is
still viable in some cases.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
HUD Construction Program. Although HUD new construction programs are not at present
strongly funded and take a minimum of two to three years to plan, if time is not a major
consideration, a HUD new construction program (such as the Section 202 Program for the Elderly)
may be a desirable program.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
City of Delano                                                                      December 2005
General Plan                                                                                    5-11

Equal Housing Opportunities Program. The Fair Housing Division is funded through the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program and serves all of unincorporated Kern County and all CDBG non-entitlement
municipalities. The State Fair Employment and Housing Department enforces fair employment and
housing laws, educates the general public of its housing rights, and informs the public of the various
courses of action which are available in the event of an alleged violation of fair housing laws.
The Kern County Fair Housing Division implements various outreach and marketing programs to
inform the public of fair housing and to assist with housing-related problems where appropriate. The
Division distributes 200 informational flyers per month to housing providers. The Division
advertises its toll-free telephone number throughout the County; in 1992, the Division received over
4,200 telephone calls. The Division has prepared a housing resource guide containing information
pertaining to all housing-related services provided throughout Kern County. The guides are
“regionalized” and distributed throughout the various portions of the County.
         Recommendation. Implement/continue the program.
d.       Other Housing Programs
In addition to the preceding activities outlined in the existing Delano Housing Element, the City has
undertaken a number of housing programs, which are described below.
Mortgage Credit Certificate Program. The Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC) Program,
authorized by Congress in the Tax Reform Act of 1984, is a means of providing financial assistance
to “first time homebuyers” for the purchase of new or existing single family housing. The MCC
Program provides qualified homebuyers with a Federal income tax credit. Income tax credits reduce
an individual’s tax payments by an amount equal to the credit. Under the MCC Program, the
maximum tax credit available is equal to 20 percent of the annual interest paid on the borrower’s
mortgage.
In 1985, the State of California adopted legislation authorizing local agencies to make MCCs avail-
able in California. The MCC Program is a “non-cost” housing ownership program currently being
utilized throughout the State. This program could be implemented through the utilization of City of
Delano Redevelopment Agency housing set-aside funds. The authority of the MCC Program comes
from the Federal Government. The MCC Program is easy to administer and is highly cost-effective
in that it delivers a direct subsidy to a homeowner.
While the enabling legislation for the program potentially expires this year, many officials in
Washington, D.C. feel it will be extended for at least another two years. While the tax credit
authority comes from the Federal Government, the issuance of MCCs comes under the jurisdiction
of the State. MCCs are allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis in California.
The chief advantage to the Redevelopment Agency would be that the cost of this program is a simple
one percent deport fee placed with the State Mortgage Allocation Committee. For example, if the
City of Delano                                                                       December 2005
General Plan                                                                                     5-12

Agency wished to subsidize 100 homes at $80,000, the cost to the Agency would be a deposit of
$80,000, fully refundable upon origination of the certificates.
First-Time Home Buyer Loan Program. This program is designed to provide prospective
homeowners with a matching down payment equal to the down payment of the borrower, not to
exceed $15,000, through the utilization of City of Delano Redevelopment Agency housing set-aside
funds. Applicants under this program must be fully qualified to make mortgage payments to the
funding institution of their choice. Such payments, including principal, interest, taxes, association
dues, repayment to the Redevelopment Agency, and other requirements must meet the lending
criteria of the lending institution. The Agency contribution would assume a second position to the
holder of the first lien and the Agency would be reimbursed if the dwelling were sold or transferred
during the first 10 years of occupancy. No monthly payment would be due the Agency during the
initial five years of the loan. Payment would be due to the Agency in the sixth year but only on 50
percent of the Agency loan. The other 50 percent would be forgiven if the dwelling remained
occupied by the original owners for a minimum of five years. The Agency position and the amount
of the monthly repayment schedule must be within the acceptable guidelines of the lending
institution selected by the applicant. This program could be funded from the proceeds of a taxable
note as the potential exists that note proceeds could be treated as a loan.
Silent Second Trust Deed Program. This program is similar to the First Time Home Buyer Loan
Program except that the City of Delano Redevelopment Agency provides 100 percent of the required
down payment and secures its position through a “silent” second trust deed. Depending upon the
objective of the Agency, payback of the second trust deed can be postponed until the unit is sold, or
a portion could be forgiven based upon the number of years the unit is occupied by the owner.
Homeless Shelter/Transitional Housing Zone Amendment. In order to accommodate any present
and future needs of the homeless in Delano, the City of Delano will amend its zoning ordinance to
allow for homeless shelters and transitional housing within General Services Commercial (G-S)
districts. There is a sufficient supply of available sites within the existing G-S zoned areas in
Delano. G-S districts are located within reasonable access to local community services, including
government offices and transportation services, and will not require unusually high site development
costs. The zoning ordinance will be amended to permit the development of, or conversion to, a
homeless shelter or transitional housing without undue special regulatory approval.
Homeless Shelter/Transitional Housing Incentives. The City of Delano established administrative
processing guidelines to encourage the development of, or conversion to, a homeless shelter or
transitional housing through various reductions in development requirements and fees. The
incentives to be available to qualified developers of homeless shelters and transitional housing
projects will include reduced development impact fees, reduced parking requirements, and reduced
utility connection fees.

Migrant Farm worker Housing. The special housing needs of many farm workers stem from the
generally low wages and the instability associated with the agricultural industry. The northern Kern
County area is economically based in agricultural production. Farm workers comprise a significant
portion of Delano’s population. In 1990, 2,697 Delano residents (35% of employed persons 16 years
and older) were employed as farm workers, nearly all of whom are likely to have affordable housing
needs
Due to the magnitude of the farming industry in the Delano area, large numbers of migrant farm
workers are employed during the various harvest seasons. However, no migrant farm worker
housing is available in the Delano area. The nearest migrant farm worker housing is located in the
City of Shafter, approximately 20 miles southwest of Delano. This complex is owned and managed
by the Kern County Housing Authority. In order to accommodate the housing needs of migrant farm
workers, migrant farm worker housing should be established in the Delano area.
The Housing Authority of the County of Kern (HACK) would be the appropriate entity to establish
migrant farm worker housing in the Delano area. HACK should investigate potential siting and
funding for a migrant farm worker housing project in the Delano area.
5.3     NEEDS ASSESSMENT
5.3.1 Introduction
Section 65583(a) of the California Government Code requires the Housing Element to include an
assessment of housing needs and an inventory of resources and constraints relevant to the meeting of
these needs. The assessment and inventory must include the following:
        (1) An analysis of population and employment trends and documentation of projec-
            tions and a quantification of the locality’s existing and projected housing needs
            for all income levels. These existing and projected needs shall include the
            locality’s share of the regional housing need.
        (2) An analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of
            payment compared to ability to pay, housing characteristics, including over-
            crowding, and housing stock condition.
        (3) An inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites
            and sites having potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship
            of zoning and public facilities and services to these sites.
        (4) An analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the mainte-
            nance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels, including
            land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site improvements, fees
            and other exactions required of developers, and local processing and permit
            procedures. The analysis shall also demonstrate local efforts to remove
            governmental constraints that hinder the locality from meeting its share of the
            regional housing need.

        (5) An analysis of potential and actual nongovernmental constraints upon the
             maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels,
             including the availability of financing, the price of land, and the cost of
             construction.
        (6) An analysis of any special housing needs, such as those of the handicapped,
             elderly, large families, farm workers, families with female heads of
             households, and families and persons in need of emergency shelter.
        (7) An analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to
             residential development.
        (8) An analysis of existing assisted housing developments that are eligible to
             change from low-income housing uses during the next 10 years due to
             termination of subsidy contracts, mortgage prepayment, or expiration of
             restrictions on use.
5.3.2 EMPLOYMENT AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
a.      Total Population
Between April 1990 and January 2000, the population of Delano increased from 23,467 to 39,489,
an average of 1,602 persons per year (6.8 percent, annually). During the same period, the housing
stock increased from 6,236 to 8,830 units, an average of 259 units per year (4.2 percent). The
California Department of Finance estimates that population within the City of Delano was 40,292
and there was a total of 8,935 housing units in January of 2001. Table 5.3.A shows population and
housing growth in Delano between 1990 and 2000.

b.        Population Projections
The most recent growth projections adopted by the Kern Council of Governments (COG) indicates
that population growth in Delano will be greater than occurred in the 1990s (1,602 persons annually
or 6.8%). Kern COG’s population projections show the City growing by approximately 3,668
persons annually through 2020, more than double the average annual population growth of the
1990s. Additionally, the City’s population growth includes the growth of the prison population
within the City. The number of housing units will also increase accordingly (930 housing units
annually or 10.5 percent), as shown in Table 5.3.B.

c.        Age Distribution
Understanding age distribution in the community is important because it affects the housing market.
A declining number of young children can result in a change in the types of housing units being
sought. Childless adults tend to have a higher combined income and prefer certain amenities,
increasing the demand for condominiums or units in planned unit developments. An elderly
population creates a demand for units with common recreation facilities and easy access to
commercial, medical, and transportation facilities. Inflationary pressures within the housing market
can create disadvantages for the elderly on fixed incomes.
It is typical that small rural communities, such as Delano, which are designed for and attract young
families experience a particular demographic cycle. As the community matures, its school-age chil-
dren grow up and begin forming their own households. Often, mature communities that emphasized
single-family housing during their growth phases do not have a sufficient supply of housing that is
affordable to these emerging households. Thus, a generation of new adults is sometimes forced to
move away from its community in order to seek starter (often rental) housing.
In addition, such rural communities find that the types of housing that were well suited to families
are not particularly well suited to seniors and empty nesters (non-senior adults whose children have
grown and started their own households). Thus, seniors and empty nesters often look to sell their
homes, and move into housing that is smaller and better suited to their needs. Sometimes suitable
housing for such older adults is not available in the community where they made their homes, and
they are forced to move to other areas. Typically, a new generation of young families moves into the
community. School-age population increases, and the community once again has many young
families in residence.
As noted above, not only does a community’s demographic makeup change over time, so does its
housing needs. If it is important to the community to retain its youth and elderly populations, it is
important that a variety of housing types and styles of residential development be provided,

including rental and starter housing, as well as housing for young growing families, empty nesters,
and the elderly.
In 2000, over one-third of Delano’s population was under the age of 19, while 7.5 percent of the
population was 65 years old or over (Table 5.3.C). This indicates that Delano is still within its
“growth” stage, attracting young families. Population growth projections for the City indicate that
this trend toward attracting young families will continue for the next 20 years.

d.       Ethnicity
Table 5.3.D provides the 1980, 1990 and 2000 Census breakdowns of the racial and ethnic distribution of
the City of Delano by percentage of the population. As shown in the table, there are some differences in
the way that ethnicity was tabulated in the censuses, primarily in the tabulation of “Hispanic.” In the
1980 and 1990 Censuses, “Hispanic” was treated as an ethnic characteristic, separate from the racial
characteristics being tabulated. Thus, in 1980 and 1990, “Hispanic” residents were also categorized
as being a member of the “white,” “black,” “Native American,” “Asian,” or “other” race. In the
2000 Census, “white,” “black,” “Native American,” “Asian,” and “other” are treated as ethnicities.
Thus, in the 2000 Census, “Hispanic” residents are not also categorized by race.

e.       Employment Characteristics
The California Employment Development Department (EDD) identified the total labor force within
the City of Delano as of February 2002 to be 12,780. The total employment was 8,960, which left
3,820 unemployed (29.9%). This percentage is not adjusted for seasonal farm worker unemploy-
ment. This percentage is typical compared to other farming communities within the San Joaquin
Valley. For instance, McFarland had an unemployment rate of 34.5 percent and Arvin had an unem-
ployment rate of 28.2 percent, as of February 2002. Communities within the San Joaquin Valley that
do not rely on farming have lower unemployment rates that do not reflect the seasonal fluctuation.
For instance, Bakersfield had an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent and Taft had a rate of 8 percent.
Kern COG states that in 2000 there were 13,138 jobs within the City of Delano. The job projections
for the year 2020 within Delano are 22,258, this is an increase of 456 jobs per year (or 3.5% increase
per year). Thus, Delano’s jobs-to-household ratio is projected to decrease from 1.52 in 2000 to 0.81
in 2020.
While the City’s economy is heavily oriented towards agriculture, it is not solely dependant upon
agriculture. The employment industries in the Delano area are very diverse. The EDD breaks down
the employment statistics by Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The City of Delano is included in
the Bakersfield MSA. Table 5.3.E depicts the diversity of employment opportunities within the
Delano area. The industry sectors of Government, Services, Trade, and Farming are almost even in
the quantity of people that each industry employs.

In November of 1991, the City of Delano was officially designated as an Enterprise Zone by the
State Department of Commerce. This designation will be in effect for a 15-year period. The Enter-
prise zone program provides numerous State and local incentives and benefits to businesses that
expand or locate within the Zone during this period. Since receiving Enterprise Zone designation,
the City has attracted several large businesses. These include North Kern State Prison, Sears
Logistics Services, and Paramount Farms. These new businesses have created approximately 2,200
new jobs.
5.3.3 Household Characteristics
a.      Average Household Size
The 2000 Census reports that there were 8,409 households in the City of Delano, with an average
household size of 4.02. Of these households, it is estimated that 7,245 (86.2%) were family
households, while only 912 households (10.8%) were individuals living alone. The balance of
Delano’s households were non-family households with more than one occupant.
Delano’s existing population per household as identified in the 2000 Census (4.02) is high, relative
to Kern County (3.03) and the Southern California region (3.13). Whereas Kern County’s
population per household is projected to decrease slightly from 3.03 to 2.63 by 2020, Delano’s
population per household is projected to increase from 4.02 to 4.11 by 2020. This is much higher
than the County or the regional average, and indicates Delano’s continuing popularity for families,
including large families.
b.      Income
The Kern COG 2000 Regional Housing Allocation Plan breaks the County into nine different
planning areas. The City of Delano is included in Planning Area 3, which consists of census tracts
39, 40 through 44, and 46 through 50. Four incorporated cities are in the area Delano, McFarland,
Shafter, and Wasco.
City of Delano                                                                    December 2005

Planning Area 3 has the lowest family income of all the planning areas in the County. Median
family incomes were more than $10,000 below that of Kern County as a whole. Table 5.3.F shows
that low and very low-income families represent nearly 60 percent of families in Planning Area 3.
This indicates that the City provides housing for a much higher percentage of low and moderate-
income households than do other communities in the County. Table 5.3.F illustrates the differences
in income distribution between the City of Delano and Kern County. The City currently provides its
“fair share” housing for lower income households.

c.         Housing Tenure
According to the 2000 Census, of the 8,830 households in Delano, 59.4 percent are owner-occupied, and
40.6 percent are renter occupied. Additionally, the City has a low homeowner vacancy rate of 1.1
percent.
d.         Overcrowding
According to both California and Federal standards, a housing unit is considered overcrowded if it is
occupied by more than one person per room (excluding kitchens, bathrooms and halls). Occupancy
by more than 1.5 persons per room constitutes “severe” overcrowding. The incidence of overcrowd-
ing was significant in Delano, in 1990, with 42.3 percent of renter households and 25.1 percent of
owner households defined as overcrowded. The 2000 Census states that the average household size
is 4.02 and the average family size is 4.27. These are both much higher than the Kern County and
regional averages. Factors contributing to the rate of overcrowding in Delano include housing costs,
an increase in the number and proportion of large family households, and an inadequate supply of
large family rental and ownership units. Overpayment of housing is an additional problem within
the City. According to the 2002 Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy Report (CHAS
Report), 1,647 renters and 786 owners overpay for housing within the very low-income household
needs group.
As discussed in Chapter 5, the City of Delano is implementing several programs to lower the rate of
overcrowding. These programs are designed to ensure available residential sites to meet the needs of
the larger household, obtain grants to assist in housing large households, prioritize building
inspections and funding opportunities, and increase the number of affordable housing units in the
city, which will lower the occurrence of families doubling up within residential units.

e.       Special Housing Needs
Disabled Persons. Disabled persons often have special housing needs. Depending on the type of
disability, these may include close proximity to transit, retail and commercial services, and their
workplaces. Other needs may involve modifications to the housing unit itself: ramps, lowered
sinks, grip bars, and wider doorways. Curb cuts, ramps, and elevators in multistory buildings assist
persons with walkers, crutches, and wheelchairs in gaining access to their living units, common
areas, and the street. A variety of housing types, both rental and owner-occupied, should be made
available that are suitable for disabled persons.
As of the time of this writing, 2000 census data on disabilities was not available. Delano had 2,583
residents aged 16 or over with disabilities in 1990, comprising 16 percent of Delano’s 16 and over
population. Of these 2,583 persons with a work disability and/or a mobility/self-care limitation,
1,283 were males and 1,300 were females. Based on the rate of population growth since 1990, the
number of persons with disabilities in Delano today is probably close to 4,339. Table 5.3.G
compares the percentage of adults in Delano who have a work disability or a mobility limitation to
the same figures for Kern County as a whole.

Single-Parent Households, Including Those with Female Heads of Household. The number of
single-parent families, especially those headed by a female, has increased in recent decades. These
families often have special housing needs, including a strong demand for affordable housing because
of the income limitations of single-earner households. Of the 8,409 households within the City of
Delano, 5,068 were married couple households (60.3%) and 1,547 were headed by single females
(18.4%).
The Elderly and Households Headed By The Elderly. As of 2000, 7.5 percent of Delano’s resi-
dents were age 65 or older. The percentage of older residents in Delano is lower than that of Kern
County (9.4%). In addition, 1,982 or 5.4 percent of households, had an individual over 65 years old.
Most of these individuals are living in owner-occupied housing units (70%), which is 19.7 percent of
the total number of owner-occupied housing units in the City of Delano. Thus, 12.6 percent of the
elderly are living in rental units. This percentage reflects 12.6 percent of the total rental housing
within the City.
City of Delano                                                                       December 2005

Housing affordability is an important consideration for the elderly, as they are typically on fixed
incomes. Housing designed specifically for the elderly is typically made up of apartments with one
or two bedrooms. Housing projects for the elderly are often constructed at higher densities than
other types of housing, and often include some units designed for handicapped residents. The
primary considerations in evaluating sites for elderly housing are proximity to shopping, social
services, public transportation, and health care; compatibility with adjacent land uses; and cost.
Secondary considerations involve proximity to recreation and churches, special amenities such as
trees and views, and the absence of detrimental conditions such as traffic, noise, and industrial land
use. There are two senior citizen rental projects in the City of Delano. These include the Cecil
Avenue Apartments and the Cara Hernandez Apartments.
Large Families. According to 2000 Census data, Delano had 3,125 households consisting of five or
more persons, representing 37.2 percent of the City’s households. Table 5.3.H shows the number of
households of different sizes in Delano. The share of large households (five or more persons) is con-
siderably higher in Delano than the Kern County average, 18.8 percent. Among large families, the
proportion that is renting is higher in Delano than it is Countywide (36.0% vs. 7.5%). This figure
has increased from 30 percent in 1990. Delano, therefore, has a disproportionate demand for large
rental units. Policies were established in 1992, as identified in Chapter 2, to encourage the
development of 3+ bedroom units, since this policy was implemented, a total of 112 attached
multiple family rental units with 3+ bedrooms have been issued permits for construction.

Group Quarters. In 2000, Delano had 5,057 residents living in group quarters, representing 13 percent of
City residents. Of the residents identified as living in group quarters, 4,982 were identified as being
“institutionalized.” Those institutionalized include the population of the North Kern Correctional Facility and
the Community Correctional Facility (CCF).
Farm workers. Agricultural employment continues to be a significant economic activity in Kern
County. A precise count of the number of agricultural workers in Delano is currently unavailable
due to seasonal and annual variation. However, the 1990 and 2000 Census demonstrates that the
percentage of people living in Delano and employed as farm workers has declined. The 1990 census

Problems associated with farm worker housing typically include severe overcrowding and
substandard living conditions. Specific programs identified in Section 5, Implementing Program
2.1.1, identifies grant programs for farm workers. There is typically a particular need for housing
units that can accommodate large families.
The Kern County Housing Authority owns and manages six affordable housing complexes in the
Delano area that accommodate farm workers. Complexes are located immediately outside of the
City limits of Delano within the unincorporated area of Kern County.
Due to the seasonal changes in the farming industry, large numbers of migrant farm workers are
employed during the harvest seasons. However, no migrant farm worker housing exists in the
Delano area. The nearest migrant farm worker housing is located near the City of Shafter, approxi-
mately 20 miles southwest of Delano. This complex is owned and managed by the Kern County
Housing Authority. In order to accommodate the housing needs of migrant farm workers in the
Delano area, migrant farm worker housing should be established in the Delano vicinity. A housing
program pertaining to the establishment of migrant farm worker housing in the Delano area by the
Housing Authority of the County of Kern is included in this Housing Element.
Persons and Families in Need of Emergency Shelter. Due to the transient nature of the homeless,
the precise number of homeless individuals in Delano is difficult to determine. Shelter assistance for
the homeless is not available in Delano; however, there are several homeless shelters located in
Bakersfield, approximately 30 miles south of Delano. No shelter beds, hotel/motel vouchers, or
units of transitional housing are currently available in Delano.
Social service agencies located in Bakersfield include Kern Linkage, Bethany Services Bakersfield
Homeless Center, and the Bakersfield Rescue Mission. Kern Linkage serves Kern County’s
mentally disabled homeless. Their assistance consists of information referral, case management,
counseling, and a variety of other services to the homeless mentally ill.
The Bethany Services Bakersfield Homeless Center serves a large number of people from the
Delano area. The Center provides over 12,000 meals monthly and provides shelter for up to 166
people daily. Overnight stays for a month or longer can be accommodated by the Center. The
Center provides medical and dental care, clothes and supplies, and a school program for children.
The Bakersfield Rescue Mission serves single men and adult women. The Mission serves over
18,000 meals and sleeps 8,000 people per month. The Mission has a one-year program for people
who are trying to make substantial changes in their lives. In this program the participants live in the
Mission for one year and are provided both mental and physical assistance. The Mission provides
for medical, dental, and nutritional needs; in addition to drug and alcohol classes, parenting classes,
financial accountability classes, and job finding assistance.

Assisted Housing At Risk. State law requires an analysis and a program for preserving federally
assisted housing developments eligible for conversion to market rents (“at risk” units). The purpose
of this analysis is to identify programs that the City can implement to preserve federally assisted
housing units that will prevent or minimize tenant displacement and will preserve the local
affordable housing stock.
The following assisted housing projects within the City of Delano, are administered by the Housing
Authority of the County of Kern. According to the Housing Authority of the County of Kern all of
the listed projects will continue to be funded for the next ten years, therefore they will continue to
retain their affordability.
Valle Vista: 62-unit complex was built in 1951 and consists of 10 one-bedroom, 34 two-bedroom, 12
three-bedroom, and 6 four-bedroom units.
Homer Harrison Homes: This 50-unit project was built in 1991 and consists of 46 three-bedroom and
four-bedroom units.
Rancho Algodon: This 62-unit project was built in 1983 under the State’s Rental Housing Construc-
tion Project (RHCP) and consists of 50 three-bedroom and 12 four-bedroom units.
International Village: This 54-unit Farmers Home Administration (FMHA) project was built in 1987
and consists of 32 two-bedroom, 18 three-bedroom and 12 four-bedroom units.
The following assisted housing projects within Delano, are administered by HUD. According to
HUD and the individual property owners, all of the listed projects will continue to be funded for the
next ten years, therefore they will continue to retain their affordability.
Delano Gardens: This 76-unit complex was built in 1972.
Valley View: This 90-unit complex was built in 1982.
Cecil Avenue Apartments: This 43-unit complex is specifically designed to meet the needs of senior
citizens. The complex consists of 42 one-bedroom apartments and one two-bedroom apartment.
5.3.4            HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
a.       Housing Inventory
As shown in Table 5.3.I, the California Department of Finance identifies 8,667 dwelling units within
the City of Delano. A total of 70 percent of these units are detached single-family homes. Over 14
percent are located in structures of five or more units. This mix reflects the community’s small town
character and agricultural heritage.
b.       Housing Conditions
In March of 2000, a housing condition analysis was prepared for the City of Delano. All of the resi-
dential zoned parcels were surveyed and given a housing condition. Approximately 37 percent of
City of Delano                                                                        December 2005

the residences were classified as needing little or no repair. Approximately 37 percent of residences
were noted as needing very minor or only cosmetic repairs to maintain the unit. Units that needed
moderate to major repairs or units that started to show significant deteriorating problems comprised
approximately 20 percent of units within the City of Delano. Units that required an extensive
amount of repairs or visible major structure problems represented 5 percent of the total dwelling
units. There were only 50 units that were determined to be uninhabitable, which accounted for less
than 1 percent of the total housing units surveyed.

The dwelling units that require an extensive amount of repairs and those that were determined to be
uninhabitable are primarily concentrated in two large regions. The first region is located just west of
State Highway 99, between 11th Avenue and Garces Highway. The second region is located just east
of State Highway 99, which also extends from 11th Avenue to Garces Highway. This second region
is slightly larger, and there are more concentrations of deteriorating and dilapidated dwellings along
the eastern side of State Highway 99.
c.        Housing Cost and Rents
Housing costs in Delano are slightly lower than the Kern County average. According to the Califor-
nia Association of Realtors, the median price for a home in Delano in January 2002 was $89,000,
compared to $97,250 Countywide. These figures are similar to comparable figures from the 1990
census. With conventional financing and current interest rates (about 7% on a 30-year conforming
mortgage), the monthly payment on a $90,000 mortgage would be $599. Comparison with the
figures in Table 5.3.J shows that moderate-income households, and even some low-income
households, can afford the median home price in Delano.
Rental housing is often a lower cost alternative for lower-income households. Based on a review of
newspaper advertisements, a two-bedroom apartment in Delano can be currently rented for $385 to
$490 per month, with three-bedroom units now renting for approximately $450 to $570 per month.
Allowing 30 percent of gross income for housing costs, a Delano household would have to earn
$16,000 to $19,500 annually to afford the average two-bedroom rental unit and $18,000 to $23,000
to afford the average three-bedroom rental unit in Delano at current market rates. Thus, the average
two-bedroom rentals are affordable to very low-income, three-member households, and the average
three-bedroom rental is affordable to very low-income, four-member households. The above
numbers reflect current market conditions within the City of Delano; they do not represent the future
cost of housing within the City.

5.3.5             EXISTING HOUSING NEEDS
a.       Income Groupings
State law requires that housing needs be determined in such a way as to ensure that the shelter re-
quirements of all income groups be identified, not just those household with incomes high enough to
compete effectively in the private marketplace. Housing need is distributed into four income catego-
ries related to the County median household income: very low, low, moderate, and above moderate
income (Table 5.3.K).
The terms “moderate income” and “low income” are commonly misunderstood as they apply to
municipal housing elements. Moderate income is often thought of as applying to those with less
than average incomes, and that, roughly translated, “moderate” income includes the “working poor”
– those working people who are just above the poverty line. “Low” income, thus, is typically
perceived as those who are below the poverty level. From these perceptions spring a wide variety of
negative stereotypes. “Low income” residents are sometimes unfairly stereotyped as being
unemployed, on welfare, and prone to crime. In short, they are often wrongly perceived as being an
undesirable element in the community, rather than being working people.
However, as used in State housing law, “very low,” “low,” “moderate,” and “above moderate” in-
come are based on the County’s median income: “moderate” income means average income for the
County, and “low” income is simply below average. State law requires that four income levels must
be considered in determining future housing needs. The income levels that are defined in relation to
the median income in the county are identified in Table 5.3.K.
                                  Table 5.3.K - Household Income Groupings
                        Income Group                                      Percent of County Median Income
                          Very Low                                                          <50%
                              Low                                                        50% - 80%
                           Moderate                                                      80% - 120%
                       Above Moderate                                                      >120%
The annual household income limit for each income group is determined by applying the above per-
centages to the Kern County median income, as reported by the California Department of Housing
and Community Development. Because Kern County has a relatively low median household
City of Delano                                                                                       December 2005
General Plan                                                                                                   5-26

income, a family of four with a household income of $32,240 to $48,360 is considered to be of
“moderate” income, while a family of four with a household income of $20,150 to $32,240 is
considered to be “low” income in Kern County. Table 5.3.K shows the median income and income
limits for each income group for household of one to four persons in Kern County.
Because large numbers of households have two or more wage earners, it is often overlooked that
many single-wage earner households often fall into low- or moderate-income categories. Thus,
households with a single wage earner who is employed, for example, as a cook, file clerk, or bank
teller, would likely fall into the very low income category. Similarly, households with a single wage
earner who is employed as a teacher, truck driver, nurse or secretary would likely fall into the low
income category, while a household with a single wage earner who is employed as a police officer,
accountant, or engineer would likely fall into the moderate income category.
b.           Housing Affordability
The monthly housing payment that a household is considered to be able to afford is determined by its
household income. For purposes of housing affordability planning, a household is expected to be
able to spend up to 30 percent of its monthly income on housing. Table 5.3.L shows the monthly
payments that households in each income group within Kern County are able to afford. Table 5.3.M
translates those maximum-housing payments into purchase prices for a four-person household.

                                                                                              Household Size

  The criteria defined for ownership affordability assumes one-third of annual income is available for housing, less 10 percent of housing
  cost for taxes and insurance, a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage at 7 percent interest. Rental housing affordability assumes a two-bedroom
  apartment and that 30 percent of annual income is available for payment of annual rent.
As can be seen from these tables, because of Kern County’s relatively low median income, housing
that is affordable to “lower income” groups has relatively low sale prices and rental rates. For exam-
ple, a new home that is offered for sale at $130,000 in Delano is considered to be affordable to a
moderate-income household, while a rental unit offered for $600/month is considered to be
affordable to a low-income household. Thus, within Delano, the housing market is producing new,

four-bedroom homes at prices that are affordable to moderate-income residents. In addition, the
housing market is producing rental units that are affordable to low-and very low-income residents.
However, there is still an affordability issue facing the City of Delano. The 2000 Census
demonstrates that 35.7 percent of home owners and 44 percent of renters within the City of Delano
are paying more than 30 percent of their gross income on housing costs.
5.3.6 FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS
a.       Regional Housing Needs
Section 65584 of the Government Code requires that the appropriate council of governments deter-
mine each locality’s share of the region’s existing and future housing needs. Kern COG, which is
responsible for cities and unincorporated areas within Kern County, adopted a Regional Housing
Allocation Plan in May 2001. This document identifies future housing needs through the Kern COG
region. “Future housing need” is defined as the number of additional housing units that are needed
to meet projected increases in the number of Delano households between 2000 and 2007 to:
•   Accommodate projected growth in the number of very low, low, moderate, and above
    moderate income households;
•   Compensate for housing demolitions and other inventory losses; and
•   Achieve a vacancy rate at the end of 2007 that allows the market to operate efficiently (4 to
    6%).
According to Kern COG, Delano’s projected need for new housing construction between 2000 and
2007 is 1,628 units. This projected need of 1,628 units represents a much larger growth rate than has
historically occurred within the City of Delano. The vast majority of these units are needed to
accommodate growth in the number of households; less than 5 percent is needed for each of the
purposes of compensating for housing units that have been lost and maintaining a vacancy rate
which facilitates choice in the housing market. Table 5.3.N shows the housing need for each income
category, as determined by Kern COG.

b.       Avoidance of Impaction
State housing law requires that in allocating future housing needs by income level, the local Council
of Governments (Kern COG) avoid further “impaction,” which is the concentration of lower income

households. Cities with a percentage of lower income households that is higher than the regional
average are called “impacted” jurisdictions. Kern COG’s Regional Housing Allocation Plan deals
with the “avoidance of impaction” within cities by reducing projected needs for housing affordable
to lower income households and increasing projected needs for housing units that are affordable to
higher income households that are allocated to impacted jurisdictions. The opposite adjustment is
made in the allocation to non-impacted jurisdictions.
According to Kern COG’s assessment, 59 percent of Planning Area 3 households are in the very
low- and low-income categories. By comparison, in Kern County as a whole, 40 percent of
households are in these categories. Regionally, the figure is 25 percent. Thus, Delano is impacted as
defined in State law. As shown in Table 5.3.N, 40 percent of Delano’s identified new housing needs
were allocated by Kern COG to Delano to very low- and low-income households.
c.       New Housing Already Constructed
Since the beginning of the period covered by the Regional Housing Allocation Plan (April 2000)
through the end of February 2002, 326 housing units for moderate-income households and 133 units
for low-income households have been constructed in the City of Delano. The affordability of these
new dwelling units and remaining housing needs are presented in Table 5.3.O. The numbers listed
in Table 5.3.O are based on the average sales price compared to income. Housing sales prices were
determined by estimates from City building records, anecdotal information, and, when provided,
information from developers at the time of sale. The 326 housing units for moderate-income
households being constructed meet the needs of low and moderate-income groups, with a range of
purchase price from $82,950 to $149,950. All of the 133 units are apartments within multifamily
residential structures and have been constructed. They meet the needs of the low-income group. As
stated previously, two- and three-bedroom apartments in Delano can be rented for approximately
$385-$570 per month. Because of Kern County’s relatively low median income, a rental unit
offered for $600/month is considered to be affordable for low-income households and thus the rental
rate of these 133 apartments is affordable for low-income households.

5.4                HOUSING RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
5.4.1              INTRODUCTION
Chapter 5.4 contains data and analysis pertaining to the resources and constraints affecting the
maintenance, improvement, and development of housing in Delano. The analysis focuses on four
major topics:
•   Availability of sites for residential development (vacant land study/developable acres).
•   Potential and actual governmental constraints on housing (e.g., land use controls, fees, etc.).
•   Potential and actual non-governmental constraints on housing (e.g., land prices, construction costs,
    and the availability of financing).
•   Opportunities for energy conservation with respect to new development.
5.4.2 AVAILABILITY OF SITES FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
a.       Physical/Environmental Constraints
Areas of Steep Slopes. Landslides and slope stability do not affect the City of Delano since it is flat
in topography.
Fault Zones. No faults have been mapped immediately near Delano, but several major faults can be
found in Kern County. Therefore, the City is not designated in a special study zone under the
Alquist-Priolo Act.
Agricultural and Open Space Issues. In general, most of the area within the existing City limits is
not in agricultural production. Some agricultural parcels in unincorporated lands surrounding the
City are currently under Williamson Act contract, which precludes their development until such time
as the contracts expire.2
b.       Inventory of Land Suitable for Residential Development
State law requires that an inventory of lands that are suitable for the development of housing be
undertaken in the resources and constraints portion of a community’s Housing Element. The
objective of this analysis is to demonstrate that the community is capable of accommodating its “fair
share” of regional housing growth, as expressed in the Regional Housing Needs Assessment.
As shown in Table 5.4.A, currently residentially zoned property within Delano’s City limits has the
capacity for 1,393 additional housing units. As previously noted, Kern COG’s Regional Housing
Needs Assessment indicates that there is a remaining need for 1,169 dwelling units within the City of
Delano through the end of this Housing Element period (2005), as shown in Table 5.3.O.
2   Contracts are for a ten-year period and are automatically renewed each year unless a notice of non-renewal is filed with the
    managing governmental agency. In that case, the land use restrictions remain in effect until the remaining nine years of the
    contract have elapsed.

 Density and capacity of rural parcels are expressed based on maximum allowable development potential. The actual build out of these areas
 depends on the specific physical characteristics of individual sites.
As indicated in Table 5.4.A there are 23 acres of vacant land that is designated high density. It is
important to note that the 23 acres are broken down into 8 parcels. The sizes of these parcels range
from 18 acres to 0.14 acre and the number of units that can be developed on each parcel ranges from
522 units to 4 units.
Table 5.4.B identifies the vacant land that has a potential for zone change increasing the acreage
available for housing existing in the Delano City limits. These areas have the ability to be rezoned
and utilized to increase the land availability for very-low and low-income households.

The City is evaluating three potential annexation sites. Of these sites one is currently developed,
with a 56-unit duplex project constructed by the Kern County Housing Authority, and a tract of 125
homes affordable to moderate-income households. At the time of development, about 20 years ago,
this tract was allowed to develop without annexing into the City of Delano, although the City does
provide water and sewer services to this area.
Annexation of this site would increase the supply of low and medium housing units within the City
by 180 units. This would not result in the production of new housing units, but existing residents
could benefit from City maintenance services. Also, existing homeowners and tenants could then
become eligible to participate in City administered housing rehabilitation loan programs financed
through the City’s participation in Block Grant programs and HOME funds.
Table 5.4.C identifies the anticipated breakdown of housing by economic group that would result
from build out of the existing Delano City limits. This breakdown is based on the following criteria.
City of Delano                                                                                                          December 2005
General Plan                                                                                                                               5-31

•   Rural density housing will likely be affordable only to above moderate-income households.
•   Most low-density (single-family) housing will also be affordable to above-moderate income
    households, but some (30 percent) will be affordable to moderate-income households. This appears
    to be a conservative estimate, since the median home price in Delano is $89,000. As shown in Table
    5.3.M, a four-person family at the upper end of the low-income range in Kern County can afford up to
    a $104,823 home, and a family in the moderate-income range can afford up to a $157,235 home.
    Delano Redevelopment Agency offers programs to assist first time in the very low- to moderate-
    income households. The Down Payment Assistance program is useful for those households, which
    may not otherwise be able to afford to accumulate sufficient income to afford a house. Also, FHA
    and VA loans are available at a lower interest rate and smaller down payments, which would, in turn,
    increase the mortgage. Other programs that help first time home buyers include density bonus given
    to developers within new housing tracts, which allow developers to construct smaller units to attract
    the first-time buyer.
•   Medium and medium-high density housing will be affordable to primarily low- and moderate-income
    housing. This type of attached dwelling unit with zero lot lines substantially reduces the cost of the
    home as compared to the typical detached single-family home.

    Above Moderate            100%            70%             20%
Table 5.4.D, below, shows that by applying these criteria, Delano can meet its need for low- and
moderate-income housing using available capacity under existing zone within the City limits. The
Specific Plan is currently producing new homes ranging from about $80,000 for 3-bedroom models
to $147,000 for a two-story, 3- or 4-bedroom model. Based on these price ranges, it is estimated that
about 50 percent of these new single-family homes are affordable to low-income households, and 50
percent are affordable to moderate-income households. No new models are priced at $157,000 or
higher, which is the threshold for above-moderate income households as indicated in Table 5.3.M.
Within the current City limits, there is a shortage of land for very low-income households. The
development capacity numbers in Table 5.4.D are an accurate portrayal of the quantity of units that
can be developed on vacant lands within the City of Delano under the current zoning ordinance. The
density used to calculate the development capacity is net acres, which includes any infrastructure
improvements required to the vacant parcels.

In addition, the City of Delano allows for homeless shelters in residential zones R-2, R-3 and R-4
multiple family zones and are subject to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit. Transitional
housing for the homeless can be placed in all motels, hotels, and churches. Farm worker housing is
permitted in R-A, R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones and also requires a Conditional Use Permit, per Section
20.12 of the Zoning Ordinance. The Conditional Use Permit procedure is identical to the
Conditional Use Permit review required for second units on single-family lots; or for more than one
single-family and/or multi-unit structure in the R-2, R-3, and R-4 zones requiring Conditional Use
Permit approval.
Essentially, the Conditional Use Permit procedure in multiple-family zones is the same as a site plan
review process whereby the City reviews the proposal for compliance with City standards and
adequacy as to building setbacks, parking landscaping and development standards set forth in the
zoning ordinance. No differentiation in procedures or standards is made as to whether the residential
proposal is multiple-family, more than one single-family structure on a parcel, designated farm
worker housing, emergency shelter, or transitional housing.
The City is in the process of an ordinance amendment that would re-designate the conditional use
permit procedure in multiple-family zones as a “site plan review” process. The focus of the new
procedure would not be on a discretionary review of permitted uses, but would center on
encouraging an effective and attractive design for projects. There would be no difference in
architectural or design standards applied to farm worker housing, transitional housing and homeless
shelters as compared with standard apartment residential construction.
In an attempt to minimize governmental constraints on housing for persons with disabilities, the City
of Delano allows for group homes for persons with disabilities in all residential zones. Delano
requires development pursuant to the Uniform Building Code, and does not maintain additional
building requirements that would hinder the development of housing for disabled residents. Also,
the City facilitates the development of housing for persons with disabilities by being able to waive
development standards for ADA retrofit projects.
c.       Limits to Physical Expansion of the City of Delano
The ultimate limits to Delano’s legal boundaries and urban expansion within its Planning Area are
dependent upon local political factors and geological characteristics.
City of Delano                                                                      December 2005
General Plan                                                                                    5-33

The City of Delano is surrounded by lands that are currently under County jurisdiction. Only some
of this land is suitable for annexation.
Delano’s Sphere of Influence, established by Kern County’s Local Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO) marks the City’s projected ultimate boundary. The Sphere of Influence is primarily a
planning tool that helps communities and public agencies project future service needs. The City has
no direct land use control within those portions of the Sphere of Influence that are outside of the City
limits.
The existing City Limit of Delano includes 6,467 acres (10.1 square miles). The City of Delano has an
urban area boundary, this is the ultimate development boundary for the community and the area in
which the City may comment on development proposals which are proposed by the County, and it is the
potential annexation area for the community. The Urban Boundary Element of the Delano General Plan
has several policies to control and direct growth. The City of Delano has adopted the following
policies:
1. First priority shall be given to development of vacant, underdeveloped, and/or redevelopable
    land where urban services are or can be made available. Parcels should be substantially
    contiguous to existing development.
2. Identify and use natural and man-made edges, such as local roadways, as urban development
    limits for growth phasing lines.
3. Utilize low density and estate residential land uses as a buffer and transition between long-term
    agricultural uses and high-density urban development.
4. Prohibit the premature conversion of agricultural lands where agricultural preserves are present.
5. Encourage the use of parks and open space to enhance gateways to the City.
5.4.3 LAND USE CONTROLS
The City of Delano exercises a number of land use controls that directly affect the development of
housing. Some of these programs place certain restrictions on housing development, while others
encourage housing production. It is the purpose of this section to evaluate the extent to which these
standards may facilitate or hinder the development of housing for all economic segments of the com-
munity.
a.       Density Bonus
The City adopted a density bonus ordinance in accordance with the existing provisions of State law.
The ordinance provides for a 25 percent density bonus for housing development that will meet one
of the following qualifications:
•   Housing Development for Lower Income Households: At least 20 percent of the units must be for
    lower income households.
City of Delano                                                                         December 2005
General Plan                                                                                       5-34

•    Housing Development for Very Low Income Households: At least 10 percent of the units must be for
     very low-income households.
•    Housing Developments for Senior Citizens: At least 50 percent of the units must be for qualifying
     senior citizen residents.
The ordinance states that a development will be given either a density bonus of 25 percent over the
otherwise maximum allowable residential density under the General Plan and zoning ordinance or
the City will provide other incentives of equivalent financial value based upon the land cost per
dwelling unit. Density bonuses are negotiated on a case-by-case basis between the City of Delano
and the developer. Where a development meets these qualifications, the ordinance requires the City
to provide at least one other regulatory concession and/or incentive, unless a finding is made that the
additional concession and/or incentive is not required to provide the affordable housing.
b.       Development Requirements
The City of Delano’s requirements for off-site improvements are standard for small communities
within Kern County. The off-site improvements within and adjacent to housing tracts include
standard street widths, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks and are in compliance with standards as defined
in the General Plan Circulation Element and the City’s Municipal Code. Water and sewer lines from
the development are required to be connected to the nearest city water and sewer main lines. Within
the City of Delano there are no infrastructure issues that would hinder residential development.
Required on-site improvements for residential development are determined largely by the zoning of
the property. There are four basic residential zoning districts in the City of Delano, corresponding to
General Plan land use designations:
•    Estate Residential;
•    Low Density;
•    Medium Density; and
•    High Density.
The Zoning Ordinance establishes lot dimension and setback requirements for structures in each resi-
dential zoning district. The required front setback is 20 feet to the garage and 15 feet to the front of
the house. Table 5.4.E shows the Zoning District Development Standards for Residential Zones in
the City. Table 5.4.F shows the Zoning District Development Standards for Commercial Zones in
the City. Table 5.4.G shows parking requirements for residential units as established by the Zoning
Ordinance. Delano’s requirements for on-site improvements as expressed in the Zoning Ordinance
are typical of California communities, and are not considered to be unusually restrictive as a
constraint on the development of housing.

c.      Building Codes
Building codes are not a serious constraint to residential development. Building inspections in
Delano are conducted by the City’s building inspectors, for approval of new construction for
occupancy, and to respond to specific complaints. New construction is required to meet the
standards of the Uniform Building Code, which was last revised in 1997.
d.      Minimum Size Requirements for Dwelling Units and Rooms
The City of Delano maintains minimum size requirements for dwelling units. There are no local
amendments added to the Uniform Building Code. The minimum size for dwelling units is
measured on the outside of walls, and excludes basements, garages, carports, exterior courtyards,
and porches. These are modest requirements and are substantially smaller than what is currently
being produced in market rate housing. Minimum dwelling unit sizes are as follows.
•   Single-family detached homes: ................................................................................. 800 square feet
•   Dwelling units within a multifamily structure:
        1 Bedroom........................................................................................................... 650 square feet
        2 Bedrooms ......................................................................................................... 800 square feet
        For each additional Bedroom in excess of 2 ....................................................... 120 square feet
“Efficiency” apartments (450 square feet) are permitted in areas designated in the General Plan for
“Medium,” “Medium High,” and “High” density residential development.
The City’s minimum room size standards are as follows:
    Room                                                                                                               Minimum Room Size
    Bedroom .................................................................................................................... 100 square feet
    Full bath (tub, toilet, and lavatory).............................................................................. 50 square feet
    Three-quarter bath (stall shower toilet, and lavatory) ................................................. 35 square feet
    Half bath (toilet and lavatory) ..................................................................................... 25 square feet
These standards are modest, and do not unreasonably add to the cost of housing within the City.
City of Delano                                                                                                                     December 2005

e.      Mobile Home and Manufactured Housing Development Standards
The City of Delano permits manufactured dwellings to be used as single-family residences outside of
designated mobile home parks if the home is certified under the National Mobile Home Construction
and Safety Act of 1974, and if it meets the following standards:
•   Front yard. No building structure or vehicle, except a recreation building, erected on or moved onto a lot
    shall have a height greater than one story or which exceeds 15 feet.
•   Rear yard. There shall be a rear yard depth of not less than 5 feet, or 15 feet when adjacent to any
    residential zone.
•   Roofed area. The total roofed area including mobile home and accessory buildings or structures shall not
    exceed 60 percent of the net area of the lot.
•   Side yard. There shall be a side yard of at least five feet on both sides, or 15 feet when adjacent to any
    residential zone.
•   Access. The subdivision shall have at least two means of ingress or egress leading to a public street.
These standards permit the placement of mobile homes that comply with federal HUD standards to
be sited on single-family lots upon permanent foundations. The intent of the ordinance is to ensure
that mobile home units are structurally safe and conform to (but not to exceed) the design standards
of the neighborhood.
f.      Second Dwelling Units
Within Rural (R-A), Low (R-1, R-1-5), and Medium (R-2) density residential zoning districts, the
City permits an additional dwelling unit to be sited on a parcel subject to approval of a Conditional
Use Permit and the following standards:
•   The conversion of a portion of a single-family unit whereby cooking facilities are not shared in
    common.
•   The addition of a separate unit onto the existing single-family unit.
•   The creation of a separate detached unit on the lot or parcel in addition to the existing single-
    family unit.
•   A detached mobile home or manufactured housing unit may be used as a second unit provided it
    is placed on a permanent foundation and meets all the requirements of Division 3, Chapter 7 of
    the Delano Zoning Ordinance.
•   The second unit shall clearly be a subordinate part or accessory to the existing single-family
    dwelling located on the lot or parcel. The second unit shall not be more than 60 percent of the
    existing single-family dwelling nor shall it ever exceed 1,200 square feet in size or contain more
    than 2 bedrooms. The minimum size for a second dwelling unit is 300 square feet of living area.
•   The second unit must maintain the scale of adjoining residences and blend into the existing
    setting by use of appropriate building form, height, materials, colors and landscaping appropriate
    to that setting.
•   No more than one second unit may be created within a single-family dwelling.
City of Delano                                                                               December 2005
General Plan                                                                                             5-38

•   One additional paved off-street parking space shall be provided for the second unit, which is in
    addition to the off-street parking requirements for the principal single-family home.
•   The additional dwelling is required to be metered separately from the main unit for gas, electric-
    ity, and water/sewer services.
g.       Processing and Permit Procedures
Development review also affects housing costs. Because of holding costs, the longer it takes for a
development proposal to be approved, the higher the development costs. For ministerial permits
there is a site plan check by the senior planner. Additionally, a plan check and fee assessment by the
Building Inspector takes place. This process typically takes less than 30 days. In the City of Delano,
an application for a residential project containing about 20 units typically requires a processing time
(from filing of the initial application to Final Map approval) of 90 to 120 days. However, actual
processing time varies according to the size and scope of the project, as well as the time taken by the
developer to prepare the final map, improvement plans, and other project-related documents. While
the City attempts to process development applications in a timely and efficient manner, some delays
are outside the control of the City. Delays in processing can occur if environmental review, pursuant
to California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), requires an EIR to be prepared. At times,
approval from State or other agencies may also be required for certain types of projects. The typical
application procedure for both single and multi-family residential units is as followed:
Single-Family Dwellings:
•   Floor plans, construction plans and Site or Plot Plan is submitted to the Building Permit Technician
    with a $100 plan check fee deposit.
•   Site Plan is sent to Planner for Zoning compliance review; either stamped approved or sent back
    for corrections.
•   Approved site plan is sent to Building Division; after corrections are submitted and approved,
    the technician collects and verifies payment of school fees, development impact fees per
    Ordinance, utility connections, and issues construction permit upon payment of permit fees.
•   Permit is valid for six months, if no work commenced and inspections requested, the permit
    approval expires and re-application and issuance of new permit is required if work is to continue.
Multiple-Family (attached) Dwellings:
•   Construction and Site Plans are submitted to the Building Permit Technician with a $250 plan
    check fee deposit.
•   Prior to plan check, the proposal is sent to Planning to determine CEQA status; if not exempt, an
    Initial Study is generally required for projects containing more than six units or two or more
    residential structures.
•   A conditional use permit is required in all R-2, R-3 and R-4 zones for residential projects
    containing more than five units in a single structure or more than one structure.
•   Project plans are circulated to all City departments and County Fire Department.

5.4.4            GOVERNMENTAL FACTORS
a.       Funding Availability
The City of Delano does not have the financial resources or sufficient staff to undertake major
housing assistance programs without substantial backing by Kern County, the State, and Federal
agencies. Existing funding for Federal and State programs is not sufficient to meet Statewide
demand, which, in turn, limits the City’s ability to meet its needs. Therefore, the limitations on
availability of outside assistance programs acts as a constraint to the provision of affordable housing.
b.       Public Services and Facilities
The provision of public services (especially water, sewers, and flood control) does not constrain the
production of new housing below the number projected by the current Regional Housing Allocation
Plan. Currently, State laws governing municipal funding limit the ability of cities to provide
infrastructure out of ongoing revenues. As a result, new development is generally required to “pay
its own way” with regard to public facilities such as water, sewer, drainage, parks, and roadway
facilities. In accordance with AB 1600, the City has enacted a development impact fee program to
ensure new development pays only for its impacts and not for existing deficiencies caused by prior
development.
The City of Delano, like many communities, has determined that its public works systems must not
be overburdened by new development. The City’s Wastewater Treatment Plant is at capacity, but
expansion is currently under way and will be completed within two years. Expansion of the City is
contingent upon the continued upgrading of the Wastewater Treatment Plant and system wide utility
upgrades. A 20-year capital improvements program that identifies and prioritizes such needs as
water main replacement, flood control, water storage, and sewage treatment plant expansion, as well
as parks, streets, and sidewalk replacement, provides a guide for allocating public funds in the most
productive directions.
c.       Fees and Exactions
The fees and exactions required of a development to pay for the public facilities associated with the
residential development pose a potential constraint to housing production. Two types of fees are
charged by the City of Delano, and discussed below: development impact fees and planning
processing fees. Table 5.4.H identifies the applicability of impact fees and Table 5.4.I lists the fee
amounts for each category. A comparison of planning fees to those charged in other Kern County
cities is found in Table 5.4.J.

A comparison of Delano’s typical residential planning fees in relation to nearby communities is
shown in Table 5.4.J. Delano, Wasco, and Shafter are small residential communities. It can be seen
from Table 5.4.J that Delano’s planning fees are generally comparable to other small cities in its
vicinity. Thus, fees and exactions do not pose a constraint on new residential development.
5.4.5            NON-GOVERNMENTAL FACTORS
a.       Land Costs
The price of land is a significant ingredient in the total cost of housing. Developed land costs
typically account for about one-quarter of the total cost of a home. Land costs in Southern
California and Kern County have consistently been increasing since World War II as a result of
inflation, increased demand due to population immigration, and decreasing land supply. This
increase has an adverse effect on the ability of households, particularly low- and moderate-income
households, to pay for housing.
Land costs of single-family residential lot in the City of Delano, as of 2001, typically are $12,000 to
$40,000, depending on the size of the parcel and the extent of improvements contained on the lot.
According to the most recent information available from the California Association of Realtors, re-
sales of typical single-family home prices in the City are priced at around $89,000. Based on these
estimates, land costs in the City represent from about one-quarter to one-third of the selling price of
a home. In addition, the housing market is capable of producing three-bedroom rental units that are
affordable to very low and low-income residents.
b.       Construction Costs
Construction cost increases, like land cost increases, affect the ability of consumers to pay for
housing. Construction cost increases occur due to the cost of materials, labor, and higher
government imposed standards (e.g., energy conservation requirements). Current construction costs
for a single-family home are roughly $55 to $65 per square foot. This is typical for Southern
City of Delano                                                                         December 2005
General Plan                                                                                      5-42

California, and does not present a significant constraint to the production of housing within Delano.
As noted above, the development community is currently producing market rate for-sale housing that
is affordable to moderate-income households and rental housing that is affordable to low-income
households.
c.      Availability of Financing
The availability of capital to finance new residential development is a significant factor that can
impact both the cost and the supply of housing. There are two types of capital involved in the
housing market: (1) capital used by developers for initial site preparation and construction, and (2)
capital for financing the purchase of units by homeowners and investors.
In general, financing for new residential development in Delano at the present time (2002) is readily
available at reasonable interest rates. The current low interest rates have proven to be a benefit to the
production of housing by facilitating affordable construction financing and mortgage rates.
Local Banks. There are seven local banks in Delano. As a result, there a variety of single-family
and multiple family home loans available in the Delano area. Interest rates are currently
competitive, and are similar to those available in other communities throughout the San Joaquin
Valley. Interest rates for single-family and multiple family construction loans are variable.
VA, FHA, and conventional loans are available. The local banks do not currently have any
programs specifically oriented toward the construction of affordable housing, other than those that
are sponsored by governmental agencies, such as the Community Reinvestment Act.
As a result of relatively low interest rates, local banks report that refinancing of existing homes has
been popular; however, such refinancing has not affected the availability of loans for home
purchases.
d.      Affordable Housing Financing
Funding for affordable housing currently requires financing for a first mortgage, second mortgage,
and equity. An overview of each funding source is presented in the following paragraphs.
First Mortgage. Because of their low rents, affordable housing projects are financially capable of
generating enough money to make monthly payments on only a relatively small first mortgage –
often as low as 20 to 25 percent of total project cost. For the first mortgage lender, subordinated
debt increases a project’s loan-to-value and debt coverage ratios to acceptable levels, reducing risk
and increasing the likelihood of obtaining private debt financing. The amount of the first mortgage
that can be supported is a function of the net operating income of the project. Tax-exempt bond
proceeds are sometimes used for permanent financing of low-income housing projects.

General Plan                                                                                        5-43

Second Mortgage (Gap Financing). A second mortgage is frequently necessary to partially fill the
gap between total project costs and the amount that can be supported by the first mortgage. A
below-market second mortgage provided by State or local governments or philanthropic
organizations, could be structured with a low interest rate, no interest deferred payments, or as a due-
on-sale loan.
The maker of the second mortgage often prefers subordinated debt rather than a project grant even
though the former entails added risk. The mortgage usually contains restrictions to ensure that the
property serves low-income families; otherwise it becomes due and payable. Local funds are often
used to provide “soft seconds” – mortgages whose principal and interest payments may be deferred
until cash flow is available or the project is refinanced or sold.
Equity. Equity, which is the money or capital invested in the project, reduces the amount needed to
be financed with a first and/or second mortgage. Although equity financing can be derived from
several sources, affordable housing partnerships depend greatly on the syndication of low-income
housing tax credits. Ownership of these projects is usually structured as limited partnerships;
corporate or individual investors are the limited partners who rely on the tax credits for market
returns.
Redevelopment Agency. The Redevelopment Agency has a City Council-approved budget of
$2,028,110 for 2001/2002 from expected “set-aside” funds. The projected expenditures throughout
the next planning period are expected to be similar to the 2001/2002 approved budget. This will
occur in several different programs: 1) the Housing Rehabilitation Program will spend $100,000, 2)
the First Time Home Buyers Program will spend $500,000 dollars. The exact number of units to be
rehabilitated with these funds depends of the number of applicants and the amount awarded to each
applicant (see Table 5.4.K).
Thus, several funding sources are necessary as part of a financing package for a low-income housing
development. In general, the following distribution per financing component as shown in Table
5.4.L is typical:

5.4.6           OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY AND WATER CONSERVATION
A discussion of energy conservation opportunities is required to be included in housing elements by
the California Government Code Section 65583(a)(7). Utilities and related energy expenditures are
a major component of a household’s total shelter costs. Within the City, 97.7 percent of all
households have some form of space heating 99.8 percent have complete plumbing facilities, and
99.9 percent have electrical connection according to 2000 census data. As an integral part of
providing housing, these utilities can represent a claim in household income ranging from 15 to 40
percent of total housing costs, or higher, considering current and anticipated increases in energy
costs. Thus, efforts to reduce energy and water consumption can significantly benefit Delano
households.
The most effective home conservation measures are those that reduce the biggest user of energy:
space heating. Most utility companies agree that actions to reduce air infiltration are the most cost-
effective ways of minimizing space-heating requirements. Weather-stripping, caulking, duct
wrapping and attic and wall insulation are all ways to reduce such energy consumption. In addition,
furnaces equipped with setback thermostats and electronic (“pilotless”) ignition can further reduce
costs. This is now required in all new residential construction by the Uniform Building Code.
Water heating is another major energy user. Insulation blankets for water heaters, pipe insulation,
and water saving showerheads are simple, add-on measures that can lower, both energy bills and
water consumption. More elaborate measures include solar water heating systems that supplement
the traditional water heater.
New housing construction is another area for ensuring efficient energy use. Homes that are sited to
maximize solar and wind orientation can significantly reduce long-term energy needs. Further, such
homes can be equipped with energy saving appliances which also lower energy and water
consumption. A balance must be achieved between the short-term costs of building energy-efficient
homes and the long-term benefits they provide. However, many design, construction, and
landscaping techniques are available which help reduce energy consumption. Some add little or no
cost to the housing unit, but have not been adopted by developers and contractors. Examples include
avoiding east- and west-facing lots, reducing north-facing window areas, using drought-resistant
landscaping, and employing paving materials that generate less heat.
Water conservation is a significant issue for both individual households and the City. Lower water
consumption reduces monthly bills, and extends the capacities of municipal water wells and the local
sewage treatment plant. More conservative landscape watering schedules and less wasteful watering
systems make significant contributions to lower water demand. Inside the home, low-flow
showerheads, low-flow toilets and efficient clothes and dishwashing appliances are useful in

stemming the need for water. However, by changing personal habits regarding water use (e.g.,
shorter showers, not pre-rinsing dishes, etc.), reductions in water use can be achieved at little or no
cost.
Presently, Southern California Gas offers conservation programs for homeowners, renters, and
landlords. Both companies participate in the State’s Residential Conservation Service, and provide
free energy audits to all households. Further, both companies offer cash rebates and low-interest
financing to help offset the cost of many conservation measures. In 1990, the City Council adopted
an ordinance requiring low-flow fixtures in all new development, and as a retrofit in certain
remodels.
5.5      GOALS, QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES, POLICIES, AND
         PROGRAMS
The intent of the Housing Element is to ensure that the housing needs of all economic segments of
the community will be met through the year 2007. The housing goals and policies included in the
Delano Housing Element, as well as the actions that the City will undertake to meet its housing
needs, are discussed in this Chapter. A summary of actions, including identification of funding
sources, responsible entities, and time frames for implementation, is also presented.
In evaluating the prior Housing Element, the City analyzed the programs it undertook, and evaluated
why implementation of some programs was more successful than others. Accordingly, the City has
included in this element those actions it believes can successfully be implemented and that reflect the
best use of the City’s limited resources.
Delano’s quantified housing objectives are presented below, along with housing goals, policies, and
implementing programs.
5.5.1 Quantified Objectives
The City of Delano has designed a number of implementing programs that will focus City resources
on meeting its projected housing needs. The City recognizes that there are a number of factors im-
pacting the provision of affordable housing, and will not be able to meet all projected needs during
the planning period. Accordingly, the City of Delano has identified its quantified objectives for new
construction and rehabilitation. Rehabilitation of existing units will be achieved through the City’s
efforts to link property owners with available financial assistance programs. Units that are rehabili-
tated are units that are converted from non-affordable to affordable by acquisition of the units or the
purchase of affordability covenants. The City’s conservation quantified objective is based upon
projected activities of the Redevelopment Agency and City efforts to assist and cooperate with non-
profit, private, and other public entities to preserve as well as provide additional affordable units.
The conservation of dwelling units requires one-to-one replacement of any housing units demolished
due to public or private action, the provision of stable zoning to preserve affordable housing, and the
long-term affordability restrictions on assisted rental units.

The City has established its quantified objectives on the basis of Kern Council of Governments
(Kern COG) regional housing needs projections for the City of Delano for the period of 2000-2007
(Table 5.5.A). Overall, it is the objective of the City of Delano that a sufficient number of market-
rate housing projects take advantage of the affordable housing incentives offered to these projects to
achieve 15 percent of the housing developed in the City being affordable to lower income
households (5% very low income, 10% low income).

COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
6.1     INTRODUCTION
The condition of the environment in which an individual lives, works, or plays and the experiences
of conducting activities within that environment is closely related to the individual’s perceived
“quality of life.” A resident will develop an image of a residential neighborhood by the condition
and appearance of other homes, by noise levels of adjacent roads, and by the proximity of the
neighborhood to activity centers. A visitor to the area will develop an image of the city based on the
appearance of uses in the city center, the convenience of tourist-oriented commercial uses, traffic,
parking availability, and directional signage. These experiences of the resident and visitor are a
response to the City of Delano’s urban design.
Community design refers to the form and function of the city which is perceived both physically and
psychologically. The design must be efficient, convenient, aesthetically pleasing, and responsive to
the need for clear identification and orientation. The focus of the Community Design Element is on
building design, architecture, streetscape design, and circulation.
The Community Design Element also addresses the design features of Delano that contribute to the
community’s image and perceived “quality of life.” The overall intent of this element is to establish
a framework for public and private sector decision-making with respect to the overall community
quality and character.
6.2     PURPOSE
The City of Delano is a rapidly growing area in Kern County in terms of population and
employment. The purpose of the Community Design Element is to guide Delano as it seeks to
maintain its desirable rural characteristics while gaining those benefits found in urbanized
communities. The goals, objectives, and policies of the Community Design Element address the
evolutionary nature of the city as well as the rural characteristics that have historically contributed to
a quality of life that residents seek to preserve and enhance.
The design guidelines will provide a framework to achieve quality and compatibility in the physical
design of the developing portions of the city, and to enhance existing developed areas. The design
City of Delano                                                                         December 2005
General Plan                                                                                        6-1

guidelines set forth general criteria for residential, commercial, and industrial/manufacturing
development, as well as for the downtown area.
The Community Design Element is not intended to be prohibitive and inflexible in nature, or to
discourage design solutions that are creative and appropriate for the use and the site. Rather, the
Element is intended to provide direction to landowners, architects, landscape architects, and
decision-makers in order to achieve compatible and quality site and building development. The
policies and guidelines shall encourage a public/private dialogue whereby creative and innovative
design solutions may be realized. At the same time, the Element provides an overall urban design
framework that identifies opportunities for the City to enhance the visibility and image of the
community.
6.3     AUTHORIZATION
The Community Design Element is not a state required element of the general plan. Government
Code Section 65302 allows local governments to adopt non-mandated elements which address issues
relating to the physical development of a city. Upon adoption, the Community Design Element will
have the same force and effect as the mandatory elements of the general plan.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
6.4     ASSESSMENT OF EXISTING URBAN FORM AND FUNCTION
The community’s aesthetics were identified as a significant factor in the community’s General Plan
evaluation. The community survey conducted for the General Plan identified the following issues,
with their relative ranking indicated:
1.      Lack of trees
2.      Gateways to the community were “ugly” and needed to be fixed up.
3.      Lack of landscaping in general for commercial, industrial and residential uses.
4.       “Chinatown” district (Block “H”) was “ugly,” and is the primary State Highway frontage.
5.      Bad Alleys and roads.
6.      Neighborhoods are poorly kept
Specific recommendations from the community with regard to community aesthetics included the
following:
1.      Change the appearance of Fremont, Glenwood, and streets next to the freeway.
2.      Change Chinatown; get rid of bars.
3.      Increase open space through a new 18-hole golf course.
4.      Downtown façade program and general business clean up
5.      Need better street landscaping.
6.      Create a park-like setting in the downtown.

City of Delano                                                                       December 2005
General Plan                                                                                      6-5

6.      The height and scale of new development should be compatible with that of surrounding
        buildings where a desirable pattern or character has been established. New development
        should provide a transition from the height of adjacent structures to the maximum height of
        new development.
7.      Tall dominating structures should be broken up by creating horizontal emphasis through the
        use of trim, awnings, eaves or other ornamentation, and by using a combination of
        complementary colors.
8.      All roof equipment shall be screened from line of sight from the ground level. Screening
        should be an integral part of the roof design and not appear as a “tacked on” afterthought.
        For flat roofs, a screen enclosure behind the parapet wall may be used if it is made to appear
        as an integral part of the structure’s design. Ground or interior-mounted mechanical
        equipment (with appropriate screening) is encouraged as an alternative to roof-mounting.
9.      Structures in pedestrian-oriented areas should provide continuous storefronts at the ground
        level front elevation.
10.     Entries should be protected from the elements and should create a focus or sense of entry for
        the building. Wall recesses, roof overhangs, canopies, arches, signs, and similar architectural
        features should be integral elements of building design calling attention to the importance of
        the entry.
11.     Vertical mixed use projects, where residential uses are located above commercial or office
        uses, or office uses located above commercial uses, are encouraged within the downtown
        area, redevelopment areas, and within planned developments..
12.     Buildings shall be designed with a precise concept for adequate signage. Signs shall be
        integrated into the design of buildings and should compliment the architecture. All signage
        should be compatible with the building and site design relative to colors, materials and
        placement, and shall respect established architectural and/or historical character.
13.     Monument-type signs are preferred over tall pole signs for business identification, wherever
        possible. Where several tenants occupy the same site, individual wall mounted signs are
        appropriate in combination with a monument sign identifying the development. Custom
        signs, which are unique and creative, are encouraged, provided that the style of the sign
        complements the style and design of the building. Historic signs that are in themselves
        architectural features shall be retained.
14.     The planting of street trees is encouraged for all existing and new commercial and industrial
        development.
15.     Buildings, landscaping, parking and other development features should be arranged in a
        manner that is compatible with the size, scale and appearance of nearby development.
City of Delano                                                                      December 2005

16.     Landscaped areas should be clustered on a site to maximize their effect on the public views.
17.     Landscaping should be used to define areas such as entrances to buildings and parking lots,
        define edges of various land uses, provide transition between neighboring properties
        (buffering), and provide screening for outdoor storage, loading and equipment areas.
18.     Landscaping should be in scale with adjacent buildings and be of appropriate size at maturity
        to accomplish its intended purpose.
19.     Areas of a site that are not utilized for parking, circulation, storage or other uses, shall be
        landscaped.
20.     Parking should be screened and is to be visually subordinate to the buildings on a site.
        Parking lots shall not overwhelm views of a site and shall incorporate landscaping for all
        areas not used for vehicle storage, access or circulation.
21.     Site planning should emphasize a strong relationship to the adjoining street(s) and encourage
        pedestrian circulation and access. Pedestrian access shall be separate from vehicular access,
        where feasible.
22.     Site plans shall provide safe and well-defined pedestrian connections from buildings to
        parking areas, from buildings to the adjoining street(s), and among buildings on the same
        site. Pedestrian connections between commercial development and surrounding residential
        neighborhoods should also be provided.
23.     Buildings, sidewalks, and parking lots should be located to minimize conflicts between
        pedestrian and vehicular circulation on a site.
24.     Loading and trash facilities shall be located where they may be adequately screened from
        public view (generally at the rear of the structures, away from the street).
25.     Long expanses of fence should be offset and architecturally designed to prevent monotony.
        Landscaped pockets and limited openings should be provided along said walls.
Objectives
B.      Ensure that industrial development is functional, attractive and of high-quality design, to
        enhance the image of the City.
Policies, Standards
1.      Establish site plan review procedures for all new industrial development, including
        provisions for building setbacks, lot coverage, parking, access and circulation, outdoor
        lighting, signage, and landscaping.
2.      Promote rehabilitation of appropriate industrial sites and investigate funding opportunities
        for rehabilitation/remodeling of small businesses.

        b.      Service, storage, and loading areas located out of public view from the street,
                generally at the rear or side of buildings;
        c.      Screening of outdoor storage and outdoor work areas and equipment;
        d.      Landscaping, signage and other features to emphasize the main entrance;
        e.      Landscaping within areas visible from public streets and paving for other areas not

                siding)
        g.      Mirror window glazing
        h.      Loading doors facing the street unless a screen wall is provided along the site’s
                frontage; and
        i.      Exposed roof drains that will be visible to the public.
6.      Where industrial development abuts non-industrial uses, appropriate buffering techniques
        shall be employed such as setbacks, screening landscaping, or some combination of these.

NOISE ELEMENT
7.1     INTRODUCTION
The Noise Element of a general plan is a comprehensive program for including noise control in the
planning process. It is a tool for local planners to use in achieving and maintaining compatible land
use with environmental noise level. The Noise Element identifies noise sensitive land uses and noise
sources, and defines areas of noise impact for the purpose of developing programs to ensure that City
of Delano residents will be protected from excessive noise intrusion.
The Noise Element follows the revised state guidelines in Government Code Section 653021(g) and
in Section 46050.1 of the Health and Safety Code. This Element quantifies the community noise
environment in terms of noise exposure for both near and long-term levels of growth and traffic
activity. The information will become a guideline for the development of land use policies to
achieve compatible land uses and provide baseline levels and noise source identification for local
noise ordinance enforcement.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
7.2     NOISE SOURCES
The existing noise environment in the City of Delano was determined by a combination of noise
level measurements and noise modeling. Following is a discussion of the background noise level
survey results in residential areas of the City, and a description of the studied noise sources in the
City.
7.2.1 Background Noise Level Survey
The purpose of the background noise level survey was to determine the base-line noise environment
in those parts of the City that are removed from obvious noise sources, such as busy roadways. Four
residences, located in various quadrants of the City, were selected for the survey. Noise
measurements were conducted continuously for 24 hours using unattended sound level analyzers
situated in the backyards of the residences.
City of Delano                                                                        December 2005
General Plan                                                                                       7-1
The background noise levels in terms of the Day/Night Average Level (Ldn) at the four residences
ranged from about 52 to 57 dB. These are typical noise levels in suburban residential
neighborhoods. The highest hourly noise levels usually occur in the daytime when human activity is
highest.
Lmax represents the highest (maximum) instantaneous noise level occurring during an hour. The Lmin
is the minimum instantaneous noise level during an hour, and the Leq is the energy equivalent or
average noise level during the hour. The sound level was obtained by using the A-weighting filter of
a sound level meter, expressed in decibels (dB). All sound levels referred to in this settings
document are in A-weighted decibels. A-weighting de-emphasizes the very low and very high
frequencies of sound in a manner similar to the human ear. Most community noise standards utilize
A-weighting, as it provides a high degree of correlation with human annoyance and health effects.
7.1.2 Major Stationary Noise Sources
The production of noise is an inherent part of many industrial, commercial and agricultural
processes, even when the best available noise control technology applied. Noise production within
industrial or commercial facilities is controlled indirectly by Federal and State employee health and
safety regulations (OSHA and Cal-OSHA), but exterior noise emissions from such operations have
the potential to exceed locally acceptable standards at nearby noise-sensitive land uses.
Noise exposure information for the major stationary noise sources selected for study by the City was
developed from operational data obtained from source operators (when available), noise level
measurements conducted at reference locations around the noise source, and file information. Only
existing noise levels are described since there are too many variables and unknown conditions to
predict future noise exposure.
The following discussions provide generalized information concerning the relative noise impacts of
each source, and identify specific noise sources which should be considered in the review of
development proposals where potential noise conflicts could result. Not all industrial noise sources
in the City are discussed. Unidentified industries or other major noise sources may exist, which
could generate significant noise levels and result in noise-related land use conflicts. Generalized 50
and 55 dBA hourly Leq noise contours were prepared for major stationary noise sources where it was
determined that such contours would be located off the property occupied by the source.
Carroll’s Tire Warehouse: This business is located at the intersection of Cecil Avenue and Quincy
Street. The main sources of noise in the store are banging and clanging, air tools, compressors and
grinding. These sources of noise are typical of tire dealers, brake shops and muffler stores. At a
distance of 50 feet the measured Leq was 63.0 dBA and the Lmax was 73.7 dBA. The hourly 50 and
55 dBA Leq are 223 and 125 feet from the store.
Delano Regional Medical Center: This medical facility is located north of Garces Highway east of
Lexington Street. Noise sources that are related to a medical facility are heating and ventilation
equipment and cars moving through parking areas. During the inspection of the facility on
December 11, 1997, it was not possible to distinguish equipment noise and car noise from
background noise levels off the site (principally Highway 99).
City of Delano                                                                         December 2005
General Plan                                                                                       7-2

Delano Energy Company: Located at the intersection of Pond Road and Highway 99, this facility
converts organic waste materials to energy. The principal noise source is the cooling towers located
on the south side of the plant. The towers operate continuously 24 hours a day. At a distance of 200
feet from the towers, the measured noise level in terms of Leq and Lmax were 67.6 and 70.3 dBA,
respectively. The 50 and 55 dBA Leq contours are 1,517 and 853 feet from the cooling towers.
Delano Logistic Services, Inc.: This distribution facility is located at the intersection of Lexington
Street and Shuster Avenue. The principal noise source on the site is slowly moving trucks. It was
not possible to distinguish noise from slowly moving trucks at a location off the site due to traffic
noise from Highway 99. Typical Lmax noise levels from slowly moving trucks are 70 – 73 dBA at 50
feet.
Delano Rock Company: This business is located between Highway 99 and High Street, and south
of Garces Highway. The typical noise sources in such a facility are the concrete batching
equipment, trucks operating a high idle while being loaded with concrete, truck movements on the
site, and front loaders scooping sand and gravel. At a site about 300 feet form the center of the plant,
measured Leq values were 67.6 dBA while all noise sources were in operation. The Lmax was
70.3 dBA. Single-family residences are located near the plant on the east side of High Street. The
50 and 55 dBA Leq contours are 2,028 and 1,140 feet from the plant.
Rail Noise: The mainline of the Union Pacific Railroad (formerly Southern Pacific) runs through
Delano in a north-south direction. Mostly commercial and industrial uses are located next to the
track. These uses are insensitive to noise. There are approximately 20 freight train operations per
day, uniformly distributed through a 24-hour day. The mean Sound Exposure Level (SEL) of Union
Pacific freight trains is about 95 dB at 125 feet. The Day/Night Average (Ldn) of trains was
calculated using train operation numbers and mean SEL values. At 125 feet, the Ldn is about 65 dB.
Near grade crossings where the horn is blown, the Ldn would be about 69 dB. The distance to the
60 and 65 dB Ldn contours is about 269 and 125 feet, respectively.
7.3     NOISE ELEMENT POLICIES
Objectives
A.      To protect the citizens of the City from the harmful and annoying effects of exposure
        to excessive noise.
B.      To protect the economic base of the City by preventing incompatible land uses from
        encroaching upon existing or planned noise-producing uses.
C.      To preserve the tranquility of residential areas by preventing noise-producing uses
        from encroaching upon existing or planned noise-sensitive uses.
D.      To educate the citizens of the City concerning the effects of exposure to excessive
        noise and the methods available for minimizing such exposure.
City of Delano                                                                         December 2005
General Plan                                                                                        7-3

E.      To emphasize the reduction of noise impacts through careful site planning and
        project design, giving second preference to the use of noise barriers and/or structural
        features to buildings containing noise-sensitive land uses.
Policies, Standards
1.      Table 7-A depicts the ranges of noise exposure from transportation noise sources, which are
        considered to be acceptable, conditionally acceptable, or conditionally unacceptable for the
        development of different land uses. Table 7-A shall be used to determine whether mitigation
        is needed for development of land uses near major transportation noise sources.
        a.      In areas where the noise environment is acceptable, new development may be
                permitted without requiring noise mitigation.
        b.      For areas where the noise environment is conditionally acceptable, new development
                will be required to define the site’s precise noise environment, and if needed
                incorporate appropriate mitigation into the design of the project to reduce noise
                exposure to the levels specified by the Noise Element.
        c.      For areas where the noise environment is conditionally unacceptable, it may not be
                feasible for new development to provide appropriate mitigation to achieve
                compliance with applicable noise standards. In such cases, other, more noise tolerant
                land uses would be more appropriate for the site and its noise environment.
2.      New development of noise-sensitive land uses shall not be permitted in areas exposed to
        existing or projected future levels of noise from transportation noise sources which exceed
        the noise levels specified in Table 7-1 for the given land use, unless appropriate mitigation is
        provided.
3.      Noise created by new transportation noise sources, including roadway improvement projects,
        shall be mitigated where feasible so as not to exceed the noise levels specified in Table 7-1.
4.      New development of noise-sensitive land uses shall be consistent with the noise level
        standards of Table 7-2, following the implementation of appropriate mitigation measures.
5.      New proposed stationary noise sources, or existing stationary noise sources which undergo
        modifications, shall not be permitted where the noise level exceeds the standards of Table 7-
        2 within the area being modified. The Delano Municipal Code shall be amended to conform
        to these quantitative standards.
6.      The preferred method of noise control for new development is thoughtful site design.
        Secondarily, noise control should be achieved through the use of noise barriers. Site and
        building design guidelines may include:

          normal conventional construction, without any special noise.
          CONDITIONALLY – New construction or development should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the
          noise reduction requirements is made and needed noise insulation features included in the design. Conventional
          construction, but with closed windows and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning will normally suffice.
          NORMALLY – New construction or development should generally be discouraged. If new construction or
          development does proceed, a detailed analysis of the noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise
          insulation features included in the design.
          CLEARLY – New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

        a.      The backyards of single-family residences should not back onto the primary noise
                source. Where this is not possible, the narrow portion of the building should face the
                primary noise source, and the interior layout should locate the most sensitive areas
                away from the noise source by placing garages, storage facilities, carports or other
                such areas nearest the noise source.
        b.      Patios and balconies of apartments should be placed on the side of the building
                opposite the noise source.
        c.      Commercial and industrial structures shall be designed so that noisy equipment is
                located as far as possible from noise-sensitive land uses, and/or is shielded by
                structures.
        d.      Two-story residential construction that is permitted immediately adjacent to major
                roadways, the railroad, or other significant noise source shall be required to
                incorporate adequate noise attenuation.
        e.      When possible, residential cul-de-sacs should be perpendicular to adjacent arterials
                or collectors.
        f.      Loading and unloading activities for commercial uses that are located near noise-
                sensitive uses should be conducted in an enclosed loading dock with a positive seal
                between the loading dock and trucks, and should be screened by a noise barrier and
                dense landscaping.
7.      Prior to approval of the proposed development in a noise impacted area, or the development
        of an industrial, commercial or other noise generating land use in or near an area containing
        existing or planned noise-sensitive land uses, an acoustical analysis may be required if:
        a.      The existing or projected future noise exposure at the exterior of buildings, which
                will contain noise sensitive uses, or within proposed outdoor activity areas (patios,
                decks, backyards, pool areas, recreation areas, etc.) may exceed 65 dB Ldn (or
                CNEL).
        b.      Interior residential noise levels resulting from offsite noise may exceed 45 dBA.
8.      When noise studies are necessary they shall:
        a.      Be the responsibility of the applicant.
        b.      Be prepared by an individual or firm with demonstrable experience in the fields of
                environmental noise assessment and architectural acoustics.
        c.      Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and
                locations to adequately describe local conditions.

        d.     Include estimated noise levels for existing and projected future (10-20 year hence)
               conditions, with a comparison made to the adopted policies of the Noise Element.
        e.     Include recommendations for appropriate mitigation measures to achieve compliance
               with the adopted policies and standards of the Noise Element.
        f.     Include estimate of noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have
               been implemented.
        g.     The acoustical analysis shall be prepared as early in the project review or permitting
               process as possible, so that noise mitigation measures may be an integral part of the
               project design rather than an afterthought.
7.4     DEFINITIONS
        a.     A-Weighted Sound Level (dB): The sound level obtained by using the A-weighting
               filter of a sound level meter, expressed in decibels (dB). All sound levels referred to
               in this policy document are in A-weighted decibels. A-weighting de-emphasizes the
               very low and very high frequencies of sound in a manner similar to the human ear.
               Most community noise standards utilize A-weighting, as it provides a high degree of
               correlation with human annoyance and health effects.
        b.     Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): The equivalent energy (or energy
               average) sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of approximately
               five decibels to sound levels in the evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and ten
               decibels to sound levels in the night before 7:00 a.m. and after 10:00 p.m. The
               CNEL is generally computed for annual average conditions.
        c.     Day/Night Average Sound Level (Ldn): The equivalent energy (or energy average)
               sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of ten decibels to sound
               levels in the night after 10:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m. The Ldn is generally
               computed for annual average conditions.
        d.     Equivalent Sound Level (Leq): The sound level containing the same total energy as a
               time varying signal over a given sample period. Thus, the Leq is a single-valued level
               that expresses the time-averaged total energy of a fluctuating sound level. For
               example, if 64 dB is measured for 10 minutes, 68 dB is measured for 20 minutes and
               73 dB is measured for 30 minutes, the 1-hour Leq is about 71 dB. The Leq is typically
               computed over 1, 8 and 24-hour sample periods.
        e.     New Development: Projects requiring land use or building permits, but
               excluding remodeling or additions to existing structures.
        f.     Noise-Sensitive Land Use:
City of Delano                                                                       December 2005

                 1.      Residential development, except temporary dwellings
                 2.      Schools-preschool to secondary, college and university; specialized
                         education and training.
                 3.      Hospitals, nursing and personal care
                 4.      Churches
                 5.      Hotels and motels, bed and breakfast facilities
         g.      Outdoor Activity Areas: Patios, balconies, and swimming pool areas of multi-family
                 dwellings; backyards of single-family dwellings; designated areas for outdoor
                 recreation and activity for hospitals, nursing and personal care facilities.
         h.      Stationary Noise Source: Any fixed or mobile source not preempted from local
                 control by existing federal or state regulations. Examples of such sources include
                 industrial and commercial facilities and vehicle movements on private property (e.g.,
                 parking lots, truck terminals, auto racetracks, etc.)
         i.      Transportation Noise Source: Traffic on public roadways, railroad line operations
                 and aircraft in flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by existing
                 federal or state regulations. However, the effects of noise from transportation
                 sources may be controlled by regulating the location and design of land uses affected
                 by transportation noise sources.

PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES
ELEMENT
8.1        INTRODUCTION
The Public Services and Facilities Element is intended to document information on the ability of the
City and other service providers to offer services and operate facilities at acceptable standards. In
response to the anticipated growth within and around Delano, the city has chosen to address the
maintenance and future provision of essential public facilities and services.
The Public Services and Facilities Element specifically addresses the following:
       Law Enforcement
       Solid Waste Disposal
       Health Services
       Schools
       Utilities
       Kern County Library System
       Public Transportation
       Fire Facilities
       Water System
       Sewer Collection and Treatment System
       Storm Drainage
8.2        AUTHORIZATION
Under state planning law, local governments have the discretion to adopt any other elements or
address any other subjects which relate to the physical development of the city. The City of Delano
has elected to incorporate certain public facilities and services within this Element. Once adopted,
goals, policies, and programs carry the same authority as those adopted for subjects contained in the
mandated elements of the general plan.
City of Delano                                                                       December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                               8-1

Environmental Setting
8.3         PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES
8.3.1       Law Enforcement
The City of Delano is patrolled on a 24 hour basis by the City operated Delano Police Department,
which currently consists of twenty patrol officers, seven reserve officers, five sergeants, and four
detectives. Between July 1997 and June 1998 the department responded to approximately 17,000
calls for service. The City operates under a mutual aid agreement with the Tulare and Kern County
Sheriff’s Departments.
The current Police Department level of staffing for the City's non-incarcerated 1998 population of
28,688 results in a ratio of 1.4 equivalent officers per one thousand population. In an average month,
there are currently 1480 calls for service. The Delano General Plan update identifies a staffing ratio
of 1.4 equivalent officers per thousand persons. Based on this policy and the 20-year population
growth projections described in the General Plan update, an additional 39 equivalent officers would
need to be hired to meet this increase in population at the current Level of Service.
8.3.2       Solid Waste Disposal
The City of Delano provides twice-a-week pickup of solid waste within the City limits. Residential
customers are billed $9.05 monthly for this service. This amount has not changed since 1993.
Approximately 24% of the past three year’s budgets for solid waste is allocated for capital expenses.
Of this amount, approximately 2% is allocated to new capital requirements, the balance is allocated
to replacement. Increase of the fee is expected since by 2020 the population is expected to have
doubled, and the city area increased. Further, the possible closure of the McFarland/Delano Transfer
Station at Stradley and Woollomes Avenues will require the city to deliver its solid waste to the
Shafter Landfill. Growth of the City combined with the consumption of vehicle time in trips to the
landfill will require that additional collection vehicles be purchased.
8.3.3       Health Services
Delano is served by the Delano Regional Medical Center. Several medical clinics also provide
private and public health care services within the City limits and three private convalescent
homes/hospitals provide a variety of levels of care for seniors and the infirmed ranging from assisted
living to full convalescent care. Specialized medical services are available within thirty minutes
from Bakersfield, within forty-five minutes from Visalia and within ninety minutes from Fresno.
8.3.4       Schools
The Delano Union Elementary School District and the Delano Union High School District provide
educational services. Table 8-1 presents the schools which currently serve the City of Delano.

      Design Capacity is defined by the DUESD as permanent structures and district owned relocatable classrooms.
2
      The DUESD is able to facilitate enrollment in excess of designed capacity at each site by implementing Multi-Track year-
      round Scheduling and adding leased relocatable classrooms.
A developer fee justification report prepared by the Delano Union Elementary School and Delano
High School District identified overcrowded conditions in all of Delano’s schools. This
overcrowding was compounded by recent passage of SB1777 and SB1789, which provided financial
incentives to schools, which were able to reduce class size in grades K-3 to a ratio of 20 pupils per
teacher, by February, 1997. The District proposed plans to reduce class size and relieve current
overcrowding by enlarging existing sites and adding relocatable classrooms. Future student
enrollment projections indicate new school sites will be needed to accommodate future development
and increased student enrollment. Current and future expansions will be funded through the State of
California, local property taxes and developer fees levied in accordance with State legislation.
The Delano Union School District and the City of Delano agreed in 1997 that the potential existed
for inadequate financing of needed new school facilities. These agencies agreed to evaluate land use
decisions based on:
1.    Preparation of a school impact analysis, including an assessment of the total cost per student of
      providing new school facilities.
2.    Requirement for certification from the school district for legislative land use changes that
      adequate school facilities exist.
3.    A legislative land use proposal shall only be allowed when the school district certifies that
      adequate school facilities are or will be available.
City of Delano                                                                                            December 2005

4.     Certain projects, including development agreements for commercial and industrial projects, are
       excluded from the above provision, provided they pay school impact fees authorized by State
       statute.
The Leroy Greene School Facilities Act of 1998, enacted by Senate Bill 50 and funded through the
$9.2 billion of Proposition 1A approved by voters in November 1998 has altered the relationship
between the city and the school districts. The Act essentially nullifies these procedures, and
identifies the school districts and the State as exclusively responsible for school impact mitigation.
The Greene Act also suspended the Mira, Hart, and Murrieta court cases for at least eight years, and
prohibited local agencies from denying land use approvals on the basis of school adequacy and
reinstated a school facility fee cap. The statutory fee for residential projects in 1998 is $1.93 per
square foot and $0.31 per square foot for commercial and industrial development. School districts
may impose additional fees under specific circumstances defined in the Greene Act. The city has
agreed to regularly review its role in school impact mitigation.
8.3.5       Utilities
Electricity – Edison International is the primary provider of electricity for the City of Delano. All
electrical services for the City are provided by a combination of inter-ties and substations. There are
currently no locally-produced power sources in Delano. Edison does not provide information
concerning existing or projected generating capacity for either Delano or Kern County, stating that it
fills capacity as applications for service are received. Although Edison remains the primary provider
of electrical services for the City of Delano, Federal utility regulations may allow for the entry of
other utility providers into the Delano market area.
Natural Gas - Natural gas is provided to urbanized areas of Delano by The Gas Company of
Southern California. This service can be provided only where natural gas pipelines have been
installed. The rural outskirts of the City do not have this service. Residents living in such areas who
run gas appliances must purchase bottled propane from one of several providers in the region (see
following section).
–Although the majority of the City of Delano is serviced by natural gas lines, certain rural areas are
not provided with natural gas service.. For those residents not directly served by such lines, bottled
propane or butane is necessary to run gas appliances. There are several providers who deliver bottled
gas to residential users who own or lease tanks on their property. Several providers sell bottled gas
from fixed storage tanks to consumers who bring small, portable tanks to the providers’ premises.

8.3.7      Fire Facilities
The City of Delano contracts with the Kern County Fire Department (KCFD) for fire prevention and
protection services. KCFD Stations 34 and 37, located at 1001 12th and 132 West 11th Avenues,
respectively, now serve the City of Delano. According to the Department, these two fire stations are
adequate to serve the current population. They are augmented by other KCFD resources in the
County, the nearest being in McFarland. More sophisticated services provided by the KCFD, such
as hazmat response equipment and personnel are also available for dispatch to the Delano area.
New fire facilities will be required to serve 2020 development. Their timing and placement is based
on a number of factors evaluated by the KCFD. These include the location of new development,
residential population density, and type of land uses constructed. The Safety Element of the General
Plan provides for one new fire company for each 14,000 to 15,000 residents. Based on a non-
incarcerated 2020 population of over 57,000, this indicates that at least two additional fire stations
will be required.
Delano is currently charged $1,100,000 per year with a 3% inflation adjustment for a five year
agreement for fire service with the KCFD. According to KCFD, the capital portion of this cost is
inconsequential. Stations added for population increment increases of 14,000 (per the standard in
the General Plan update) in 2010 and 2020 will require an additional $1 million each for land and
buildings.
8.3.8      Water System
The City of Delano is the water purveyor within the City. The Kern County Water Basin is the sub-
basin from which the City draws its water. This portion of the water basin historically has been
considered to be in an overdraft condition. Review of maps that track the change in groundwater
levels year to year somewhat confirm this assertion. The maps, prepared by the Kern County Water
Agency, show an annual drop in water surface elevation ranging from no change to a decrease of
approximately 30 feet. What greatly influences the groundwater elevation is the amount of surface
water that is available for agricultural use. During drought years, the agricultural entitlements from
the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP) are sharply curtailed, requiring
farmers to use groundwater for irrigation.
The City of Delano currently has nine wells in production, but only eight are available to meet the
water needs of the general City population. The ninth, Well 23, located at North Kern State Prison,
serves only the prison and is not connected to the City system. Capacities range from 775 gallons per
minute (gpm) to 2,000 gpm with an average of 1,284 gpm. Recently, two wells, Well 5 and Well 18
have been taken out of production due to the presence of DBCP and hydrogen sulfide, respectively,
in the water. This creates an odor and taste problem that requires treatment with chlorination prior to
being distributed for use. Table 8.2 summarizes the depth and capacity of each well that serves the
City of Delano.

                             Total                                    10,275 gpm
Based on Table 8.2, the City of Delano well system has the capacity of pumping 14.8 million gallons
per day (mgd; the equivalent of 10,275 gpm) for domestic use and fire suppression. The City is able
of storing 4.6 million gallons in aboveground storage tanks. In addition, 4.4 million gallons of
storage is located at North Kern Prison.
When analyzing the existing and future capacities of the Delano water system, the water demand
from North Kern State Prison will not be taken into account. This is because the prison effectively
has a dedicated water system and does not impact water delivery to the City, except for its
contribution to regional overdraft. The Delano Public Utilities Department has indicated that current
average water demand for the City is 6.3 mgd. The City estimates peak water demand as twice the
average demand; therefore currently the City of Delano’s well system is capable of supplying
enough water to handle the peak demand of 12.6 mgd.
The current water demand of the City is 220 gallons per capita per day. The City’s recent General
Plan EIR projects both average daily demand for water and peak water requirements for the City of
Delano, as shown in Table 8.3. The population figures in Table 8.3 were drawn from the General
Plan population projections and do not include the inmates housed at the prison.
                         Table 8.3: Future Water Demand for City of Delano
                   Year              Population        Average Demand     Peak Demand
                   1998                28,688              6.3 mgd           12.6 mgd
                   2000                31,975              7.0 mgd           14.0 mgd
                   2010                43,897              9.7 mgd           19.4 mgd
                   2020                57,390              12.6 mgd          25.2 mgd
                Source: City of Delano
As shown in Table 8.3, Delano will need to supply 25.2 mgd to meet the peak needs of its 2020
population. Subtracting the current production capacity of 14.8 mgd from the projected demand of
25.2 mgd, Delano’s net water requirement for 2020 growth is 10.4 mgd. This does not take into
account any industrial uses that could be heavy water users. Based on an average well production of
1,284 gpm per well, six new wells will be required by 2020 for new development. The City’s
approach to planning the water distribution system is to expand the existing grid pattern with 12-inch
water mains located on the section lines and 8-inch mains on the mid-section lines. If equipped with
City of Delano                                                                        December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                8-6

pressure-sustaining valves, this would build on the grid main system with reliable pressure zones.
The City has mapped the future locations for these needed wells and water mains.
As previously discussed, this portion of the Kern County Water Basin is generally considered to be
in an overdraft condition. Increased pumping of groundwater for domestic use will continue to
exacerbate this condition. As an aquifer is drawn down, the tendency for an increase in the presence
of hydrogen sulfides and other undesirable substances will decrease water quality. These
contaminants can be treated, however, and domestic water that meets water quality regulations can
be delivered to the City of Delano.
8.3.9       Sewer Collection and Treatment System
The City of Delano collects and transmits all domestic and industrial wastewater to the City’s
wastewater treatment plant located west of Delano on Lytle Avenue between Garces Highway and
Cecil Avenue. The plant also accepts the influent from North Kern State Prison, who funded a 0.8
mgd expansion to the treatment plant in the early 1990s. The current treatment plant, which provides
primary and secondary treatment of wastewater, has a capacity of 4.4 mgd and receives 3.9 mgd
from both the City of Delano and North Kern State Prison. The City of Delano generates 114 gallons
per capita per day of wastewater to be treated.
The plant was originally designed with a capacity of 3.6 mgd and can be expanded to a capacity of
7.2 mgd. The plant expansion constructed when the prison was built brought the plant to its current
4.4 mgd capacity. Table 8.4, which was included in the City’s recent General Plan EIR, projects the
amount of wastewater treatment plant capacity required for the projected population.
                     Table 8.4: Projected Wastewater Treatment Plant Demands
                           Year                 Population         Capacity
                           1998                   34,143           3.9 mgd
                           2000                   37,430           4.3 mgd
                           2010                   49,352           5.6 mgd
                           2020                   62,845           7.2 mgd
                         Source: City of Delano
Table 8.4 indicates that the City’s treatment and collection system is adequate to handle the expected
growth of the City through 2020, subject to the completion of planned treatment plant expansion to a
minimum capacity of 7.2 mgd. The City expects that additional land will be needed for plant
facilities to treat wastewater generated by the projected growth. In addition, the City currently does
not have the capacity to dispose of any additional effluent.
The City of Delano is currently working on an expansion of the wastewater treatment plant. The City
has contracted with Carollo Engineers for this expansion. The project is currently in the design
phase and is expected to expand the capacity of the treatment plant to at least a capacity of 7.2 mgd.
The expansion to the wastewater treatment plant includes the construction of a new trunk line to
convey existing and anticipated flows to the wastewater treatment plant. The existing collection
system needs to be upgraded at several locations throughout the City to bring the system up to future
City of Delano                                                                        December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                8-7

flows and standards. The upgrade and expansion consist of various upgrades and improvements to
equipment at the wastewater treatment plant. Also part of the wastewater treatment plant expansion
is the construction of a new effluent disposal gravity pipeline to convey the existing and projected
effluent flows, which have the potential to be delivered to the Alpaugh Irrigation District’s facilities.
Conveyance of effluent in this new pipeline is currently being designed by Carollo Engineers. In
addition, the City has planned additional sewer lines that will accommodate the anticipated growth
within the City. However, it should be noted that the City’s wastewater treatment collection system
does not have the ability to serve lands east of Driver Road. Likewise, the City will not be able to
provide future service east of Driver Road without significant infrastructure expansions and
upgrades, which are beyond the current scope of work of Carollo Engineers.
The current wastewater infrastructure projects are being funded by development impact fees and
connection fees. However, the City will also be considering a rate increase in Fiscal Year 2005-
2006 to ensure adequate funding for both the expansion project and for operations and maintenance
of the entire wastewater collection and treatment system.
8.3.11     Storm Drainage
Incremental storm drainage will be necessary as urban development occurs. As is currently the
practice, water will be surface drained approximately 160 acres of residential land before needing to
pick up the flow with a storm drain pipe. Basins would be constructed that will accept up to 640
acres of drainage through a combination of surface flow and storm drains. This enables the basins to
be of sufficient size to be effective recreation areas during the non-rainy seasons. One acre-foot of
retention would be needed for each 20 acres of developed residential land. This means that every
section will need to retain 32 acre-feet of drainage. The Development Cost and Fee Study Report
prepared for this General Plan listed the needs and associated costs.

11.     Temporary drainage facilities such as ponding basins may be constructed by the developer if
        the major facilities are not available, subject to City determination and approval. The
        developer will also be required to pay all applicable drainage fees in addition to constructing
        temporary facilities at his own cost.
12.     Temporary drainage facilities such as retention basins shall be dedicated to the City. If the

SAFETY ELEMENT
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
9.1     INTRODUCTION
California’s geological and climatic composition creates an array of scenic and ecological wonders.
While these natural conditions make our state unique and aesthetically pleasing, the potential for
natural-related catastrophes becomes greater. Subsequently, the State of California has experienced an
increasing number of earthquakes, fires, floods, landslides, and other natural hazards during the past
two decades.
In 1971, the state legislature amended the California Government Code to include two additional
mandatory elements to the general plan requirements. Thus, the Seismic Safety Element and the
Safety Element were incorporated as part of the mandatory elements that must be adopted by all cities
and counties.
Under Section 65302(f) of the Code, the Seismic Safety Element must consist
        ...of an identification and appraisal of seismic hazards such as susceptibility to
        surface ruptures from faulting, to ground shaking, to ground failure or to the
        effects of seismically induced waves as tsunamis and seiches. The seismic safety
        element shall also include an appraisal of mudslides, landslides, and slope stability
        as necessary geologic hazards that must be considered simultaneously with other
        hazards such as possible surface ruptures from faulting, ground shaking, ground
        failure and seismically induced waves.
Section 65302.1 requires the Safety Element to provide
        ...for the protection of the community from fires and geologic hazards including
        features necessary for such protection as evacuation routes, peak load water
        supply requirements, minimum road widths, clearances around structures, and
        geologic hazards mapping in areas of known geologic hazards.
Because the consequences of natural hazards are inter-related, the Seismic Safety Element and
Safety Element will be prepared jointly as a single issue of concern. This Safety Element of the
City of Delano                                                                        December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                9-1

Delano General Plan will identify and discuss various hazards that presently occur and those that
potentially threaten the Delano Planning Area and Kern County.
The intent of the Safety Element is to reduce and minimize the economic, social, and physical
disruption created by natural geologic dangers. In this portion of the General Plan, various measures
will be discussed to improve the protection of public health, safety, and welfare of the community
against the geologic, fire, and flood hazards. Ultimately, this element will increase public awareness
about the danger of natural hazards.
9.2      FRAMEWORK
The Safety Element of the General Plan, which combines the mandated Safety Element and Seismic
Safety Element, is structured in the following manner:
A.       Identification of seismic and other geologic hazards as well as fire and flood hazards
         commonly found in Kern County.
B.       Assessment of geologic, seismic, and fire hazard potential in the Delano Planning Area.
C.       Assessment of levels of acceptable risks to life and property by local residents in the Delano
         Planning Area.
D.       Identification of major safety hazard issues.
E.       Outline of safety hazard policies that will help reduce the geologic and natural dangers that
         threaten the health and safety of the community.
F.       Listing of Safety Hazards Action Programs that are to be implemented to insure the attainment of
         safety hazard policies and to improve the protection of the residents from destruction and
         damage of natural and geologic occurrences.
9.3      TYPES OF SAFETY HAZARDS
9.3.1 Seismic-Related Hazards
Fault Displacement
Fault movement is theorized to result from "Elastic Rebound." Under this theory of quake movement, a
fault is incapable of movement until strain has built up in the ground on either side. The continual
shifting of the earth's crust also creates additional strain on the fault. Rocks on the surface and subsurface
become deformed but hold their positions. Finally, the accumulated stress will become too great for the
rocks to resist and the earth quickly snaps into an unstrained position.
This process of a slow build-up and sudden release within masses of rocks creates the shock waves we
know as earthquakes.
City of Delano                                                                                December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                        9-2
There are several faults throughout California, most of which are extinct and long dormant. However,
those faults that are active or potentially active pose a great danger to both man and the environment. A
major problem for geologists and technicians is identifying where the next displacement will occur along
a particular fault. Faults usually consist of a system of branch and secondary faults.
Ground Shaking
One of the major hazards caused by seismic activity is ground shaking. When the elastic strains are
transferred from potential energy to kinetic energy, the sudden movement is so great that the resulting
shaking motion may send damaging shock waves miles away. Ground shaking is commonly found in
areas underlain with soft, loose, water-saturated sediments. In areas with large amounts of alluvial soils,
the potential for serious damage to structures, especially tall buildings, is significant. Without structural
reinforcements to help withstand the strong lateral movements, the vibrations of the earthquake tremor
can incur destruction to life and property.
9.3.2 Geologic Hazards
Liquification
Liquification is a natural process whereby water in unconsolidated sand or other granular elements are
subjected to pressure generally caused by ground motion. While the granular sand is compressible, the
water is not and, thus, seeks to be released. As the fluid begins to move out of the materials, the sand
loses its strength. The reaction is similar to the properties of quicksand. In areas where liquefied materials
are in large underground layers, the occurrence virtually results in the ground flowing out from
underneath the buildings. This geologic hazard is potentially dangerous in areas subjected to high
seismic activity during the wet seasons of the year. It can also occur in some areas with shallow water
tables.
Erosion
Land erosion is a natural process which wears down the materials of the earth through weathering and
fragmentation. Another type of erosion called lakeshore erosion is caused by natural and manmade
wave motion. In instances where erosion is induced by seismic activity, the natural phenomenon is
likely to occur on gentle to steep slopes covered with unconsolidated sediments. Landslides, tilting, and
offsetting along fault zones are examples of natural situations that aggravate this geologic hazard.
Losses from this geologic hazard can be minimized through efficient engineering design, proper
grading and drainage, and periodic removal of sediments from drainage systems and basins.
Flooding
Flooding is a natural phenomenon caused by an overwhelming volume of water rising above its normal
waterline and spreading over the land. Flooding may result in failure of dams, canal banks, or irrigation
systems. In some cases the presence of landslides block drainage channels, streams, and rivers. Much
of the damage caused by flooding is a result of residential and commercial structures located within a
floodplain.
City of Delano                                                                               December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                       9-3
Land Subsidence
Land subsidence is a type of ground failure that is related to seismic activities, such as ground shaking.
This hazard is created by the removal of large volumes of fluids from underground reservoirs and
hydrocompaction, the addition of surface water to certain types of soils. The result is a sinking or
collapse of the soil structure in the affected area. Land subsidence increases the maintenance problems
on roads, underground utilities, and canals. Common mitigating practices include injecting water into
the ground to raise the water table and reducing ground pumpage from the affected water table.
There are four types of subsidence in Kern County. These subsidence causations are identified as
tectonic activity, withdrawal of groundwater, extraction of oil and gas, and hydrocompaction of
moisture-deficient alluvial deposits.
Tectonic subsidence is recognized as the long-term slow sinking of the San Joaquin Valley trough. It is
not apparently noticeable and is significant only over a geologic time period.
Subsidence caused by withdrawal of groundwater is the major form of subsidence in the Delano area.
Water from subterranean tables is being extracted at a rate faster than it can be replenished, thus causing
a decline of the water levels. This problem is evident in many parts of Kern County and should be of
major concern. Subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal should be reduced and regulated,
especially in urban areas. As a result of groundwater subsidence, areas south of Bakersfield and in other
parts of the County have experienced a lowering of the ground level.
Subsidence caused by oil and gas extraction is considered insignificant and is not a serious concern.
The State Division of Oil and Gas guards against hazardous extraction levels by: 1) monitoring
subsidence in oil and gas fields; 2) regulating oil and gas withdrawals; and 3) repressuring the fields.
Subsidence caused by hydrocompaction of alluvial deposits is another form of subsidence found in
Kern County. This collapse of the soil structure occurs in near-surface strata where rainfall or other
moisture has not penetrated during a long period of time. Areas with moisture-deficient alluvial
deposits can cause considerable damage and thus, should be mapped, studied, and evaluated.
Landsliding
This natural hazard is also associated with earthquake activity. Landslides are defined as the relatively
rapid downslope movement of soil, rock, and rock debris as a mass. The rate of this downslope
movement of materials may vary, ranging from speeds of twenty miles per hour to one inch per year.
Although landslides can be identified with seismic activity, these hazards are commonly related with
irregular topography, soil with high ground failure and areas disturbed by human activity.
9.3.3 Fire Hazard
Home Fires
There are various reasons for the cause of home fires. Most are related to human behavior: cooking,
smoking, heating, misuse of matches, and unattended fireplaces are examples of common causes for
City of Delano                                                                            December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                     9-4
home fires. The danger of home fires is increased when wood-shingled roofs, wooden exteriors, slim
setbacks, and woodpiles are present.
Indoor Public Assembly Facilities
Facilities that are utilized to accommodate large groupings of people pose a unique fire hazard for the
occupants. Because the people are generally unfamiliar with the surroundings, the potential for a mass-
panic situation is of major concern. Examples of these indoor public assembly facilities include
churches, theatres, auditoriums, and restaurants. In some instances, the buildings do not adhere to
present fire regulations.
High Fire Potential Buildings
Some hazardous buildings have a higher potential for fire loss and damage than others. These fire
hazardous buildings permit fires to spread quickly within the structures. The characteristics of these
structures include obsolete heating and ventilation systems, inadequate wiring, no fire walls, and open
stairwells. Usually, high fire potential buildings are older residential and commercial structures.
Brush Fires
Brush fires are a very serious fire hazard both in and out of a city's jurisdictional boundaries. These fires
usually occur in the warmer months of the year. When the planted or natural vegetation begins to dry in
the summer heat, the danger is quite significant because the potential fuel of a brush fire upon ignition is
tremendous. Property owners with homes adjacent to uncleared vacant lots become the unknowing
targets of city brush fires.
9.4      RISK ACCEPTANCE
The Safety Element emphasizes misfortunes caused by natural or unforeseen occurrences. In this
respect, a hazard can be defined as an unexpected disaster or accident, occurring in a random fashion.
Because of the uncertainty of its occurrence, it becomes difficult to evaluate the hazard and establish an
appropriate risk factor to the hazard.
In preparing these mandated issues of concern, the State of California requires that local governments
specify the "level or nature of acceptable risk to life and property." While no society is deemed "hazard-
free," an attempt must be made to establish appropriate levels of safety for the community, even though
the proper planning response may be of a judgmental nature. The potential for natural and man-made
hazards are continually present, but through public policy and acceptable mitigating measures, the
consequences can be minimized.
Subsequently, risk can be seen as "the degree of probability of a hazardous occurrence." Due to the
unpredictability of a hazardous occurrence, the planning perspective is one of policy statements that is
politically and economically acceptable to the general public and the local government.
City of Delano                                                                             December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                      9-5
There are many aspects that must be considered by the public when acceptable risk is being discussed.
        Economics. The early methods of determining acceptable risk levels dealt with the relationship
         of losses to earthquake intensity (Mercali scale). Variability in earthquakes and other factors
         make this type of risk evaluation relatively inadequate. While minimal losses can be attained
         through increased cost, risk will be acceptable when the public is no longer willing to pay
         additional costs.
        Cognizance. Risks taken unknowingly are very different from risks taken with full awareness.
         The public should be aware of all identified hazards and the risks that surround each specific
         hazard. It must be the duty of the proper public agencies to provide the necessary information
         which will assist the public in determining the risk levels.
        Mitigation. Losses can be reduced through a variety of methods. Demolition, relocation,
         alteration, and use activity changes are some of the ways damage can be minimized.
        Equality. No one should be subjected to additional risk without receiving an increase in benefit.
         The public should be treated fairly and equally with appropriate levels of risks and benefits being
         distributed evenly.
In conclusion, the public can express their feelings on risk acceptance to their councilmen, planning
commissioners, and staff. They themselves can decide how much risk they are willing to accept. Many
decisions concerning acceptable risk are personal that each individual must make privately. Therefore, it
becomes very improbable for the governing body to determine what level of risk all citizens should
accept. It will be important to determine appropriate public policy on this issue.
9.5      EXISTING CONDITIONS
Seismic Activities
Kern County is recognized as a high seismic activity area in California. Several major fault lines and
their branches criss-cross much of the county. Included in this list are the San Andreas Fault, the Garlock
Fault, the Sierra Nevada Fault, White Wolf Fault, Kern Canyon Fault, and Breckenridge Fault. Because
of the geologic conditions, the land is susceptible to moderate and severe ground shaking.
Most of the earthquake epicenters and fault lines are located in eastern and southwestern Kern County.
Delano is located in the northwestern part of the county. Three minor earthquake epicenters have been
designated ten miles southwest of the City. The Pond-Poso Fault Line has been identified six miles
southwest of the City. This fault line traverses the area in a northwesterly-southeasterly direction.
Although the Pond-Poso Fault has been associated with seismic activity, all of the recorded activity has
been to the southwest of the fault line and, therefore, not in the Delano area. The magnitude of these
tremors has been in the relatively mild range of 3 to 4 on the Richter Scale. It is thought that this fault
represents no serious threat to the activities in the area.
City of Delano                                                                             December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                      9-6

Two minor sub-surface faults running in a northwest-southeast direction through Delano have been
identified by William H. Park, Registered Geologist. These two sub-surface faults are located 6,000 and
7,000 feet below sea level. There is no evidence that either of these faults exists on the surface or will
have any adverse effects on urban development. As a result, ground shaking potential and fault
displacement potential are both low. It must be noted that Delano has not experienced any severe
seismic-related activity.
9.6      GEOLOGIC ACTIVITIES
Liquefaction
Liquefaction does not pose a serious threat in the Delano area. There are no known shallow water tables
in the area and no significant ground motion activity. There have been no reported incidents of
liquefaction hazards in the Delano Planning Area.
Erosion
The hazardous potential of soil erosion is minimized by the low slope grades in the Delano area. The
land is flat and no hills or mountains are found in the immediate area. Most of the land has been
cultivated and used for urban development or agricultural production. However, wind erosion is
prominent in the area due to the agricultural activities in the area.
Flooding
Delano is situated at the base of the Sierra Nevada Foothills. While the geographical setting of the
community reduces the significance of flood hazard in the area, flooding problems do exist in certain
sections of the community. Ponding is the major flooding problem in Delano with the High Street Pool,
the 20th Avenue Pool, the Rag Gulch being identified as flood hazard areas. As the storm water flows
through the city in an east to west direction, the elevated Southern Pacific Railroad that runs north to
south obstructs water movement from continuing westward. Thus, water is collected in these areas east
of the railroad tracks.
The 20fl' Avenue Pool is located between 18`h Avenue and County Line Road while the High School
Pool is bounded by 8th Avenue and Cecil Avenue. Conversely, the Rag Gulch flows to the west through
the agricultural land from the Friant-Kern Canal. As the water flow approaches Delano, it produces
shallow sheet flooding across the airport during high flow periods.
Flood hazard areas are determined by calculating the number of occurrences of flood events at a certain
magnitude during designated recurrence intervals. Subsequently, the recurrence interval represents the
long-term, average period between floods of a specific magnitude. Hence, a flood hazard area denoted as
having 100-year flood capabilities is expected to be equaled or exceeded once on the average during a
100-year period.
As illustrated in Figure 4-3 of the General Plan, the incorporated areas of Delano were divided into
various flood potential zones. According to a Draft Flood Insurance Study - City of Delano prepared
City of Delano                                                                           December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                   9-7
by Boyle Engineering Corporation in the early 1980's, only two types of zones were identified as having
flood hazard characteristics. These zones are listed below:
        Zone AH: Special Flood Areas inundated by types of 100-year shallow flooding and ponding
         where depths are between one and three feet. This area is defined as south of County Line Road,
         between the railroad and Girard Street, extending south between the railroad and High Street to
         8th Street.
        Zone B: Areas between the Special Flood Hazard Areas and the limits of the 500-year flood;
         areas subject to certain types of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are less than one foot.
         This area consists of the Delano Airport vicinity east of the railroad.
Land Subsidence
Land subsidence activity in the Delano area is quite limited. Of the four identified subsidence
classifications, only subsidence caused by withdrawal of groundwater is significant. Tectonic
subsidence, oil and gas-extracted subsidence, and subsidence caused by hydrocompaction of moisture-
deficient alluvial deposits is minimal or non-existent.
The only significant subsidence activity in the Delano area is from the withdrawal of groundwater. The
City receives its domestic water supply to serve its residents from groundwater water wells. In addition,
most of the area's economy is dependent on the agricultural production industry. Several agricultural
wells have been constructed on land surrounding the City to irrigate the table grapes, cotton, alfalfa, and
other crops. As a result of heavy demand on the groundwater supply, land subsidence in the area is
evident. One possibility of reducing the rate of subsidence from groundwater loss is utilizing Friant-
Kern Canal for domestic purposes.
9.7      FIRE-RELATED ACTIVITIES
Structure Fires
The Kern County Fire Department (KCFD), under contract with the City of Delano, responded to
103 fires between July 1995 and July 1998. This includes 81 residential fires, 14 fires in commercial
structures, and 8 fires in places of assembly. The prevalent cause of first two categories of fires was
electrical short circuits or other electrical failures. The prevalent cause in the last category was arson.
The dry hot climate which is common in agriculturally-productive areas in the San Joaquin Valley and
the older housing stock in the community also contributed to the number of total fires involved.
Homeowner awareness and the strict enforcement of the municipal code will continue to play key roles
in fire prevention throughout the City.
Indoor Public Assembly Facilities
Several buildings in Delano are used for public congregation and assemblage. Churches, school
auditoriums, and commercial conference rooms as well as restaurants, nightclubs, movie theatres, and
social halls are utilized to house large gatherings of people. Some of these buildings were constructed
before the new building codes were adopted. In these instances, the electrical wiring and building
City of Delano                                                                             December 2005
General Plan Update                                                                                     9-8

construction would be considered inadequate when measured by the present building codes. The
Building Department continually inspects many of these buildings to guard against massive panic
situations during times of fire.
High Fire Potential Buildings
Most of the high fire potential buildings are older residential and commercial structures located
throughout the City. The former type of hazardous buildings generally house low-income families or
the elderly. Meanwhile, the commercial structures with high fire potential are family retail and service
establishments dating back several years. Many of these buildings have been inspected in recent years
and upgraded to meet state and local fire regulations.
Agriculture Fires
The geographical location of Delano and the type of economic base of the community allows the area
to be very susceptible to fire fueled by agriculture material. Many crops begin to dry in the summer
heat, thus increasing the potential for agriculture fires. Although the KCFD does not currently record
these types of fires, the 1982 General Plan update noted that the then-Delano Fire Department
responded to over 170 agriculture fire incidents in the previous three years. To guard against
agriculture fire potential, the State of California enacted the Public Resources Code Clearance law of
1963. The Clearance Law established the minimum clearance of flammable vegetative growth around
structures, especially in brush-and-tree-covered watershed areas. Locally, the City's Weed Abatement
Program is used to enforce removal of dry grass and debris from vacant city lots. The County of Kern
also maintains fire breaks and weed clearance programs aimed at reducing the volume and the intensity
of fire fuel.
9.8      SAFETY HAZARD ISSUES
Issues that are related to seismic, geologic, and fire hazards must be identified before the goals,
objectives, and policies of this element can be established. The following issues affect the City of
Delano and the Delano Planning Area:
1.       Adequate water supply for fire protection. Sufficient water quantity and water pressure
         must be maintained to aid fire-fighting units in controlling fires. This is extremely important
         during the summer months when resident usage is high. The City water system with its water
         wells, storage tanks, and intricate pipelines must continue to distribute adequate water pressure
         to proposed and existing projects.
2.       Community acceptance to a certain degree of risk. The citizens must be willing to accept a
         certain amount of risk from seismic, geologic, and fire hazards. Although there are methods to
         greatly minimize hazardous consequences, the costs become prohibitive.
3.       Continual subsidence from groundwater removal. Land in the Delano Planning Area is
         continually experiencing subsidence because of the removal of groundwater for agricultural
         production and human consumption. The gradual lowering of the surface may create adverse

General Plan Update                                                                                    9-9
        long-term effects. More efficient water usage and the possibility of tapping into the FriantKern
        Canal system to serve domestic needs are two of the alternatives that could be considered to
        alleviate the subsidence hazard.
4.      Agriculture fire dangers within the City and throughout the Delano Planning Area.
        Several neighborhoods located around the perimeter of the City are subject to the dangers to
        agriculture fires. Control of dry weeded areas is important for the protection of the houses in
        close proximity. Vacant lots in the City also pose a fire safety problem.
5.      Cognizance of known seismic activity potential within Kern County. Although no active
        fault lines are noted in the Delano Planning Area, several dangerous fault lines exist within
        Kern County. The San Andreas Fault, the Garlock Fault, the White Wolf Fault, and the Sierra
        Nevada Fault pose a significant potential problem for county residents. Measures must be
        taken to inform the people and to reduce the impacts of destructive seismic activity.
