1       Introduction
1.1     PURPOSE AND CONTENTS
The Lodi Housing Element is part of the City’s General Plan, which is a comprehensive policy
statement regarding the physical, economic, and social development of the city; the
preservation and conservation of natural and human features of the landscape, and the re-use
of land and buildings within the city. Although housing represents a high priority, planning for
housing must be balanced with the community’s economic needs and environmental, resource,
and open space protection policies, which are also essential aspects of the City's General Plan.
Whereas general plans often reflect planning periods 15-25 years long, housing elements are
updated every five to eight years, in accordance with State law. This Housing Element coincides
with an update to the Lodi General Plan and is therefore an integral part of the updated
document.
The Housing Element addresses one of the State-mandated General Plan topics and most basic
human needs: shelter. For this reason the Housing Element represents a critical link between
land use and transportation policies, which define the location, layout, and movement of
people and goods, and environmental/resource policies. For a city to have a strong and
balanced economy, where people live in proximity to where they work, workers must have
places to live within their economic means.
The Housing Element contains three parts following this introduction:
     x  Chapter 2: Community Profile contains an analysis of population, housing, and em-
        ployment characteristics and trends; the needs of special population groups such as se-
        niors, large families, and persons with disabilities; indicators of unmet need, such as
        overcrowding, overpayment, substandard housing, and the potential loss of affordable
        rental housing; and future housing construction needs. The purpose of the community
        profile is to characterize existing conditions and unmet housing needs among Lodi’s
        current residents and to plan for future residents in the city.
     x  Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints addresses the opportunities and challenges to
        meet the housing needs identified in the community profile. Resources include the
        availability of land, adequate sites to meet housing needs, public and private organiza-
        tions that provide housing and supportive services, and funding to implement the
        City’s housing strategy. Constraints include the impacts of government action on hous-
        ing availability and affordability, the interaction of market forces, infrastructure, and
        environmental conditions. This analysis focuses on the magnitude of potential con-
        straints and identifies measures to remove them.
     x  Chapter 4: Housing Strategy identifies goals, policies, programs, and quantified objec-
        tives to meet identified housing needs, reduce constraints on housing availability and
        production, and make effective use of available resources. As part of its strategy, this
        section defines the responsible agencies, timeframes, and the anticipated results of the
        programs.
     x  Appendix A: Accomplishments describe achievements during the previous Housing
        Element planning period (2001 to 2009), including housing units constructed or avail-
                                                1-1

                                    DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
          able for development and implementation of programs and policies. Lessons learned
          from these accomplishments have been used to revise policies and programs.
1.2       COMMUNITY CONTEXT
This section describes Lodi’s community and demographic context in brief; Chapter 2:
Community Profile provides further details.
According to the 2007-2014 Regional Housing Needs Allocation Plan prepared by San Joaquin
County Council of Governments, Lodi should plan to accommodate 3,891 additional
residential units between 2007 and 2014. Of those residential units, 1,621, or 42%, should be
affordable to extremely low-, very low-, or low-income households. It should be emphasized
that this is the amount of housing the City should plan for; actual amounts of housing built will
be influenced by broader economic forces, including the recent national and regional economic
downturn. Potential impacts of market factors, as well as City policies and regulations, are
examined in Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints.
Between 2000 and 2008, the city’s population increased by 11%. By comparison, Tracy and
Manteca, similarly sized cities, grew 43 and 35%, respectively, while the population of Stockton
grew 19% during this period. Since 2000, population growth in Lodi has been concentrated in
children (0-4 years) and people between the ages of 45 and 64.
Although historically San Joaquin County has been known for its agriculture and food
processing industries, in 2007 the sectors that accounted for the greatest shares of total employ-
ment were trade, transportation and utilities (17%) and government (14%). Between 1992 and
2007, the following sectors saw the greatest increases in the number of jobs: construction,
professional and business services, education and health services, retail trade, and
transportation/warehousing/utilities. A high percentage of Lodi residents (54%) work outside
the community, reflecting regional employment interdependencies.
Lodi residents earn 91% of the countywide median income, according to the 2005-2007
American Community Survey. Despite having lower incomes than the county as a whole, city
residents have a local poverty rate that is similar to that of San Joaquin County. Moreover, the
poverty rate in Lodi is slightly lower than it was in 2000 (shrinking from 17 to 15%).
Lodi’s housing stock is composed primarily of single-family homes. The total number of
housing units increased from 21,381 in 2000 to 23,353 in 2008—a 9% change. The majority of
new units are single-family detached homes, composing 96% of the new stock added since
2000. There is an overall lack of construction of townhomes, duplexes, small- and medium-
sized apartment buildings, which often represent more affordable rental housing. Of occupied
housing units in Lodi, 55% are owned and 45% are rented. The vacancy rate between 2000 and
2008 has remained unchanged at 3% for both rental and ownership housing units, according to
the Department of Finance. A vacancy rate of 5% is considered to be “normal”; a vacancy rate
less than 5% indicates a tight market in which households may not be able to find vacant units
that fit their needs.
Lodi has experienced a growing gap between housing costs and local incomes. In recent years,
there has been a substantial increase in the number of households paying more than 30% of
their incomes for housing. In 2000, 44% of renter households overpaid for housing; by
                                                 1-2

                                 Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
comparison, 58% of renter households overpaid according to the 2005-2007 American
Community Survey three-year estimate. In 2000, 24% of homeowners overpaid for housing
costs; that number increased to 38% in 2005-2007. Rent-restricted housing affordable to lower-
income households is limited in Lodi. However, given recent shifts in the economy—a
reduction in home sale prices and an increase in unemployment and potential decrease in
household income, the extent of overpayment is not known.
1.3      STATE REQUIREMENTS
Beginning in 1980 and refined periodically, the California Legislature adopted requirements for
the contents of housing elements (California Government Code sections 65580 to 65589.5).
The contents of a housing element, as mandated by State law, include:
    x    An assessment of housing needs that includes an analysis of population and housing
         characteristics, employment and population projections, special housing needs, subsi-
         dized rental housing at-risk of conversion, future housing construction need (regional
         housing allocation), and opportunities for energy conservation;
    x    An analysis of constraints (governmental and non-governmental) to the maintenance
         improvement, or development of housing for all income levels;
    x    An inventory of vacant and underutilized sites by zoning category, with an assessment
         of the availability public facilities, and services to those sites; and
    x    A housing strategy containing an evaluation of past program achievements, goals, and
         policies, and a schedule of implementing actions with quantified objectives.
Although State law regarding housing elements requires communities to address the needs of
all residents, particular attention in the housing element law is devoted to the needs of
extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income households. Specifically, State law requires housing
elements to:
    x    Identify adequate sites to facilitate and encourage housing for all income levels;
    x    Remove governmental constraints to housing production, maintenance, and improve-
         ment;
    x    Assist in the development of adequate housing for low- and moderate-income house-
         holds;
    x    Conserve and improve the condition of existing affordable housing; and
    x    Promote housing opportunities for all persons.
1.4      DATA SOURCES AND THEIR USE
A variety of local, regional, State, federal, and private sources of information were used to
prepare the Housing Element. As required by State law (Government Code Section 65584), the
principal source of information used to determine future housing construction need is the San
Joaquin County Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the 2007 to 2014 planning period.
Other principal sources of information included the U. S. Census Bureau, American
Community Survey (typically the 2005-2007 three-year estimate), California Department of
Finance, the California Employment Development Department, the City of Lodi, San Joaquin
                                                    1-3

                                     DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
County, California Association of Realtors, local nonprofit organizations serving special needs
populations, local housing developers, residents, and local real estate and property
management firms.
1.5      PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The Housing Element was prepared in parallel with an update to the General Plan; extensive
General Plan public participation activities addressed the topic of housing. The City
encouraged participation by all segments of the community in the preparation of the Housing
Element through a combination of general public notices and direct contacts with
organizations serving low-income and special needs groups.
GENERAL PLAN OUTREACH
The General Plan Update was initiated in October 2006. In order for the General Plan to
accurately address community needs and values, the City undertook a comprehensive public
process of obtaining the input of residents, business and property owners, and City officials.
This process involved the sharing of information and ideas between elected and appointed
officials, City staff, planning consultants, and community members. Community members and
stakeholders participated in the planning process through several medium over the course of
three years, including a citywide survey, public workshops and meetings, stakeholder
interviews, newsletters, and a project website. Housing was a key issue in all of these public
participation activities.
The first community workshop was held in June 2007. Participants were given a chance to
brainstorm their visions for the future of Lodi and share their thoughts on issues concerning
land use, community design and development, and transportation. Input was also solicited
through a citywide survey, interviews with stakeholders, and meetings with decision-makers.
Memos and published reports were prepared to summarize feedback and then incorporated
into three “sketch plan” land use scenarios, which included various configurations for
residential development that would accommodate a range of income levels. An open house
workshop was held in May 2008 to inform community members about the effects of various
development scenarios and to solicit feedback on a preferred alternative. In addition, meetings
with more than 20 business and community groups were held in 2008 to solicit feedback on the
alternatives. Comments sent to City staff were also collected, reviewed, an integrated, as
appropriate. Following community feedback, a “preferred” land use plan was prepared.
During the General Plan outreach process, comments related to housing included: varying
opinions on building affordable housing in Lodi; varying opinions on appropriate residential
densities; support for mixed use development and development Downtown; concerns about
residential development in existing agricultural areas; desire to continue the allowance of gated
communities; desire for more senior housing; desire for more moderate income housing; and
support for the existing Growth Management Ordinance.
HOUSING ELEMENT OUTREACH
Stakeholder Forum
In addition to the outreach combined with General Plan Update, the City conducted direct
public outreach to individuals and organizations representing a broad spectrum of the
                                                 1-4

                                Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
community, particularly organizations representing lower-income and minority residents. The
City issued mailed notices/invitations prior to a July 22, 2009 stakeholder meeting to
representatives of the following organizations and groups. Ten stakeholders attended.
    x   Frontier Community Builders
    x   Service First of Northern California (Neighborhood Stabilization Program Developers
        for Lodi)
    x   Lodi Improvement Committee
    x   LOEL Foundation (senior center)
    x   Farmers & Merchants Bank
    x   Habitat for Humanity
    x   Tokay Development
    x   Visionary Home Builders (non-profit affordable housing developer)
    x   PAM Development (for-profit affordable housing developer)
    x   Colliers International Commercial Brokerage
    x   Housing Authority of San Joaquin County
    x   Community Partnership for Families
    x   Habitat for Humanity
    x   Lodi Boy's & Girl's Club
    x   Lodi Unified School District
    x   City Council and Planning Commission
    x   Community leaders
    x   Property owners
These organizations include the primary groups that provide services to lower-income and
special needs residents in Lodi. These organizations also serve individuals with limited English
proficiency. Following the stakeholder forum, a memo summarizing the findings was prepared.
Comments were organized into four categories and included the following:
    1. Housing needs: senior affordable housing, tenants for rental housing, Section 8 vouch-
        ers, homeless services, migrant workers/family housing, and supportive housing for
        persons with disabilities.
    2. How to promote affordable housing: fix perception program, develop mixed-income;
        encourage TOD Downtown, develop incrementally, and consider rehabilitation of ex-
        isting units into affordable units, as opposed to new construction.
    3. Constraints: housing rehabilitation, neighborhood resistance, developer reluctance,
        conditions of approval/plan review process, and infrastructure (e.g. sewer).
                                                 1-5
                                    DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
    4. Programs and services: need for more project-based Section 8, tax credits are competi-
        tive, lending market is tight, and need for housing assistance programs (e.g. first time
        homebuyers program has been successful).
This organization allowed for easy translation between stakeholder comments and the
preparation of the Housing Element. For example, feedback from stakeholders, specifically
non-profit and for-profit developers, about the City’s plan review process and impact fees
directly informed those analyses in Chapter 3: Constraints. Similarly, to alleviate negative
perceptions about affordable housing, the City developed a program (Program 4.4 in Chapter
4) to educate community members about the purpose, need for, design, and impact of
affordable housing.
Public Review and Hearings
On May 27, 2010, the City announced the availability of the Draft Housing Element on the
City’s website. Contact information for the Community Development Director was provided.
Any substantive comments received were evaluated and incorporated, as appropriate. On June
24, 2010, the Planning Commission held a public hearing on the Housing Element to accept
public comments. One community member spoke favorably on the Housing Element. No
changes were recommended by the public.
1.6     GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY
To promote a uniform and compatible vision for the development of the community, the
General Plan must be internally consistent in its goals and policies, as required by California
Government Code Section 65300.5. Government Code section 65583(c) requires that a housing
element describe how consistency has been achieved among the general plan elements. The
most important aspect of consistency among general plan elements is that policies and
implementation measures do not conflict, but support one another, to achieve the overall goals
and vision of a general plan. Since the Housing Element preparation coincided with the City’s
comprehensive General Plan Update, policy measures were developed in parallel. As a result,
the City has concluded that the Housing Element is consistent with the vision of the General
Plan. Policies included in other General Plan elements that affect housing are summarized
below.
LAND USE ELEMENT
LU-P3       Do not allow development at less than the minimum density prescribed by each
            residential land use category, without rebalancing the overall plan to comply with
            the “no net loss provisions of state housing law.”
LU-P4       Maintain the highest development intensities downtown, and in mixed-use
            corridors and centers, with adequate transition to Low-Density Residential
            neighborhoods.
LU-P6       Locate new medium- and high-density development adjacent to parks or other
            open space, in order to maximize residents’ access to recreational uses; or adjacent
            to mixed-use centers or neighborhood commercial developments, to maximize
            access to services.
                                                1-6

                           Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
LU-P18 Encourage medium- and high-density residential development in downtown by
       permitting residential uses at upper levels; and east and northwest of downtown, as
       depicted on the Land Use Diagram, by identifying vacant and underutilized sites
       that are appropriate for redevelopment.
LU-P24 Guide new residential development into compact neighborhoods with a defined
       Mixed-Use Center, including public open space, a school or other community
       facilities, and neighborhood commercial development.
LU-P26 Require a master or specific plan in areas with a Mixed-Use Center and adjacent
       complementary uses, as a condition of subdivision approval. Uses should include
       neighborhood commercial, civic and institutional uses, parks, plazas, and open
       space—consistent with Land Use Diagram (unless any of these uses are found
       infeasible and/or alternative locations are available to carry out mixed-use policies).
       Streets should adhere to the pattern depicted on the Land Use Diagram.
LU-P27 Provide for a full range of housing types within new neighborhoods, including
       minimum requirements for small-lot single family homes, townhouses, duplexes,
       triplexes, and multi-family housing.
GROWTH MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE ELEMENT
GM-G4  Provide public facilities—including police and fire services, schools, and libraries—
       commensurate with the needs of the existing and future population.
GM-P2  Target new growth into identified areas, extending south, west, and southeast.
       Ensure contiguous development by requiring development to conform to phasing
       described in Figure 3-1 [of the General Plan]. Enforce phasing through permitting
       and infrastructure provision. Development may not extend to Phase 2 until Phase 1
       has reached 75% of development potential (measured in acres), and development
       may not extend to Phase 3 until Phase 2 has reached 75% of development potential.
       In order to respond to market changes in the demand for various land use types,
       exemptions may be made to allow for development in future phases before these
       thresholds in the previous phase have been reached.
GM-P3  Use the Growth Management Allocation Ordinance as a mechanism to even out
       the pace, diversity, and direction of growth. Update the Growth Management
       Allocation Ordinance to reflect phasing and desired housing mix. Because unused
       allocations carry over, as of 2007, 3,268 additional permits were available.
       Therefore, the Growth Management Allocation Ordinance will not restrict growth,
       but simply even out any market extremes.
GM-P4  Update allocation of units by density to ensure that development density occurs as
       recommended in Chapter 2: Land Use. For instance, approved permits should be
       allocated to provide 45.4% of permits for low density, 27.3% medium density, and
       27.3% high density/ mixed use housing during phase 1. This represents a shift
       towards slightly more medium and high density housing in Lodi.
                                           1-7

                              DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
GM-P5  Update impact fee system to balance the need to sufficiently fund needed facilities
       and services without penalizing multifamily housing or infill development.
GM-P6  Annex areas outside the existing sphere of influence to conform with development
       needs for Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3. Subsequent phases shall be annexed as
       current phases reach development thresholds.
GM-P8  Ensure that public facilities and infrastructure—including water supply, sewer, and
       stormwater facilities—are designed to meet projected capacity requirements to
       avoid the need for future replacement and upsizing, pursuant to the General Plan
       and relevant master planning.
GM-P9  Coordinate extension of sewer service, water service, and stormwater facilities into
       new growth areas concurrent with development phasing. Decline requests for
       extension of water and sewer lines beyond the city limit prior to the relevant
       development phase and approve development plans and water system extension
       only when a dependable and adequate water supply for the development is assured.
GM-P11 Prepare master plan documents as necessary during the planning period to address
       the infrastructure needs of existing and projected growth, and to determine
       appropriate infrastructure provision for each phase. Existing master plan
       documents should be used until new master plans are developed, and updates
       should occur as follows:
       x   A sanitary sewer system master plan should be undertaken soon after General
           Plan adoption. In particular, this master plan should address how to best pro-
           vide sewer service for the growth on the east side of the city and for infill devel-
           opment, and to determine if additional wastewater flows will need to be di-
           verted into the proposed South Wastewater Trunk Line.
       x   A citywide stormwater master plan should be prepared soon after General Plan
           adoption to confirm or revise existing planning studies.
       x   A White Slough Water Pollution Control Facility master plan should be com-
           pleted during the early stages of Phase 1, most likely in 2013 or 2014.
       x   A recycled water master plan was prepared in May 2008 and is current as of
           2009. It may be appropriate to update this document when the next WSWPCF
           master plan is prepared, in 2013 or 2014, to evaluate the feasibility of construct-
           ing a scalping plant to provide recycled water for use within the city.
       x   A potable water supply and distribution master plan is not urgently needed, as
           of 2009. Future planning should be completed as necessary.
       x   The Urban Water Management Plan should be updated on a five year basis in
           compliance with State of California mandated requirements. Future plans
           should be developed in 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030.
                                           1-8

                          Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
COMMUNITY DESIGN AND LIVABILITY ELEMENT
CD-P1  Incentivize infill housing—within the Downtown Mixed Use district and along
       Mixed Use Corridors—through the development review, permitting and fee
       processes.
CD-P2  Ensure that Zoning and Subdivision ordinances include measures that guide infill
       development to be compatible with the scale, character and identity of adjacent
       development.
CD-P26 Focus new growth, which is not accommodated through infill development of
       existing neighborhoods, in easily-accessible and pedestrian friendly neighborhoods
       that include neighborhood-oriented commercial, public services such as schools
       and parks, and residential uses.
CD-P38 Promote location and siting of buildings that minimizes energy use by features
       such as enhancing use of daylight, minimizing summer solar gain, and use of
       ventilating breezes.
CD-P39 Design any City-owned buildings or City- owned buildings that are proposed for
       new construction, major renovation to meet the standards set by LEEDTM or
       equivalent.
CD-P40 Prepare, or incorporate by reference, and implement green building and
       construction guidelines and/or standards, appropriate to the Lodi context, by 2012.
       The guidelines and/or standards shall ensure a high level of energy efficiency and
       reduction of environmental impacts associated with new construction, major
       renovation, and operations of buildings. Ensure that these guidelines/standards:
       x   Require documentation demonstrating that building designs meet minimum
           performance targets, but allow flexibility in the methods used.
       x   Exceed California’s 2005 Title 24 regulation standards for building energy effi-
           ciency by 15%, with particular emphasis on industrial and commercial build-
           ings.
       x   Reduce resource or environmental impacts, using cost-effective and well-
           proven design and construction strategies.
       x   Reduce waste and energy consumption during demolition and construction.
       x   Identify street standards, such as street tree requirements, appropriate
           landscaping practices, and acceptable materials.
       x   Incorporate sustainable maintenance standards and procedures.
       x   Promote incorporation of energy conservation and weatherization features in
           existing structures. Develop programs that specifically target commercial and
           industrial structures for energy conservation and weatherization measures in
           order to reduce annual kWh per job.
       These guidelines could be developed directly from the LEED (Leadership in Energy
       and Environmental Design) system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council,

        green building program.
TRANSPORTATION ELEMENT
T-P1    Ensure consistency between the timing of new development and the provision of
        transportation infrastructure needed to serve that development. Regularly monitor
        traffic volumes on city streets and, prior to issuance of building permits, ensure that
        there is a funded plan for the developer to provide all necessary transportation
        improvements at the appropriate phase of development so as to minimize
        transportation impacts.
T-P2    Review new development proposals for consistency with the Transportation
        Element and the Capital Improvements Program. Ensure that new projects provide
        needed facilities to serve developments, and provide all needed facilities and/or
        contribute a fair share to the City’s transportation impact fee.
T-P21   Work cooperatively with the Lodi Unified School District on a “safe routes to
        schools” program that aims to provide a network of safe, convenient, and
        comfortable pedestrian routes from residential areas to schools. Improvements may
        include expanded sidewalks, shade trees, bus stops, and connections to the
        extended street, bike, and transit network.
T-P35   Require community care facilities and senior housing projects with more than 25
        units to provide accessible transportation services for the convenience of residents.
PARKS, RECREATION, AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
P-P2    Provide open space to meet recreation and storm drainage needs, at a ratio of eight
        acres of open space per 1,000 new residents. At least five acres must be constructed
        for park and recreation uses only. Drainage basins should be constructed as distinct
        facilities, as opposed to dual-functioning park and drainage basin facilities.
P-P3    Pursue the development of park and recreation facilities within a quarter-mile
        walking distance of all residences.
P-P5    Update the City’s Open Space and Recreation Master Plan, as necessary to:
        x    Arrange a distribution of open spaces across all neighborhoods in the city;
        x    Ensure that parks are visible and accessible from the street, to the surrounding
             neighborhood, and citywide users; and
        x    Provide a variety of open spaces and facilities to serve the needs of the commu-
             nity, ensuring a balance between indoor and outdoor organized sports and oth-
             er recreation needs, including passive and leisure activities.
P-P7    Work with developers of proposed development projects to provide parks and
        trails, as well as linkages to existing parks and trails.
                                              1-10

                          Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
P-P19 Require master planned residential communities to dedicate parkland consistent
      with General Plan standards. In-lieu fees will only be acceptable where an
      exemption from providing a neighborhood park facility would not adversely affect
      local residents because an existing park is nearby.
P-P20 Address park dedication and new development impact fees as part of the Zoning
      Ordinance and Subdivision Regulations Update, to ensure compliance with the
      General Plan park and open space standard.
CONSERVATION ELEMENT
C-P3  Support the continuation of agricultural uses on lands designated for urban uses
      until urban development is imminent.
C-P5  Ensure that urban development does not constrain agricultural practices or
      adversely affect the economic viability of adjacent agricultural practices. Use
      appropriate buffers consistent with the recommendations of the San Joaquin
      County Department of Agriculture (typically no less than 150 feet) and limit
      incompatible uses (such as schools and hospitals) near agriculture.
C-P17 For future development projects on previously un-surveyed lands, require a project
      applicant to have a qualified archeologist conduct the following activities: (1)
      conduct a record search at the Central California Information Center at the
      California State University, Stanislaus, and other appropriate historical
      repositories, (2) conduct field surveys where appropriate and required by law, and
      (3) prepare technical reports, where appropriate, meeting California Office of
      Historic Preservation Standards (Archeological Resource Management Reports).
C-P37 Promote incorporation of energy conservation and weatherization features into
      existing structures. Update the Zoning Ordinance and make local amendments to
      the California Building Code, as needed, to allow for the implementation of green
      building, green construction, and energy efficiency measures.
C-P38 Encourage the development of energy efficient buildings and communities. All new
      development, including major rehabilitation, renovation, and redevelopment
      projects, shall incorporate energy conservation and green building practices to the
      maximum extent feasible and as appropriate to the project proposed. Such
      practices include, but are not limited to: building orientation and shading,
      landscaping, and the use of active and passive solar heating and water systems. The
      City may implement this policy by adopting and enforcing a Green Building
      Ordinance.
C-P41 Encourage the use of passive and active solar devices such as solar collectors, solar
      cells, and solar heating systems into the design of local buildings. Promote
      voluntary participation in incentive programs to increase the use of solar
      photovoltaic systems in new and existing residential, commercial, institutional, and
      public buildings.

C-P42   Continue to offer rebates to residential, commercial, industrial and municipal
        customers of Lodi Electric Utility who install photovoltaic (PV) systems or that
        participate in the Lodi Energy Efficient Home Improvement Rebate Program.
        Ensure that rebate programs are well advertised to the community and offer rebates
        that are sufficient to gain community interest and participation.
C-P43   Work with the California Energy Commission and other public and non-profit
        agencies to promote the use of programs that encourage developers to surpass Title
        24 Energy Efficiency standards by utilizing renewable energy systems and more
        efficient practices that conserve energy, including, but not limited to natural gas,
        hydrogen or electrical vehicles. Offer incentives such as density bonus, expedited
        process, fee reduction/waiver to property owners and developers who exceed
        California Title 24 energy efficiency standards.
SAFETY ELEMENT
S-P6    Prohibit new development, except for public uses incidental to open space
        development, within Zone A (100-year flood zone) of the most current FEMA
        floodplain map (see Figure 8-1 [in the General Plan] for the most current map).
S-P10   Require that all fuel and chemical storage tanks are appropriately constructed;
        include spill containment areas to prevent seismic damage, leakage, fire and
        explosion; and are structurally or spatially separated from sensitive land uses, such
        as residential neighborhoods, schools, hospitals and places of public assembly.
S-P11   Ensure compatibility between hazardous material users and surrounding land use
        through the development review process. Separate hazardous waste facilities from
        incompatible uses including, but not limited to, schools, daycares, hospitals, public
        gathering areas, and high-density residential housing through development
        standards and the review process.
S-P22   Require new development to include grading and erosion control plans prepared
        by a qualified engineer or land surveyor.
NOISE ELEMENT
N-G2    Protect sensitive uses, including schools, hospitals, and senior care facilities, from
        excessive noise.
N-P4    Discourage noise sensitive uses such as residences, hospitals, schools, libraries, and
        rest homes from locating in areas with noise levels above 65db. Conversely, do not
        permit new uses likely to produce high levels of noise (above 65db) from locating in
        or adjacent to areas with existing or planned noise-sensitive uses.
N-P5    Noise sensitive uses, such as residences, hospitals, schools, libraries, and rest
        homes, proposed in areas that have noise exposure levels of “conditionally
        acceptable” and higher must complete an acoustical study, prepared by a
        professional acoustic engineer. This study should specify the appropriate noise
        mitigation features to be included in the design and construction of these uses, to
        achieve interior noise levels consistent with Table 9-3 [of the General Plan].
                                            1-12

                         Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
N-P6  Where substantial traffic noise increases (to above 70db) are expected, such as on
      Lower Sacramento Road or Harney Lane, as shown on the accompanying graphic
      [see General Plan], require a minimum 12-foot setback for noise-sensitive land
      uses, such as residences, hospitals, schools, libraries, and rest homes.
N-P14 Reduce vibration impacts on noise-sensitive land uses (such as residences,
      hospitals, schools, libraries, and rest homes) adjacent to the railroad, SR-99,
      expressways, and near noise-generating industrial uses. This may be achieved
      through site planning, setbacks, and vibration-reduction construction methods
      such as insulation, soundproofing, staggered studs, double drywall layers, and
      double walls.

2.1        POPULATION AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
POPULATION
According to the California Department of Finance (DOF), Lodi’s 2008 population was
estimated to be 63,362, as shown in Table 2-1. Lodi has been the slowest growing city in San
Joaquin County in recent years; between 2000 and 2008, the city’s population increased by
11%. In contrast, the comparable-sized cities of Tracy and Manteca grew 43% and 35%,
respectively, during this period.

Source: U.S. Census, 2000; DOF, 2008.
As shown in Table 2-2, Lodi’s population has grown at an average annual rate of nearly 1%
since 1990 and projections indicate that growth is expected to continue at a modest pace (1.2%)
through the next several decades. Using projections by San Joaquin Council of Governments
(SJCOG), we can estimate that the population of Lodi is expected to increase by 13% between
2008 and 2015 (not shown). It should be noted that the City’s residential permit activity in
2009-10 has resulted in less than five units.

AGE
Table 2-3 reports a breakdown of the city’s population by age cohort in 2000, according to the
U.S. Census and a three-year (2005-2007) average estimate provided by the American
Community Survey (ACS). Middle-aged adults represent the greatest proportion of Lodi’s
population. A comparison between these years show the greatest increases in the number of
children four and under, as well as in middle-aged residents, ages 45 to 64. These data suggest
that Lodi has attracted more young families in recent years and may have a need for family
housing with two or more bedrooms.

RACE AND ETHNICITY
Lodi has a smaller non-white population compared with San Joaquin County as a whole; while
in 2000 36% of Lodi’s population was non-white, the county’s non-white population made up
53% of its total. However, while the majority of Lodi’s population remains white, the trend
since 2000 is toward increasing diversity, as shown in Table 2-4. The overall growth in
population since 2000 was modest, but the number of Hispanic residents grew by
approximately 45%. Asian residents increased slightly, but still represent a small proportion of
the population in Lodi.
                                                           2-2

                                       Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
Changes in race and ethnic composition relate to certain housing needs as some demographic
and economic characteristics correlate with race. For example, though the data are not
available for more recent years, in 2000, Hispanic households had significantly higher average
family sizes than the overall average for Lodi (4.2 compared to 3.3).

2.2       HOUSEHOLD TRENDS
HOUSEHOLD GROWTH
The number of households in Lodi increased at a slower rate than the city’s population during
the last two decades. Therefore, the average household size increased over this period. The ACS
reports 21,887 households for the 2005-2007 three-year estimate, as shown in Table 2-5.

HOUSEHOLD COMPOSITION AND SIZE
Table 2-6 describes Lodi households, by family or non-family composition. According to the
ACS in the 2005-2007 period, the majority of households in Lodi were family households—
those with at least two people who are related to each other by blood or marriage. More than
half of family households had children under age 18 living at home. Conversely, since 2000,
non-family households have decreased. Of the non-family households, more than 80% were
composed of householders living alone. These data support findings from the age cohort
analysis that housing for families will continue to be needed during the planning period.

Over half of all households in Lodi are composed of one or two members, as shown in Table 2-
7. However, household size has been increasing in recent years. The median household size
rose from 2.7 in 2000, to 2.8 in 2008. Thirteen percent of households have five or more persons,
generally considered large households. (See Section 2.6: Special Needs Populations for a
compete discussion of large households).

2.3       INCOME AND HOUSING COSTS
INCOME
Table 2-8 describes income by household size and tenure. According to the ACS 2005-2007
estimate, the median income for all households in Lodi was $48,074, compared with $52,872
for San Joaquin County as a whole. Household income is lowest for one-person households
and highest for four-person households. In general, income growth does not correlate with
household size, since larger families usually indicate children or seniors who are likely out of
the workforce. Notably, the median income of homeowners was $67,322—more than twice the
median income of renters, which was $31,138. The monetary resources needed to own a home
are much greater than those needed to rent, which partially explains this discrepancy.

Poverty Status
The recent poverty rate in Lodi is slightly lower than it was in 2000. According to the ACS,
approximately 15% of the population lived at or below the poverty level, similar to San Joaquin
County as a whole; in 2000, the poverty rates were 17% and 18%, respectively. Female-headed
households with children had more than twice the poverty rate for the entire population,
approximately 40%, representing more than 700 households in Lodi. Seniors age 65 and over
held the lowest rate of poverty over all groups measured. Table 2-10 shows the poverty status
by population and by family type in Lodi and in San Joaquin County.

HOUSING COSTS
According to the California Association of Realtors, the median price for a home in Lodi
(including single-family and multifamily ownership homes, new and existing) in May 2009 was
$155,000, as shown in Table 2-11. This represents a substantial decline of 31% compared with
the median sale price the previous year, in May 2008. This change is in line with housing
market trends in the county (37% decline year over year) and statewide.

Chart 2-1 depicts the median home price fluctuations in Lodi since 2002. During this time
period prices peaked in July 2006, at $430,750, and then started to decline. Prices were lowest
in March 2009 of this period, at $135,000. This decline has made homes purchasing much
more attainable for residents who can afford to buy homes.

On the other hand, contract rents increased at a higher rate than in the previous decade, up by
32% since 2000, as shown in Table 2-12. The median contract rent in Lodi was $784 in the
2005-2007 ACS period, and nearly the same, $776, for the County as a whole. Some of the
increase may be attributed to inflation, but the demand for rental housing combined with a
lack of rental housing construction has also likely contributed to the rise in rents.

Overpayment
In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the number of households paying more
than 30% of their incomes for housing, as shown in Table 2-13. Overpayment is defined as
housing costs that exceed 30% of a household’s income. Housing costs include payments for
the housing unit (rent or mortgage payment), utilities, property taxes, and homeowner’s or
renter’s insurance.
In 2000, 44% of renter households overpaid for housing; by comparison, 58% of renter
households overpaid in 2005-2007. In 2000, 24% of homeowners overpaid for housing costs;
that number increased to 38% in 2005-2007. Not surprisingly, overpayment is most severe
among lower income households. For example, for households earning less than $20,000, 63%
of owner-occupied households and 95% of renter-occupied households are overpaying for
housing. These data suggest a need for more affordable housing, particularly rental housing for
lower-income residents.

2.4       HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
HOUSING UNITS AND VACANCY
Lodi’s housing stock is comprised primarily of single-family homes. The total number of
housing units increased from 21,381 in 2000 to 23,353 in 2008—a 9% change, as shown in
Table 2-14. The majority of new units are single-family detached homes, composing 96% of the
new stock added since 2000. There has been little increase in the stock of townhomes, duplexes,
or multifamily units, which often represent more affordable rental housing than single-family
homes.
DOF estimated a combined vacancy rate for rental and ownership units of 3% in 2008; this
value has remained unchanged since 2000. Vacancy rates less than 5% typically indicates a tight
market in which households may not be able to find vacant units that fit their needs.

TENURE
Of the 21,887 occupied housing units in Lodi, 12,136 units (55%) are owner-occupied and
9,751 (45%) are renter-occupied, as shown in Table 2-15. These rates have remained stable
since the 2000 Census. Table 2-15 also describes tenure, by age group. The most notable trend
in tenure by age was the slight decline in the rate of homeownership among householders age
65 to 74 years. The same group showed an increased rate in tenure of rental units, which
suggests that people of retiring age may be moving to senior rental housing or may not have

adequate homeownership options due to lack of income or lack of housing supply. (Notably,
no new senior housing has been built in Lodi during the previous planning period, though at
least 80 affordable units are planned for this planning period.)

HOUSING CONDITIONS
Age of Structure
Approximately 66% of Lodi’s housing stock was built before 1980, as shown in Table 2-16.
When units are 30 years or older, they typically begin to require some major improvements
and repairs in order to retain their quality, suggesting a large portion of homes may need
substantial upgrades if they have not been maintained over the years.

Substandard/In Need of Rehabilitation
The most current information on substandard housing, from a Housing Assistance Plan
(HAP) prepared by the City for federal funding in 1984, was that 1,778 housing units were in
substandard condition, of which 156 needed replacement. The number of substandard housing
units in 1984 represented about 12% of the housing stock and about 70% of the number of
                                                           2-9

                                                 Lodi Housing Element
housing units over 40 years old at the time. The HAP used 40 years as a criterion for estimating
potential rehabilitation need.
Over that past 25 years, the number of housing units over 40 years old has increased, to almost
11,000 (about 47% of the city’s housing stock, compared to about 17% in 1984). If the
relationship between age and condition in 2009 is the same as in 1984, as much as 70% of the
housing over 40 years old may need rehabilitation, or up to 7,600 dwelling units. This number
represents one-third of the city’s housing stock.
The City’s Community Improvement Unit within the Lodi Police Department administers the
code enforcement program that works to bring substandard homes into compliance with all
applicable building and health and safety codes. Over the past 10 years, the Code Enforcement
Unit has completed activities that have resulted in improvements to approximately 1,800
housing units. Using this rate of improvements as an average, the Unit will be able to
rehabilitate approximately 1,080 housing units during the planning period.
Housing improvements have also been driven by the Lodi Improvement Committee (formerly
the Eastside Improvement Committee), which assists and advises on property maintenance,
neighborhood improvement and historical preservation issues; designs and implements
programs to reduce blight and foster community pride; and works to reduce crime, drugs, and
blight in coordinating civil actions against nuisance property owners.
OVERCROWDING
Overcrowding (defined as more than one occupant per room) rates are generally low in Lodi,
suggesting that most households are able to find housing to accommodate their household size.
However, there are still 2,209 households that are overcrowded, requiring large housing units
with more rooms. Between 2000 and 2007, the rate of overcrowding for both homeowners and
renters in Lodi decreased, as shown in Table 2-17. The number of renters living in
overcrowded conditions was approximately 7% in 2000. By comparison, less than 3% of
homeowners lived in crowded conditions, according to 2005-2007 estimates.

2.5       EMPLOYMENT
According to the California Employment Development Department (EDD), in San Joaquin
County, Trade, Transportation and Utilities (17%); Government (14%); Retail (9%); and
Education and Health Services (9%) represent the largest employment sectors, as shown in
Table 2-18. Farm-related jobs have seen a decline over the past 15 years, now representing just
6% of total employment in the County.

Within Lodi, food manufacturing and plastics businesses employ many workers, according to
2006 data from the City of Lodi Economic Development Division. Retail, health care and other
services, and local government (including education) also comprise a large part of Lodi’s
economy.
EMPLOYMENT TRENDS
SJCOG projects a modest increase in jobs during the planning period in Lodi (1.6% annually)
between 2005 and 2015, as shown in Table 2-19. Most cities in the county are projected to add
jobs at a rate between 1% and 2% each year.

Over half of Lodi residents commuted to jobs outside the city in 2007, as shown in Table 2-20.
This was slightly more moderate compared to San Joaquin County as a whole, which reports
57% of workers commuting outside the county. Still, these figures suggest that Lodi residents
are not filling many of the jobs that are available in the city or that fewer jobs are available in
Lodi.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
According to EDD cities in San Joaquin County have experienced increased unemployment
rates since 2000, as shown in Table 2-21. The unemployment rate in 2008 in Lodi was 8%, up
from 5% in 2000 (not shown). By comparison, the unemployment rate in San Joaquin County
was estimated at 10% in 2008, up from 7% in 2000 (not shown). The current regional and
national economic downturn suggests that the unemployment rate may remain high during
the Housing Element planning period. This suggests that household income levels may decline
and that households may have difficulty in paying rents and mortgages or in securing
affordable housing.

2.6        SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATIONS
Certain groups in the City of Lodi encounter greater difficulty finding decent, affordable
housing due to their special needs or circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to a
household’s employment and income, family characteristics, medical condition or disability,
and/or household characteristics. A focus of the Housing Element is to ensure that persons
from all walks of life have the opportunity to find suitable housing in Lodi.
State Housing Element law identifies the following special needs groups: senior households,
persons with disabilities, single-parent (particularly female-headed) households, large
households, farmworkers, extremely- and very-low-income persons and families in need of
emergency shelter. This section provides a discussion of housing needs for each particular
group, and identifies the programs and services available to address their housing and
supportive services needs.
SENIORS
Senior housing needs may be more problematic to meet than the needs of other residents since
seniors are often living on a fixed income and many have special housing and care needs.
According to the ACS for the 2005-2007 period, approximately 21% of households in Lodi
were headed by persons age 65 years and older. Of these elderly households, 3,313 were
homeowners and 1,425 were renters; more than half consisted of persons who lived alone.
Approximately 10% of individuals 65 years of age or older in Lodi were below the poverty level
in 2007, compared to about 15% of the total population. As previously discussed, there was a
decline in homeownership among householders age 65 and older since 2000. Together, these
data suggest that seniors may not have adequate resources to sustain increased housing-related
expenses.
In 2007, approximately 42% of senior households consisted of women living alone (1,986
households). Elderly women are especially in need of financial assistance because so many of
them live alone and they tend to have lower incomes than male seniors.
                                                2-13

                                        Lodi Housing Element
According to the California Department of Social Services, there are currently ten licensed care
facilities for seniors located in Lodi. The facilities provide 510 beds for persons age 60 and
above. There are also six adult residential facilities with a capacity of 121 persons that may be
available for seniors. The City itself also administers various day programs designed for its
senior residents. In a public-private partnership, the City maintains and operates Hutchins
Street Square, a multi-purpose community center located in an old high school. The Square is
home to a senior center that provides classes, programs and services for the elderly. The Lodi
Senior Citizens Commission, an active community organization, identifies the needs of seniors
and initiates action to address those needs. LOEL Gardens is a private senior community
center, which includes 14 units restricted to low-income senior households.
PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES
Persons with disabilities may have special housing needs because of health costs, fixed or
limited incomes, and/or a lack of accessible and affordable housing. A disability is defined
broadly by state and federal agencies as any physical, mental, or emotional condition that lasts
over a long period of time, makes it difficult to live independently, and affects one or more
major life activities.
According to the ACS for the 2005-2007 period, 16% (7,872 persons) of Lodi’s working age (16
years and older) population had some disability. Of these persons, almost half, 3,914, were age
65 years or older. Of the population between 16 and 64, more than 75% of persons with an
employment disability were below the poverty level.
Individuals with disabilities do not necessarily require special housing features or supportive
services. However, to maintain independent living, persons with disabilities may need special
housing design features, income support, and/or in-home supportive services. More severely
disabled individuals may require a group living environment supported by trained personnel.
According to the California Department of Social Services, Lodi is home to one licensed adult
day care facility with a capacity to serve 30 clients. In addition, the County offers home
improvement grants, which can be used to make upgrades/modifications to ensure
accessibility. Lodi enforces State building code standards and model code requirements for
accessibility in residential construction (Title 24 of the California Administrative Code).
FEMALE HOUSEHOLDERS WITH CHILDREN
Single-parent households may have special housing needs due to limited income and child day
care requirements. These special needs particularly affect female householders with children
because their incomes tend to be lower than male householders. Women with children
comprised the majority of single-parent households in the 2005-2007 ACS estimate: almost
70% (1,765 households).
According to ACS for the 2005-2007 period, 40% of the city’s female-headed families with
children lived in poverty, up from 24% in 2000—a substantial increase. The median income for
female-headed households with children was $22,996, compared to $63,071 for married-couple
families with children. Battered women with children comprise a sub-group of female-headed
households that are especially in need. In the Lodi area, several social service providers and
emergency housing facilities serve women in need, including the Women’s Center of San
Joaquin County and the Lodi House Hope Closet.
                                                 2-14

                               Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
LARGE HOUSEHOLDS
Large households, defined as having five or more members, often require special housing needs
due to a limited supply of adequately sized, affordable housing units. Three-bedroom housing
units comprise 45% of all units, however, four and five or more bedroom units comprise just
8% and 1%, respectively. Additionally, rental units have fewer bedrooms: only 25% of rental
units have three-bedrooms and just 3% have four or more bedrooms.
As previously mentioned, the ACS reported 2,900 large households in Lodi, of which nearly
half were renter households. Large households represent 13% of the city’s total households.
Although rates of overcrowding have declined in recent years, there are still over 2,200
overcrowded households. Although these numbers do not necessarily represent the same set of
households, they do indicate there is currently an unmet need for affordable housing with
more bedrooms in Lodi.
FARMWORKERS
Farmworkers traditionally are defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned through
permanent or seasonal agricultural labor. Permanent farmworkers work in the fields,
processing plants, or support activities on a year-round basis. When workloads increase during
harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal or migrant labor. Farmworkers’
special housing needs typically arise from their limited income and the unstable, seasonal
nature of their employment, according to the California Institute for Rural Studies. Because of
these factors, farmworker households have limited housing choices and are often forced to
double up to afford rents.
According to the 2005-2007 ACS, there were 1,417 Lodi residents (representing 5% of the
workforce) employed in farming, forestry and fishing occupations. Although this is not a large
resident farmworker population, Lodi is located within the larger agricultural region of San
Joaquin County that employs 12,200 workers, according to EDD.
The Migrant Health Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a
study in 2000 estimating the number of migrant and seasonal farmworkers and their non-
farmworker household members in California: the Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker
Enumeration Profiles Study. The study was based on secondary source material, including
existing database information and interviews with knowledgeable individuals. The study
indicated that San Joaquin County has an estimated 46,913 farmworkers, including 21,721
migrant and 25,192 seasonal farmworkers—much higher numbers than the EDD reports, likely
because of the different methodology used.
The Housing Authority of San Joaquin County currently manages three migrant family farm
labor housing developments within the County, with the capacity to accommodate 341
individuals. This housing is available annually from the first week of May through the end of
October. Day care centers are provided for farm workers as well as services from the EDD, the
Social Security Administration, and education and health care services.
Some of the migrant farmers who formerly moved from state to state or from other countries
to California to pursue agricultural employment may have now become permanent residents of
Lodi. As such, the housing needs of farmworkers are primarily addressed through the
provision of permanent housing, rather than migrant farm labor camps. Their housing need
                                               2-15

                                         Lodi Housing Element
may be the same as other households and large families who are in need of affordable housing
with three or more bedrooms.
EXTREMELY- AND VERY-LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
The Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) database reported 2,503
extremely-low- and 2,381 very-low-income households in 2000, each representing 12% of all
households, as shown in Table 2-22. An additional 17% of households (3,602) are considered
low-income. In sum, 41% of households in the city may be eligible for below-market rate
housing.

Housing Provided for Very- and Extremely Low Income Households
Public and Assisted Housing
The City does not own or operate any public or assisted housing. The Housing Authority of
San Joaquin County has five rent-restricted public housing projects. None of these are in the
City of Lodi. There are two rent-restricted projects in Lodi. The Creekside South Apartments
contain 40 family units developed using the Section 236 mortgage subsidy program and
Section 8 rental subsidy. (See Section 2.7: Analysis of Assisted Housing Projects At-Risk for a
discussion of at-risk status.) LOEL Gardens is a private senior community center, which
includes 14 units restricted to low-income senior households.
Tenant-Based Housing Assistance
The Housing Choice Voucher Program provides portable vouchers that assist low-income
households with housing costs. The program is administered countywide by the Housing
Authority of the County of San Joaquin. Specific information on the location of vouchers is not
made available. The Housing Authority administers over 4,500 vouchers throughout the
County. As of October 2008 housing choice voucher program for San Joaquin County had
11,735 families on the waiting list. The County manages 4,500 vouchers countywide, 204 of
which are used in Lodi.1 The majority of those on the waiting list (68%) were extremely-low-
income families with children. The remainder was comprised of families with disabilities (28%)
and seniors (8%).

HOMELESS
According to the most recent count of homeless individuals performed by San Joaquin County
in 2009, Lodi had 94 homeless persons, 26 of whom were not in shelters.
Lodi has two facilities that provide shelter to the homeless. The Archway Shelter, operated by
the Salvation Army, has 52 shelter beds for men and 28 beds for women and children. The Lodi
House, which provides shelter for women and children, has 26 beds for women and children.
Additionally, these facilities maintain a combined 40 beds for transitional housing needs.
During the off-season, one of the migrant farmworker French Camp Facilities is made available
to the homeless. These facilities were also used as evacuation sites during the January 1997
floods and as "emergency" housing for families displaced by city or county action.
There is no information to suggest that Lodi is in need of additional homeless facilities, but
with the national and regional economic downturn, financial assistance may be required to
provide services to an increased homeless population or others requiring temporary emergency
housing.
2.7     ANALYSIS OF ASSISTED HOUSING PROJECTS AT-RISK
ASSISTED RENTAL HOUSING PROJECTS AT RISK OF CONVERSION
Existing rental housing that receives governmental assistance is a key source of affordable
housing in Lodi that should be preserved. The loss of such rental units reduces the availability
of housing affordable to extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income households. It is far more
cost-effective to preserve existing affordable housing than to replace it with newly constructed
units, unless housing has reached a substantial level of deterioration.
This section identifies publicly assisted rental housing in Lodi, evaluates the potential of such
housing to convert to market rate units during a ten-year period (January 2007 to July 2017),
and analyzes the cost to preserve or replace at-risk units. Resources for
preservation/replacement of units and housing programs to address their preservation are
described in Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints.
Table 2-23 lists the four publicly assisted multi-family rental housing projects in Lodi.

The Bethel Gardens Senior Apartments is a nonprofit- and Church-owned property that has a
subsidized mortgage that has kept the units affordable. The property was constructed in 1971
and is currently in good condition. This mortgage matures in December 2011, but the property
owner has not indicated that it intends to convert to market rate—it is not the mission of the
church to operate a for-profit business. The property is not considered at risk, but the City will
continue to encourage the owner to maintain affordability and prepay the HUD 236 mortgage
(if feasible) to ensure that their tenants are able to receive Enhanced Vouchers.
According to the National Housing Trust’s database of assisted rental housing projects,
Creekside South Apartments is a Section 8 Preservation Project with a Section 8 contract that
expired on February 29, 2008; and a HUD 236 Loan that will be paid off in November of 2013.
This suggests that the property is at-risk of conversion to market-rate housing. As of January
2010, the property owner is still operating the project under Section 8 Program contract
restrictions, but could opt to convert the project to market rate housing during the period
covered by this Housing Element (2007 to 2014). However, according to the owner’s
representative at Eugene Burger Management Corporation, the ownership does not intend on
converting the project to market-rate once the 236 Loan has been satisfied in 2013.
PRESERVATION AND REPLACEMENT OPTIONS
To maintain the existing affordable housing stock, the City can either preserve the existing
assisted units or facilitate the development of new units. Depending on the circumstances of at-
risk projects, different options may be used to preserve or replace the units. Preservation
options typically include: 1) transfer of project to non-profit ownership; 2) provision of rental
assistance to tenants using non-federal funding sources; and 3) purchase of affordability
covenants. In terms of replacement, the most direct option is the development of new assisted
multi-family housing units. These options are described below.
                                                            2-18

                                    Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
Transfer of Ownership
Transferring ownership of an at-risk project to a non-profit housing provider is generally one
of the least costly ways to ensure that at-risk units remain affordable for the long term. By
transferring property ownership to a non-profit organization, low-income restrictions can be
secured indefinitely and the project would become potentially eligible for a greater range of
governmental assistance. This preservation option is a possibility for the Creekside South
Apartments and would be based on the estimated market value of the units.
Rental Assistance
Project-based Section 8 rent subsidies can be used in combination with Low Income Housing
Tax Credits (LIHTC) to leverage private capital in areas where the market rent exceeds the
maximum rents under the LIHTC program. Under Section 8, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) pays the difference between what tenants can pay (defined as 30%
of household income) and what HUD estimates as the fair market rent on the unit. This
difference between the market rent paid by the Section 8 program and the underlying rent used
by the affordable housing industry to estimate the capacity of property to pay debt service is
called the Section 8 increment. This additional debt may be used for renovation of existing
affordable housing and production of new rental housing affordable to very-low-income
households.
Purchase of Affordability Covenants
Another option to preserve the affordability of the at-risk project is to provide an incentive
package to the owner to maintain the project as affordable housing. Incentives could include
writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan balance, and/or supplementing the
Section 8 subsidy received to market levels. The feasibility of this option depends on whether
the complex is too highly leveraged. By providing lump sum financial incentives or on-going
subsidies in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to the owner, the City can ensure that
some or all of the units remain affordable.
Construction and Conversion of Replacement Units
The construction of new affordable housing units is another means of replacing the at-risk
units should they be converted to market-rate units. The cost of developing housing depends
upon a variety of factors, including density, size of the units (i.e., square footage and number of
bedrooms), location, land costs, and type of construction. Assuming an average development
cost per housing unit of $90,000, it would cost approximately $3.6 million to construct 40 new
assisted units.2
Given the current housing market downtown (regionally and nationally), there may be
opportunities for the City to work with non-profit housing developers and property
management companies to purchase existing properties on the open market and maintain
them as affordable housing.

As an Entitlement Community, Lodi now will look to HCD for HOME Program funds.
Through the Neighborhood Services Division of the City’s Community Development
Department, which administers the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program,
Lodi intends to pursue funding opportunities for new rental construction projects and rental
rehabilitation projects with both non-profit and for-profit developers.
In the last year within the Urban County, the City also received an allocation of Neighborhood
Stabilization Program (NSP) funds to be used to acquire vacant, foreclosed properties for
rehabilitation and reuse as affordable housing.
Both of these activities will provide the opportunity to put restrictions in place to ensure long-
term affordability. (See Section 3.2: Administrative and Financial Resources for a detailed
description of funding resources.)
ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED IN PRESERVING ASSISTED RENTAL
HOUSING
The preservation of affordable rental housing at risk of conversion to market rate housing can
be assisted by non-profit organizations with the capacity and interest to acquire, manage, and
permanently preserve such housing. The California Department of Housing and Community
Development maintains a list of interested non-profit organizations. A number of
organizations have expressed an interest in preserving affordable rental housing in San Joaquin
County, including:

2.8      OPPORTUNITIES TO PROMOTE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Energy costs directly affect housing affordability through their impacts on the construction,
operation, and maintenance of housing. There are many ways in which the planning, design,
and construction of residential neighborhoods and structures can foster energy conservation to
reduce this cost impact and at the same time produce an environmental benefit. Techniques for
reducing energy costs include construction standards for energy efficiency, energy-saving
community design alternatives, the layout and configuration of residential lots, and the use of
natural landscape features to reduce energy needs. Sustainable development also encompasses
the preservation of habitat and species, improvement of air quality (particularly important in
this region), and conservation of natural resources, including water and open space.
RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS
The State of California has adopted building standards for energy efficiency that apply to newly
constructed dwellings and residential additions. Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations
sets forth mandatory energy efficiency standards that can be achieved through prescriptive
means or through compliance with a maximum “energy budget.” Prescriptive means include
the use of appliances, building components, insulation, and mechanical systems that meet
minimum energy efficiency ratings. Local governments implement state energy standards as
part of their building code enforcement responsibilities.
RESOURCES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
The City of Lodi operates its own electric utility, Lodi Electric Utility, which provides
residential, commercial, and industrial electric service, and allows flexibility and control over
energy sources. In 2008, the City’s average power mix included more renewable energy (27%)
compared with the statewide average (10%) and less coal (21%) than the statewide average
(32%). In addition to sustainability efforts in energy sources, Lodi Electric Utility offers several
programs to reduce residential energy use, including:
    x    Residential Energy Survey Program, which helps residents identify major energy uses
         and how these can be reduced;
    x    Residential Appliance Rebate Program, which provides rebates on the purchase of new,
         energy-efficient appliances;
    x    Energy Efficient Home Improvement Program, which offers rebates on other types of
         energy efficient residential systems (fans, space conditioning, insulation, thermostats,
         windows, etc.);
    x    Housing-As-A-System Inspection Program, which uses diagnostic equipment to ana-
         lyze mechanical and air delivery/duct systems and includes an inspection of attic insu-
         lation and windows; and
    x    A residential energy conservation demonstration program, in which a single-family
         home has been fitted with the latest energy conservation technology and is open to
         public tours to promote energy saving features.
Pacific Gas & Electric, which provides gas to the city, provides a variety of energy conservation
services for residents and also participates in several other energy assistance programs for
lower income households, which help qualified homeowners and renters, conserve energy and
                                                2-21

                                        Lodi Housing Element
control electricity costs. The California Alternate Rates for Energy Program provides a 15%
monthly discount on gas and electric rates to income-qualified households, certain nonprofit-
operated facilities housing agricultural employees, homeless shelters, hospices, and other
qualified non-profit group living facilities. The Relief for Energy Assistance through
Community Help (REACH) Program provides one-time energy assistance to customers who
have no other way to pay their energy bills. The intent of REACH is to assist low-income
customers, particularly the elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and the unemployed, who
experience severe hardships and are unable to pay for their necessary energy needs.
GENERAL PLAN GOALS AND POLICIES
Other elements in the General Plan discuss policy measures to reduce energy consumption
through land use, transportation, and conservation efforts.
    x   The Land Use Element prioritizes new mixed-use centers, which will consolidate resi-
        dential, retail, and small office uses, and which will be co-located with parks and
        schools. It encourages a diversity of housing types, in particularly promoting town-
        house and multi-family units, which are more energy efficient compared with single-
        family homes. It also promotes infill development in the city’s Downtown and major
        corridors to capitalize on transit facilities and existing commercial and public services.
    x   The Growth Management Element and Infrastructure Element seeks to maintain the
        city’s compact form and ensure the preparation of infrastructure plans and improve-
        ments in tandem with new develop. Policies also require water conservation measures,
        which in turn reduces consumption of energy embodied in the distribution of water.
    x   The Community Design and Livability Element promotes site planning and green
        building measures to reduce energy consumption and improve quality of life. This in-
        cludes lot orientation to maximize solar gain and ventilating breezes, and implementa-
        tion of building standards consistent with LEEDTM or equivalent green building pro-
        grams. The Element also regulates lighting, to reduce light pollution as well as energy
        consumption and requires street trees and shade in certain locations to reduce the ur-
        ban heat island effect.
    x   The Transportation Element seeks to reduce the reliance on cars and increase the con-
        venience of alternate modes through new connections and improved circulation for
        transit, bikes and pedestrians. The City operates its own local “GrapeLine” transit ser-
        vice, which allows it to closely coordinate land use and transit planning decisions. As a
        result, the City can both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality.
    x   The Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Element proposes to increase the acreage of
        carbon-sequestering open space, retain mature trees, and encourage the use of native
        and trees and drought-tolerant plantings.
    x   The Conservation Element seeks to preserve agricultural land, and food and wine pro-
        duction until urban development is imminent. It seeks to protect and restore habitat
        and species, particularly along the Mokelumne River. The Element also encourages
        energy conservation through the promotion of solar panels and heating systems; the
        preparation of a climate action plan, and a heat island mitigation plan.
                                                 2-22

                                Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
Together these policies and programs seek to reduce the consumption of natural resources and
limit greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time promoting public health and overall
quality of life for residents.
2.9        FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS
HCD defines the annual income limits for various housing affordability categories for each
county in the state. In 2009, the median income for a family of four under these guidelines was
$63,600. The income categories and their corresponding income ranges are shown in Table 2-
24. These income categories are referenced throughout the Housing Element.

SJCOG determines the amount of affordable housing the county will need for the time period
and then divides that need among its participating jurisdictions. According to SJCOG, Lodi is
responsible for accommodating 3,891 additional housing units between 2007 and 2014, of
which 1,621 units should be affordable to extremely-low-, very-low- and low-income
households, approximately 42% of Lodi’s total share of regional housing needs.
Lodi is not responsible for actual construction of these units. However, Lodi is responsible for
creating a regulatory framework in which these housing units can be built. This includes the
creation, adoption, and implementation of general plan policies, Zoning Ordinance
regulations, and/or economic incentives to encourage the construction of the needed range of
housing units.
Table 2-25 shows the number and percentage of housing units identified in the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation Plan for Lodi for the 2007 through 2014 planning period, by income
category.

3        Resources and Constraints
This chapter describes housing site opportunities, resources for residential development and
programs, constraints to developing housing in Lodi, and recommendations for how to remove
such constraints.
3.1      SITES INVENTORY AND ANALYSIS
Land on which to construct housing is one of the most critical resources necessary to meet
future housing demand. Without adequate vacant or underutilized land, the City of Lodi
cannot demonstrate how it will accommodate its share of the regional housing needs allocation
(RHNA). The amount of land required to accommodate future housing needs depends on the
city’s physical characteristics, zoning, availability of public facilities and services, and
environmental conditions.
ADEQUATE SITES
To determine whether the city has sufficient land to accommodate its share of regional housing
needs for all income groups, Lodi must identify “adequate sites.” Under State law, adequate
sites are those with appropriate zoning, development standards, and infrastructure capacity to
accommodate new construction needs. A locality’s sites are adequate if the land inventory
demonstrates sufficient realistic capacity at appropriate densities and development standards to
permit development of a range of housing types and prices to accommodate the community's
share of the RHNA by income level.
The extent to which the city has “adequate sites” for housing affordable to very-low- or low-
income households will depend, in part, on zoning standards, particularly the maximum
allowed density, parking, building coverage, height, and set-back standards. The combination
of the city’s flexible zoning standards, allowances for housing on commercial properties and a
history of approving housing, planned development provisions, and exceptions and variances
suggests that Lodi can accommodate its share of the RHNA on sites available within the
existing city limits and in new growth areas to be annexed into the city.
The types of sites that are appropriate for residential development in Lodi are divided into
three categories, described in detail in the section below and in Figure 3-1.
     1. Development Projects – This category includes land with housing development either
         recently built, under construction, or approved by the City.
     2. Approved Master Plans – This category includes the three master plan projects that
         have been approved by the City, but for which subsidies have not been identified.
     3. Vacant or Underutilized Infill – This category includes vacant land or land currently
         occupied that is capable of being developed at higher densities or with greater intensity
         than the existing use. All sites contain General Plan designations that permit residential
         use. The majority of this type of land is located adjacent to existing residential areas or
         in areas designated for mixed-use development according to the General Plan.
     4. Annexation Areas – This category includes land that has been designated in the Gen-
         eral Plan, but has not yet been annexed by the City of Lodi. The figure shows sites are
         included in Phase 1 of the General Plan—outside the current city limits, but inside the
         Sphere of Influence.

DEMONSTRATING APPROPRIATENESS OF SITES
Appropriate Densities and Housing Types
Although subsidized housing is limited in Lodi, what does is exist has been created through a
variety of means and densities, including new construction, rehabilitation, low- and moderate
densities. Loel Gardens maintains three separate senior homes, with five units each,
representing some of the smaller housing types on smaller lots (less than ¼ acre), that blend in
with adjacent single-family homes.
Creekside South Apartments provides 40 subsidized family units on a 2.2 acre parcel,
representing a density of 18 units per acre. On the larger end, the approved Eden Housing
development will provide 80 senior units on a 4.4 acre site at the same density level. It has a
General Plan designation of Mixed-Use Corridor and a Single-Family Residential Zoning
classification. It has a General Plan designation of High-Density Residential and a Planned
Development Zoning classification. These examples suggest that the “default” density of 20
units/acre, permitted by State law, is an appropriate density for recent development types.
Finally, Hotel Lodi, with 76 units, is a rehabilitated mixed use development (formerly a hotel),
located above several Downtown shops.
Appropriate Land Use Designations
The City’s Zoning Ordinance, including zoning districts and the zoning map, has not yet been
updated to be consistent with the General Plan, adopted in 2010. As described in Program 1.1,
the Zoning Ordinance will be revised within one year of adoption of this Housing Element.
Until the Zoning Ordinance is updated, General Plan land use designations and
density/intensity standards shall apply on all sites, as described in the matrix below. For
information purposes, the General Plan Land Use Diagram is shown in Figure 3-2.
 General Plan Land Use Designation   Density Range (units/acre) Household Income Level Accommodated
 Mixed Use Center                                         8-35  Extremely-Low-, Very-Low-, and Low
 High Density                                            15-35  Extremely-Low and Very-Low
 Medium Density                                           8-20  Moderate
 Low Density                                               2-8  Above moderate
Demand and Market Trends
Chapter 2 described the continued demand for affordable housing, given low income levels and
overpayment, as well as a constrained supply, with new housing construction remaining static
for several years. A market study prepared for the Eden Housing senior affordable
development project corroborated the pent-up demand for affordable senior housing in
particular. The study projected demand from 928 households (in and around Lodi) for 79
spots, concluding that the development would likely be fully occupied in just three months.
Although no new housing has been constructed in several years, developments that have been
approved are part of mixed use communities, with commercial and public uses complementing
residential uses. This concept is upheld by the recently adopted General Plan which calls for

Financial Feasibility
Both developer and homeowners’ loans and feasibility are critical aspects of the potential for
development and purchasing of new housing. The current housing makes developers wary and
less likely to move forward with new projects. The City is committed to pursuing state and
regional funding opportunities (see Program 1.5 and resources section below) to provide
incentives for development and bridge financing gaps. Given the City’s commitment to TOD
and mixed-use development as identified in the General Plan, the City may be able to access
state bond funds and other regional grants to create model projects in the Central Valley.
As described in the non-governmental constraints section in Chapter 4, the tightening of the
mortgage lending market has made it more difficult for households to secure loans. In 2007,
the overall loan approval rating for the city was 47 percent. However, very low interest rates,
combined with the City’s successful implementation of the first-time homebuyers program
suggest that financing is still feasible for a range of income levels, with good credit ratings.
1. Development Projects
Within Lodi, there are already several development projects that have been completed,
approved or are under construction, or which have been completed that will count toward
meeting the RHNA. Table 3-1 reports development projects since January 2007, by income
level. In total, development projects will produce 547 housing units, including 90 units that
may be developed at below market rates. Where affordability funding has been secured—
specifically for the Eden Housing senior development and the Service First of California
acquisitions—this is documented in the final column of the table.

2. Approved Master Plans
Three master plan projects were approved by the City in advance of the recent General Plan
update, but have not yet been constructed: FCB Southwest Gateway, Blue Shield/Reynolds
Ranch, and FCB Westside. Given developers’ target sale prices, development agreements,
and/or approved densities, sites within these plans may accommodate affordable housing as
described below.
A. Affordable Targeted Sales Prices. Given the current housing market downturn, many
market-rate homes in Lodi have become affordable, even to low-income households, though
not subsidized. Certain development project units can be considered affordable for low and
moderate income households due to their Medium- or High-Density Residential General Plan
designation, designation for high-density senior housing, lot and unit size (e.g. 1,850 to 2,350
square feet on moderately sized lots), and the corresponding likely sales price: in the mid to
high-$200,000s.3 To illustrate, as reported in Table 2-24, income limits for the County are up to
$76,300 for a family of four to qualify for Moderate income housing (120% of median).
Assuming that a family spends no more than 30% of its income on housing, it has the ability to
spend up to $22,890 per year (or $1,908 per month). Assuming a 30-year fixed interest rate at
5% and 20% downpayment, a home up to $290,000 could be attainable.4
B. Approved Medium- and High-Density Housing. In addition to City Council approvals and
certified environmental impact reports, each project has been awarded growth management
allocations, and does not require subsequent City Council action to build at the density levels
described herein. Moreover, the General Plan references these projects as key projects in the
Plan’s Phase 1 development, which seeks to avoid leapfrog development by prioritizing
contiguous development within just a few miles of the Downtown. The General Plan codified
approved densities for these three projects, by designating land uses and densities consistent
with these approvals, as shown in Table 3-3. Therefore, where residential densities have been

approved at 20 dwelling units per acre or higher, sites are appropriate for Very-Low and Low
Income households. Zoning for all three sites is Planned Development (PD).
    x   Blue Shield/Reynolds Ranch: This approved master planned project will include a mix
        of residential, office, and commercial development. The business park component of
        this project was completed and occupied by Blue Shield in 2008 and commercial retail
        underway, with a Costco warehouse opening in 2011. The residential component has
        not yet been constructed, but has approvals and growth management allocations for
        1,080 units including 9.3 acres of High-Density Residential and 58.0 acres of Medium-
        Density Residential. The former units are appropriate for Very-Low and Low Income
        households. The latter units are intended for senior housing; though no subsidy has
        been identified, the development approval calls for duplexes, which may be appropriate
        for Moderate Income households as described in bullet (A) above.
    x   FCB Southwest Gateway: This approved master planned project will be a residential
        community with a school and open space. The site is currently vacant and construction
        has been delayed given the economic downturn. The project has approvals and growth
        management allocations for 1,230 units, including 17 acres of High-Density Residential
        and 30 acres of Medium-Density Residential. While the High-Density units are appro-
        priate for Very-Low and Low Income households, the Medium-Density units may be
        appropriate for Moderate income households as described in bullet (A) above.
    x   FCB Westside: This approved master planned project will be a residential community
        with a school and open space. The site is currently vacant and construction has been
        delayed given the economic downturn. The project has approvals for 638 units, includ-
        ing 10 acres of High-Density Residential and 23 acres of Medium-Density Residential.
        While the High-Density units are appropriate for Very-Low and Low Income house-
        holds, the Medium-Density units may be appropriate for Moderate income households
        as described in bullet (A) above. In addition, the development agreement also requires
        the landowner to either rehabilitate or pay the costs of rehabilitating up to 25 residen-
        tial units (or up to $1.25 million) within the Eastside neighborhood, which has a con-
        centration of homes in need of repairs.
C. Adequate Infrastructure. Services will be constructed in tandem with residential
development through a combination of special assessments, impact fees, and on/off-site
improvements requirements. None of the master plan projects have environmental or other
impediments that would restrict their development at full potential. Infrastructure needs have
been identified where necessary. For example, in 2002, the City adopted the Westside Facilities
Master Plan, a master plan for the “FCB Westside” development project, which identifies a mix
of land use and City services necessary to support the proposed land uses for the area. See
Section 3.3: Constraints for a detailed description of public facilities and infrastructure needs.

3. Vacant and Underutilized Infill
Through its General Plan policies, the City emphasizes infill development, a compact
community, residential neighborhoods that are accessible to commercial services, and higher
densities in appropriate locations. Table 3-4 and Table 3-5 describe vacant and underutilized
sites, respectively, that represent appropriate locations for below-market rate housing. Vacant
infill sites have the capacity for 998 below-market rate units; underutilized sites could produce
as many as 314 below-market rate housing units. The following tables identify an assumed
density value, based on densities permitted in the General Plan. Current zoning designations
are shown; however, zoning designations will be updated following adoption through the
implementation of interim zoning regulations as specified in Program 1.1.
Underutilized sites include sites where uses are no longer in operation, in disrepair, or have
surpassed their useful life. Sites designated as Mixed Use Corridor were prioritized, since the
General Plan calls for reinvestment in these areas. As evidenced by the small number of vacant
parcels in the city, the City has done a commendable job of avoiding leapfrog development.
Given the current economic client, redevelopment of underutilized parcels—included closed
businesses—will be important for avoiding blighted conditions and maintaining the city’s
compact form and accessible neighborhoods. Moreover, these sites already have infrastructure
in place, which may reduce development costs compared to projects on greenfield land.
Unit capacity is determined by multiplying the number of acres by the assumed density and
buildout factor. Sites were deemed appropriate for extremely-low- or very-low-income
households due to their allowed density; location; and proximity to transit, neighborhood
services, and public facilities. The Mixed Use Corridor designation permits 100% residential
development except along Cherokee Lane and Lodi Avenue, where 25% and ground-floor
frontage should be commercial active uses, respectively. Likewise, the Downtown Mixed Use
designation requires ground-floor active uses. These restrictions are calculated as part of the
unit capacity. A realistic development capacity of 80 percent (“buildout factor”) is assumed for
most vacant sites. Sites over ten acres in size are assumed to have a development capacity of 70
percent to account for additional open space and enable appropriate development typologies
(e.g. small apartment complexes of no more than 30 units for very-low income households).
For underutilized sites, the assumed density value also takes into account the realistic potential
for redevelopment, such as any existing uses to remain on the site or a potential mix of uses.

4. Annexation Areas
Annexation is not required to fulfill the RHNA, but this section lays the groundwork for
annexation should the housing market pick up in the short-term. Lodi has used its planning
powers and the growth management process to prevent premature conversion of prime
agricultural land, protect natural resources that border the city, and ensure orderly and
efficient extension of public facilities and services. The General Plan Growth Management and
Infrastructure Element identifies a phasing strategy to facilitate contiguous development and
avoid unnecessary and premature conversion of agricultural land. Housing Element policies in
the Strategy section call for discussions with property owners about annexation to commence
by the end of the planning period in 2014. Potential annexation areas are identified by Phase 1
of the General Plan, specifically the portion of Phase 1 that lies outside of the current city
limits, but inside the Sphere of Influence. (Phase 1 General Plan sites inside the city limits are
subsumed in the relevant sections above: development project, vacant and underutilized sites.)
These annexation areas allow for 2,681 housing units, including 1,373 units available for
below-market rate units. Annexation sites are documented in Table 3-6.
Methods
The lettered key in the first column of the table corresponds to the relevant site in Figure 3-1.
Existing land use information is provided for each site. Most of these sites are currently in
agricultural use. Some sites contain one or more associated residences. Sites will only redevelop
once agricultural uses cease. All unit capacity calculations assume that existing housing units
would remain on the site. Sites within Mixed Use Centers are assumed to build out as 80%
residential uses and 20% non-residential uses. Calculations also provide for 25% of the total
area for streets and other infrastructure for each land use type (exceptions are noted in Table 3-
6, as dictated by specific site conditions).
Infrastructure
As part of the Growth Management Program, which regulates the maximum amount of
residential growth that can occur over time, the City requires that projects identify on- and off-
site infrastructure improvements necessary to serve the project. Internal infrastructure is
generally provided as part of the initial construction of a project. The areas proposed for
annexation, as included in this Housing Element, will be subject to compliance with the City’s
regulations and policies related to infrastructure, which will alleviate any potential constraints
the availability of public facilities (namely, storm drains, water distribution, and sanitary sewer)
would have on housing construction. See Section 3.3: Constraints for a detailed description of
public facilities and infrastructure needs.

provide most of the labor for the homes. Government agencies or individuals typically donate
land for new homes. In the past, the City of Lodi has provided an allocation of HOME Program
funds to the local Habitat for Humanity chapter for land acquisition to accommodate their new
construction activities. However, the availability of vacant parcels for such development and
the higher cost of land in recent years have prevented Habitat from further development.

housing costs, including the Section 8 rental assistance program, public housing, and migrant
farmworker housing. Specifically, HASJC manages five public housing projects and three

FINANCIAL RESOURCES
The City of Lodi has access to a variety of existing and potential funding sources available for
affordable housing activities. These include local, State, federal and private resources, and are
summarized in Table 3-8. Described below are the four largest housing funding sources the
City can use for housing production, rehabilitation, or preservation: CDBG, HOME
Investment Partnership Program grants, the Section 8 Rental Assistance Program, and the new
Neighborhood Stabilization Program offered by HUD.
Community Development Block Grant
The federal CDBG program provides funds for a variety of community development activities.
The program is flexible in that the funds can be used for a range of activities. The eligible
activities include, but are not limited to: acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or
property, public facilities and improvements, relocation, rehabilitation and construction
(under certain limitations) of housing, homeownership assistance, and also clearance activities.
From 2001 to 2007, the City used $510,922 in CDBG dollars to produce eleven very-low-
income units. Since 2007, the City has used $229,380 in CDBG funds to produce nine units.
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
The Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) is a federal program established for the
purpose of stabilizing communities that have suffered from foreclosures and abandonment.
Two rounds of funding have been approved through the Housing and Economic Recovery Act
of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. NSP is a component of the
CDBG program. Grants allow communities and nonprofits to purchase foreclosed or
abandoned homes and rehabilitate and/or resell homes to qualified low- to moderate-income
households. Available data indicates that the San Joaquin County area has the highest rate
nationally of foreclosures per housing unit. Approximately 580 homes were foreclosed in Lodi

in the 18-month period between January 2007 and August 2008.7 San Joaquin County is the
grantee entity for Lodi; it allocated $577,908 to Lodi, nearly 10% of the County’s total
allocation. As described in the Administrative Resources section above, Service First of
Northern California has been acquiring four vacant foreclosed homes in Lodi for affordable
housing redevelopment, using these funds.
HOME Investment Partnership Program
Federal HOME funds can be used for activities that promote affordable rental housing and
homeownership for lower income households. Such activities include the following: building
acquisition, new construction, reconstruction, moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-time
homebuyer assistance, and tenant-based assistance. A federal priority for the use of HOME
funds is the preservation of at-risk housing projects. Since 2001, the City has allocated $996,299
in HOME funds to produce 40 low-income units. HOME funding is now provided through the
State HOME program on a competitive application basis; the City’s application for funding is
pending.
Section 8 Rental Assistance
The Section 8 program is a federal program that provides rental assistance to very-low-income
households in need of affordable housing. The program offers a voucher that pays the
difference between the current fair market rent and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g., 30%
of their income). The voucher allows a tenant to choose housing that may cost above the
payment standard, but the tenant must pay the extra cost. The program is administered by the
Housing Authority of San Joaquin County.

3.3      CONSTRAINTS
A number of factors may constrain the development of housing, particularly housing
affordable to lower income households. These factors can generally be divided into
“governmental constraints,” or those that are controlled by federal, state, or local governments;
and “nongovernmental constraints,” factors that are not generally created or affected by
governmental controls.
An analysis of these factors can help in the development of programs that lessen the effect of
construction on the supply and cost of housing.
NONGOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Mortgage and Rehabilitation Financing
The availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under
the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required to disclose
information on the disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race/ethnicity
of the applicants. This applies to all loan applications for home purchases and improvements,
whether financed at market rate or with government assistance.
In 2007, 482 households applied for conventional loans to purchase homes in Lodi. The overall
loan approval rate was 47%. By comparison, in 2001, 83% of loans were approved. This
tightening of lending has compounded the downturn in the national and local housing
markets, making it more difficult for households to secure loans. For government-sponsored
loans, 19 households applied and the approval rate was 84% in 2007. Home improvement loans
only had a 30% approval rate with 183 households applying in total. In general, census tracts
with a higher percentage of households of color or lower incomes experienced greater difficulty
in securing loans.8
To address potential private market lending constraints and expand homeownership and home
improvement opportunities, the City of Lodi offers and/or participates in a variety of home
buyer and rehabilitation assistance programs. These programs assist extremely-low-, very-low-,
low-, and moderate-income residents by increasing access to favorable loan terms to purchase
or improve their homes.
Cost of Land
A key factor in determining housing costs is the price of raw land and any necessary
improvements. Because of the economic downturn, over the course of the last two years
virtually no land has been sold in the city since 2007. The price of existing homes continues to
drop, so the market has not yet stabilized enough to create much demand for new home
construction, let alone new land. In early November 2009, there was one listing for residentially
zoned land (R-2) on LoopNet, an online real estate resource. The property, 5.26 acres in size,
was listed as $1.9 million, meaning that it is priced at $361,217 per acre. According to Jeffrey

Kirst at Tokay Development, a local developer, residentially zoned land anywhere in the city
would not sell for more than $75,000-$100,000 per acre at present.9
Construction Costs
Single-Family Homes
Various factors can affect the cost of building a single-family house, including the type of
construction, custom versus tract development, materials, site conditions, finishing details,
amenities, square footage, and structural configuration. These factors create a wide variation in
construction costs, from as little as $110 per square foot for basic construction to as much as
$160 for high-quality custom construction. A basic, 1,200-square foot starter home could be
constructed in Lodi for $132,000. Including land cost of about $14,000 per lot,10 permit and
development impact fees of $15,433,11 site preparation, and other miscellaneous costs, the
minimum cost of producing a 1,200-square foot home in Lodi is estimated to be between
$160,000 and $170,000, excluding developer fee or profit.
Multi-Family Homes
Contacts with multi-family housing developers in the Lodi region indicate that construction
costs for multi-family housing units, excluding land and site preparation costs, fees, and related
expenses range from $90 to $95 per square foot, depending on the quality of construction and
interior amenities. Therefore, the construction costs for a 1,000 square foot unit would be
between $90,000 and $95,000. Assuming land cost of approximately $5,000 per lot,12 permit
and development impact fees of $11,000,13 site preparation, and other costs, the minimum cost
of producing a 1,000-square foot, multi-family home in Lodi is estimated to be between
$106,000 and $111,000, excluding developer fee or profit.
GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Local policies and regulations impact the price and availability of housing and subsequently the
provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and
exactions, permit processing procedures, and other factors can constrain the maintenance,
development, and improvement of housing. This section discusses potential governmental
constraints, as well as policies that encourage housing development in the city.
In September 2003, the City of Lodi published a draft revised Zoning Ordinance to replace the
existing Zoning Ordinance, adopted in 1954. The Planning Commission held several public

hearings to gain input on the new code, however for various reasons, the revised Zoning
Ordinance was not adopted; it is the City’s expectation to undertake revisions to this draft for
consistency with the new General Plan and then adopt them. The draft proposed Ordinance
makes many changes to remove constraints to development and is referenced in the discussion
below. However, the analysis and subsequent recommendations are based on the City’s current
Zoning Ordinance.
General Plan Designations and Permitted Densities
The Land Use Element was recently updated as part of the comprehensive General Plan
Update. The Element sets forth the City’s development policies. These policies, as implemented
by the Zoning Ordinance (Title 17 of the Lodi Municipal Code), establish the amount of land
allocated for residential and other uses within the city. The Zoning Ordinance needs to be
updated to reflect the recent General Plan Update (see Program 1.1 in Chapter 4). The Land
Use Element establishes ten land use designations in total (see Table 3-9), including six that
allow residential uses: Low-Density Residential, Medium-Density Residential, High-Density
Residential, Downtown Mixed-Use, Mixed-Use Corridor, and Mixed-Use Center. With this
most recent General Plan, the City is emphasizing a dense, mixed-use downtown as well as
mixed-use development along the city’s major corridors: Kettleman and Cherokee lanes and
Lodi Avenue.
At the time of this writing, the Zoning Ordinance has not been updated to be consistent with
the General Plan. Table 2-8 describes how the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance will be
implemented in this interim period: according to the residential densities stipulated in the
General Plan and corresponding development standards from the Zoning Ordinance. This
interim solution will be implemented by Program 1.1.

Medium- and High-Density Residential and the mixed-use designations all allow multi-family
housing by right. The Mixed Use Corridor designation permits 100% residential development
except along Cherokee Lane and Lodi Avenue, where 25% and ground-floor frontage should be
commercial active uses, respectively. Likewise, the Downtown Mixed Use designation requires
ground-floor active uses. Still, the range of districts that permit residential development and
the densities they offer (2-35 units per acre) allow for a variety of housing types and therefore
does not serve as a constraint to housing development.

                                       DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
Smart Growth and Transit-Oriented Development
Both the General Plan, adopted in April 2010 and the Transit-Oriented Design Guidelines for
Downtown prioritize locations for high-density development. The first guiding principle of the
General Plan seeks to maintain the City’s compact form, with virtually all new development
located within three miles of Downtown. Lodi’s Downtown and major transit and commercial
corridors (including Lodi Avenue, Cherokee Lane, and Kettleman Lane) are priority areas for
high-density and mixed-use with primarily residential development, in order to capitalize on
access to transit, public facilities, and services. New growth areas are focused around mixed use
centers that envision a range of housing choices (including high-density development,
appropriate for below-market rate housing). Three new schools and several parks are
intentionally located next to mixed use centers and the highest residential densities to promote
walkability and access to services. The General Plan and TOD Design Guidelines serve to
remove constraints to affordable housing, by supporting housing choices, including high-
density.
Zoning Standards and Permitted Housing Types
The existing Zoning Ordinance regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential
development and exists to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
residents. In addition, the Zoning Ordinance serves to preserve the character and integrity of
existing neighborhoods. As shown in Table 3-10, Lodi’s Zoning Ordinance includes design
standards and guidelines for districts that permit residential development. As shown in Table
3-10, multi-family housing is allowed by right, without a conditional use permit, in the R-GA,
R-MD, R-HD, R-C-P, P-D, C-1, and C-2 districts.
The development standards contained in the City’s Zoning Ordinance are consistent with
other cities of Lodi's size and character. Examples include: maximum lot coverage from 45 to
60% and height limits of 35 feet in Low and Medium Density designations and 60 feet in High
Density zones. Table 3-10 summarizes the City’s development standards. Note that densities in
the Sites Inventory are determined by the General Plan designation. As described in Program
1.1, the Interim Zoning Ordinance will provide guidance between how the General Plan and
Zoning Ordinance will be implemented until such times as the Zoning Ordinance is
comprehensively updated.
Development Standards
Yards and Setbacks
Yard and setback requirements are consistent with permitted densities in residential zones: 20
feet in front, ten feet in rear, and five feet on each side. There is no side yard setback
requirement in multi-family zones, except on corner lots (which are required to have a side
yard setback of 10 feet) and lots adjacent to a residential zone (which are required to have a 5
foot side yard). Yard and setback requirements within the other zoning districts are typical in
comparison with most jurisdictions.

                                         DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
Building Coverage
The City’s building coverage standards are reasonably related to the density provisions in each
residential zone. In multi-family zones, permitted building coverage ranges from 40 to 50% in
the R-LD zone (low density multi-family) to 60% in the R-HD zone. Building coverage pertains
to the primary (main) building and any accessory structures.
Lot Size and Lot Area per Dwelling Unit
In zones designated for single-family homes, minimum lot size is 6,500 square feet in the R-1
zone and 5,000 square feet in the R-2 zone. Where lower density multi-family development is
allowed, minimum lot size is 6,000 square feet. Zones allowing high-density multi-family
development have a minimum lot size of 4,000 square feet.
Building Height
Permitted building heights range from 35 feet in single-family and low- and medium-density
multi-family zones to 60 feet (four stories) in the high-density multi-family zone. Residential
uses are allowed in the C-2 zone, which has a maximum building height of 75 feet (six stories)
in the city’s Downtown Business District. Outside of the Downtown Business District, building
heights are limited to 35 feet. Lodi’s Zoning Ordinance includes a provision for exceptions to
standard height limitations for non-habitable architectural elements and structures.
Parking Standards
Parking ratios for residential uses in Lodi are determined by dwelling unit type, regardless of
occupancy. For all residential uses including mobile homes, two spaces per unit is the standard
parking requirement. Lodging and retirement homes are required to provide one parking space
per two sleeping rooms. Convalescent homes and rest homes14 are subject to different
standards that require one parking space per three beds. Hotel and motel uses must have one
space per room and one space for the facility’s manager.
The City’s parking ratios are reasonable in relation to the likely demand for parking from
different residential uses for housing units with two or more bedrooms. The requirement of
two spaces per unit for multi-family uses may be a constraining factor on development of
small, infill lots typical of most vacant parcels in Lodi. The required parking may be also
excessive for efficiency/studio and one-bedroom units. The City currently mitigates this
constraint by providing an administrative process for approving minor deviations from zoning
standards; including parking requirements (see the section below on Development Review
Process). It should be noted that the new Zoning Ordinance (Program 1.1) modifies the multi-
family parking requirement by requiring one covered space per one-bedroom unit, two
covered spaces per two bedroom unit, plus one uncovered guest space for every three units.

   It should be noted that the definitions of lodging, convalescent, and rest homes will be updated in the new
Zoning Ordinance (see Program 1.1).

                                  Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
Design Guidelines
The City adopted Transit-Oriented Development Design Guidelines for Downtown in 2008
and is preparing general design guidelines as part of the update to the Zoning Ordinance
(Program 1.1), to implement the policies of the General Plan and Housing Element. These
documents do not serve as a constraint to development. In fact, they serve to alleviate
constraints, since they provide detailed guidance about the City’s design preferences (e.g.
ground floor features, green design, and parking) that can assist an applicant in preparing an
application that conforms to the City’s regulations.
Development Standard Conclusion
The City’s development standards do not impose a constraint to achieving maximum
residential densities and are reasonably related to neighborhood quality goals and protecting
the health and safety of residents. However, the Zoning Ordinance will need to be updated to
be consistent with the General Plan within one-year of adoption, as stipulated in the Program
1.1.
Permitted Housing Types
Licensed Residential Care Facilities
The city has 16 licensed residential care facilities; six adult residential care and ten residential
care facilities for the elderly. Residential care facilities are licensed by the State of California to
provide permanent living accommodations and 24-hour supervision for persons in need of
personal services, supervision, protection, or assistance for sustaining the activities of daily
living. Licensed residential care facilities include hospices, nursing homes, convalescent
facilities, sanatoriums, and group homes for minors, persons with disabilities, and people in
recovery from alcohol or drug additions. Under State law, the City of Lodi is required to permit
licensed residential care facilities that serve six or fewer persons by right in residential districts.
Facilities that serve more than six people can be required to have a Use Permit.
The Lodi Zoning Ordinance does not provide a general definition for licensed residential care
facilities. The Zoning Ordinance does define “nursing/convalescent home,” a type of licensed
residential care facility, and states that such facilities are permitted with a Use Permit in the R-
GA and R-MD zones and by right in the R-C-P and P-D zones (see Table 3-10). The lack of a
more inclusive definition in the Zoning Ordinance could create an impediment to the location
of licensed residential care facilities (other than nursing/convalescent homes) as the decision to
allow such uses would be made on a case-by-case basis without a clear set of criteria. The
Zoning Ordinance should be amended to clarify that all types of residential care facilities of six
of fewer individuals are permitted by right in residential zones (see Program 1.1). Instead of
identifying types of residential care facilities that are permitted, the Ordinance should be
amended to discuss State-defined licensed residential care facilities, in general. The Ordinance
could also identify the zoning districts and permit process under which facilities of seven or
more persons are permitted (Program 1.1).
The Zoning Ordinance contains no occupancy, distance, proximity, placement, or other
requirements that would explicitly constrain the establishment of residential care facilities,
including those for special needs groups such as senior citizens and disabled persons. For such
facilities, the City follows State law, which, as stated earlier, permits residential care facilities of
                                                  3-35

                                    DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
six or fewer persons by right in residential zones. Also, State law prohibits the
overconcentration of residential care facilities, which is defined as facilities separated by a
distance of less than 300 feet. These provisions of State law have not been explicitly
incorporated within the Zoning Ordinance, and should be incorporated (see Program 1.1).
Single Room Occupancy Units
The current Zoning Ordinance does not provide a definition for single room occupancy (SRO)
units. SRO units are generally small in nature and lack separate kitchen or bathroom facilities
for every unit. Meals are often provided, and residents stay on a permanent or semi-permanent
basis; rent is often accepted on a weekly or monthly basis. SRO units are frequently one of the
only sources of housing available to extremely-low-income people (in Lodi, a one-person
household making $13,350 or less annually qualifies as extremely-low-income). The Zoning
Ordinance’s definition of “boardinghouse,” “a building other than a hotel, containing not more
than five sleeping rooms, where lodging and meals for five or more persons are provided for
compensation” could cover some SROs, but is not very broad. The draft proposed Zoning
Ordinance broadens the definition for “rooming or boarding houses” by not limiting the
occupancy of the facility. The Zoning Ordinance could be amended to include a definition for
“group residential” that would include all living situations with shared living quarters without
separate kitchen or bathroom facilities for each room or unit, including boarding houses,
dormitories, and SROs (see Program 1.1).
Supportive and Transitional Housing
The current Zoning Ordinance does not provide a definition for supportive and transitional
housing. Supportive and transitional housing is geared towards individuals and families who
have been homeless and who benefit from supportive services such as job counseling and day
care as they get back on their feet and are able to afford their own house or apartment.
Residents in supportive and transitional housing typically stay up to a year before moving out.
According to State law, supportive and transitional housing must be treated the same as any
other residential use in a residential zone. The Zoning Ordinance could be amended to include
a definition for “supportive and transitional housing” that explicitly states that such housing be
treated the same as other residential uses (see Program 1.1).
Emergency Shelters
Recent State law (SB2) mandates that jurisdictions either permit emergency shelters by right in
one or more zones or enter into a multi-jurisdictional agreement with neighboring
jurisdictions to fund and operate a shelter or shelters to meet their collective homeless need.
Lodi currently meets this new requirement—emergency shelters are allowed by right in the C-
M and C-2 zones or their equivalent in the Zoning Ordinance update. These zones were
selected based on their access to transit, public facilities, and commercial services. C-2 and C-
M sites are all located primarily in Downtown Lodi and along Cherokee Lane (a major
commercial street with transit access, located adjacent to the eastern residential
neighborhoods). Moreover, there are older motels along Cherokee Lane that could be used as
emergency shelters if necessary. In sum, available land and existing structures would
accommodate the estimated homeless population—fewer than 100 persons, as described in
Chapter 2. Moreover, Program 1.1 calls for amending the Zoning Ordinance to create
development standards for emergency shelters to further facilitate their development. C-2

                                   Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
(though likely renamed) will continue to serve as the primary identified zone allowing
emergency shelters by right.
Second Units
The City defines a second unit as, “an additional living unit on a lot within a single-family
zone.” A second unit is a self-contained unit with separate kitchen, living and sleeping facilities.
A second unit can be created by (1) altering a single-family dwelling to establish a separate unit
or (2) adding a separate unit onto an existing dwelling. In accordance with State law, second
units are allowed without the requirement of a Use Permit, within the R-1, R-2, and R-LD
zoning districts. They are automatically permitted in the R-GA, R-MD, and R-HD zoning
districts.
The City requires that second units be architecturally compatible with the existing single-
family dwelling. They must have separate exterior entrances and be no larger than four
hundred square feet in floor area. The unit must also have one off-street parking space in
addition to the parking required for the existing residence. The definition of second units in
the Zoning Ordinance states that a second unit must be attached to the existing single-family
house. Despite this definition, the City allows second units detached from the primary
residence as a matter of practice. As part of implementing this Housing Element, the City will
revise the Zoning Ordinance definition to reflect its current practice of allowing detached
second units, consistent with State law requirements (Program 1.1, referenced above, also
memorializes this practice). Program 1.1 would amend the code to permit second units up to
640 square feet by right.
Conclusion
There are a number of proposed changes to the Zoning Ordinance that will facilitate residential
development and allow for greater design flexibility. The most significant examples that have
not already been mentioned are:
     x    Modify the number and definition of residential zoning designations for consistency
          with the General Plan and to create greater development flexibility;
     x    New Low-Density Residential designation that allows for the development of single-
          family detached, two-family and three-family homes up to the General Plan Land Use
          Density of 7 units per acre;
     x    Provision for a variety of housing types in residential zones including care facilities,
          shelters and live/work projects;15
     x    Single-family detached lot sizes as small as 5,000 square feet;
15
   While the draft Zoning Ordinance permits shelters with a Conditional Use Permit, before adoption the
new, revised Zoning Ordinance will need to be amended to allow emergency shelter by right in a zone or
zones (planned to be the equivalent of the current C-2 zone) or the City needs to enter into a multi-
jurisdictional agreement to provide adequate shelter services.

discussed in this section, the City’s zoning will not serve as a constraint to development.
Development Process
Growth Management Ordinance
In 1991, the City adopted a Growth Management Allocation Ordinance (GMAO) to regulate
the location, amount, and timing of residential development.
Under the ordinance, the maximum number of housing units approved each year by the City
reflects a 2% increase in population. Unused permits rollover to the next year and there is no
annual limit on the number of resulting permits that may be utilized. The ordinance establishes
a residential density allocation system, with the goal of promoting a mix of housing types in the
designated percentages listed in Table 3-11. These percentages were derived from the
breakdown in existing housing units in Lodi when the ordinance was first conceived in 1989.
Table 3-11: Growth Management Ordinance Breakdown by Density
 Housing Type                           Units/Acre                   Percent
 Low Density                                   <7                       65%
 Medium Density                              7-20                        10
 High Density                                 >20                        25
 Source: City of Lodi, General Plan 1991.
The allocation for a given year is calculated in the following manner: Lodi’s DOF population
estimate x 0.02 ÷ Lodi’s DOF estimate of persons per household = number of allocations
For example, in 2008, the 2% GMAO translated to a maximum of 453 residential building
permits a year: 295 for low density housing units (under seven units/acre), 45 for medium
density housing units (7-20 units/acre), and 113 for high-density housing units (over 20
units/acre).
The breakdown by density establishes an upper limit for the number of permits, but does not
guarantee that the density quotas for the three categories are attained by the end of a given
year. Because in most years demand has been less than available permits, an inventory of
available permits has built up, standing at a total of 5,111 available units (remaining from the
1989-2008).
Assuming that Lodi’s population continues to grow at 1.2% annually (the average growth rate
from 2000-2008), with 2.8 persons per household (the average household size in 2008), permits
for about 2,779 additional units will be allocated from January 1, 2009 to June 30, 2014. This
                                                         3-38

                                   Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
means that in total, development permits for approximately 7,890 units will be available to
fulfill Lodi’s RHNA, which is 3,891. The density breakdown of these allocations appears in
Table 3-12, below. Of the City’s 3,891 RHNA, 971 are allocated to extremely-low-/very-low-
income units and 650 are allocated to low-income units. This means that the City must identify
sites for a total of 1,621 affordable units during this planning period. The default density—the
density at which it is assumed by HCD that affordable units can feasibly be built—is at least 20
units per acre for Lodi. While some medium density sites may therefore qualify, even if only
high-density sites are counted, there are 2,779 allocations—more than enough to cover the
1,651 RHNA for all economics segments of the population.

How Permits are Allocated and Points Awarded
Proposed developments receiving the highest number of points under an annual permit
application process receive allocations. Projects are ranked by point-score and eliminated as
necessary in order to equal the number of permits allowed for a given year. No single-family
development is allowed to receive more than one third of the permits available in any single
year unless the number of applications is less than the total permits available for the year. The
current GMAO excludes commercial and industrial projects; senior housing; on-site
replacement of housing in existence as of September 1, 1989; and projects of four units or less.
To facilitate the development of affordable units, Program 1.2 excludes affordable housing
from units that are required to receive allocations.
In practice, demand for permits has not exceeded the supply since 1991. Since that time there
has been a backlog of available permits which rolls over from year to year. There is no cap on
the number of allocations that can be granted annually nor is there an expiration date.
Moreover, multi-family and affordable housing are eligible for 30 additional points. As shown
in the table below, multi-family housing is eligible for up to 20 bonus points for landscaping
and architectural design, not available to single-family developments. In addition, projects with
units affordable for low and moderate income households can earn up to 10 points. However,
because of the large number of permits available, this scoring system is not expected to be
necessary or used during this Housing Element planning period. The City awards points as
follows:

Conclusion
Overall, the Growth Management Program does not present a substantial constraint to
development during this planning period. There are more than enough available allocations to
meet housing demand. There is no annual cap on the number of allocations that can be
granted and no expiration on the permits Moreover, senior units are exempt from the
allocation process and affordable units will be exempt (Program 1.2).
However, the allocation process adds time and cost up front to the development process for
two reasons. The allocations occur once a year and an investment is required on the applicant’s
part to provide the level of site plan and application detail required by the City to receive an
allocation. The reason the City only accepts allocations once a year is so that projects can be
compared. Generally, projects submitted in May will receive allocations by the end of the
calendar year. The time and cost are recouped for successful applicants who receive allocations
because their proposed site plans and other details of the development proposal are reviewed
and approved by the City during the allocation process. This provides a degree of certainty and
ultimately efficiency in the approval process.
Once a development proposal is approved, an applicant may proceed with a Tentative
Subdivision Map (TSM). Approval of the TSM is the final major regulatory process for the
applicant. Following approval of the TSM and allocation of housing units, the applicant
generally need only apply for ministerial approvals (final subdivision map, building permits,
etc.). Applicants can apply for multi-year allocations (up to three years), which further reduces
the long-term cost of receiving development approvals under the allocation process. However,
use of housing allocations must be done in accordance with the schedule approved and
construction occur in the year for which the allocation applies.
The City of Lodi does not believe that added costs exist with respect to the Growth
Management Program. The time frame for project review and approval is consistent with, if
not shorter than, other communities. The review of site plans in the approval of multi-family
projects is consistent with sound planning practice and other jurisdictions. Finally, since the

inception of the Ordinance, no medium or high density request has been denied; this is
important given the statewide and local need for affordable housing opportunities.
Development Review Process
A City’s development review process—the steps that it lays out and the time that it takes to
review and make a decision on a development application—can serve as a constraint to
residential development. This section explains the City’s development review practices.
Administrative Deviations
Minor deviations from the provisions of Lodi’s Zoning Ordinance are approved through the
processing of an administrative deviation. This process requires the submittal of an application
and involves review and approval by Community Development and Public Works and Electric
Utility Department staff only and can be submitted for land located within any zoning district.
Administrative deviations are issued only because of special circumstances such as topography
or size constraints that obstruct development of a site. Lodi’s Zoning Ordinance identifies the
only modifications for which an administrative deviation can be issued. These modifications
include: off-street parking requirements, setback requirements, area and width requirements,
height requirements, and landscaping requirements. Modifications are only allowed up to a
certain percentage of the standard requirements.
Site Plan and Architectural Review
The development review process includes site plan and architectural review for certain
development projects by the Site Plan and Architectural Review Committee (SPARC). The
purpose of this review is to ensure compliance with the Zoning Ordinance and promote
orderly development. Projects required to obtain site plan and architectural approval are:
    x   Residential buildings proposed in R-GA, R-MD, R-HD, R-C-P, C-1, and C-2, except
        single-family dwellings, duplexes, and triplexes;
    x   Commercial-professional offices and institutional buildings proposed in areas zoned R-
        C-P and C-1;
    x   Nonresidential buildings proposed in areas zoned C-1, C-2, and C-M;
    x   Nonresidential buildings proposed in areas zoned M-1 and M-2, which abut areas
        zoned R-1, R-2, R-GA, R-MD, R-HD, R-C-P, C-1, and C-2; and
    x   Any use requiring a Use Permit, or when the Planning Commission or City Council
        requires a site plan and architectural review as a condition of a discretionary permit.
Site plan and architectural review is facilitated by the SPARC, which was established to assist
the Planning Commission in reviewing site plans and architectural drawings. Four of the five
members are appointed by the Mayor, while the SPARC is appealable to the Planning
Commission. The Planning Commission is the final regulatory authority that issues decisions
on most developments within the city. SPARC meetings are open to the public and are publicly
noticed.
Applicants are required to submit the following information to the Committee:
                                                3-42

                                 Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
    x   A site plan of the proposed structures that complements the neighborhood and pre-
        serves light and air on adjoining properties;
    x   Landscaping and/or fencing of yards and setback area, use of landscaping, and/or fenc-
        ing for screening purposes;
    x   Design of ingress and egress;
    x   Off-street parking and loading facilities;
    x   Drawings or sketches of the exterior elevations; and
    x   Designation of location of existing fire hydrants.
These requirements are relatively easy to meet and do not add significantly to the cost or time
required for site plan review since these elements are already required for planning and
building approval processes and proceed in parallel. The SPARC meets monthly or as needed.
The review process proceeds as follows:
    x   Planning staff reviews site plan and architectural review applications to determine if
        projects require discretionary approval from the Planning Commission in addition to
        site plan and architectural review. Discretionary approval may be required if a project
        needs a use permit or variance—it does not apply to multi-family dwellings in the fol-
        lowing districts, which permit multi-family housing by right: R-GA, R-MD, R-HD, R-
        C-P, C-1, and C-2. On the other hand, condo conversions would trigger a use permit,
        though existing tenants would have the first right of refusal.
    x   If it is determined that discretionary approval is required, the application in question is
        sent to the Planning Commission for review of the site plan and architectural features.
    x   If the application falls into one of the categories requiring site plan and architectural
        review (but does not require discretionary approval), it is reviewed by the SPARC.
    x   The approval body, whether the Planning Commission or the SPARC, has the power to
        approve or disapprove the application or to approve the application subject to com-
        pliance with modifications or conditions to comply with the City’s Municipal Code and
        other applicable laws and regulations—this evaluation against existing laws serves as
        the findings for approval or denial.
    x   The SPARC has up to 21 days to make a decision. Upon approval of submitted plans,
        or at the expiration of 21 days, the City issues a building permit, provided that all
        building code requirements have been met and the applicant does not need a Use Per-
        mit (which triggers Planning Commission review).
    x   The SPARC’s decision may be appealed to the Planning Commission. Appeals must be
        filed in writing, with a $300 fee, within ten days of the SPARC’s decision.
Development Review Timeframe
The development review timeframe is affected by several factors. Some of these factors, such as
the amount of time it takes to a) determine the completeness of an application, b) determine if
environmental review is necessary, and c) approve or disapprove a project from the date
environmental review is complete or determination of categorical exemption is made are
within the control of jurisdictions. Other factors, such as the time it takes to gather application
                                                3-43

                                    DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
materials or complete an environmental document are largely in the hands of developers. Still
other factors such as the availability of project financing are dependent upon the state of the
economy.
The City complies with State law by taking only 5-10 days to determine if an application is
complete and 5-10 days to determine if environmental review is required (the State actually
allows up to 30 days for both of these steps) as well as only 180 days when an EIR is required or
60 days when a negative declaration is made (or the project is exempt from CEQA) to approve
or disapprove a project (see Table 3-13). However, typically, project approvals take longer
because of the factors discussed above that are out of the City’s control as well as additional
steps such as conditional use permits and construction permits that may be required.
 A typical single-family development will require a residential allocation, tentative and final
tract map, environmental review (Negative Declaration or EIR), Planning Commission review,
City Council review (if a Planning Commission decision is appealed), and construction permits
(building, grading, etc.). From start to finish, the process will typically take six to 12 months. A
large or complex project, particularly one triggering state or federal environmental mandates,
can take longer. A typical multi-family development will require a residential allocation,
environmental review (Negative Declaration or EIR), Planning Commission review, City
Council review (if a Planning Commission decision is appealed), and construction permits
(building, grading, etc.). From start to finish, the process will typically take six to 12 months.
Multi-family and single-family developments are also required to go through the Site Plan and
Architecture Approval Committee process. It takes two to four weeks to complete staff review
before the development can be submitted to the Committee. Then, the Committee takes 21
days to review the project. It should be noted that smaller developments in the city such as one
single family home or two- to four-unit multi-family structures are only required to obtain
building permits and are not required to go through the Site Plan and Architectural Approval
Committee.

Constraints to Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Given that persons with disabilities frequently have difficulty finding housing that meets their
needs, the State requires special analysis of governmental constraints to housing for persons
with disabilities.
                                                               3-45

                                     DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
Zoning and Land Use Policies and Practices
Lodi’s Zoning Ordinance permits certain detached and attached accessory uses and various
projections into yards and setbacks. While the Ordinance does not specifically indicate that
facilities for access by persons with disabilities are permitted, accessory uses such as ramps or
lifts for handicapped accessibility are similar to the permitted uses that are specified. Requests
for reasonable accommodations are approved administratively (without the requirement of a
public hearing or other special review) unless the nature of the request triggers a major design
review, which is unlikely. The City does not charge a separate fee for such consultation, and
any representative of an applicant (including the applicant) can make a request to the City for
reasonable accommodations. Reasonable accommodations requests are subject to a building
permit ($118 for a single-family home) and generally take 10-15 business days to approve.
There are no specific programs, or provisions within the Zoning Ordinance that specifically
obstruct the development of housing or other structures that accommodate persons with
disabilities. However, there are no special provisions either, which may be a constraining factor
upon improvements and developments focused to meet the special needs of persons with
disabilities. Creation and implementation of a program designed to increase the allowances for
persons with disabilities would remove this potential constraint [See Program 1.1].
On- and Off-site Improvement Standards
Site improvements are an important component of new development and include roads, water
and sewer, and other infrastructure necessary to serve the development. Improvement
requirements are regulated by the City’s Subdivision Ordinance. Within the existing city limits,
off-site improvement requirements are typically limited because the infrastructure needed to
serve infill development is already in place. Where off-site improvements are required, they
typically relate to local improvements to existing facilities to accommodate higher density
development or to repair or replace aged infrastructure.
Street Improvements
Street improvement standards can have a significant impact on housing cost. The cost of
providing streets for new residential developments, in turn, is primarily influenced by the
required right-of-way width, pavement width, and pavement improvement standards. Table 3-
14 summarizes Lodi’s right-of-way and pavement requirements for the hierarchy of streets.
The right-of-way and pavement requirements allow for adequate though slightly narrower
streets in residential areas than in many communities. Minimum pavement widths of 50 feet or
more for collector streets and 40 feet of more for residential streets are common among local
jurisdictions. Lodi’s Zoning Ordinance includes a provision for reimbursement to developers
for excess widths of street construction, more than 68 feet for construction of new streets and
widening in excess of 34 feet on one side.
Required street improvements include curbs, gutters, and sidewalks of at least 5 1/2 feet in
width. The minimum sidewalk improvement standard is consistent with accessibility
requirements for persons with disabilities and is adequate for ensuring pedestrian access in
residential areas. Planting strips equaling 2% of the five and a half foot swath are also required.

Drainage
Lodi requires that developers of residential subdivisions prepare master storm drainage plans
for the area associated with the tentative map. Storm drains must conform to the City’s master
storm drainage plan. Any facilities within the subdivision that are not part of the City’s master
plan are the developer’s responsibility. However, the City Council has the ability to grant
credits to developers for storm drain lines and manholes that developers construct. Payment of
mitigation for drainage impacts is included within the City’s development impact fee.
Sanitary Sewers
Internal sanitary sewers and appropriate off-site sanitary sewers are required for all proposed
development. Installation is required to comply with the current City policies and standards. In
the event that developments are asked to construct oversized facilities, Lodi has established a
mechanism by which the developer is reimbursed for excess improvements. As part of the
development impact fee paid by development, funding, in part, for construction, operation,
and maintenance of city-wide sanitary sewer facilities is provided.
Potable Water
Internal water transmission pipelines and appropriate off-site connection facilities are required
for all proposed development. Installation is required to comply with the current City policies
and standards. Similar to the process for sanitary sewers, in the event that developments are
asked to construct oversized facilities, the developer is reimbursed for excess improvements.
The City also levies a development impact fee that is used, in part, to construct, operate, and
maintain citywide water system facilities.
Code Enforcement
The Building Department provides assistance to applicants and owners in meeting State and
local codes by publishing compliance forms, handouts, and worksheets; and through the plan
check process. The City’s Community Improvement Unit within the Lodi Police Department
administers the code enforcement program that works to bring substandard homes into
compliance with all applicable building and health and safety codes. Over the past 10 years,
approximately 1,800 housing units that were identified as out of compliance have made
improvements. Using this rate as an average, the City should be able to rehabilitate
                                                           3-47

                                    DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
approximately 1,080 housing units during the planning period. The City recent instituted a
code enforcement tool through its website, allowing community members to report violations,
upload photographs, and track progress in rectifying the program. This tool is expect to assist
in increasing reporting of violations, as well as increase accountability for the City in issuing
violations or warnings and for property owners to bring their properties into compliance.
Fees
Development Impact Fees
The City of Lodi levies one combined development impact fee for all the various municipal
facilities and services under the City’s jurisdiction. Although requiring developments to either
construct site improvements and/or pay pro rata shares toward the provision of infrastructure
and public services is common practice, these requirements nonetheless result in increases to
the cost of housing development and in turn, the final sale price or rent of housing. Despite the
initial cost that impact fees impose on new homes, such fees are necessary to protect the public
health and safety.
Calculating Fees: Residential Acre Equivalent
Development impact fees can serve as a constraint to affordable housing development as the
current fee program disincentivizes multi-family development. This constraint will be
alleviated through revision of impact fee program, as described in Program 3.1. To calculate
the fee charged to a residential development, the City has established a formula based on the
fee per acre times the number of acres for each type of public facility/service. The fee charged
to residential development depends on its “residential acre equivalent,” or RAE, factor. The
“equivalent” for purposes of calculating the factor is a single-family home in the Low Density
General Plan land use category (factor of 1.00). The specific factor or ratio of fee, applied to a
specific type of residential development is based on the City’s estimate of the amount of facility
or service that a particular land use will need in relation to a single-family home in the Low
Density land use category. For example, a housing unit in the High Density residential category
has a RAE factor that ranges from 1.00 for storm drainage to 4.72 for police services, as shown
in Table 3-15. As a result, per acre fees are much higher for the High Density category than for
the Low Density category: $211,558 and $82,955, respectively.

The RAE factors are based on an average density assumption for each residential land use
category, not the specific density of the proposed development. In multifamily zones, the RAE
factors can have the effect of significantly increasing the fee payment of development projects
(on a per-unit basis) that have lower densities and fewer units than the average assumed by the
City. One method of mitigating this potential cost impact would be for the City to use a factor
for establishing fees on multifamily projects based on the actual density of the proposed
development, not the average density assumed by the City. See program 3.1 which serves to
mitigate this constraint, reducing the impact fees assessed on multi-family units and reducing
the existing disincentive.
Planning Fees
The Planning Division collects the fees listed in Table 3-16. Many of the fees include a base fee
as well as an hourly charge for staff time. The Planning Division operates on an hourly basis.
The fee is a deposit against expected time and cost to complete. The deposit amounts listed are
averages with more complex projects requiring additional funds. Planning fees could total
about $3,500 for a single-family dwelling and likewise for a multi-family unit.

Total Fee Estimates and Comparisons
As mentioned in the discussion of construction costs, City staff estimate that a basic, 1,200-
square foot single family home would necessitate $15,433 in development impact fees. The
minimum cost of producing such a home in Lodi is estimated to be between $160,000 and
$170,000, excluding developer fee or profit. Therefore, fees represent about nine percent of the
development costs—fairly low compared to the typical threshold of about 12 percent. A multi-
family 1,000-square foot unit would require development impact fees of about $11,000 per
unit. The cost of constructing such a unit is estimated at between $106,000 and $110,000,
excluding developer fee or profit. Therefore fees represent about ten percent of total
development costs.
A review of planning fees from neighboring cities reveals that Lodi’s fees are in-line, if not
lower, than those charged in other San Joaquin County jurisdictions. While it is difficult to do a
direct comparison of fees collected across jurisdictions because the types of fees jurisdictions
levy vary somewhat, Table 3-17, below, compares several common fees. Rezonings, tentative
parcel maps, and most negative declarations and use permits are less expensive in Lodi than in
                                                        3-50

ENVIRONMENTAL, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PUBLIC SERVICE
CONSTRAINTS
Environmental factors, including a lack of necessary infrastructure or public services, can
constrain residential development in a community by increasing costs and reducing the
amount of land suitable for housing. As discussed below, the City’s water, sewer, and storm
drain facilities are adequate to accommodate the existing and future development of Lodi. The
following discussion addresses the constraint which environmental and infrastructure issues
may pose on housing development for the City of Lodi.
As part of the General Plan Update in 2009, an infrastructure assessment was undertaken to
determine infrastructure demand, supply, and projected improvements in both infill and new
growth areas. Although the assessment was completed for a 2030 planning horizon and full
General Plan development potential, the analysis has been adjusted to accommodate the 2014
horizon and Housing Element sites presented in Section 3.1. Note that these are conservative
estimates, since the infrastructure analysis includes both residential and non-residential uses
identified in Phase 1 of the General Plan.
Historically, the city has grown in increments, which has ensured the availability of public
services for new development, while avoiding adverse impacts to levels of service to existing
residents. New development is assessed a development impact mitigation fee, which in part,
funds the incremental improvements to the water, sewer collection and disposal, and drainage
systems. One of the City’s major goals, identified in the General Plan is to maintain an
adequate level of service in the City’s infrastructure to meet the needs of existing and projected
development.
Storm Drainage and Flood Control
Based on revised flood risk evaluations prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) for the City of Lodi and San Joaquin County, effective October 19, 2009, flood
hazards are a constraint to development only in two areas of the city: the area immediately
                                                               3-51

                                             DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
adjacent to the Mokelumne River along the city’s northern boundary, and the area around the
White Slough Water Pollution Control Facility. No new development is planned within either
of these areas, as shown in Figure 3-3. Most of the city lies in Zone X, which describes lands
subject to the 0.2% annual (500-year) flood zone or that lie within the 100-year flood zone, but
with flooding depths less than one foot. This suggests that these areas have a low susceptibility
to major flooding, but would be inundated, with depths less than one foot, during a 500-year
flood event.
Levees or berms along the Mokelumne River protect the city from flood events. As long as
levees are not over-topped and maintain their structural integrity, flooding is considered to be
very unlikely. Should a major storm event cause levees to be over topped or if a levee fails,
flooding would occur. Flooding also can occur when runoff exceeds the capacity of local
systems and cannot drain adequately. The City’s existing stormwater system functions well,
with no substantial flooding problems.
The General Plan Growth Management and Infrastructure Element identifies storm drain
improvements and calls for the preparation of a storm water master plan. Table 3-18 describes
the proposed improvements for the sites identified in this Housing Element. Facility planning
and sizing will need to be refined and verified though preparation of the detailed stormwater
master plan.
Table 3-18: Required Stormwater Infrastructure
Location                      Required Infrastructure
East of Beckman Road          An upgraded (size and pumps) public station is required for this basin.
(Pixley Park)
South of Harney Lane          Detention basins and trunk storm drains will be needed for all watersheds. A
                              pump station with two pumps will also be required. There will need to be an
                              outfall pipe line located in a 75 foot wide greenbelt buffer along the south
                              boundary of the city that flows to a new 60 cfs pump station on the east side
                              of the WID canal (WID pump station). These improvements are part of the
                              South Lodi Storm Drain Master Plan and South Hutchins Study Area Storm
                              Drainage Master Plan.
North of Kettleman            Storm drainage service for the area of growth North of Kettleman Lane and
Lane and west of              west of Lower Sacramento Road, within General Plan Phase 1, has already
Lower Sacramento              been planned. No additional new facilities are necessary.

Based on the City’s incremental approach to annexation and the extension of the public
facilities and services through the payment of development fees, Lodi does not anticipate that
residential development will be impeded in infill areas or the areas to be annexed due to
drainage or flood control issues.

Water Service
The City of Lodi operates the potable water distribution system that serves all areas within the
city limits. The City’s water supply comes from groundwater via 27 municipal wells, with a safe
yield for the area estimated to be about 15,000 acre-feet per year. Under terms of an agreement
with the Woodbridge Irrigation District (WID), 6,000 acre-feet per year of surface water is also
currently available. In addition, further groundwater and surface water supplies will be made
available through the annexation process, since new land area increases the safe yield and WID
supplies available to the City, respectively.
A complete water supply and demand analysis was undertaken as part of the General Plan
Update and associated environmental review. Scaling this analysis method from the General
Plan’s 2030 growth areas and planning horizon, to the 2014 Housing Element sites and
horizon, also results in a finding of an adequate water supply to meet demand. Table 3-19
documents these estimates, finding that water supplies are adequate to meet demand in both
normal and dry years.

The General Plan Growth Management and Infrastructure Element also identifies the
following water distribution improvements:
     x    A new transmission main is required from the new surface water treatment plant to
          Mills Avenue. This main would be connected to the existing water distribution system
          to supply surface water to the City’s water system.
     x    Specific water system requirements should be further evaluated through preparation of
          a potable water master plan at an appropriate time in the future.
     x    New wells will be required in the southern and eastern areas of the city. Additional wa-
          ter storage tanks may be needed.
                                                              3-54

                                          Chapter 3: Resources and Constraints
Moreover, an updated Urban Water management Plan will be developed in 2010, consistent
with State law and will be consistent with this Housing Element and the recently updated
General Plan. As discussed above, the city’s desire to grow incrementally is addressed through
the implementation of a growth management program and the levying of a development
impact mitigation fee. Development that occurs within annexed areas will provide internal
water transmission facilities and pay fees as appropriate for necessary off-site infrastructure.
Therefore, water service will not be a constraint to the City’s ability to meet future housing
needs.
Sewer Service
The City of Lodi owns and operates the municipal wastewater system, which collects all
domestic and limited industrial wastewater flows within the city limits. The City also owns and
operates a wastewater treatment plant, the White Slough Water Pollution Control Facility
(WSWPCF), located six miles south of the city. With the recent expansion of the plant,
WSWPCF has an Average Dry Weather Flow (ADWF) capacity of 8.5 mgd. The ADWF flow
to the WSWPCF for 2008 was 6.4 mgd, indicating that the existing facility currently has an
excess capacity of about 2.1 mgd (ADWF). This excess capacity will accommodate much of the
development proposed in this Housing Element. However, the infrastructure assessment for
the General Plan determined that capacity expansion of the WSWPCF would be required
within the early stages of Phase 1. The City of Lodi Wastewater Master Plan (2001)
preliminarily identified the facilities needed to achieve a capacity of 12 mgd. The General Plan
Growth Management and Infrastructure Element calls for the preparation of an updated
sanitary sewer master plan to address future needs for infill and new growth areas. Table 3-20
describes the improvements needed to adequately meet the needs of the Housing Element sites
and other Phase 1 General Plan development (including non-residential uses).

                             Phase 1. Alternatively, a scalping plant near the City could be constructed to
                             provide recycled water for use in/near the city that would reduce the size or
                             extent of the required new facilities at the WSWPCF. However, there would
                             need to be a nearby use for the recycled water for a scalping facility to be feasi-

Development within annexed areas will provide sewer collection facilities and pay fees as
appropriate for necessary off-site infrastructure. Infill areas will also require sewer
improvements, as identified above. Since the initial planning steps have been taken to assess

sewer infrastructure needs, expansion of sewer service to meet the City’s future housing needs
is not a constraint to development.
Agriculture and the Williamson Act
Nearly all of the soils in the Lodi area are classified, by the U.S. Department of Conservation, as
prime agricultural soils, some requiring frequent irrigation. Historically, various parcels within
this area have been subject to Williamson Act compliance.16 Potential residential annexation
areas, defined by Phase 1 of the General Plan and described in Section 3.1, include 73 acres of
land covered by active Williamson Act contracts. Of these acres, 68 acres are designated for
Low Density Residential and five acre for Medium Density Residential. The City does not need
this land in order to accommodate its share of the RHNA (specifically the below-market rate
units) and does not intend to pursue annexation until those contracts have expired and the
market is ready for urban development.
Protection of Habitat and Species
The San Joaquin County Multi-Species Conservation and Open-Space Plan (SJMSCP) is a 50-
year habitat conservation plan that seeks to protect agriculture, open space, habitat, and
wildlife, in order to address the impacts of urban development and conversion of open space
land. In 2001, the City of Lodi adopted the SJMSCP, thereby allowing project applicants to use
this plan to mitigate open space conversions while satisfying CEQA requirements. Project
applicants may: pay an in-lieu fee that mitigates cumulative impacts; dedicate habitat lands as
conservation easement or fee title; purchase mitigation bank credits from a mitigation bank
approved by SJMSCP; or propose an alternative plan, consistent with the SJMSCP goals and
equivalent in biological value. It should be noted that there are no known protected species in
areas encompassed by the housing sites listed in this document.
In preparing the SJMSCP, land uses and habitats were mapped throughout the County and
categorized into land use categories to help determine compensation fees. Potential annexation
areas described in Section 3.1 fall into three of the SJMSCP compensation zones and include
the following per acre fees in 2009: No Pay Zone ($0), Multi-Purpose Open Space Land
($7,052), and Agricultural Habitat Open Space ($14,104). As a voluntary plan, developers have
the option to participate (or not) depending on site evaluation. Participation may increase or
decrease the costs associated with mitigating the environmental impact, depending upon site
specific conditions. Although electing to pay an in-lieu fee would increase development costs,
this cost is the same as other cities in the county that participate in the SJMSCP.

   The Williamson Act is a mechanism by which agricultural land is preserved for a specified period of time.

4       Housing Strategy
The provision of housing is a critical concern for cities throughout California. The housing
element is a city's major statement of local housing strategy, providing an integrated set of
goals, policies and programs to improve the condition and availability of housing.
4.1     GOALS AND POLICIES
H-G1         Provide a range of housing types and densities for all economic segments of
             the community while emphasizing high quality development, homeownership
             opportunities, and the efficient use of land.
H-P1.1       Promote the development of a broad mix of housing types through the following
             mix of residential densities as described in Policy GM-P4 of the Growth
             Management Element.
H-P1.2       Regulate the number of housing units approved each year to maintain a
             population-based annual residential growth rate of 2%, consistent with the
             recommendations of the Mayor’s Task Force and the growth management
             ordinance.

4.2     IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS
The following programs describe actions that the City intends to implement during the time
frame of this Housing Element (2007 through 2014). For some of these programs, the
description includes a target (quantified objective) for the number of units to be produced or
households to be assisted during the Housing Element timeframe.
H-G1         Provide a range of housing types and densities for all economic segments of
             the community while emphasizing high quality development, homeownership
             opportunities, and the efficient use of land.
Program 1.1: Revise Zoning Ordinance
Within one year of adoption of the Housing Element, the City will bring the Zoning
Ordinance into conformance with the General Plan. The City shall revise Title 17 of the Lodi
Municipal Code (Zoning Ordinance) to reduce barriers to, and provide incentives for, the
construction and conservation of a variety of housing types, including Medium, High-
Density, and affordable housing consistent with the policies and programs of this Element.
Revisions to Title 17 will include, but not be limited to, the following:
    x   The addition of a chapter that provides for density bonuses and other incentives for
        projects that include 5% very-low-income housing, 10% low-income housing, 10%
        median-income housing, and senior housing (even if none of the units are income re-
        stricted), in compliance with Sections 65915 – 65918 of the California Government
        Code. The maximum density bonus granted is 35%. The City shall work with the San
        Joaquin County Housing Authority in developing procedures and guidelines for es-
        tablishing income eligibility for the "reserved" units and for maintaining the "re-
        served" units as affordable units for at least 30 years. The City shall seek Housing Au-
        thority administration of the reserved units. The City shall establish a program to
        publicize the availability of the density bonus program through the City’s website,
        program information at the Community Development Department public counter,
        and pre-development meetings with housing providers (such as the housing unit allo-
        cation stage). The City shall encourage prospective housing developers to use the
        density bonus program at pre-development meetings.
                                                4-3

                                DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
x Conformance with California Government Code sections 65852.3 and 65852.7, which
  require that manufactured homes in single-family zones on permanent foundations
  be permitted under the same standards as site-built homes (with limited exceptions).
x The City will continue to allow, by right, the development of emergency shelters in
  areas zoned C-M or C-2 (or their equivalent under the updated Development Code).
  These zones typically have good transit and services access, and allow both commer-
  cial and residential development. The sites inventory identified 2.5 acres designated
  Downtown Mixed Use (which is consistent with the C-2 zone as described below)
  that could be used for emergency shelters. These sites could accommodate the esti-
  mated 94 homeless, including separate shelters for individual adults and families.
x Addition of definitions for transitional and supportive housing as well as clarification
  that they are treated the same as other residential uses in residential zones. This is in-
  tended to help support housing options for extremely-low income households and
  others in need of additional services.
x Addition of a definition of Farmworker housing that does not conflict with State law
  definitions for employee housing (beginning with California Health and Safety Code
  Section 17000) and specification of the zoning districts and standards under which
  such housing will be permitted. The City will also designate residential and commer-
  cial zones in which Farmworker housing will be permitted. Such zones will be se-
  lected, in part, based on the availability of vacant land or sites with re-use potential. In
  implementing this program, the City will treat permanent housing for Farmworkers
  who live in Lodi year-round the same as other permanent housing (single-family,
  multi-family, manufactured homes, etc.) The City will permit seasonal or migrant
  Farmworker housing in a similar fashion to group homes with respect to the zones
  and conditions for approval. Farmworker housing will be permitted by right in any
  zone in which agriculture is a primary permitted use.
x Clarification of residential care facility definition and standards. Create a definition
  for “residential care facility” that is broad and encompasses facilities that care for a
  range of clients. The City will specify that all such facilities with six or fewer residents
  are permitted in residential zoning districts. The City will also designate zoning dis-
  tricts in which facilities of seven or more persons will be permitted through a Use
  Permit and standards for such facilities. In addition, to comply with State law, the
  Zoning Ordinance will be clarified to explicitly prohibit the overconcentration of res-
  idential care facilities (facilities should be at least 300 feet apart).
x Amend the Zoning Ordinance to include a definition for “group residential” that in-
  cludes all living situations with shared living quarters without separate kitchen or
  bathroom facilities for each room or unit, including boarding houses, dormitories,
  and SROs
x Revision of off-street parking requirements (Chapter 17.60) to reduce standards to: 1
  covered space/1-bedroom and two covered spaces/2-bedroom as well as one unco-
  vered space for guests for every three units.
x Revision of standards for second dwelling units to allow the conversion of accessory
  buildings to second units (as well as allowing detached second units, in general) sub-
  ject to compliance with all other zoning and parking standards, an appropriate mini-
  mum lot size for detached second units (640 square feet), and architectural compati-
  bility with the main dwelling unit. The City will permit second dwelling units through
  an administrative permit process (i.e. ministerial and by right; not requiring a Use
  Permit) in compliance with State law (California Government Code section 65852.2).
                                            4-4

                                      Chapter 4: Housing Strategy
   x  Specification of procedures for requesting reasonable accommodations for persons
      with disabilities that allow for administrative (ministerial) approval of accessible fea-
      tures. Create explanatory handouts for those wishing to request reasonable accom-
      modations.
   x  Completion of other significant revisions that will facilitate residential development
      and allow for greater design flexibility, such as:
      - Revised zoning districts consistent with the new land use designations in the Land
           Use Element);
      - New Low Density Residential designation that allows for the development of sin-
           gle-family detached, two-family and three-family homes up to the General Plan
           Land Use Density of eight units per acre;
      - Provision for a variety of housing types in residential zones including care facili-
           ties, shelters and live/work projects;
      - New Group Residential definition that will cover all group living situations with
           shared living quarters and without separate kitchens or bathrooms for each room
           or unit (for example: dormitories, fraternities, single room occupancy (SRO)
           units).
      - Single-family detached lot sizes as small as 5,000 square feet;
      - Minimum and maximum setbacks to match the desired General Plan intent and
           desired character for specific districts, with reduced—or potentially even no—
           front setbacks in pedestrian-oriented mixed-use districts.
      - No Use Permit requirements to build multi-family dwelling within the Medium
           or High density designations
   x  Until the Zoning Ordinance is comprehensively updated to be consistent with the re-
      cently adopted General Plan, the City will adopt and administer interim zoning regu-
      lations to ensure General Plan consistency in development review. The following ma-
      trix, which will be incorporated into the interim regulations, describes what develop-
      ment regulations will apply in General Plan land use designations that permit resi-
      dential development by right.
                                              Residential Density (du/ac)  Corresponding Zoning District
        General Plan Land Use Classification     (from the General Plan)  (other development standards)
        Low-Density Residential                                      2-8                         R-LD
        Medium-Density Residential                                  8-20                         R-MD
        High-Density                                               15-35                         R-HD
        Downtown Mixed Use                                          8-35                           C-2
        Mixed Use Corridor                                          2-35                           C-1
        Mixed Use Center                                            8-35                           C-1
      Ensure that densities established in the General Plan are not unduly limited by the
      interim regulations; where interim regulations may get in the way of a project
      attaining the General Plan-desired densities, update the regulations so that they are
      not a constraint.

                                   DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
Timeframe:      Complete Zoning Ordinance amendments as part of the new unified
                development code within one year of adoption of this Housing Element and
                interim zoning regulations within one month of adoption of this Element.
Funding:        General Fund and federal funds (application underway)
Objective:      Reduce regulatory barriers to the provision of housing.
Program 1.2: Revise Growth Management Program
The City will revise its growth management program to exempt housing units affordable to
very-low- or low-income households with long-term affordability restrictions. The City will
also monitor the program to ensure that it does not represent a constraint to multi-family
and affordable housing for all income groups. The program should be evaluated for
cumulative effects of all development application requirements and costs by the end of the
planning period.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:      Revise Growth Management Program within a year of adoption of this
                Housing Element and evaluate implementation by the end of the planning
                period.
Funding:        Application fees
Objective:      Expedite the residential development approval process for affordable housing.
Program 1.3: Personal Security Standards
The City will continue to implement design standards applicable to all new residential
projects with the objective of improving the personal security of residents and discouraging
criminal activity. Design standards will address issues such as the placement of landscaping,
accessory buildings, and accessory structures in a manner that does not impede the City’s
ability to conduct neighborhood police patrols and observe potential criminal activity;
lighting and other security measures for residents, and the use of materials that facilitate the
removal of graffiti and/or increase resistance to vandalism.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:      Current and ongoing (2007-2014)
Funding:        Development fees
Objective:      Reduce the susceptibility of residential properties and neighborhoods to
                criminal activity and increase residents’ perception of personal safety.
Program 1.4: Land Inventory
The City shall maintain a current inventory of vacant, residentially zoned parcels and a list of
approved residential projects, and shall make this information available to the public and
developers, including information on underutilized sites within the downtown area with
                                               4-6

                                     Chapter 4: Housing Strategy
residential or mixed-use development potential. The City shall update the inventory and list
at least annually.
To maintain adequate sites throughout the planning period to accommodate the City’s
RHNA, pursuant to Government Code Section 65863, the City will monitor available
residential capacity and evaluate development applications, particularly in non-residential
and/or mixed use zones. Should an approval of development result in a reduction of capacity
below the residential capacity assumed in the sites inventory, the City will identify and zone
sufficient sites to accommodate the shortfall to ensure that the “no net loss” provision is
upheld (i.e. if any units that had been designated for subsidized housing are developed as
market rate, then an equal number of units must be designated in their stead).
The inventory update of infill sites should focus on opportunity sites along Mixed Use
Corridors, in the Downtown Mixed Use designation and residential areas Downtown, as
identified in the Land Use Element. The City promotes the land inventory and the availability
of each update through the City’s website, a notice at the Community Development Permit
Counter, and a press release subsequent to each update.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:        Maintain a current land vacant residentially zoned land, Ongoing.
Funding:          General Fund; contributions from property owners
Objective:        Increase the potential for infill development, thereby reducing the need to
                  prematurely annex land and convert agricultural land to urban use.
Program 1.5: Pursue State and Federal Funds in Support of Housing Construction
The City will continue to pursue available and appropriate state and federal funding sources
to support efforts to construct housing meeting the needs of low-and moderate-income
households, to assist persons with rent payments required for existing housing units, to
provide supportive services, and to provide on- and off-site improvements and public
facilities, in support of affordable housing projects. The City takes the following actions in
pursuit of State and federal funding:
     a. Meet annually with private nonprofit and for-profit affordable housing providers and
         public agencies that are interested in constructing affordable housing (and keep in
         contact with them throughout the year), providing special needs housing or shelter,
         and/or providing supportive services for low-income and special needs residents. The
         purpose of the annual meetings will be to discuss priorities for lending City support
         for funding requests for affordable housing projects and programs during the subse-
         quent 12 to 24 months. The City will promote these annual meetings through direct
         notices to private and public entities that have provided housing or supportive servic-
         es in Lodi, or that expressed an interest in doing so, in the past.
     b. Provide support to other entities (nonprofit organizations, for-profit affordable hous-
         ing providers, and public agencies) that apply directly for state or federal funds. Ex-
         amples of support to be provided by the City include: 1) expedited processing of
         planning permits that are needed before an applicant can submit a state or federal
         funding request or receive funds; 2) providing information to complete a funding re-
         quest (such as demographic, housing, or economic statistics in support of an applica-
                                                 4-7

                                    DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
        tion); and 3) letters of support for projects or programs that the City has approved
        (including preliminary or conceptual approval). This can help support organizations
        such as Central Valley Low Income Housing Corporation and the Loel Foundation
        which provide services to extremely-low income households.
    c. Apply directly for State and federal funding under programs in which the City must
        be the applicant.
In pursuing State and federal funding, and working with other private and public entities to
provide affordable housing, the City seeks to increase the availability of housing and
supportive services to the most vulnerable population groups and those with the greatest
unmet needs, such as very-low-income and frail seniors, persons with disabilities who cannot
live independently, farmworkers and their families, low-income large families, and single-
parent households, particularly those with small children.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:      For Action a., annual meetings, 2007-2014; for Action b., quarterly each year,
                depending on funding deadlines for specific State and federal programs, 2007-
                2014; for Action c. semi-annual review and assessment of funding
                opportunities based on (1) funding cycles and eligible activities for various
                State and federal programs, (2) projects and programs proposed to the City
                for State or federal funding, and (3) City staff capacity to prepare funding
                requests.
Funding:        California Multi-family Housing Program, California Housing Finance

                National Stabilization Program, and Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Fund.
Objective:      20 extremely-low-, 50 very-low-, and 50 low-income housing units
Program 1.6: Encourage Efficient Use of Land for Residential Development
The City encourages the efficient use of land for residential development while reducing the
premature conversion of agricultural land to urban use. The City uses the following
approaches:
    x   The General Plan Growth Management and Infrastructure Element guides conti-
        guous development through the identification of three expansion phases: The third
        phase includes Urban Reserve designations that define future growth areas if initial
        phases are built out. (See the Growth Management and Infrastructure Element for de-
        tails.)
    x   In response to the City’s dual goals of preserving agricultural land/open space and
        supporting employment in the agriculture industry, the City will develop an agricul-
        tural conservation program that establishes a mitigation fee to protect and conserve
        agricultural lands. The fee will be assessed for acreage converted from agricultural to
        urban use, and used for conservation easements, fee title acquisition, research, educa-
        tion and capital improvement projects that benefit agriculture. (Program details and
                                               4-8

                                    Chapter 4: Housing Strategy
        priority areas are described in the Conservation Element, Policy C-P7.) Notably, all
        conservation areas are outside the City’s current Sphere of Influence and future
        growth areas as delineated in the current Land Use Element and therefore would not
        affect any housing sites listed in the inventory herein. The program will be developed
        with community input following buildout of phase 1 of the General Plan. During de-
        velopment of the program, the City and community members should consider how to
        exempt or reduce the fee for High Density and/or affordable housing projects.
    x   The City has adopted the San Joaquin County Multi-Species Conservation and Open-
        Space Plan (SJMSCP), a habitat conservation plan that seeks to protect agriculture,
        open space, habitat, and wildlife, in order to address the impacts of urban develop-
        ment and conservation of open space land. This allows project applicants to mitigate
        open space conversions and satisfy CEQA requirements by paying an in-lieu fee, de-
        dicating land, purchasing credits from a mitigation bank or proposing an alternative
        plan consistent with SJMSCP goals.
Responsibility: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council
Timeframe:      Require fee payment as mitigation, ongoing (2007-2014); enforce Urban
                Reserve designation and contiguity requirements when this Housing Element
                is adopted.
Funding:        General Fund
Objective:      Preserve agricultural land and reduce the amount of land needed to meet
                future urban growth needs.
Program 1.7: Provide Rental Assistance
The City shall continue to support the San Joaquin County Housing Authority in its
administration of the Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance program (formerly called
Section 8 Program). The City’s support will include distribution of program information at
the Community Development public counter, distribution of program information to rental
property owners as part of the City’s code enforcement activities, annual meetings with
representatives of the Housing Authority to discuss actions the City can take to encourage
greater participation in the Voucher Program by rental property owners, and creation and
maintenance of a link to the Housing Authority’s website on the City’s web site.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:      Distribution of Housing Choice Voucher Program information, current and
                ongoing, 2007-2014; create website link to Housing Authority website within
                six months of adoption of this Housing Element, maintain link thereafter,
                2009-2014.
Funding:        General Fund
Objective:      Increase rental property owner awareness of, and participation in, rental
                assistance programs.
Program 1.8: Focus on Neighborhood Improvement Initiatives
                                                4-9

                                   DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
The City will continue to designate a staff position, Neighborhood Services Manager (NSM),
within the Community Development Department to focus on the implementation of housing
and neighborhood improvement programs. Among the duties of the NSM are to:
    x   Develop programs and plans to produce housing, especially affordable housing, by
        means of new construction, rehabilitation or acquisition;
    x   Implement neighborhood improvement programs on a city-wide basis and develop
        neighborhood improvement strategies;
    x   Ensure compliance with federal and State laws and regulations and consistency with
        local objectives and community requirements;
    x   Prepare a variety of reports on housing preservation and development, neighborhood
        improvement and code enforcement, and other related City activities; and
    x   Manage programs for housing rehabilitation, first-time buyer and code enforcement.
        Through 2009, the City operated both housing rehabilitation and first-time home-
        buyer programs through the Urban County CDBG/HOME Program. Since 2000, a
        total of 71 low-income households have been assisted. Beginning in 2010, Lodi turned
        to the State of California HOME Program to fund the first-time homebuyer program
        and has been awarded $800,000 to do so.
The Lodi Police Department is responsible for enforcing City codes and ordinances
pertaining to neighborhood maintenance; the NSM is tasked with coordinating activities with
the code enforcement supervisor and staff within the Police Department.
Responsibility: Community Development Department; Police Department
Timeframe:       Current and ongoing, 2007-2014
Funding:         CDBG, CalHOME Program
Objective:       Improve the City’s ability to focus on the implementation of housing and
                 neighborhood improvement programs.
Program 1.9: Annex Land to Accommodate Future Housing Needs as Necessary
The City will pursue annexation of land outside the existing Sphere of Influence to conform
to the development needs for Phase 1, 2, and 3. Subsequent phases should be annexed only as
current phases meet development capacity thresholds, as described in the Growth
Management and Infrastructure Element. South of Harney Lane, an area which would
require annexation, 338 acres have been identified for Low-Density Residential; nearly 100
acres for Medium- and High-Density Residential, and 28 acres for the residential component
of Mixed Use Center. Given the backlog of unused housing allocations, recently approved
development projects, and available sites within the current City limits, the City does not
need to annex land to meet current housing needs. Nevertheless, the City will initiate the
process with property owners by the end of the planning period.
Responsibility: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council
Timeframe:       Pursue discussions with property owners about annexation, as appropriate
                 according to housing needs, but no later than the end of the planning period
                 in 2014.
                                              4-10

Objective:       Increase the City’s residential development capacity to accommodate its share
                 of the region’s future housing construction needs.
Program 1.10: Provide Homebuyer Assistance
The City will continue to implement a first-time homebuyer down payment assistance
program. The City will continue to participate with the Housing Authority in a countywide
consortium for the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage credit certificates to
assist first-time homebuyers. The City will promote the program by providing information at
the Community Development Department’s public counter and by providing a link to the
program on the City’s web site. The City’s Neighborhood Services Manager will contact real
estate agents active in Lodi to identify opportunities for program participation.
Responsibility: Community Development Department

Development Department’s link to the City’s website, information brochures available at the
Community Development Department, pre-application meetings, and a notice to the local
homebuilder’s, realtor’s, and contractor’s associations.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:       Current and ongoing (2007-2014); information is currently available on the
                 City’s website and at the public permit counter. The City also encourages pre-
                 application meetings. These practices will continue indefinitely. A notice of
                 the City’s multi-family development standards will be distributed to industry
                 organizations within six months of the adoption of this Housing Element.
Funding:         General Fund, Permit Fees
Objective:       Increase awareness of the City’s multi-family development standards.
Program 1.12: Subdividing Large Sites for Lower Income Households
To assist the development of housing for lower income households on larger sites (more than
10 acres), the City will facilitate land divisions, lot line adjustments, and specific plans
                                                4-11

                                    DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
resulting in parcels sizes that enable multifamily developments affordable to lower income
households. The City will work with property owners and non-profit developers to target
and market the availability of sites with the best potential for development. In addition, the
City will offer the following incentives for the development of affordable housing including
but not limited to:
    x   Streamlining and expediting the approval process for land division for projects that
        include affordable housing units,
    x   Deferral or waiver of fees related to the subdivision for projects affordable to lower
        income households,
    x   Technical assistance to acquire funding.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:       Determine appropriate incentives within one year of adoption. Provide
                 incentive throughout planning period, as projects are submitted to the
                 Planning Division.
Funding:         General Fund.
Objective:       Facilitate parcel sizes that that are developable for multi-family affordable
                 housing and consistent with recommendations/requirements of state, federal
                 and local financing programs.
H-G1        Encourage the maintenance, improvement, and rehabilitation of existing
            housing stock and residential neighborhoods, particularly in the Eastside area.
Program 2.1: Evaluate Applications for the Demolition of Residential Structures
The City shall implement policies and procedures for evaluating applications for demolition
of residential structures. This evaluation shall consider the implications of the demolition
with respect to the retention of affordable housing. If demolitions are deemed to result in a
reduction of the amount of affordable housing in Lodi, the City shall require the proponent of
the demolition to cooperate with the City in providing relocation assistance to displaced
residents and in determining the means for replacing demolished units. The City will provide
information regarding its policies and procedures on the City’s website and at the
Community Development Department’s public counter.
The City will determine the most appropriate method of implementing this program through
a review of past demolition permits and conditions.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:       Complete review within six month of adoption of this Housing Element;
                 implement new review procedures within one year of adoption of this

Program 2.2: Assist the Eastside Area with Housing Rehabilitation and Code
Enforcement
The City will continue to combine code enforcement and housing rehabilitation assistance,
targeted to the Eastside area. Code enforcement falls under the purview of the Lodi Police
Department, while the Neighborhood Services Manager (NSM) is responsible for
coordinating rehabilitation efforts. The NSM will promote its program through the Lodi
Improvement Committee, a neighborhood organization that provides direct outreach to area
residents and property owners, by providing information at the Community Development
Department’s public counter, and through a link to the program on the City’s website. The
NSM will work with the Committee to continue marketing the program to Eastside area
residents and property owners.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:       Current and ongoing, 2007-2014
Funding:         CDBG, HOME, CalHOME, Neighborhood Stabilization Program funding

                 violations) over the planning period of this Housing Element: 250 extremely
                 low-/very-low-, 250 low-, and 250 moderate-income.
Program 2.3: Implement Property Maintenance and Management Standards
The City will continue to implement standards for private property maintenance (Chapter
15.30 of the Municipal Code) to 1) control or eliminate conditions that are detrimental to
health, safety, and welfare; 2) preserve the quality of life and alleviate certain socioeconomic
problems created by physical deterioration of property; and 3) protect property values and
further certain aesthetic considerations for the general welfare of all residents of the City of
Lodi.
Responsibility: Police Department (code enforcement); Community Development
                 Department, Neighborhood Services Division (implementation)
Timeframe:       Code enforcement on both complaint and pro-active basis; Current and
                 ongoing, 2007-2014
Funding:         Inspection fees, code violation penalties, CDBG funds (for dwelling units
                 occupied by low-income households)
Objective:       Eliminate substandard building and property conditions
Program 2.4: Conduct a Housing Condition Survey
The City will conduct a housing survey to document its efforts at improving housing
conditions and to identify future areas and housing types for targeting its code enforcement,
housing rehabilitation assistance, and neighborhood improvement efforts.
Responsibility: Community Development Department

Timeframe:       Complete survey and report to City Council within one and a half years of
                 adoption of this Housing Element.
Funding:         CDBG, General Fund
Objective:       Document housing conditions and establish priorities for future code
                 enforcement, housing rehabilitation assistance, and neighborhood
                 improvement efforts.
Program 2.5: Preserve Affordable Rental Housing
There are currently no affordable units at-risk of converting to market rate in Lodi. However,
if in the future units become at-risk, the City would coordinate a meeting or series of
meetings between the Housing Authority, local nonprofits, and the owner (or owner’s
representative) to discuss the owner’s intentions to remain or opt out of the federal Housing
Choice Voucher (Section 8) Program and future plans for the property. If the owner intends
to convert the apartments to market rate housing or sell the property, Lodi will seek to
facilitate the acquisition of the property by a nonprofit or other entity to preserve the rental
units as affordable housing. The City would not take part directly in negotiations regarding
the property, but would apply for State or federal funding on behalf of an interested nonprofit
entity, if necessary, to protect the affordability of the rental units. Lodi would request that the
property owner provide evidence that it has complied with State and federal regulations
regarding notice to tenants and other procedural matters related to conversion and contact
HUD, if necessary, to verify compliance with notice requirements.
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe:       Implement this program as necessary.
Funding:         Minimal administrative cost to coordinate meetings; CDBG, HOME,
                 CalHFA, Multi-family Housing Program, and Section 207 Mortgage
                 Insurance for Purchase/Refinance (HUD) as potential funding sources for
                 preservation
Objective:       To preserve affordable rental housing units.
Program 2.6: Target the Eastside Area for Use of Funds for Public Improvements
The City will continue to target a portion of its annual CDBG allocation for public
improvements in the Eastside area in support of its housing rehabilitation and neighborhood
improvement activities. The General Plan Land Use Diagram identifies the Eastside Area for
Medium and High Density Residential, acknowledging opportunities for redevelopment and
reinvestment through density increases. Public investment is intended to stimulate private
investment in order to preserve the character of the neighborhood and introduce new
housing, while also improving streetscapes and connections to downtown. In addition, the
City will continue the practice of including conditions in developer agreements of major
projects to pay for rehabilitation of housing units. Funds can be specifically directed toward
units for extremely-low and very-low income households and supportive housing providers,
and will be negotiated on a case by case basis.

             existing and future residential development.
Program 3.1: Collect          Development      Impact     Fees    and Enforce    Improvement
Requirements
The City will continue to collect a unified development impact fee to pay for off-site public
facilities and services needed for residential development and require that residential
developers continue to provide on-site infrastructure to serve their projects. The City shall
continue to charge fees that reflect the actual cost of service provided to housing units
anticipated by this Element. Prior to the issuance of building permits, the City will require
evidence that the developer has paid the required school impacts fees.
The City will review and adjust its fee formula, particularly for multi-family dwelling units in
the Medium and High Density Residential and Mixed Use General Plan land use
designations. Per unit and per acre fees should be reasonable, in order to encourage the
development of higher density affordable housing units while corresponding with the
estimated public facility and service impact for the specific project being proposed. The
review and adjustment is anticipated to result in a reduction of fees for some multi-family
projects. Utilities, streets, parks, and emergency services improvements should be developed
consistently with infrastructure improvements and planning efforts identified in the
appropriate in the Growth Management and Infrastructure; Transportation; and, Parks,
Recreation, and Open Space elements.
Responsibility: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council
Timeframe        Submit proposed fee schedule adjustment to Planning Commission within six
                 months of adoption of this Housing Element.
Funding:         General Fund
Objective:       Reduce impact fees for multi-family projects based on actual project densities
Program 3.2: Assure Adequate Public Services for Residential Development
The City will continue to use its growth management program to ensure that the pace of
development is consistent with the City’s, and other public facility and service providers’
abilities to provide public facilities and services and maintain minimum facility and service
standards for the entire community. The City will contact other public facility and service
providers annually during the housing unit allocation process to insure that these agencies
can serve the increased number of housing units to be allocated.

        vice and lower the cost of living within the community, with funding to be paid from
        traffic impact fees, State, and federal funding sources, and “Measure K” sales tax
        funds.
    b) Determine whether areas with infill/reuse potential (see Program 1.4) qualify as infill
        opportunity zones. The City shall designate qualified areas that are appropriately lo-
        cated for higher density residential and mixed-use developments in such zones, near
        transit facilities.
    c) If adopted under action “b,” promote development opportunities in infill zones
        through a link on the City’s website, an information bulletin to be distributed to
        property owners within these zones, and developers and business organizations in
        Lodi, and one or more meetings with business and community organizations to ex-
        plain the benefits and implications of infill zone designation for development oppor-
        tunities.
    d) Use the City’s adopted Transit-Oriented Development Design Guidelines to develop
        TOD in Lodi’s Downtown, establishing a framework for infill development and pub-

             all members of the community regardless of race, sex, or other discriminatory
             factors.
Program 4.1: Promote Fair Housing Services
The City shall promote equal housing opportunity for all persons in compliance with State
and federal laws by continuing to provide funding for the operation of the City's Affirmative
Fair Housing Program. Under the program, the City provides information to the public on
State and federal fair laws, provides referrals to county, State, and federal agencies for
investigation of fair housing complaints, and provides financial support to Stockton/San
Joaquin Community Housing Resource Board (CHRB), which provides landlord-tenant
mediation services. From 2005-2010, the City provided approximately $20,000 to the CHRB
for fair housing purposes.
The City will collaborate with CHRB to promote fair housing information and resources at
an annual community event. Lodi will promote fair housing activities and resources by
providing links through its website to nonprofit, county, state, and federal agencies; providing
fair housing information at the Community Development Department public counter;
designating a point of contact within the Department to handle fair housing inquiries; and
distributing fair housing information at public locations in the City (such as the Lodi Public
Library and the LOEL Senior Center).
Responsibility: Community Development Department
Timeframe         Current and ongoing, 2007-2014; annual community event for display of air
                  housing information within one year of adoption of this Housing Element;
                  fair housing links will be provided on the City’s website within six months of
                  adoption of this Housing Element.
Funding:          CDBG
Objective:        Provide information on fair housing law to the public and support landlord-
                  tenant mediation services
Program 4.2: Regulate Condominium Conversion
The City currently regulates the conversion of rental housing to condominium or stock
cooperative ownership to reduce the displacement of extremely low-, very low-, low-, and
moderate-income households (See Title 15 of the Lodi Municipal Code). However, the
regulations need to be expanded and strengthened. The City should amend Title 15 to ensure
that:
     1. Residential condominium conversion projects are consistent with the Housing Ele-
         ment of the General Plan and State law;
     2. Converted dwellings meet certain safety, quality and appearance standards;
     3. Purchasers of converted dwelling units are fully informed as to the physical condition
         of the structure and facilities;
                                                 4-17

                                     DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
     4. Tenants are provided with notice of the conversion, relocation benefits and the op-
         portunity to purchase the residential units being converted; and
     5. The City maintains a supply of affordable housing.
Responsibility: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council
Timeframe:       Amendment of Title 15 will occur within two years of the adoption of this
                 Housing Element.
Funding:         Application fees
Objective:       Minimize the impact of displacement of very low-, low- and moderate-
                 income households and assure safety of converted units.
Program 4.3: Pursue Regional Solutions to Homeless Needs
The City shall continue to support regional solutions to homelessness through its
collaboration with the Salvation Army. Over the past five years, Lodi has contributed
$418,798 to the Salvation Army for the expansion or improvement of its facilities. The City is
also open to the possibility of providing funds to other nonprofit organizations. The City
shall also support San Joaquin County in implementing the Ten Year Plan to End
Homelessness and continue to have a City representative serve on the Board of the
Emergency Food and Shelter Program.

                 organizations for use of City’s share of CDBG funds
Funding:         CDBG
Objective:       Provide regional solutions to homelessness through assistance to nonprofit
                 organizations and the County who work on solutions to end homelessness in
                 the region.
Program 4.4: Educate the Public About Affordable Housing
Affordable housing is seen negatively by many in the community; the perception is that
affordable housing drives down property values, increases the demand for services, and
facilitates criminal activity. The reality is that affordable housing helps police officers, fire
fighters, teachers, and other low- and moderate-wage workers live in the Lodi. The City will:
     x   Put together a newsletter on housing in Lodi that discusses typical wages for various
         jobs that are held in the city and the housing costs that each earner can afford; and
     x   Conduct a workshop on the issue of affordable housing, publicizing the event to

Timeframe:       Newsletter and workshop will occur within two years of adoption of this
                 Housing Element.
Funding:         General Fund
Objective:       Provide information to the community about the benefits of affordable
                 housing.
Program 4.5: Incentivize Affordable Housing Development
To incentivize the development of affordable housing opportunities, the City will study the
possibility of providing certain benefits to developers who build affordable units such as
expedition of the development review process and reduction in development impact fees.
Program 3.1 describes modifications to the impact fee program to alleviate disincentives to
multi-family housing construction. In addition, Program 1.2 calls for the exemption of
affordable units from the growth management allocation process, which would eliminate the
time and expense of the process.
As described in Program 1.5, the City will meet annually with private nonprofit and for-profit
affordable housing providers and public agencies that are interested in constructing
affordable housing (and keep in contact with them throughout the year), providing special
needs housing or shelter, and/or providing supportive services for low-income and special
needs residents. The purpose of the annual meetings will be to discuss priorities for lending
City support for funding requests for affordable housing projects and programs during the
subsequent 12 to 24 months. The City will assist applicants in the subdivision of land on
larger sites as necessary to facilitate affordable housing development.
The Needs Assessment identified approximately 2,500 Extremely-Low Income households in
2000. Senior housing has been prioritized due to a growing senior population. Female-headed
households with children, large households, and farmworkers with families require multi-
bedroom units, preferably in multi-family buildings that can provide usable common open
space. The City will continue to assist non-profit developers with site acquisition, allow
multi-family housing by right in several zoning districts, and identify funding sources to
facilitate development and rehabilitation. For single-person Extremely-Low Income
households, such as persons transitioning out of homelessness, seniors, or others that can be
accommodated with efficiency units, Program 1.1 supports the modification of the Zoning
Ordinance to broaden the definition of boarding houses and the allowance of SROs. The
National Stabilization Program in particular, will prioritize units for Very-Low and
Extremely-Low Income households.
Responsibility: Community Development Department, Planning Commission, City Council
Timeframe        Investigate possible incentives for facilitating the development of affordable
                 housing and present findings to City Council within one year of the adoption
                 of this Housing Element. The Zoning Ordinance and Growth Management
                 Ordinance update will be completed within one year of the adoption of this
                 Housing Element.
Funding:         General Fund, National Stabilization Program and other federal sources (see
                 also Program 1.5)
Objective:       Facilitate the development of affordable housing opportunities in the city.

Program 5.1: Promote Energy Efficiency and Weatherization Improvements for Older
Homes
The City shall continue to promote energy conservation and weatherization improvements as
eligible activities under the Lodi Housing Rehabilitation Program (Program 2.2). The City
will post and distribute information on currently available weatherization and energy
conservation programs operated by the City, nonprofit organizations, and utility companies
through the Lodi website, the Community Development Department public counter, the Lodi
Public Library, the LOEL Senior Center, and other public locations. The Conservation
Element also promotes energy conservation and weatherization improvements to existing
structures and public buildings.

4.3       QUANTIFIED OBJECTIVES
The City of Lodi has established quantified objectives for several program categories to
provide measurable standards for monitoring and evaluating program achievements.
Quantified objectives have been established for accommodating the City’s share of San
Joaquin County’s regional housing needs, new housing construction, housing rehabilitation,
and the preservation of existing affordable housing. The quantified objectives represent the
target goal based on the needs, resources (including, land and financing), constraints,
policies, and programs identified in this element. The quantified objectives for the City’s
share of regional housing needs and housing construction differ because the housing
construction objective is based on the City’s estimate of the number homes that can actually
be constructed and at each household income level.

A. Accomplishments
A.1.    OVERVIEW
The success of the updated Housing Element is dependent to a great extent on a useful
examination of the policies and implementation programs included in the previously adopted
Housing Element. The evaluation identifies programs that have been successful in achieving
housing objectives and addressing local needs, as well as programs that require modifications
to address objectives in the updated Housing Element. State law (California Government
Code section 65588 (a)) requires each jurisdiction review its housing element as frequently as
appropriate to evaluate:
    x   The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to
        the attainment of the State housing goal;
    x   The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community's housing
        goals and objectives; and,
    x   The progress of the jurisdiction in implementing the housing element.
According the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD),
“Housing Element Questions and Answers: a Guide to the Preparation of Housing Elements,”
"the review is a three-step process:
    x   Review the results of the previous element’s goals, objectives, policies, and programs.
        The results should be quantified where possible (e.g., the number of units rehabili-
        tated), but may be qualitative where necessary (e.g., mitigation of governmental con-
        straints).
    x   Compare what was projected or planned in the previous element to what was actually
        achieved. Analyze the significant differences between them. Determine where the
        previous housing element met, exceeded, or fell short of what was anticipated.
    x   Based on the above analysis, describe how the goals, objectives, policies and programs
        in the updated element are being changed or adjusted to incorporate what has been
        learned from the results of the previous element.
A.2.    CONSTRUCTION ACHIEVEMENTS
Table A-1 summarizes accomplishments during the 2001-2009 period. At that time, the City’s
total RHNA projected by the San Joaquin Council of Governments was 4,014 units. Actual
construction, according to the Department of Finance, was 1,757 units. Some of these “above
moderate” units may actually be affordable to low income households—given the decline in
housing prices in the city—even though they were not subsidized. Although the RHNA
targets were not achieved in actual construction, the City made available a sufficient number
of appropriate housing sites, in each income category to meet RHNA requirements. This is
documented in the General Plan update Land Use chapter which describes potential for low-,
medium-, and high-density residential developments, as well as mixed use residential units
totaling 4,4,00 units. Moreover, several large development projects, including a variety of
density levels and unit types, were approved during the planning period at high densities, but
without subsidies. Due to the local, regional and statewide housing and lending market
constriction, these projects have not necessarily moved into the construction phase.

A.3.      PROGRAM EVALUATION
This section summarizes achievements for each program in the 2004 Housing Element.
Programs are organized within relevant Housing Element goals.
Goal A: To provide a range of housing types and densities for all economic segments of the
community while emphasizing high quality development, homeownership opportunities, and
the efficient use of land.
Program 1: Zoning Ordinance Revisions.
The City shall revise Title 17 of the Lodi Municipal Code (Zoning Ordinance) to reduce
barriers to, and provide incentives for, the construction and conservation of a variety of
housing types. The full program is located on p. IV-8 of the 2003-2009 Housing Element.
Objective: Reduce regulatory barriers to the provision of housing
Progress: The comprehensive Code update was on hold initially due to budget constraints
and the update of the General Plan. The provisions in this program have been or will be
included in the Administrative Draft of the Zoning Ordinance, which is underway. The
Ordinance is being updated to be consistent with the General Plan, which was adopted in
April 2010. This program has been updated in this Housing Element to meet State law and to
implement new policies in the General Plan.
Program 2: Revise Growth Management Program.
The City will revise its growth management program to exempt housing units affordable to
very-low- or low-income households with long-term affordability restrictions.
Objective: Expedite the residential development approval process for affordable housing.
Progress: This program is part of the Administrative Draft of the Development Code update,
described in Program 1.1. This program will be implemented when the draft Code is adopted.
                                                        A-2
                                    Appendix A: Accomplishments
Program 3: Personal Security Standards.
The City will continue to implement design standards applicable to all new residential
projects with the objective of improving the personal security of residents and discouraging
criminal activity. Design standards will address issues such as the placement of landscaping,
accessory buildings, and accessory structures in a manner that does not impede the City’s
ability to conduct neighborhood police patrols and observe potential criminal activity;
lighting and other security measures for residents, and the use of materials that facilitate the
removal of graffiti and/or increase resistance to vandalism.
Objective: Reduce the susceptibility of residential properties and neighborhoods to criminal
                  activity and increase residents’ perception of personal safety
Progress: This is an on-going implementation. The new Development Code will incorporate
new ideas related to how good site planning and architecture can result in improving
personal security. Development proposals are sent to both the Police and Fire Departments
for review; their recommendations are incorporated into the project design and conditions of
approval. This program is implemented through the City’s design review process. Therefore,
development fees are the funding source.
Program 4: Land Inventory.
The City shall prepare and maintain a current inventory of vacant, residentially zoned parcels
and a list of approved residential projects, and shall make this information available to the
public and developers, including information on underutilized sites within the downtown
area with residential or mixed-use development potential. The City shall update the inventory
and list at least annually. The City will promote the land inventory and the availability of each
update through the City’s web site, a notice at the Community Development Permit Counter,
and a press release subsequent to each update.
Objective: Increase the potential for infill development, thereby reducing the need to
                  prematurely annex land and convert agricultural land to urban use
Progress: The land inventory has been prepared and updated. The development potential was
completed and led to the current General Plan land use concept of a mixed-use designation.
This inventory also contributed to the identification of a suitable site for the 80-unit Eden
Housing affordable housing development described in Chapter 4. This program has been
modified in this Housing Element to account for new land use designations and development
opportunities described in the new General Plan.
Program 5: Pursuit of State and Federal Funds in Support of Housing Construction.
The City shall pursue available and appropriate state and federal funding sources to support
efforts to construct housing meetings the needs of low-and moderate-income households, to
assist persons with rent payments required for existing housing units, to provide supportive
services, and to provide on- and off-site improvements and public facilities, in support of
affordable housing projects. The City will take the following actions in pursuit of state and
federal funding: [see 2003-2009 Housing Element for complete program]
Objective: 150 very Low-income housing units, 100 low-income housing units
                                                A-3

                                    DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
Progress: The City continues to pursue and utilize State and federal grants and funds. For
example, in 2007, HOME and CDBG funds were used for the following programs: Down-
Payment Assistance ($900,000 for 13 home-buyers); site acquisition assistance for a five-unit
senior affordable development; $8,600 towards Lodi’s share of the San Joaquin Fair Housing
Program that assists renters with fair housing issues; and $38,654 for ADA accessibility
improvements at the Salvation Army Homeless Shelter (it’s estimated that over 4,000 clients
will benefit from the improvements).
Program 6: Encourage Efficient Use of Land for Residential Development.
The City will investigate incentive and regulatory tools to encourage efficient use of land
designated or held in reserve for urban development within the existing Lodi Sphere of
Influence to reduce the premature conversion of agricultural land to urban use. If determined
to be feasible, the City will adopt one or more incentives or regulations.
Objective: Preserve agricultural land and reduce the amount of land needed to meet future
urban growth needs
Progress: All development has been required to mitigate for loss of prime farmland. The use
of a TDR program was studied and rejected. A transitional designation (Urban Reserve) is
incorporated in the Draft General Plan to define future growth areas and protect agricultural
land. This program was amended in Chapter 4 of this Housing Element to reflect these
changes.
Program 7: Rental Assistance.
The City shall continue to support the San Joaquin County Housing Authority in its
administration of the Housing Choice Voucher rental assistance program (formerly called
Section 8 Program). The City’s support will include distribution of program information at
the Community Development public counter, distribution of program information to rental
property owners as part of the City’s code enforcement activities, creation and maintenance
of a link to the Housing Authority’s website on the City’s web site, and annual meetings with
representatives of the Housing Authority to discuss actions the City can take to encourage
greater participation in the Voucher Program by rental property owners.
Objective: Increase rental property owner awareness of, and participation in, rental assistance
programs
Progress: The Housing Authority has been in transition for past several years, so
implementation has not yet been completed. The new Executive Director is interested in
developing better working relationship. The City continues to support the use of vouchers. As
of November 2009, the County managed 4,500 vouchers countywide, 204 of which were used
in Lodi.
Program 8: Neighborhood Improvement.
The City will continue to designate a staff position, Community Improvement Manager
(CIM), within the Community Development Department to focus on the implementation of
housing and neighborhood improvement programs.
Objective: Improve the City’s ability to focus on the implementation of housing and
neighborhood improvement programs
                                               A-4

                                   Appendix A: Accomplishments
Progress: Implementation has been ongoing through regular code enforcement activity. The
Code Enforcement function has been moved to the Lodi Police Department and a new
Supervising Community Improvement Officer position has been created/filled to supervise
that program. The remaining elements of this program remain within the Community
Development Department under the direction of the Neighborhood Services Manager
(formerly Community Improvement Manager). This program has been revised in this
Housing Element to acknowledge this change. The City has also implemented a web-based
code enforcement reporting and tracking system to improve efficiency and accountability.
CDBG and HOME funded.
Program 9: Annexation of Land to Accommodate Future Housing Needs.
The City will work with property owners of approximately 600 acres outside the current City
limits, but within Lodi’s Sphere of Influence (SOI), to plan for, and annex the land to the City
so that additional residential development opportunities can be provided to meet Lodi’s
future housing construction needs. The 600 acres is located between Harney Lane, Lower
Sacramento Road, the Woodbridge Irrigation District canal, and the western SOI boundary.
The City has facilitated a specific planning process with property owners of over 300 acres to
prepare these sites for annexation to the City.
Objective: Increase the City’s residential development capacity to accommodate its share of
the region’s future housing construction needs between 2001 and 2009, and subsequent years,
under the San Joaquin County Council of Governments housing allocation plan
Progress: Annexation of 524.28 acres has taken place and projects approved consist of 3,249
units. The City has targeted acreage for higher density development as well as possible senior
and affordable housing sites. The City will continue to work with developers to create a range
of housing types. Notably, developers see first time homebuyers as the majority of their sales
volume, with moderate sized units on moderate sized lots as an appropriate and affordable
(though not necessarily subsidized) housing type.
Program 10: Homebuyer Assistance.
The City will continue to implement a first-time homebuyer down payment assistance
program. The City will continue to participate with the Housing Authority in a countywide
consortium for the issuance of mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage credit certificates to
assist first-time homebuyers. The City will promote the program by providing information at
the Community Development Department’s public counter and by providing a link to the
program on the City’s web site. The City’s Community Improvement Manager will contact
real estate agents active in Lodi to identify opportunities for program participation. Because
the availability of homes within the program price limits is extremely limited in Lodi, there
will likely be a small number of assisted homebuyers.
Objective: 50 homebuyers
Progress: In 2007, the City used $900,000 in HOME and CDBG funds to assist 13 home-
buyer households through the Downpayment Assistance Program. (As an Entitlement
community, the City of Lodi now looks to the State HOME Program funding. Community
Improvement Manager changed to Neighborhood Services Manager.)
Program 11: Commercial Linkage Fee.

                                  DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
The City will undertake a “nexus” study to determine whether a direct connection exists
between non-residential development in Lodi that creates jobs and the need for housing
affordable to lower income workers who will fill some of those jobs. The study will attempt to
estimate:
    x   Projected employment growth by industry and occupation based on land use policies
        in the General Plan, zoning regulations, and development trends;
    x   The difference between the cost to develop housing in Lodi and the amount that low-
        er income households can afford to pay for housing (the subsidy gap needed to make
        housing affordable); and
    x   The dollar amount per square foot, by industry or land use category, that non-
        residential developments would need to pay to close the subsidy gap.
Objective: Increase local funding options for affordable housing and improve the balance
between the supply of housing affordable to the local workforce and anticipated job creation
Progress: City Council has not been supportive of a Commercial Linkage Fee Program due to
the adverse impact that they feel it would have on non-residential development, especially in
the current economic environment. Therefore, the program will not be implemented.
Program 12: Promote the City’s Multifamily Housing Development Standards.
The City will promote its multifamily development standards through the Community
Development Department’s link to the City’s website, information brochures available at the
Community Development Department, pre-application meetings, and a notice to the local
homebuilder’s, realtor’s, and contractor’s associations.
Objective: To increase awareness of the City’s multifamily development standards.
Progress: Information about multi-family housing options is currently available at the permit
counter and through the City’s website. The City holds pre-application meetings upon
request of the developer.
Goal B: To encourage the maintenance, improvement, and rehabilitation of existing housing
and residential neighborhoods, particularly in the Eastside area, and the preservation of
existing affordable housing.
Program 13: Demolition of Residential Structures.
The City shall implement policies and procedures for evaluating applications for demolition
of residential structures. This evaluation shall consider the implications of the demolition
with respect to the retention of affordable housing. If demolitions are deemed to result in a
reduction of the amount of affordable housing in Lodi, the City shall require the proponent of
the demolition to cooperate with the City in providing relocation assistance to displaced
residents and in determining the means for replacing demolished units. The City will provide
information regarding its policies and procedures on the City’s website and at the
Community Development Department’s public counter.
Objective: Maintain or replace existing affordable housing
                                              A-6

                                   Appendix A: Accomplishments
Progress: The City does not issue a significant number of residential demolition permits. In
code enforcement cases, demolition is usually the last option and is used when there are
building code or zoning issues that cannot be addressed by repair or remodeling the unit in a
reasonable or cost-effective manner. In most cases, demolished units are replaced with new
residential units.
Program 14: Housing Rehabilitation and Code Enforcement.
The City will continue to combine code enforcement and housing rehabilitation assistance,
targeted to the Eastside area. The City will promote its program through the Eastside
Improvement Committee, a neighborhood organization that provides direct outreach to area
residents and property owners, by providing information at the Community Development
Department’s public counter, and through a link to the program on the City’s website. The
City’s Community Improvement Manager will work with the Committee to continue
marketing the program to Eastside area residents and property owners.
Objective: Improvement of 1,000 housing units (including private investment to correct code
violations) over five years
Progress: Code Enforcement function is now under the Lodi Police Department.
Neighborhood Services Manager (formerly Community Improvement Manager) still
responsible for coordinating Housing Rehab efforts with code enforcement and promote this
effort through the Lodi Improvement Committee (formerly Eastside Improvement
Committee). CDBG, HOME, CalHOME and Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP)
funding. The City has also required developers of major new projects to provide funds to
assist in the rehabilitation of existing residential units through the development agreement
process.
Program 15: Property Maintenance and Management Standards.
The City will continue to implement standards for private property maintenance (Chapter
15.30 of the Municipal Code) to 1) control or eliminate conditions that are detrimental to
health, safety, and welfare; 2) preserve the quality of life and alleviate certain socioeconomic
problems created by physical deterioration of property; and 3) protect property values and
further certain aesthetic considerations for the general welfare of all residents of the City of
Lodi.
Objective: Eliminate substandard building and property conditions
Progress: Over 906 complaints related to property maintenance and substandard housing
issues were received and investigated in 2007. While code enforcement function has moved
from Community Development to Lodi Police Department, the overall coordination of these
efforts still falls to the Community Development through the Neighborhood Services
Division. Funded by CDBG, HOME Program, NSP, and General Fund
Program 16: Housing Condition Survey.
The City will conduct a housing survey to document its efforts at improving housing
conditions and to identify future areas and housing types for targeting its code enforcement,
housing rehabilitation assistance, and neighborhood improvement efforts.
                                               A-7

                                     DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
Objective: Document housing conditions and establish priorities for future code
enforcement, housing rehabilitation assistance, and neighborhood improvement efforts
Progress: The Housing Condition Survey was not undertaken, but is still necessary and
included as program in this Housing Element update.
Program 17: Preservation of Affordable Rental Housing.
There is one subsidized rental housing project in Lodi (Creekside South Apartments) that
contains 40 housing units affordable to low-income households. These units are at risk of
converting to market rate housing. To preserve Creekside South as affordable rental housing
for low-income households, the City will coordinate a meeting or series of meetings between
the Housing Authority, local nonprofits, and the owner (or owner’s representative) to discuss
the owner’s intentions to remain or opt out of the federal Housing Choice Voucher (Section
8) Program and future plans for the property.
Objective: To preserve 40 affordable rental housing units
Progress: City staff routinely check in with property owners/managers of affordable housing
projects to determine affordability status and assist in preservation of units at risk of
conversion to market rate.
Program 18: Mobilehome Park Preservation.
Lodi will meet with mobilehome park owners to discuss their long-term goals for their
properties and the feasibility of preserving these parks. Feasibility will be evaluated based on
the condition of park infrastructure and buildings, the condition of mobile homes located in
the park, parcel size, accessibility to services, and surrounding land uses. Several of the parks
are small (with fewer than 50 spaces) and may not be prime candidates for preservation.
Objective: To preserve approximately 400 mobilehomes and spaces in mobilehome parks
                with the highest feasibility for continued operation
Progress: The City did coordinate an inspection of one mobile home park property with
State HCD inspectors, the property owner and local enforcement officials. No funds were
available to continue this program; the program is dropped in this update.
Program 19: Preservation of the Eastside Area.
The City will continue to target a portion of its annual CDBG allocation for public
improvements in the Eastside area in support of its housing rehabilitation and neighborhood
improvement activities. The City will also maintain the Eastside single-family residential
zoning as a regulatory tool to preserve the character of the neighborhood and encourage
private investment in older homes.
Objective: To preserve and improve the Eastside area.
Progress: The updated General Plan supports intensification of housing and investment (such
as streetscape improvements) in the Eastside Area. This program will be updated to reflect
this change, but continue the financial support.
Program 20: Redevelopment Agency Funding.
                                                 A-8

                                   Appendix A: Accomplishments
Should the City Council adopt a redevelopment project area between 2003 and 2009, at least
20% of any tax increment funds accruing to the Agency will be used to support low- and
moderate-income housing projects and programs. The City will also adopt an
implementation plan that provides funding for public improvements to the downtown and
residential neighborhoods within the redevelopment project area.
Objective: To preserve and improve the downtown and residential areas within the proposed
                 redevelopment project area
Progress: Lodi voters rejected the proposal to establish a redevelopment project area during a
citywide vote in March 2009.
Goal C: To ensure the provision of adequate public facilities and services to support existing and
future residential development.
Program 21: Development Impact Fees and Improvement Requirements.
The City will continue to collect a unified development impact fee to pay for off-site public
facilities and services needed for residential development and require that residential
developers continue to provide on-site infrastructure to serve their projects. The City shall
continue to charge fees that reflect the actual cost of service provided to housing units
anticipated by this Element. Prior to the issuance of building permit, the City will require
evidence that the developer has paid the required school impacts fees.
The City will review and adjust its fee formula for multifamily dwelling units in the medium
and high density general plan land use designations so that the fee encourages the
development of higher density affordable housing units while corresponding with the
estimated public facility and service impact for the specific project being proposed.
Objective: Reduce impact fees for multifamily projects based on actual project densities
Progress: This will be comprehensively reviewed and amended as an implementation to the
updated General Plan.
Program 22: Growth Management Program.
The City will continue to use its growth management program to insure that the pace of
development is consistent with the City’s, the Lodi Unified School District’s, and other public
facility and service providers’ abilities to provide public facilities and services and maintain
minimum facility and service standards for the entire community. The City will contact other
public facility and service providers annually during the housing unit allocation process to
insure that these agencies can serve the increased number of housing units to be allocated.
Objective: To provide public facilities and services meeting minimum City standards
Progress: The Growth Management Program is still intact. However, Program 1.2, to exempt
affordable housing from the allocations process, will be implemented with adoption of the
updated Development Code.
Program 23: Use of CDBG Funds.
                                               A-9

                                   DRAFT Lodi Housing Element
The City will continue to use CDBG funds to upgrade public facilities and services in older
neighborhoods. (See Program 8 for implementation.)
Progress: In 2007, the City used CDBG funds to assist 13 homebuyers through the Down-
Payment       Assistance    program;      25    households      with     funds     for    home
improvements/rehabilitations; and the LOEL Center to rehabilitate ten senior housing units.
The City also funded construction of ADA accessibility improvements through four projects
that will benefit thousands of disabled, elderly, and homeless residents in the city, many of
whom fall within the very-low and low-income categories.
Program 24: Park and Recreation Facilities.
The City will annually review its Park and Recreation impact fee to ensure that these fees, in
combination with other funds that may be available to the City, will allow Lodi to acquire and
improve sufficient parkland and provide recreation facilities according to the minimum
standards contained in the General Plan Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Element.
Objective: To provide park and recreation facilities and services meeting minimum General
Plan standards
Progress: Park fees are being reviewed along with the comprehensive update of all impact
fees, resulting from new park standards in the General Plan.
Program 25: Transit Facilities and Transit-Oriented Development.
To coordinate the availability of public transit as Lodi develops and to support transit-
oriented development on infill sites and properties with re-use potential, the City will
continue to construct and maintain transit facilities, determine appropriate sites higher
density residential and mixed-use developments near transit facilities and provide this
information through the City’s website and through business and community organizations.
Objective: To increase housing opportunities near transit facilities and encourage forms of
travel other than private vehicles
Progress: The City adopted Transit-Oriented Development Downtown Design Guidelines in
2008, to stimulate development Downtown. These guidelines modeled development
feasibility based on a scenario where 15% of the housing units were affordable at below-
market rates. In addition, the updated General Plan identifies appropriate locations for high-
density development near transit and other services. The TOD Downtown Design Guidelines
were funded by Caltrans.
Goal D: To promote equal opportunity to secure safe, sanitary, and affordable housing for all
members of the community regardless of race, sex, or other arbitrary factors.
Program 26: Fair Housing Services.
The City shall continue to promote equal housing opportunity for all persons in compliance
with state and federal laws by continuing to provide funding for the operation of the City's
Affirmative Fair Housing Program. Under the program, the City provides information to the
public on state and federal fair laws, provides referrals to county, state, and federal agencies
for investigation of fair housing complaints, and provides financial support to Stockton/San
                                             A-10

Joaquin Community Housing Resource Board (CHRB), which provides landlord-tenant
mediation services.
Objective: To provide public facilities and services meeting minimum City standards
Progress: CDBG funds were used to contribute towards Lodi’s share of the San Joaquin Fair
Housing Program which assists renters with fair housing issues. The City contributes to this
program on an annual basis. It is estimated that the program assists 110 households per year,
most of whom are very-low and low-income households. $8,600 of CDBG funds in 2007.
Program 27: Special Housing Needs.
The City shall continue to implement zoning standards, provide regulatory incentives, work
with nonprofit and other private housing providers, and provide financial assistance, within
the City’s limited fiscal capacity, to facilitate the development and operation of housing
meeting the needs of special population groups. (See Programs 1, 5, and 17 for
implementation.)
Progress: The City continues to support households with special housing needs. The Zoning
Ordinance update, to be adopted within one year of Housing Element adoption, will further
support regulations that support housing for special needs population (e.g. allowance for
SROs, emergency shelters).
Program 28: Condominium Conversion.
The City shall continue to regulate the conversion of rental housing and mobilehome parks to
condominium or stock cooperative ownership to reduce the displacement of low- and
moderate-income households. The City will implement requirement in Title 15 of the Lodi
Municipal Code, which govern condominium conversion. (See Program 18 for
implementation on mobilehome park conversion.)
Objective: To minimized the impact of displacement of low- and moderate-income
households
Progress: The City continues to implement the regulations for condominium conversions
according to the existing ordinance.
Program 29: Regional Solutions to Homeless Needs.
The City shall continue to support regional solutions to homelessness through its
participation in San Joaquin County’s Continuum of Care strategy and collaboration with the
Salvation Army. The City provides annual contributions to nonprofit organizations that assist
in the implementation of the strategy. Programs and services under the Continuum of Care
strategy include overnight shelter for individuals and families in immediate need of
assistance, transitional shelter, rent assistance for homeless individuals and families ready to
live in conventional housing, and supportive services to assist homeless individuals and
families in making a successful transition from homelessness to independent living.
Objective: To provide regional solutions to homelessness through continuum of care strategy
Progress: The City supports countywide efforts to end homeless and serves on the board of
the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. The current Zoning Ordinance permits

emergency shelters in zones with the greatest access to transit, public facilities, and
commercial services (C-2 and C-M). There are several older motels along Cherokee Lane (a
major commercial street with transit access, located adjacent to the eastern residential
neighborhoods) that could be used as emergency shelters if necessary.
Goal E: To encourage residential energy efficiency and reductions in residential energy use.
Program 30: Energy Efficiency and Weatherization Improvements for Older Homes.
The City shall continue to permit energy conservation and weatherization improvements as
eligible activities under the Lodi Housing Rehabilitation Program. The City will post and
distribute information on currently available weatherization and energy conservation
programs operated by the City, nonprofit organizations, and utility companies through the
Lodi website, the Community Development Department public counter, the Lodi Public
Library, the Loel Senior Center, and other public locations.
Objective: To increase energy efficiency in older homes
Progress: In the 2006-2007 year, the City Electric Utility Department provided the following:
grants to 100 low-income families to help pay their electric bills; monthly 30% discounts to an
additional 2,200 low-income families; in-house and online energy audits for 117 and 110
customers, respectively; a series of six “Energy Smart” workshops with over 1,500 attendees;
energy efficiency home improvement rebates for 100 customers; and appliance rebates to 275
customers.
Program 31: Energy Conservation for New Homes.
The City shall enforce state requirements for energy conservation, including Title 24 of the
California Code or Regulations (state building code standards), in new residential projects
and encourage residential developers to employ additional energy conservation measures in
the design of new residential developments.
Objective: To increase energy efficiency in the design and construction of new homes
Progress: All building plans and energy calculations are reviewed to make sure that they
comply with Title 24 requirements. Subdivision design standards have been amended to
require landscaped parkways, necessitating shade trees that will reduce ambient
temperatures. Similarly, the City also requires shade trees when constructing or expanding
parking lots.

  2                     Land Use
How the city uses its land to meet the needs
of both residents and business interests is
central to the General Plan. This Plan seeks
to accommodate anticipated population
expansion, while maintaining the city’s
small-town identity and compact form, and
providing for economic growth. The Land
Use Element summarizes the city’s existing
land use pattern; establishes a General Plan
land use classification system; describes
development potential; and provides land
use and economic development strategies.
To maintain flexibility in the face of changing and unpredictable
market conditions, the General Plan accommodates a range of potential
economic conditions, by identifying a phasing strategy for growth. While
the details of this concept are discussed in Chapter 3: Growth Manage-
ment and Infrastructure, a summary of this phased approach and the
resulting development potential are reported in Section 2.3.
                                                                         2-1

the east side of the city. In terms of medical facilities, Lodi
Memorial Hospital is one of the largest employers in Lodi
and the 14th largest employer in San Joaquin County.1 The
private not-for-profit hospital has two campuses and various
facilities clustered around Ham Lane and South Fairmont
Avenue, comprised of the hospital, clinics, medical offices,
and laboratories. Moreover, the Blue Shield call center in
the southeast portion of the city represents an expansion of
office uses and may serve as a driver for other employment
uses in this area.
Mixed-Use
                                                                Most industrial uses are located east of SR-99.
Mixed-use developments, for the purposes of discus-
sion here, are those with a combination of residential,
retail, and/or office uses within the same parcel. In Lodi,
mixed-use development usually encompasses retail or
office use on the first floor, and residential or office use
on the second floor. In total, mixed-use developments
make up 31 acres (less than 1%) of the city, mostly in
downtown.
Agriculture
Lodi wines and grapes are the pride of the region, but
most agriculture activity takes place outside city limits.
Agricultural uses encompass 55 acres (1%) of the City’s
incorporated limits; virtually all of this land is located in
the newly annexed areas that have proposed or approved
plans for urban development.
Public and Quasi-Public Uses
Public and quasi-public uses compose 757 acres (13%)
of Lodi’s urbanized land area. This is a reasonable pro-
portion, given that Lodi is foremost a residential city,
and requires services provided by pubic and quasi-pub-
lic entities. Among all public uses, schools are the most
dominant, comprising a total of 294 acres, or 5% of the
city’s land area. Many of the civic and public uses can         Mixed-use developments (bottom) and civic uses (middle) are concentrated

Residential
In addition to densities stipulated below, the Zoning
Ordinance may specify FARs for residential develop-
ment in some areas, such as traditional neighborhoods
around downtown, to ensure compatibility of housing
size to lot size and overall neighborhood development
pattern. Residential density ranges overlap across clas-
sifications in order to allow for some flexibility in
housing type.
Low-Density Residential
This classification is intended for residential develop-
ments at densities of two to eight units per acre. This
density is typical of old and new single-family neigh-
borhoods with detached homes, such as Old Lodi
and Sunwest. Most existing housing in Lodi falls
under this category and the majority of new residen-
tial development will continue to be built within this
density range.
Medium-Density Residential
This classification is intended for residential develop-
ments at densities ranging from eight to 20 units per acre.
This density range accommodates a variety of housing
types, including detached or attached (townhomes) sin-
gle-family houses, and two or three-story multifamily
units. This type of housing exists in the eastern neigh-
borhoods, along Church Street, south of Kettleman
Lane. Within new growth areas of the General Plan,
Medium-Density Residential is planned between sin-
gle-family neighborhoods and higher density housing
in the Mixed-Use Centers, providing a smooth transi-
tion between districts and uses. This designation is also
applied east and northwest of downtown to define areas
where reinvestment of medium-density housing should
be prioritized.                                             Residential classifications accommodate a range of density levels, but
                                                            single-family housing will continue to be the predominate housing type.
High-Density Residential
This classification is intended for residential develop-
ment at densities of 15 to 35 units per acre. This density
range includes townhomes and stacked multi-family
housing, which due to their higher density concentra-
tion may provide more affordable rental and ownership
                                                                                                     Chapter 2: Land Use | 2-9

Lodi’s downtown. This classification encompasses an
expanded downtown area, across the railroad tracks and
extending past Main Street. This designation seeks to
enable improved connections and coherence, but does
not seek to expand downtown to the Eastside neighbor-
hood; rather, the Eastside is expected to maintain its
own character.
Retail uses or eating and drinking establishments are
required at the ground level (see Chapter 4: Community
Design and Livability for specified sites). This category

represents future land area for residential and commer-
cial land use. (Although specific land uses have not been
delineated on the Land Use Diagram, land use mixes
will be similar to the new land area designated just to
the east and described later in this chapter). Along the
eastern edge, the Urban Reserve designation provides
additional area for industrial uses, taking advantage of
railroad and highway access.
Armstrong Road Agricultural/Cluster Study Area
This overlay designation is intended to maintain a clear
distinction between Lodi and Stockton. In coordina-
tion with relevant public agencies and property owners,
the City will continue to study this designation area to
determine a strategy to meet this objective. Potential
strategies are identified in Table 3-1 of Chapter 3: Growth
Management and Infrastructure.

Recently Approved Development
Existing development trends are included in the overall
development potential of the General Plan. While Lodi’s
growth in recent years has been incremental on generally
smaller parcels, the scale of the most recent major devel-
opment projects—including the Southwest Gateway
Project, Westside Project, and Blue Shield/Reynolds
Ranch—is unprecedented in the city’s history. Table 2-3
describes recently approved development projects.

projections for 2010, there were approximately 24,655 in
2008. In terms of employed residents, the city has seen
a slight decrease in employment and corresponding
increase in unemployment between 2007 and 2008. In
2008, EDD reported 32,000 persons in the labor force
and an unemployment rate of 7.8%, a slight increase
over the 6.0% rate in 2007. The job market in Lodi is
somewhat better than in the County as a whole, which
reported a 10.4% unemployment rate in 2008.
Lodi’s largest employers are in the wine/food, plastics, and manufacturing sectors.

For example, in 2005, the 2% Growth Management
Allocation Ordinance translated to a maximum of
450 residential building permits; 65% of the approved
permits were for low density housing units (under seven
units/acre), 10% medium density units (7-20 units/acre),
and 25% high-density units (over 20 units/acre). Overall,
the allowable housing developments averaged seven
units per acre.
The breakdown by density establishes an upper limit for
the number of permits, but does not guarantee that the
density quotas are attained by the end of a year. Because
in most years demand has been less than available
permits, an inventory of available permits has built up,
standing at a total of 3,268 available units in addition
to the annual 2% allocation in 2007. The General Plan

jurisdiction in 2000. The Legislature amended this statute
in 2000, requiring jurisdictions to sustain their waste
diversion efforts into the future. Lodi met the diversion
goal by diverting 51% of its waste out of landfills in 2000.

3.5	 Public Facilities
This section focuses on specific functional needs of
Lodi’s public services and facilities, including schools,
libraries, police and fire services. Facilities are distrib-
uted throughout the city as shown on Figure 3-4.
Public Schools
Lodi’s educational and academic needs are served
primarily by the Lodi Unified School District (LUSD).
LUSD covers an area of 350 square miles, serving all of
Lodi as well as North Stockton, Acampo, Clements,
Lockeford, Victor, and Woodbridge. In the 2007-2008
school year, LUSD served 31,259 students in kindergar-
ten through grade 12.15
Within Lodi, LUSD has a total of 21 schools—12 ele-
mentary, two middle, two comprehensive high schools,
and one continuation high school. In addition, the
district offers alternative, adult, and pre-schools. Table
3-7 describes the enrollment and capacity of LUSD
schools located in the City of Lodi.
As of 2007, LUSD’s school facilities—within
Lodi—were at 97% overall capacity. Several elementary,
middle, and alternative education schools are exceeding
their capacities.
Private Schools
The City of Lodi has ten private schools, with a total
estimated enrollment of 1,875 students ranging from
preschool to grade 12. Unlike LUSD schools, many
private schools offer preschool education.
Higher Education
Currently there is one adult school and one Regional
Occupation Program in LUSD, both of which are located
                                                                       Public schools in Lodi, such as Lodi High, Millswood Middleschool, and
in Lodi’s Eastside neighborhood. As of 2007, there are an              Larson Elementary, are nearing or above capacity.

The concept of livability encompasses
economic and social factors such as
employment opportunities, housing
affordability, public services, and safety,
as well as the physical form of the city.
This element explores the physical factors
that make Lodi a desirable place to live. It
envisions a compact and sustainable city
form, walkable neighborhoods, a revitalized
downtown and corridors, multiple new
recreational opportunities, and a continued
high quality of life.
Topics addressed include city form and identity; downtown; neighbor-
hoods and corridors; streets, connectivity, and accessibility; and site
planning and green building.

4.2	 City Form and Identity
Lodi today is a livable community. Community surveys
indicate civic pride and a sense of identity. Well-situated
away from the urban traffic and sprawl of the Bay Area,
the city enjoys a favorable Central Valley climate. Lodi
has a compact form, with visible history and a human
scale. Downtown is active, well-kept, and pedestrian-
oriented. Agricultural land surrounding Lodi provides
a contrast to the urban center, further reinforcing Lodi’s
identity.
Compact and Coherent Form
Lodi has higher population density than any other
community in the county and most of the Central
Valley. Growth has remained contiguous, due to
incremental development on all sides of the city core.
This has allowed Lodi to maintain a generally square
structure, as shown in Figure 4-1. As a result, downtown
and the oldest neighborhoods remain close to the geo-
graphic center of the city. Furthermore, the city’s built
form consists of fairly uniform layers or “belts” of devel-
opment radiating from the downtown. Consequently,
Lodi’s neighborhoods possess consistent urban design
and livability qualities without significant disruptions.
Because of the absence, until fairly recently, of large-
scale developments, there is diversity in building design
as well. In recent decades, growth has been focused on
land at the southern and western edges in particular,
resulting in increasing distances from downtown.
Several characteristics make Lodi a coherent and
navigable city. Lodi has a historic and identifiable
downtown, surrounded by graceful neighborhoods and
tree lined streets. The city lacks major obstacles within
its borders, with the exception of the railroad tracks
and State Route (SR) 99, much of which is depressed
                                                            Historic buildings such as the Carnegie Forum, gracious old neighborhood
through the city. The urban form is further defined by      streets, and new neighborhood design all help define the evolution of Lodi’s
the contrast to the surrounding agricultural land, which    structure.
complements the urban form and provides visual and
functional definition to the city’s outer edge. The agri-
cultural setting not only provides a special identity, but
also sustains emerging industries in viticulture and
tourism, making it an integral component of the city’s
identity and economic base.

The typology of the neighborhoods emanating from
downtown reflect their development era, with a close
knit grid of streets at the core giving way to large-spaced
arterials and introverted neighborhoods at the edge.
This evolution is illustrated in Figure 4-2.
Lodi generally exhibits four patterns of residential
neighborhood scale and structure—gridded, semi-grid-                                                c. 1930

to different eras of development. These patterns are
described in the text below and in Figure 4-3. In general,
neighborhoods are fairly homogeneous in their nature,
rarely exhibiting a mix of land uses, parcel sizes, or
street types. The only non-residential parts of Lodi that
are notable in size and profile are the downtown com-
mercial district and the industrial Eastside, which are
singular areas unlike the rest of the city.
                                                                                                    c. 1960

    The grid pattern was established from the city’s
    beginning in the 19th century and expanded from
    what is now downtown into surrounding neighbor-
    hoods through the 1950s. Downtown, Old Lodi and
    the Eastside neighborhoods exhibit a fine grained
    street grid with extensive street trees, small parcels,
    and small blocks, averaging approximately 350 feet
    by 450 feet. The short interconnecting blocks of                                                c. 1980

    moving through the neighborhood.
B.	 Semi-Gridded Pattern
    As newer areas radiate out of this core, the overall
    street grid pattern remains intact, though block
    lengths begin to increase. Finding space for street
    trees in newer residential areas is a challenge as                                              c. 2000

C.	 Curvilinear Pattern
    The post-World War II period saw the introduc-
    tion of the curvilinear pattern with cul-de-sacs,

The northern edge of the city is well defined by the          RMSTRONG   RD
Mokelumne River. Due to limited existing connec-

new connections, the Mokelumne River shall remain
the City’s northern edge. The Armstrong Road Agri-

Growth Management and Infrastructure, will delineate

Downtown Lodi
Downtown Lodi is located near the center of the city,
roughly contained by Lockeford Street, Pleasant Avenue,
the railroad, and Lodi Avenue. Downtown offers small
scale retail in a vibrant pedestrian-oriented setting, and is
easily accessible from nearby government offices and the
surrounding residential neighborhoods. The downtown
has benefited from revitalization efforts over the past
decade, and the creation of Downtown Development
Standards and Guidelines. Streetscape improvements            Wayfinding and historic lighting help define the downtown core.
to date have been made through the General Fund and
Assessment District rather than through establishment
of a redevelopment area, though future improvements
may be dependent on some other financing structure.
The streetscape, well articulated buildings, and active
use of the street through outdoor dining and open air
markets all contribute to the creation of a distinct and
vibrant atmosphere. This plan envisions a slightly larger
downtown that embraces the Eastside, extending to
Main Street.
The heart of the pedestrian-oriented downtown area is
along School Street. Church Street runs one block west

lots accessible off of Church Street provide back door
entrances or access to alleyways or arcades that access
School Street. Other key north/south downtown streets
include Sacramento Street and Main Street; east/
west streets include Elm Street and Pine Street. The
downtown area is currently one of the densest areas of
Lodi, with an average floor area ratio (FAR) over 0.75
and building heights of one to three stories.

                                                  housing. The addition of residential uses and possibly
                                                  hotel uses in the downtown core will increase demand
                                                  for downtown services, contribute to the vibrancy

structure are corridors—such as Kettleman Lane and
Lodi Avenue—and neighborhoods. While the corridors
are currently dominated by auto-oriented commercial
uses, the general plan seeks a greater pedestrian focus,
and mixed use development in some stretches, especially
closer to the core. In addition to the corridors and neigh-
borhoods, the general plan seeks to establish mixed-use
centers for new development at the edge of the existing
urbanized area. This section describes the key character-   Low density housing in southwest Lodi, less than eight units per acre.
istics and goals of each of these three forms.
Neighborhoods
For many of Lodi’s residents, livability begins with their
neighborhood. Residential environments need to be
comfortable, safe, and designed to support the needs of
diverse groups including young children, adolescents, the
elderly, handicapped, single adults, and families. Lodi’s
neighborhoods are very diverse, ranging from country
roads with historic farmhouses to historic neighbor-
hoods of Victorian cottages and California bungalows
to recent large-scale master-planned developments.
                                                            Medium density housing in west Lodi, 8-15 units per acre.
Lodi’s neighborhoods are largely internally consistent
in their architecture and site design. Residential land
in Lodi is generally single-family detached housing,
developed at a density of less than eight units per acre.
These densities are fairly consistent across the city’s
neighborhoods, with development at the urban fringes
sometimes ranging from four to six units per acre. The
main exception to this pattern is found in the older,
gridded sections of Lodi—particularly the Eastside—
where smaller parcels result in a slightly higher density
and a greater mix of uses. Pockets of medium- to high-
density housing can be found to the south of Kettleman
Lane near Mallard Lake and off of Hutchins Street.

create a series of residential islands interconnected only
by major roadways, with travel distances that require
driving. Restricting the number of access points to the
larger street network can also create congestion at a few
choke points, since traffic cannot easily distribute itself to
other intersections. Finally, limited access points, indirect
routes, and long blocks make walking an inefficient
transportation choice. While some of the most recent
neighborhoods have better internal connectivity than the
curvilinear design, access is often somewhat limited to
the broader roadway network of the city and the neigh-
borhoods continue to lack non-residential uses.
                                                               Garages often dominate the frontage of newer single-family housing,
                                                               detracting from the pedestrian experience.
Increasing connectivity and walkability throughout
these neighborhoods could contribute to the livability
of these already often pleasant neighborhoods. This can
be accomplished with streetscape improvements and
establishing pedestrian and bike network connections,
such as paths that link cul-de-sacs.
Future Development
Infill development, particularly downtown and along
key corridors, is expected to make up about a quarter
of new housing in Lodi. The remaining development
will occur throughout the city and at the southern and
western edges of the city. These new neighborhoods are
envisioned with a greater mix of uses, strong connections      Many of the most recent developments have started to include street trees.
to commercial and public services, high quality design,
and well landscaped streets. All potential street connec-
tions with the existing urban fabric will be extended
through the neighborhoods.
Residential densities in this Plan allow slightly denser
development than currently exists, though the majority
of new development will continue to be in the form
of single-family homes. Higher densities proposed for
future growth in Lodi are targeted toward infill oppor-
tunities along the corridors and in downtown; and in
the new mixed-use centers to complement the commer-
cial development in those areas and to establish vibrant
centers. These densities will contribute to maintenance
of the compact form by avoiding unnecessary con-
version of farmland and help support local businesses
and transit. Regardless of density, all development

                         as of 2009. The project includes bulbouts and stamped
                         concrete at key intersections as illustrated on Figure 4-8,
                         decorative streetlights, and colored crosswalks, as well
                         as landscaping, trees, benches and sidewalk artwork at
                         various locations along Lodi Avenue. This General Plan
                         envisions Lodi Avenue as a visually cohesive and pedes-
                         trian-friendly street with active ground floor uses, such
                         as retail and restaurants, that are oriented toward the
                         street.
                         Central Avenue
                         Central Avenue is a smaller scale mixed-use street that
                         has been identified by community members as a model
                         for a neighborhood commercial center. Central Avenue
                         is a two-lane street with angled parking, street trees,
                         pedestrian scale lighting, and a planter strip that buffers
                         the pedestrian from the street. Retail and commercial
                         uses are generally one story and oriented to the street.
                         Residential uses line the blocks immediately adjacent
                         and are interspersed on the main commercial block,
                         reflecting a well integrated mix of uses. This setting is
                         very pedestrian friendly and walkable while also being
                         convenient to access by car. These factors contribute to
                         the success of the area as a neighborhood center. General
                         Plan improvements are illustrated in Figure 4-9.
                         Mixed Use Centers
                         Mixed Use Centers will become focal points of new
                         development as the city expands outward to the south
                         and west. These areas will include a mix of uses,
                         including medium- to high-density residential, office,
                         and neighborhood commercial uses, allowing people to
                         live and work in the same area. The Mixed Use Centers
                         are designed to be adjacent to parks and near new
                         schools and public facilities, to maximize accessibil-
                         ity. Essential components of Mixed Use Centers will be
                         their connectivity to the existing urban form, the estab-
                         lishment of pedestrian and bicycle friendly streetscapes,
                         and publicly accessible parks.

Green Building and Construction
Green building is a term used to describe a structure
that is designed, built, renovated, operated or reused in
a sustainable and resource-efficient manner. It encom-
passes the environmental, economic, and social impacts
of buildings, including energy efficiency, water conser-
vation, indoor environmental quality, use of recycled
and renewable materials, and site planning. Green

  5                     Transportation
A safe and efficient transportation system
contributes to a community’s quality of life
and economic vitality. Complemented by
land use planning, transportation policies
seek to provide access to employment and
educational opportunities, commercial and
recreational centers, public services, and
other amenities. Moreover, by enhancing
the circulation network to enable convenient
use of alternative travel modes—such as
biking, walking, and transit—the General
Plan seeks to reduce air quality impacts
and greenhouse gas emissions and enable
recreation opportunities.
The Transportation Element describes trends in residents’ travel patterns
to establish a basis for improvements, existing and proposed improve-
ments for each mode and type of transportation, and policies to achieve a
multi-modal transportation network.

                                                          The roadway network in Lodi includes freeways,

intra-city or intercity travel, typically allowing limited
access to adjacent properties and providing signalized
intersections at about ½-mile intervals. Pedestrian and
bicycle travel is prohibited on freeways, but is often
accommodated on expressways and on the more urban
portions of highway corridors.
The major freeway through Lodi is SR-99, which runs
along the eastern part of town and connects Lodi to the
Sacramento region to the north and the San Joaquin/
Stanislaus County areas to the south. Five interchanges
along SR-99 provide access to Lodi. SR-12 is an east-west
highway crossing the Central Valley; within Lodi, the        SR-99 runs north-south through Lodi, with overpasses that accommodate

segment of SR-12 between Lower Sacramento Road
and SR-99 functions as a major arterial and is known as
Kettleman Lane. East of SR-99, SR-12 is known as Victor
Road. There are no expressways currently in Lodi, but
there are plans for sections of Harney Lane and Lower
Sacramento Road to be developed as expressways.
Arterials
The primary function of arterial streets is to connect
the regional roadway network with the local roadway
network. In many cases, only limited access is provided
to abutting parcels (e.g. at 1/4-mile increments). Two to
four travel lanes are typically provided on arterial streets
                                                             SR-12 is known as Kettleman Lane in Lodi’s urban area, and functions as a

mento Road, Ham Lane, Hutchins Street, Harney Lane,
Century Boulevard, Lodi Avenue, and Turner Road.
Collectors
Collector streets link residential and commercial areas
to each other and to the arterial street system. Two travel
lanes are typically provided on collector streets in Lodi.
Key collectors include Church Street, Elm Street, Mills
Avenue, Vine Street, and Tokay Street.
Local Streets
Local streets accommodate low volumes of local traffic

typically have two travel lanes and allow parking on
both sides of the street. Through traffic is permitted on
local streets, but high speeds are discouraged.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Lodi’s generally level terrain makes bicycling and
walking viable forms of mobility for both daily trans-
portation and recreational purposes. As discussed in
Section 5.1, approximately 4% of Lodi residents report
bicycling or walking to work. In addition, it is apparent
from observations that both bicycling and walking are
popular methods for children to travel to school and for
recreation. Bicycle lanes are provided on several streets
in Lodi, with more bicycle lanes and routes proposed in
the City’s Bicycle Transportation Master Plan. Further
increasing the geographic area accessible for biking, all
Lodi Grapeline buses have bicycle racks.
Walking is part of every trip, whether it is from
the parking lot to a building or from home to a bus
stop, work, or store. The walking environment is an
important element of the public realm where people can
interact, and should be a fundamental component of
land use planning, design standards, and guidelines for
a cohesive circulation system.
Bicycle Network
Bicycle facilities are classified into several categories, as
described below and in Figure 5-3.
Class I Bikeways (Bike Paths)
Class I Bikeways are completely separate facilities desig-
nated for the exclusive use of bicyclists and pedestrians
with minimal vehicle crossings. Currently there are no
Class I Bikeways in the city. However, there is a paved
path from the swimming area at Lodi Lake to Lower
Sacramento Road, and a multi-use path around the
lake that allows vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian use. In
addition, the General Plan supports new multi-use paths
along the Woodbridge Irrigation Canal right-of-way
                                                              The bicycle and pedestrian networks in Lodi aim to provide safe and com-
and along the Victor Road/Lockeford Street railroad           fortable options for transportation and recreation.
right-of-way, between the city’s eastern boundary and
downtown.
Class II Bikeways (Bike Lanes)
Class II Bikeways are signed and striped lanes des-
ignated for the use of bicycles on a street or highway.
                                                                                              Chapter 5: Transportation | 5-9

Parking
The City of Lodi has an abundance of free parking,
ensuring that driving and parking at a destination is con-
venient and reliable. General Plan policies seek to provide
sufficient parking for businesses and residents, while
balancing other interests. Namely, protecting adjacent
neighborhoods from overflow parking situations and the
environment, by reducing the land area 	 devoted to
impermeable surfaces. Managing parking may be used as
a means of encouraging the use of alternative modes of
transportation, such as bicycling and transit.
Goods Movement
Goods movement is an important component of the city’s
circulation system, serving industrial, commercial, and
retail uses. A street system that accommodates trucks
is essential to ensure the safe and efficient movement
of goods between business centers and the freeways.
Policies in this section support the movement of goods
and also seek to reduce the impacts of truck opera-
tions on city streets and adjacent land uses. The city is
served by two freight rail services: the Southern Pacific
Railroad, now part of Union Pacific, and the Central
California Traction Company. These rail lines provide
freight service to many of the industrial and warehouse
uses on the east side of the city, and connect to the
large intermodal facilities in nearby Stockton. Relevant
policies are identified in both the Goods Movement and
Public Transit (which includes railroad crossing safety)
subsections in Section 5.3: Policies.
Transportation Demand Management
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) refers to
a comprehensive strategy to reduce driving by promoting
alternative modes, such as public transit, carpooling,       Public parking options in Lodi include the downtown parking garage, public
                                                             lots, and on-street parking.
bicycling, walking and telecommuting. Policies in this
section support the City’s efforts to reduce traffic, energy
consumption, noise, greenhouse gas emissions, and
pollution, by reducing automobile travel and promoting
alternate modes of transportation.

  6                        Parks, Recreation, and Open Space
Parks and open spaces provide opportunities
for recreation, relaxation, informal sports,
walking, or simply a break from the stresses
of everyday life. They also serve as gathering
places where community members can
meet, informally or for planned activities.
These activities need to be supported
with an adequate supply of accessible and
appropriately developed space. The city
should have parks with a distribution and
form that allows them to be enjoyed by
workers during the day, used by children
and the elderly close to their homes, and
to serve as a point of focus for residential
neighborhoods.
The General Plan builds on Lodi’s existing parks and recreation facilities,
ensuring that community members will continue to enjoy park and rec-
reation services. This Element provides background on the city’s existing
parks, open space, and recreation facilities; describes planned improve-
ments; and outlines policies and standards to ensure a continued high
level of service as the city grows.

hood parks serve a ½-mile radius area. Currently, there
are 14 neighborhood parks in Lodi.
Community Parks
Community parks serve a larger segment of the popula-
tion, and are primarily designed for active and structured
recreation for both children and adults. While individual
and family activities are encouraged, community parks
are a main channel for organized activities and sports. In
addition, all or a large portion of land in these parks also
function as detention basin during rainy seasons. These
parks have a service area of one to two-mile radius and
range from 10 to 26 acres in size. There are currently two
community parks in the city—Kofu and Salas—provid-
ing ball fields, basketball courts, dog areas, playgrounds,
picnic areas, meeting rooms, skateboard park, in-line
hockey and tennis court facilities.
Regional Parks
The Lodi Lake Park is the only regional park within
Lodi’s City limits. A regional park serves the entire region,
attracting visitors far beyond the boundaries of the city.
Typically exceeding 100 acres in size, regional parks
feature a wide range of activities and facilities. The 43-acre Lodi Lake Park and Wilderness Area serve a regional population and pro-

Lodi Lake Park is characterized by the Mokelumne River,
swimming, beaches, and large picnic areas. It is also
attached to the Lodi Lake Wilderness Area. A proposed
expansion of the park, planned on the Lodi Lake West
Bank Area, will add approximately eight acres to the
regional park (five additional acres have been designated
for the surface water treatment facility).
Natural Open Space
The Lodi Lake Wilderness Area is the only natural open
space within City limits. Natural open space is undevel-
oped land primarily left in its natural environment with
recreation uses as a secondary objective. The Lodi Lake
                                                               Kofu Park is a community park with amenities that serve a larger area.
Wilderness Area spans 58 acres, including 25 acres of
lake area. Located adjacent to Lodi Lake Park, this site
was intended to preserve the riparian and natural open
space along the Mokelumne River. This open space also
provides 2.3 miles of paved and unpaved trails.

Park Distribution
Given the crucial role of open spaces in an urban envi-
ronment, parks should have maximum accessibility.
They should be located within a quick walk, bike ride,
or drive from residents’ homes. Lodi has a thorough
network of parks, which are fairly well distributed
around the city. A substantial area of southwest Lodi
currently lacks open space, but two parks are proposed
for the area, as shown on Figure 6-1.
Parks and Recreation Facilities and Programs
Lodi offers a wide range of recreational programs and
facilities within its parks and open spaces, as shown in
Table 6-3. Playgrounds, picnic areas, and restrooms are
available in nearly all parks. Some notable recreation
facilities in Lodi include in-line hockey at Peterson Park,
a skateboard park at Kofu Park, the Softball Complex,
the Grape Bowl stadium, and Zupo Hardball Field.
In addition, many parks also provide sports fields that
cofunction as detention basins during the rainy season.
The Lodi Parks and Recreation Department provides a
remarkable variety of recreation programs and services
to residents and non-residents. The Department offers
both youth and adult sports, a kids’ summer camp, swim
lessons, and a host of other recreation programs. In coor-
dination with Hutchins Street Square, the Lodi Public
Library, and the Parks and Recreation Department, the
City publishes a calendar of arts and recreation opportu-
nities and offers convenient sign-up for activities.

New parks and open spaces have been distributed
throughout the new growth areas to ensure convenient
access for new and existing residents, as shown in Figure
6-1. Each mixed-use center designated on the Land Use
Diagram in Figure 2-1 (see Chapter 2: Land Use) has a
park located adjacent to it. In addition, each new school
proposed in the new growth area contains an adjacent
park. As result, students, residents, workers, and visitors
have convenient access to City park, from school, resi-
dences, work, or while out shopping at a nearby store.
Moreover, this co-location encourages use at different
times of day. All new parks face the street and are
situated on new streets, ensuring that parks are inviting

Financing
To assist in the acquisition and development of City
parks, the City requires dedication of parkland or
payment of in-lieu fees on all new residential, com-
mercial, office, and industrial development. The fee is
reviewed periodically and revised as necessary. Despite
these fees, the City has had difficulty raising enough
capital to acquire and develop new parks, open spaces,
and recreation facilities. Several recent residential devel-
opment projects, including Reynolds Ranch, Southwest
Gateway, and Westside, have elected to build open space
and recreation facilities on site, in sizes consistent with
the City requirements. Including parkland in the site
development process allows the City to work with devel-
opers to ensure that parks are accessible and appropriate
for both new and existing community members.
One of the challenges to financing and providing
adequate park land is that the City is the parks and rec-
reation provider for the entire north County area (the
Lodi Unified School District service area, north of Eight
Mile Road).

  7                      Conservation
The preservation of natural resources is
critical to Lodi’s environmental quality,
economic development, and overall
quality of life for its residents. Maintaining
agricultural land stimulates the city’s and
region’s economy and aesthetic identity. The
protection of biological resources and habitat
encourages biodiversity and the viability
of plant and animal life. Good water and
air quality are essential for ensuring health
and safety. And conserving energy helps
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
preserve non-renewing resources. In addition
to natural resources, manmade historic
resources, such as building and historical
event sites, help to form the city’s identity.
The Conservation Element establishes policies for the conservation of
natural resources in Lodi. Topics addressed include agricultural and soil
resources; biological resources; cultural and historic resources; hydrology
and water quality; energy and climate change; and air quality. Water supply
and conservation are addressed in Chapter 3: Growth Management and
Infrastructure. Flooding and drainage are addressed in Chapter 8: Safety.

Preservation and Conservation
Williamson Act
The California Land Conservation Act of 1965, Sections
51200 et seq. of the California Government Code,
commonly referred to as the Williamson Act, enables
local governments to restrict the use of specific parcels
of land to agricultural or related open space use. Land-
owners enter into contracts with participating cities and
counties and agree to restrict their land to agriculture
or open space use for a minimum of 10 years. Contracts
are automatically renewed every year, for an additional
year, unless a property owner initiates the non-renewal
process which starts the nine-year non-renewal period,
after which time the contract is terminated.
In August 1998, the Williamson Act’s Farmland Security
Zone (FSZ) provisions were enacted with the passage of
Senate Bill 1182 (California Government Code Section
51296-51297.4). This sub-program, called the “Super
Williamson Act,” enables agricultural landowners to
enter into contracts with a specific county for 20-year
increments. Land restricted by an FSZ contract is valued
for property assessment purposes at 65% of its William-
son Act valuation, or 65% of its Proposition 13 valuation,
whichever is lower.
Figure 7-1 provides the locations of parcels within the
Planning Area that have an active Williamson Act
Contract (18,251 acres), a Williamson Act Contract in
non-renewal status (124 acres), or a FSZ contract (1,343
acres).3 The General Plan growth areas coincide with
927 acres of active contracts, 16 acres in non-renewal
contracts and 37 FSZ contracts. General Plan policies
support the continuation of Williamson Act contracts in
anticipated urban growth areas, until the contracts have
expired and the market is ready for urban development.
                                                                        Lodi’s climate and soil are well suited for agricultural production—a key

Urban Areas
Wildlife species that use urban habitat are variable,
depending on the density of development, the surround-
ing land use, and the types and availability of vegetation
and other habitat features available for foraging, nesting,
and cover. In general, wildlife habitat in urban areas
consists of landscaped areas with a mix of both native
and exotic ornamental plant species. Species using
these areas are conditioned to a greater level of human
activity than those in natural and less developed areas.
Wildlife species typically found in urban habitat include
American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), rock dove
(Columba livia), American robin (Turdus americana),
Brewer’s blackbird (Euphagus cyanocephalus), house
finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), house sparrow (Passer
domesticus), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglot-

(Procyon lotor), Virginia opossum (Didelphis virgini-

agricultural land, but may also border smaller areas
of wetland or riparian habitat. Along the Mokelumne

7.4	 Historic Resources
Historic resources are standing structures of historic
or aesthetic significance. Architectural sites dating
from the Spanish Period (1529-1822) through the post-
World War II period (1945-1955) are generally considered
for protection if they are determined to be historically
or architecturally significant. Sites dating after the
post-World War II period may also be considered for
protection if they could gain significance in the future.
Historic resources are often associated with archeologi-
cal deposits of the same age. A records search of pertinent
survey and site data at the Central California Informa-
tion Center, California State University, Stanislaus, in
February, 2007 [CCIC # 6606L] revealed known and
recorded cultural resources within the Planning Area.
An inventory of properties listed in the National Register
of Historic Places (National Register), the California
Register of Historic Resources (California Register), the
California Inventory of Historic Resources (1976), the
California Historical Landmarks (1996), the California
Points of Historical Interest (1992 and updates), and the
California Office of Historic Preservation (OHP) are
also provided. Due to the extensive number of surveys
and archaeological sites in the project vicinity, a com-
prehensive listing of the reports is not included. Rather,
an example of the types of studies and archaeological
sites is provided.
Historic Setting
By the early 1800s, Spaniards had started exploring the
area, adversely impacting the Native population. The

as white settlers began to inhabit the area permanently
or travel through on their way to the gold fields in the
Sierra Nevada. Lodi began in 1869 as the Town of
Mokelumne, founded by the Central Pacific Railroad.           Old images of Sacramento, School, and Lockeford streets.
The railroad connected Lodi with Sacramento to the
north and Oakland and Stockton to the south, and
the town was laid out parallel to the tracks. To avoid
confusion with Mokelumne Hills and Mokelumne City,
the townspeople changed the name to Lodi in 1874.5

California Point of Historical Interest Program
The California Point of Historical Interest Program was
established in 1965 to recognize local historic proper-
ties not able to meet the restrictive criteria of the State
Historical Landmarks program. The criteria for the
Points are the same as those that govern the Landmark
program, but are directed to local (city or county) areas.
California Points of Historical Interest do not have
direct regulatory protection, but are eligible for official
landmark plaques and highway directional signs.
Mills Act Historic Property Contract
State-enabling legislation, known as the Mills Act, allows
jurisdictions to enter into contracts with private property
owners of qualified historic properties to provide a property
tax reduction in exchange for the owners agreeing to preserve,
rehabilitate and maintain their historic properties. Mills Act
historic property contracts always have provisions for rehabil-
itating a property with specifications for complying with the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. This
property tax reduction is usually most beneficial to owners
who have made recent purchases.

A historic preservation ordinance is the primary tool used by
municipalities to protect historic resources in a community.
Local governments in California have authority to adopt
a historic preservation ordinance to provide regulations
regarding historic and cultural resources. Historic preser-
vation ordinances are structured to address the particular
needs and resources within a community.
While Lodi has several individual buildings on the
National Register, it does not have any designated historic
or conservation districts. Such districts would ensure that
the overall neighborhood character of a neighborhood—
within which individual buildings may not be designated,
but which contribute to the overall character—are
protected and enhanced. Establishing historic districts
would help address issues of incompatible new construc-
tion and additions that have been occurring in some of the
city’s historic neighborhood. It would also address issues of
public realm—such as streets, lampposts, and trees—that
contribute to the overall urban character of a district.

Joaquin-Sacramento Delta empties into San Francisco
Bay. The San Joaquin Valley (Valley), thus, could be
considered a “bowl” open only to the north.
Wind Conditions and Air Pollutants
During the summer, wind speed and direction data indicate
that summer wind usually originates at the north end of the
Valley and flows in a south-southeasterly direction through
the Valley, through Tehachapi pass, into the Southeast
Desert Air Basin. In addition, the Altamont Pass also serves
as a funnel for pollutant transport from the San Francisco
Bay Area Air Basin into the region.
During the winter, wind speed and direction data indicate
that wind occasionally originates from the south end of
the Valley and flows in a north-northwesterly direction.
Also during the winter months, the Valley generally expe-
riences light, variable winds (less than 10 mph). Low wind
speeds, combined with low inversion layers in the winter,
create a climate conducive to high carbon monoxide
(CO) and respirable and fine particulate matter (PM10
and PM2.5, respectively) concentrations.
Climate
                                                             Cars and trains emit greenhouse gases, contributing to air quality impacts
The SJVAB has an “Inland Mediterranean” climate              in the region.
averaging over 260 sunny days per year. The valley
floor is characterized by warm, dry summers and cooler
winters. For the entire Valley, high daily temperature
readings in summer average 95ºF. Temperatures below
freezing are unusual. Average high temperatures in the
winter are in the 50s, but highs in the 30s and 40s can
occur on days with persistent fog and low cloudiness.
The average daily low temperature is 45ºF.
The vertical dispersion of air pollutants in the Valley is
limited by the presence of persistent temperature inver-
sions. Solar energy heats up the Earth’s surface, which
in turn radiates heat and warms the lower atmosphere.
Therefore, as altitude increases, the air temperature
usually decreases due to increasing distance from the
source of heat. A reversal of this atmospheric state, where
the air temperature increases with height, is termed an
inversion. Inversions can exist at the surface or at any
height above the ground, and tend to act as a lid on the
Valley, holding in the pollutants that are generated here.

7-26 | LODI GENERAL PLAN

California Clean Air Act
The CCAA provides a planning framework for attain-
ment of the CAAQS for ozone, CO, SO2, and NO2.
The CCAA classifies ozone nonattainment areas as
moderate, serious, severe, and extreme based on severity
of violation of state ambient air quality standards. For
each class, the CCAA specifies air quality management
strategies that must be adopted. For all nonattainment
categories, attainment plans are required to demonstrate
a five-percent-per-year reduction in nonattainment air
pollutants or their precursors, averaged every consec-
utive three-year period, unless an approved alternative
measure of progress is developed. Air districts respon-
sible for air basins with air quality that is in violation
of CAAQS for ozone, CO, SO2, and NO2 are required
to prepare an air quality attainment plan that lays out a
program to attain the CCAA mandates.
The CCAA requires all feasible control measures,
including TCM, to reduce emissions; provides for
indirect source programs in attainment plans; and
contains targets for emission reductions, vehicle miles
traveled, and average vehicle ridership.
Assembly Bill 170
In adding Section 65302.1 to the Government Code, AB
170 requires cities and counties in the Valley to incor-

planning efforts.

Senate Bill 709 adds Chapter 5.7 to Part 3 of Division 26

the thermal infrared range, trapping heat in the earth’s
atmosphere. There are no “attainment” concentration
standards established by the federal or state government
for greenhouse gases. In fact, GHGs are not generally
thought of as traditional air pollutants because green-
house gases, and their impacts, are global in nature,
while air pollutants affect the health of people and
other living things at ground level, in the general region
of their release to the atmosphere18. Common GHGs
include water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ozone (O3), and chloro-
fluorocarbons (CFCs). Some greenhouse gases occur
naturally and are emitted to the atmosphere through
both natural processes and human activities. Other
GHGs are created and emitted solely through human
activities. The principal greenhouse gases that enter the
atmosphere because of human activities are CO2, CH4,
N2O, and fluorinated carbons.
Emission Levels
The SJVAPCD’s regional air quality monitoring
network provides information on existing ambient con-
centrations of criteria air pollutants. Monitored ambient
air pollutant concentrations reflect the number and
strength of emissions sources and the influence of topo-
graphical and meteorological factors. Table 7-8 presents
a five-year summary of air pollutant (concentration) data
collected at the three monitoring stations in the vicinity
of the project area on Hazelton Street, East Mariposa
Road, and at the Wagner-Holt School in Stockton. The
Hazelton Street station measures concentrations of all
air pollutants, including the two for which the SJVAB
remains “nonattainment”, ozone, PM10, and PM2.5.
The East Mariposa Road Station measures ozone con-
centrations only and has not been collecting data for the
last four year. The Wagner-Holt School Station measures
PM10 concentrations only. Pollutant concentrations
measured at these stations should be representative of
background air pollutant concentrations at or near the
18
  	In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded (Massachusetts v.
   EPA) that GHGs meet the CAA definition of an air pollutant, and are
   thus subject to regulation by EPA.

The Safety Element identifies the natural
and manmade hazards that exist within
the city. It seeks to mitigate their potential
impacts, through both preventative and
response measures, to ensure the continued
health and safety of Lodi community
members.
This Element addresses flooding and drainage; potentially hazardous
materials and operations; seismic and geologic hazards; fire hazards; and
emergency management. Potential health hazards related to air quality
are addressed in Chapter 7: Conservation. Storm drain infrastructure

  9                     Noise
Noises are undesirable or unwanted sounds
that vary widely in their scope, source,
and volume. They range from individual
occurrences such as a leaf blower or holiday
firecrackers, to regular though intermittent
disturbance by aircraft flying overhead, or an
infrequent train going through town, to the
fairly constant noise generated by traffic on
freeways. Noise is primarily a concern with
regard to noise—sensitive land uses such as
residences, schools, churches, and hospitals.
This chapter identifies the noise sources that exist within the city,
describes noise impacts that may result from the General Plan, and estab-
lishes policies to mitigate potential impacts through both preventative
and responsive actions.

breaking, process noise dominates.
Other Equipment
Several other portable or small-scale pieces of equipment
may also produce noise effects. Mechanical equipment,
such as pumps and fans may produce low noise levels,
but continuously and for substantial distances. Rooftop
or otherwise exposed mechanical equipment can also
produce constant and disturbing noises. Portable power
equipment, such as leaf blowers and drills, is ubiq-
uitous in the modern city, and can produce very high
noise levels at the location of the work. Other amplified
sounds, from automotive audio equipment or loud-
speakers also create noise exposure.

          mask sounds; and
       •	 Controlling hours of operation, including
          deliveries and trash pickup.
N-P8	  Update Noise Ordinance regulations to
       address allowed days and hours of construc-
       tion, types of work, construction equipment
       (including noise and distance thresholds),
       notification of neighbors, and sound attenua-
       tion devices.
N-P9	  Develop and implement noise reduction
       measures when undertaking improvements,
       extensions, or design changes to City streets
       where feasible and appropriate.
N-P10	 Encourage transit agencies and rail
       companies to develop and apply noise
       reduction technologies for their vehicles to
       reduce the noise and vibration impacts of
       bus and rail traffic.
N-P11	 Coordinate with the California Public Utilities
       Commission and other pertinent agencies
       and stakeholders to determine the feasibil-
       ity of development a railroad “quiet zone” in
       downtown, which would prohibit trains from
       sounding their horns.
N-P12	 Restrict the use of sound walls as a noise
       attenuation method to sites adjacent to State
       Route (SR) 99, the railroad, and industrial
       uses east of SR-99.
N-P13	 Ensure that new equipment and vehicles
       purchased by the City of Lodi are equipped
       with the best available noise reduction
       technology.
N-P14	 Reduce vibration impacts on noise-sen-
       sitive land uses (such as residences,
       hospitals, schools, libraries, and rest homes)
       adjacent to the railroad, SR-99, express-
       ways, and near noise-generating industrial
       uses. This may be achieved through site
       planning, setbacks, and vibration-reduction
