Los Alamitos General Plan                                                           March 2015
Introduction
Since the City’s incorporation in 1960, Los Alamitos remains a community that values its
citizens, its way of life, and its future as one of the preeminent communities in Southern
California. This General Plan builds on the strengths of previous planning efforts, staying true to
the community’s values and vision, and addressing future needs in a changing world.
This plan focuses on the preservation and enhancement of the existing Los Alamitos community
while strengthening the employment base and promoting the creation of a town center to
ensure long-term viability.
Another important focus of this General Plan is to provide a document that is approachable and
easy to use. This plan focuses on providing clear, consistent, and substantive goals and policy
direction to guide community members, staff, and elected officials when making decisions
about Los Alamitos’ future.
Purpose
Comprehensive Framework
The General Plan establishes a comprehensive framework through which the City manages its
growth and development to ensure it efficiently and effectively provides public facilities and
services. With great public facilities and services, Los Alamitos delivers and continually
enhances a high quality of life and a desirable business climate, maintaining its position among
the most attractive places to live and work in Southern California.
Great communities develop over time, and Los Alamitos is no exception. In addition, great
communities are the product of countless individual decisions by residents, businesses,
investors, visitors, and organizations, as well as numerous collective decisions through elected
and appointed officials and public sector staff. The purpose of the General Plan is to provide a
common vision for the future of Los Alamitos and to provide coordination for the many
individual and collective decisions that, over time, will lead to the envisioned future.
Planning Area, Timeframe, and Contents
The General Plan guides land use and development for the entire Los Alamitos planning area,
which includes the City and JFTB and the community of Rossmoor. The General Plan identifies
the Los Alamitos JFTB as Community & Institutional/JFTB. The civilian reuse of the JFTB is not
considered likely in the near future, and the City fully supports the base maintaining its current
role for the federal and state government and the City of Los Alamitos. Although the Los
Alamitos JFTB is within the City’s municipal boundary, the City has no jurisdiction or land use
authority on this US military installation.
                                                                                                  1

Introduction                                                                          March 2015
The planning area also includes the community of Rossmoor as part of the City’s sphere of
influence. Rossmoor is included to understand future demands for services and implications for
growth in Rossmoor and the City. However, Rossmoor remains an unincorporated community
governed by the land use and planning authorities of the County of Orange.
The previous General Plan was adopted in 1990 and maintained a planning horizon year of
2010. In 2011, the City began a comprehensive update of the General Plan to better reflect
current conditions, refine goals and policies, and position the City for success over the next 20
years through the year 2035. The City will review and evaluate this General Plan periodically,
but anticipates that a comprehensive update may be needed around the year 2025.
The General Plan is comprised of an overall Vision and seven topical elements. Whereas the
elements address a group of topical issues, the Vision provides the common framework tying all
of the General Plan together into a unified whole. The General Plan will also help guide and be
implemented by other planning documents such as the City’s Annual Budget, Strategic Plan,
Capital Improvement Plan, and of course the General Plan Implementation Plan.
Citywide Vision
Los Alamitos is an attractive, dynamic, and modern city renowned for its world-class schools,
parks, and recreation facilities, as well as a nationally-recognized medical center.
The City is comprised of well-maintained neighborhoods that enjoy strong identities, generate
civic pride, and collectively offer wide range of places to live.
Los Alamitos hosts a town center that defines the popular image of the City and offers
multiple places for the residents, workers, and students of Los Alamitos to meet friends, stroll,
enjoy great food, and shop.
The City is home to successful businesses that provide the City with a diversity of tax revenue
and fiscal support, helping ensure Los Alamitos is economically sustainable.
Los Alamitos maintains a system of streets and trails that are safe for everyone and every
form of transportation—be they children, families, workers, or customers who walk, bike, ride
transit, or drive.
General Plan Elements
The elements establish the goals and policies relevant to land use, growth, and development of
the City for a variety of topics and provide a framework for municipal decision-making. Equally
as important though, the City intends the goals and policies to guide and help inform decisions
of those investing in Los Alamitos—residents, businesses, and organizations. The specific
elements are listed below, followed by a list of goals by element.
 1. Land Use                       4. Open Space, Recreation, and Conservation

A Brief History of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor
1800s: Bixby and Sugar Beets
In 1878, John Bixby acquired Rancho Los Alamitos and established great farming and ranching
enterprises. Bixby’s dream of developing a city one day was brought to fruition by the passage
of the McKinley Act in 1890, which spurred on the growth of a sugar industry in the United
States.
In 1896, the Los Alamitos Sugar Company was formed and constructed the first sugar beet
factory in Orange County. The Bixby Land Company laid out the town of Los Alamitos as support
for the factory, and paid for a rail line from west Anaheim and a railroad station, where Ganahl
Lumber now stands. The first church in Los Alamitos was built in 1897 and stood for over 60
years at the corner of Pine Avenue and Church Street (Church Street was later renamed Katella
Avenue). In later years, the sugar factory built worker housing and clubhouse for social and
recreational activities on Myrtle Street, which was renamed Los Alamitos Boulevard.
Additionally, the first school opened around the turn of the century to educate the factory
workers’ children.
1900s: A Quake and the Navy
In 1933, the 6.4 magnitude Long Beach Earthquake shook the town, damaging many structures
including the St. Isidore Catholic Church (originally built in 1922). The church was originally built
on the City’s Main Street, and still stands in the same location now known as Reagan Street.
The sugar beet factory operated until 1926, when an area-wide nematode infestation depleted
the soils of their nutrients. The factory complex changed many hands until 1960, when all but
two of the buildings were torn down. The sugar warehouse is the only remaining building and is
located next to the post office.
In 1942, the Naval Air Station moved from Terminal Island in Long Beach to Los Alamitos. By the
1950s, Los Alamitos became the largest Naval Air Reserve in the nation. In 1973, the station was
designated as an Armed Forces Reserve Center and was renamed the Joint Forces Training Base
in 2000. The base provides support and training for military units and other federal, state, and
local organizations.
1950s: The Construction of Rossmoor
In the 1950s, a developer named Ross W. Cortese came to the area with a vision to construct a
large, exclusive master planned community—at the time the largest such community in Orange

County with 3,500 homes. Between 1951 and 1956, Cortese formed the Rossmoor Corporation,
purchased the land from the Fred Bixby Ranch Company, and began construction. Rossmoor
was marketed first as a subdivision of Los Alamitos and subsequently as Long Beach's smartest
new suburb. The first homeowners moved in by June 1957 and enjoyed the benefits of a master
planned community, with homes organized into neighborhoods centered on school sites, tree-
lined streets, spacious yards, and easy access to two shopping centers and a medical complex.
The community of Rossmoor remains unincorporated today despite several incorporation and
annexation attempts, including the first incorporation effort proposed by Cortese himself in
1957. In the mid-1960s, Judge Alfred Gittelson, as the land owner of what is known today as
The Shops at Rossmoor, annexed his land into the City of Seal Beach, despite opposition by the
Rossmoor Homeowners Association and the City of Los Alamitos. The latest incorporation
effort, submitted by the Rossmoor Community Services District, was rejected by Rossmoor
residents in the November 2008 election. In 2009, the Local Agency Formation Commission
placed Rossmoor in Los Alamitos' sphere of influence.
1960s: Cityhood, New Schools, and a Medical Center
During the 1940s and 1950s, the Chamber of Commerce acted as the quasi town government
until its members decided to seek incorporation. The City of Los Alamitos incorporated in 1960
with a population of 4,312. The current (est. 2013) population is just over 11,000 residents.
Around the time of cityhood, several roads were fully constructed and improved, providing Los
Alamitos with access to neighboring communities. Katella Avenue was finally connected to
Willow Street in Long Beach, making it a major east-west thoroughfare.
The City and Rossmoor are perhaps best known for their excellent schools and medical center.
The first school in Rossmoor opened in 1958, followed quickly by several other elementary
schools. The City’s two middle schools and high school opened in the 1960s. Today, all of the
City’s nine comprehensive schools have been honored as National Blue Ribbon Schools and/or
California Distinguished Schools. Additionally, many of the schools host athletic fields and boast
a history of successful community and high school sports teams.
In 1968, the Los Alamitos Medical Center was founded to meet the health care needs of a
growing community. The medical center has grown from a community hospital to a
comprehensive medical campus, providing medical care to over 100,000 patients per year.
Despite its growth, the medical center predominantly serves the local community as almost 90
percent of patients live within an eight-mile radius.
The facility is the largest local employer and contributes significant utility and property taxes. In
2011, the City approved a 25-year specific plan that includes a three-phase master planned
expansion of the medical center. The specific plan permits the addition of over 160 new
hospital beds, a new medical office building, and two parking structures.

Today: A Modern Small Town
The City remains is a peaceful, tree lined community that has preserved much of its original
small town image and maintained a maintained a culture of great schools, community sports
and activities, and healthy living. Strategically situated at the junction of the I-605, I-405, and
22 freeways, Los Alamitos boasts a diversified economic base consisting of light industry,
manufacturing, commercial businesses, and many restaurants.

Existing Land Uses
Los Alamitos
Los Alamitos is a small but balanced community bordered by the cities of Cypress, Garden
Grove, and Seal Beach in Orange County and the City of Long Beach in Los Angeles County. The
Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB) represents roughly half of the land area within the City
boundaries and nearly 60 percent of all its parcelized land uses.
The City offers housing options that include small and large detached homes, townhomes, and
medium- and high-density apartments, with the residential areas grouped into 16 different
neighborhoods. Unlike the majority of Orange County jurisdictions, Los Alamitos actually has
more multiple family housing units than single family homes.
The City enjoys a healthy retail and office market, along with an emphasis on medical service
and the Los Alamitos Medical Center. Other businesses and employment opportunities span
from aerospace to commercial printing to specialty produce. Public uses include numerous
school campuses, parks and recreational facilities, religious institutions, civic facilities, and the
Joint Forces Training Base.
As of 2013, over 11,000 people called Los Alamitos home, over 14,000 people were employed
by businesses in Los Alamitos, and roughly 6,600 students attended schools in the City.
Rossmoor
Rossmoor is within the City’s sphere of influence and was originally developed as a master
planned community nestled between Los Alamitos, Long Beach, and Seal Beach. Its land use
patterns remain largely the same today, and a little over 10,000 people reside within its
boundaries. Approximately 2,600 students attend one of the four elementary schools in
Rossmoor.
The dominant land use is single family residential, complemented by a small amount of multiple
family units, elementary schools, a church, parks, and shops and restaurants.
Charts 1 to 3, Table 1, and Figures 1 and 2 provide a more precise breakdown of existing land
uses and neighborhoods in Los Alamitos and Rossmoor. In total, the City estimates that nearly
22,000 people and 15,000 employees lived and worked in the entire sphere of influence for Los
Alamitos in 2013. Approximately 10,000 students attend schools in Los Alamitos and Rossmoor.

Notes on Table 1
1. Existing land use categories and GP designations do not match. This is not an error or an
indication of land use change or nonconformity. The existing land use figures and maps are
provided as a snapshot in time to provide context and better understanding for implementation
of the goals and policies.
2. Employment totals for the JFTB are estimates of day-to-day employees and include those
who work at the golf course. It does not include personnel that train periodically at the facility,
which can total up to 3,000 Army reservists and National Guard units.

Los Alamitos General Plan                    8
Land Use Element                                                                         March 2015
Issues and Opportunities
Los Alamitos is small, builtout community, and any new development could substantially
impact the look, feel, and performance of the City. Care must be taken to encourage and
approve the optimal land use mix for any new development within Los Alamitos. The following
discusses some of the most significant land use issues and opportunities. As other issues and
opportunities arise in the future, the General Plan’s goals and policies can provide guidance.
Downtown and Retail Spending
Downtown / Town Center
The General Plan uses the terms “downtown” and “town center” interchangeably to refer to a
walkable, human-scaled area where people shop, work, eat, have fun, and spend quality time
with friends and family. People can also live adjacent to or in a downtown area. It can also be
thought of a central business, shopping, and social district. Such an area may also serve the
primary place where the people of Los Alamitos gather to celebrate as a community.
Retail Spending
The City’s 2012 economic analysis pointed out that Los Alamitos has done relatively well
capturing its share of retail spending in the past. With relatively new shopping centers
developed in Seal Beach and Cypress, however, Los Alamitos may not soon recover to its pre-
recession levels of retail sales. The vast majority of popular big-box retailers are already located
in adjacent cities and Cypress already has land capacity to accommodate additional big box
tenants.
However, Los Alamitos has the potential to create a unique retail shopping environment with
the downtown plan from the Commercial Corridors Plan. A walking, human-scale, experiential
shopping district is something that one must travel far from Los Alamitos to find. Furthermore,
the Internet has not finished changing the nature of retail, and the future of big box stores as a
staple of American consumerism is not a sure thing. What is more certain is that regardless of
how we satisfy our material needs, we will still desire places where we can socialize, hang out,
dine with friends and family, and, perhaps, do a little shopping.
Additionally, Los Alamitos hosts a large daytime population due to its balance of employment-
generating land uses. Workers can generate a great deal of retail sales tax revenue through
their purchases before, during, and after work. A downtown Los Alamitos would capture more
of the daytime population’s taxable retail spending.
Based on the goals and policies from the preceding General Plan and over four years of public
input through surveys, interviews, and over two dozen public meetings and workshops, it is
clear that the creation of a downtown or town center is one of the community’s top three
priorities. The downtown plan provides a way for Los Alamitos to create a central place for its
residents and successfully compete for taxable retail sales in a way that complements and
enhances the community’s quality of life.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                          9

Industrial
Industrial businesses are an important component of the local economy. The City’s 2012
economic analysis suggests that these businesses will likely remain viable and continue
contributing more to municipal revenues than they require in public services.
Industrial areas tend to have lower purchase/lease costs than retail and office areas. As a result,
non-industrial uses often seek to locate in industrial areas. Many industrial parks in Southern
California are dealing with encroachment from churches, day-care facilities, gymnastics and
karate schools, and so forth. In Los Alamitos, several industrial properties have commercial
recreation businesses (e.g., archery, gymnastics, indoor health and fitness, and batting cages).
The nature of commercial recreation businesses attracts families with children and can conflict
with adjacent industrial uses and degrade their economic viability.
Accordingly, the City created a Limited Industrial land use designation for a specific area of the
City that explicitly permits forms of industrial, commercial recreation, and public/quasi-public
uses that do not involve heavy equipment or large trucks. The Planned Industrial land use
designation clearly delineates the area intended to accommodate industrial businesses over the
long term without encroachment by family-oriented, non-industrial uses.
Medical Office
The medical services industry will continue growing for many years. This growth provides an
opportunity for Los Alamitos to capture more economic activity and, consequently, more
municipal revenues. The Los Alamitos Medical Center is approved for and is currently
implementing a planned expansion that could accommodate a great deal of new medical
service uses. If additional medical office demand is created, the City prefers to locate it
alongside the Medical Center campus on the north side of Katella Avenue. The Medical Overlay
land use designation communicates this preference without limiting opportunities for medical
uses elsewhere in the City.
Short-term Development Opportunities
SuperMedia/Civic Center
The land fronting Katella Avenue just east of the 605 freeway is seen as the largest viable site in
the City for future retail. Collectively, this is 13 acres and consists of City properties (City Hall,
Police Department, City Yard, and the Community Center); other quasi-public buildings; and
SuperMedia (western 10 acres), which has expressed a possible desire to sell its property.
Private development interest, along with the City’s willingness to relocate its own facilities,
indicates that this area could support a variety of retail and hospitality uses. The area is also
near Los Alamitos Boulevard and could serve as a southern anchor—though it should not be
developed to potentially compete with downtown uses along Los Alamitos Boulevard.

Vacant Parcel Next to Center Plaza
The 2.25-acre parcel along Los Alamitos Boulevard is one of the few pieces of vacant land in the
City. Over the years the land has served temporary uses such as Christmas tree sales or a short-
term carnival. It will be crucial for the City to ensure that the design of any new development
complements the objectives of the downtown effort and the goals and policies of the General
Plan. If Serpentine Street is vacated and given to the private land owner, the City should work
with the developer to maximize public plaza space into the design.
New Residential South of Cerritos Avenue
There are three parcels along the south side of Cerritos Avenue just east of the Coyote Creek
Channel that could potentially be repurposed for residential land uses. These parcels contain
two industrial uses and a church, and are surrounded by homes in the Old Town West and
Royal Oak Park neighborhoods. The site is also surrounded by new homes just built in 2013, the
northern edge of the downtown area, access to the Coyote Creek bike trail, and the high
school. The existing church use would be explicitly permitted in a residential designation and be
complementary to existing and future residential uses. The surrounding residential uses, the
school district, proximity to the high school and downtown area, and poor access for retail uses
indicated that a residential designation was considered the highest and best use of the
properties.
Joint Forces Training Base
The JFTB provides support and training for military units and other federal, state, and local
organizations. The base occupies roughly half of the land area within the City boundaries, but is
relatively quiet during the weekdays. On weekends and other select training periods, activities
can increase substantially. Nevertheless, the current activities of the base generally do not
disturb the surrounding civilian areas, with the exception of some aircraft noise and dust on the
areas immediately next to the base and flight path, as well as dust and noise related to new
construction activities. Existing land use patterns do not inhibit military readiness activities.
The City maintains a strong partnership with the base, which hosts community events such as
the annual Race on the Base and the Wings, Wheels and Rotors Expo. The base also houses the
Sunburst Youth Challenge Academy, Youth Baseball Fields, and Aquatic Center, all of which are
used by civilian members of the public.
The civilian reuse of the JFTB is not considered likely in the near future, and the City fully
supports the base maintaining its current role for the federal and state government and the
City of Los Alamitos. The City will continue to coordinate with JFTB leadership on current and
potential base activities, the renovation or expansion of recreational facilities, and
opportunities to reuse the land between Little Cottonwood Park and the baseball fields that
currently contains long-abandoned multifamily units. Ideas include an expansion of the existing
park and recreation; a civic center complex; and a joint-use facility that could be used by active,
former, and disabled military, the general public, school district, and medical center.

Periodically, traffic congestion is increased along Farquhar and Katella Avenue due to military
and civilian activity on the base. The base previously maintained two guarded points of access:
Lexington and Orangewood. A third point of access is provided for the golf course, but it is not
used to access other parts of the base except in special circumstances. The base closed the
Orangewood access point a number of years ago, leaving Lexington as the only entrance to the
base. For special events, the base and the City coordinate and open the Orangewood entry, but
it otherwise remains closed. The City may wish to investigate with the base on the options and
merits of reopening the Orangewood entry on a permanent basis.
Future potential growth in the City and Rossmoor is not within the airport’s clear zone and
would be restricted to building heights far below the federally-defined limitation of 88 to 200
feet based on proximity to the runway. Additionally, potential growth would be limited to a few
areas of the City, would only represent incremental increases in building space, and would not
introduce sensitive land uses that are not already present. Accordingly, current and future
military readiness activities would not be affected by future growth. The base is categorized as
its own special Community and Institutional land use designation and policies are provided to
guide the City in the event that the base begins to transition to civilian use.
Long-term Development Opportunities
Mixed Use Designation
The four corners of Los Alamitos Boulevard and Katella Avenue contain the only remaining
commercial property in the unincorporated community of Rossmoor and the most intense
commercial areas in Los Alamitos. The southwest corner remains designated Suburban
Residential and under the jurisdiction of the County of Orange until such time as the properties
are annexed into the City. The City created a Mixed Use land use designation to complement its
Town Center Overlay Zone and encourage the future improvement and intensification of the
land around the primary downtown intersection.
The northeast corner (extending to Reagan Street) contains Los Alamitos Plaza, other assorted
shops, office, quasi-public uses (including St. Isidore), and some residences. The City currently
applies a Town Center Overlay Zone to the northeast corner (through to the alleyway before
Reagan Street). The overlay district permits commercial uses on the first or second floor and
multiple family residential uses on the second floor and higher. Buildings within the Town
Center overlay district can be constructed up to five stories or 60 feet in height (reduced down
to one, two, or three stories when within 75 feet of residentially zoned property).
The northwest corner contains a commercial center (with some improvements), gas station,
some homes, an older retail business, and a new CVS. The alley functions as an internal drive
aisle, and the property is oriented to the automobile, though internal circulation is provided.
Recent new development/improvements make it unlikely that this corner would undergo a
major transformation; however, it could reposition itself when the downtown plan’s street
improvements take place.

The southeast corner (extended south to Farquhar) consists of numerous small shops,
restaurants, services, and the Los Alamitos museum. Shared parking is in this area, along with a
small underground parking garage. This corner is served by alleys—the north-south alleyway
has been partially improved with the undergrounding of utilities and inclusion of pedestrian-
scale street lights. Previous plans identified this area for a walkable atmosphere that would
have many of the businesses front onto the alleyway. Accordingly, future development and
improvement options would likely revolve around internal streetscape design, a centralized
parking feature, and the possible introduction of mixed uses.
Positive implications primarily revolve around an increase in revenue and exposure for the
commercial businesses and jurisdiction, and the introduction of uses that are complementary
to the medical center and downtown area. Ideas include a mix of residential, retail, restaurants,
and a business hotel that could serve the medical center and other visitors. A hotel use would
bring in a good deal of transient occupancy tax revenue without a significant traffic impact.
Upper floor uses could take advantage of the views and temperate Southern California
weather. Finally, Katella Avenue and its intersection with Los Alamitos Boulevard will likely be
exposed to high volumes of external traffic regardless of intensification. The City may be wise to
maximize the value of the exposure to the passing traffic by facilitating more intense
development in this area.
Arrowhead Products
Arrowhead Products is a dynamic aerospace company whose facilities are situated on 28 acres;
its two plants total over 250,000 square feet of working area. The company manufactures
metals products such as flexible and ridged bleed ducting, flex joints, and exhaust ducts; and
non-metal products such as insulation to support metals product and end item composites
made from plastic, rubber, fiberglass, resins, Kevlar, etc. The facility permits the manufacture of
intricate, detailed parts from raw material (sheet, rod, forge, blank, mixtures, etc.) through
complex final assembly and cleaning processes. Arrowhead Products has been operating at this
location for decades and generates a large number of highly skilled, highly paid jobs as the
company continues to build upon its global status. The City supports its continued operation
and success.
If the company ever decides to move locations or change its business, the property could also
be an ideal site for new retail development. Collectively, the four parcels offer 28 acres of
land—larger than any other privately used site in the City. Additionally, the site sits along
Katella Avenue, a regional thoroughfare that carries upward of 60,000 vehicles per day, and is
in proximity to substantial commercial development in Cypress.
To ensure that the City could understand and plan for a potential retail uses on the site, the City
created and applied a Retail Overlay to the site to allow both the underlying Planned Industrial
district and, at the time that the property owner determines that industrial uses are no longer
desired, the introduction of new retail businesses as primary uses. Retail uses generate greater
traffic impacts than manufacturing uses, and the environmental analysis evaluated the site as
retail to analyze the greatest potential traffic impact.

Land Use Plan
The development, use, and distribution of land are critical to achieving the City’s vision and
objectives. Land, especially in Los Alamitos, is a finite and valuable resource, and its use dictates
the City's economic future. As stewards of the land, the City must plan for uses and
development that adds value to the community, in terms of function, design, and fiscal return.
The following land use plan and designations reflect the City’s desire to remain a balanced and
fiscally sustainable community. Figure 3 displays the General Plan Land Use Plan.

Calculating Density and Intensity of Development
Residential Density | dwelling units per acre (du/ac)
Residential density refers to the number of dwelling units that can be constructed per acre of
land.
Residential project. For a project containing only residential uses, divide the total number of
dwelling units by the acreage of land, excluding the area designated for public right-of-way.
Mixed-use project, horizontal mix. For residential and nonresidential uses within the same
project area, but on different parcels, divide the total number of dwelling units by the acreage
of land used as residential, excluding area designated for public right-of-way.
Mixed-use project, vertical mix. For a project containing residential and nonresidential uses
that are within the same building, divide the total number of dwelling units by the acreage of
land used for that building(s), excluding area designated for public right-of-way.
If a project contains both horizontal and vertical mixes of residential and nonresidential uses on
a single parcel, the Community Development Director shall determine the appropriate
proportion of land to allocate for the purposes of calculating residential density. Land used for
structured parking and public rights-of-way shall be excluded from such calculations.
Building Intensity | floor area ratio (FAR)
The intensity of building on a site reflects a combination of a building’s height, lot coverage, and
overall massing distribution. To ensure that the building intensity of a project is appropriate for
the land use designation and community, a maximum intensity standard is provided in the form
of a floor area ratio (FAR). The FAR calculation excludes floor area used for structured parking
to encourage its use and reflect its much higher construction costs.
Nonresidential project. For a project containing one or more nonresidential uses, divide the
total net floor area of a building(s) by the total area (in square feet) of the parcel, excluding
area designated for structured parking and public right-of-way.
Mixed-use project. For a project containing residential and nonresidential (on the same or
different parcels), divide the total net floor area of the residential and nonresidential portions
of a building(s) by the total area (in square feet) of the parcel, excluding area designated for
structured parking and public right-of-way.

Projected Buildout Conditions
Estimating the future buildout of the Land Use Plan allows the City, Rossmoor, and others to
plan for necessary levels of community services and infrastructure capacities. It does not,
however, reflect a certain future or a mandate to approve development.
The theoretical buildout was based largely on the assumption that the majority of the City and
Rossmoor would not change. Some incremental intensification was assumed through small
projects (e.g., adding a second dwelling unit or expanding a storefront). A handful of parcels
were identified as areas where more substantial change could occur. For those parcels, the City
created a set of projections and estimated the amount of development that could occur
between now and 2035 (the horizon planning year for the General Plan). Tables 3 and 4 break
down the potential buildout by land use designation and jurisdiction.

Goal 4:     Neighborhoods and buildings that are well maintained and demonstrate a sense
            of pride and identity.
Policy 4.1  Pride and identity. Enhance the sense of identity and increase the feeling of pride
            among Los Alamitos residents, business owners, employees, and visitors through
            excellent physical design and continual property maintenance and improvements.
Policy 4.2  Corridor design. Buildings and related improvements along the City’s arterial
            streets should exhibit authentic and enduring design. Although no specific
            architectural style is required, the City prefers that designs for individual buildings
            stay true to a single architectural style and discourage franchise architecture.
Policy 4.3  Multifamily neighborhoods. Promote coordinated property maintenance and
            improvement in the Old Town West, Old Town East, and Apartment Row
            neighborhoods.
Policy 4.4  Scale and Character. Ensure that all new development in residential neighborhoods
            is compatible with the scale and character of the surrounding neighborhood.
Policy 4.5  Substandard parcels. Encourage improvement of existing buildings and property to
            comply with current standards and present an attractive and well-maintained
            appearance. When improvements are not feasible, support the consolidation of
            substandard parcels for reuse.

Goal 5:     Lands owned by public agencies that are used, planned, and developed in a
            manner that reinforces the goals of the General Plan.
Policy 5.1  Community use of the Joint Forces Training Base. Cooperate with Joint Forces
            Training Base (JFTB) leadership to maximize the community use of base facilities.
Policy 5.2  Joint Forces Training Base reuse. The JFTB shall remain a functioning military
            training facility within the jurisdictional boundary of the City of Los Alamitos. If the
            federal government decides to close the base and transition it to private, non-
            military use, the City of Los Alamitos shall maintain a leadership role in establishing
            and implementing a base reuse plan.
Policy 5.3  Reuse of public land. The City shall prioritize the reuse of land not along Katella
            Avenue that is owned by non-city public agencies for public uses such as civic
            buildings, parks, or recreation facilities.
Policy 5.4  Flood control facilities. The City strongly supports the use of flood control facilities
            as public trails throughout Los Alamitos.
Policy 5.5  Dual use of school property. Coordinate with LAUSD to enable public use of school
            facilities outside of school hours.
Policy 5.6  School expansion and improvements. Coordinate with LAUSD and its consultants
            on technical studies for school expansion and improvement projects.

Economic Development Element
Summary of Key Economic Findings
The economic development element is based, in part, on a comprehensive economic analysis
conducted in support of the planning process. The analysis identified five key findings.
Los Alamitos Is a Jobs Engine
Los Alamitos is a jobs-rich economic engine. Businesses, nonprofit organizations, and public
agencies provide nearly 14,000 jobs in Los Alamitos. Even when Rossmoor is included, the
General Plan area provides more jobs, 14,600, than it has employed residents (roughly 10,000).
Few cities achieve this balance, and most constantly strive to expand the number of jobs.
Health Care Is the Engine of the Local Economy
The medical services industry provides 24 percent of all jobs in Los Alamitos, almost one of
every four jobs. This sector provides 5.6 more jobs per household in Los Alamitos than it
provides in Orange County and California. In addition to the sheer number of workers, it brings
untold numbers of visitors to the City each day who spend money at local stores and
businesses.
Manufacturing Is Still Important
Manufacturing is also an important component of the local economy. Manufacturers provide
11 percent of local jobs, about the same as in Orange County as a whole, but more than across
the state. Contrary to popular perception, manufacturing continues to grow in the United
States, and the value of manufactured goods, even in inflation-adjusted terms, has steadily
increased over many decades, albeit with fewer and fewer workers. The community should
expect manufacturing to remain an important part of the local economy.
Los Alamitos Captures Retail Sales
Los Alamitos captures a fair amount of taxable retail sales. The City captures slightly more retail
sales per household than Orange County as a whole and even more than the local average
(among four neighboring cities: Cypress, Garden Grove, Seal Beach, and Westminster). Prior to
the recession, the amount of inflation-adjusted retail sales per household had leveled off, and
during the recession, sales declined 30 percent. Since 2009, the amount of retail sales has
grown.
Los Alamitos Needs to Supplement Its Strengths
As a built-out city, Los Alamitos has few prospects for substantial changes that do not involve
large-scale redevelopment. Nevertheless, changes will come to Los Alamitos, driven by
demographic transitions over the next 10 to 20 years. The City and Rossmoor have a very large
population bulge in older children, concentrated in the 15 to 19 age cohort (2010 Census), and
as these children move out, their parents may spend less on retail sales and services in Los
Alamitos.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                        1
Economic Development Element                                                            March 2015
The City and Rossmoor also have a very large population bulge in the baby boom generation,
concentrated among those in the 45 to 54 age cohort (2010 Census). As these residents
transition into retirement, a portion of them will likely desire to move elsewhere.
In fact, trends indicate that there will be fewer families with children on a regional and national
level. A question is whether the family-based market demand for housing in Los Alamitos and
Rossmoor will be sufficient to sustain growing property values. The excellence of the school
district and park resources may not be enough for the City to compete with other jurisdictions
that are evolving into more complete communities.
Economic Overview
To better understand how the economy functions in Los Alamitos, it is important to appreciate
the structure of the local economy, local sales tax revenues, and demographic trends.
Structure of the Local Economy
To describe the structure of a local economy, economists often use employment data across 20
sectors of the economy. This type of analysis identifies the types of economic activity in which
the local economy specializes and the types in which the local economy is underserved.
Relative to the more complete economies of Orange County and California, five sectors employ
a substantially larger share of workers in the local economy: construction; manufacturing;
wholesale trade; real estate and rental and leasing; and health care and social assistance.
Together, these sectors account for more than half the jobs in Los Alamitos and in the General
Plan area, compared to about a third of the total jobs in the county and in the state. These are
sectors in which the local economy specializes and which bring new dollars into the local
economy.
At the same time, six sectors employ substantially fewer workers locally compared to the
regional and state economies. These sectors are: agriculture, farming, forestry, and fishing;
utilities; information; management of companies and enterprises; arts, entertainment, and
recreation; and public administration (excluding education, which is its own sector). These
underrepresented sectors provide only 3 percent of jobs in the City and in the General Plan
area, while they account for 10 percent of Orange County jobs and 14 percent of jobs
statewide.
Goods-Producing Sectors
Economic development efforts typically focus on base sectors, which are the sectors that
usually produce goods and services that are exported out of the region and thus bring new
dollars into the local economy. One group of base industries is the goods-producing sectors:
agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting; mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction;
construction; and manufacturing.
The goods-producing sectors provide about 22 percent of the jobs in Los Alamitos and in the
General Plan area, somewhat more than the 17 percent of county jobs, and 16 percent of state
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                        2
Economic Development Element                                                                            March 2015
jobs. Of these four sectors, construction is the most highly concentrated, providing about 10
percent of local jobs while only accounting for about 5 percent of jobs in the county and state.
One should note that construction jobs are counted in the place where the construction
business is, not in the location of a particular construction project.
Manufacturing is also an important local component of the goods-producing sectors. Its share
of local jobs, 12 percent, is nearly the same as the share of county jobs, but higher than the
share of statewide jobs, 9 percent. As previously discussed, the local area has a relatively high
portion of population with some college education, often a qualification for manufacturing.
Thus, there may be labor force advantages in operating a manufacturing business in Los
Alamitos. Chart 1 shows the employment distribution in the goods-producing sector.

Base Service Sectors
The other set of sectors that typically bring new dollars into a region and a local economy are
the base service sectors. This group includes: utilities; wholesale trade; transportation and
warehousing; information; professional, scientific, and technical services; management of
companies; and administration & support, waste management, and remediation.
The base service sectors only provide 22 percent of local jobs, while providing 27 percent of
jobs in the county and the state. Two of these sectors—information and management of
companies and enterprises—account for most of that difference. On average, from 2009 to
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                                        3

2011, Los Alamitos had 62 jobs in information and 18 jobs in management of companies and
enterprises. If, however, the City’s economic structure had been more like that of the county
and the state, it would have had 248 jobs in information and 230 jobs in management of
companies and enterprises. Chart 2 shows the comparison of the base service sector jobs.

Local-Serving Sectors
Local-serving sectors are those that provide services primarily to the residents, workers, and
visitors to an area. Whereas the base sectors of the economy tend bring new dollars into the
area, local-serving sectors tend to recirculate the dollars that are already in the local economy.
This group includes: retail trade; finance and insurance; real estate and rental and leasing; arts,
entertainment, and recreation; accommodation and food service; other services (excluding
public administration); and public administration.
The local-serving sectors account for only about 26 percent of local jobs but 36 percent of
county and state jobs. By this measure, it would appear that the community is underserved in
local services. However, local-serving sectors serve residents and businesses in the local area,
and comparing two areas based on the percentage of total jobs can be misleading because
some areas have relatively few out of a lot of total jobs.
An alternative is to compare the number of local-serving jobs per 1,000 households. Chart 3
shows this measure of employment. By this measure, Los Alamitos has 756 jobs per 1,000

households, compared to 449 for the General Plan area, 480 for the county, and 377 for the
state. Based on the number of households, Los Alamitos’s local economy is specialized in local-
serving sectors. In addition, Los Alamitos has roughly the same or more jobs per household
than the county and the state in all of the local-serving sectors.

Education and Health Care
The education services and the health care and social assistance sectors are also local-serving
sectors. Economic analyses, however, often consider these sectors separately because state
and federal regulations and funding have a greater influence over the level of employment than
do the market forces that drive the other local-serving sectors.
These sectors provide 30 percent of jobs in the local economy, substantially more than in the
county, 18 percent, and the state, 21 percent. Similarly, on a jobs-per-household basis, these
sectors provide 879 jobs per 1,000 households in Los Alamitos, 509 in the General Plan area,
and 237 in the county and state. This comparison is shown in Chart 3.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                                           5

Clearly, the local economy is highly specialized in education and health care—the specialization
is mostly in health care, which accounts for 5.3 times more local jobs than it does jobs in the
county and state. The health care sector has the potential to be the major driver of local
economic development and to attract continued private sector investment in Los Alamitos.
Sale Tax Revenues
Many cities in California closely monitor taxable retail sales because sales tax is a major source
of revenues. In 2013, sales taxes provided about 21 percent of Los Alamitos’s total revenues,
even more than property taxes, which provided a little over 20 percent.
Total taxable retail sales in Los Alamitos increased from $96 million (M) in 1997, to a high of
$185M in 2007. With the onset of recession, taxable sales decreased for several years, to a low
of $135M in 2009. In 2012, the last year for which the California Board of Equalization has
published taxable retail sales data, sales in Los Alamitos rebounded slightly to $158M, a little
over what sales were in 2003. After adjusting for inflation and population growth, retail sales in
2012 were about the same as they were in 1999.
Los Alamitos, like most cities, has a long way to go to return to pre-recession retail sales levels,
especially when adjusted for inflation and the number of households. Even then, real taxable
sales per household generally reached a plateau in 2004 and started to decline from 2006 to
2007, a year before the recession officially began. This suggests the City faces structural issues
unrelated to the recession. Even with recovery from the recession’s effects, the trend suggests
that the City would face constraints on its ability to fund expansion or improvements in public
facilities and services, at least from sales tax revenues.
Did other cities share Los Alamitos’s experience of taxable retail sales leveling off prior to the
recession? Chart 4 compares the retail taxable retail sales per household for Los Alamitos,
neighboring cities (combined average of Cypress, Garden Grove, Seal Beach, and Westminster),
and Orange County.
The county’s retail sales reached a peak in 2005, a year after Los Alamitos. In 2010, per
household retail sales in the county were at the same level as in 2008. Similarly, across the four
neighboring cities, retail sales reached their highest level in 2004. However, these cities did not
have quite as steep a growth rate, and so by 2010, per household retail sales were at about the
same level as in 2000. This comparison suggests that the Los Alamitos plateau in per household
retail sales was not an anomaly, but appears to be part of a larger story about retail spending in
Orange County and other cities.

Demographic Trends
After World War II, the number of births in the US increased substantially above its long-term
norm, peaked around 1957, and showed a sharp decline from 1964 to 1965. This bulge in
fertility rates is known as the baby boom; this population is aging and now nearing retirement.
The number of births again increased in 1976 in an “Echo Boom” as the baby boomers began
having children, though fertility rates remained low. Chart 5 shows the age distribution of these
groups now in Los Alamitos, Southern California, and nationally.
The country is distressingly unprepared to deal with the cost of medical care as baby boomers
age. There are not enough doctors, nurses, and facilities to accommodate these people. As the
cost of and demand for healthcare increases, cities are thinking about not only their need for
adequate medical services but also about building on health care growth as an economic
development strategy.

In 2011, the first baby boomers became eligible for retirement. Already, there has been a
decrease in family size as children of the baby boomers move out of their parents’ homes, and
families are becoming a smaller portion of total households. Chart 6 illustrates the changing
characteristics of households in the United States.
Between retirement and this decrease in household size, baby boomers may become more
likely to sell their single family homes in order to live in more manageable accommodations.
This would cause the supply of single family homes to increase; survey research suggests that a
smaller portion of members of the echo boom are interested in this type of housing than were
members of the baby boom. This suggests there might not be enough buyers to purchase the
houses of the baby boomers, and housing prices could fall. This could be a large problem for Los
Alamitos, which has a very large retiring population and young population, but little population
in the age group able to buy homes.
Although Los Alamitos, a built-out city, is not able to change its housing characteristics without
major redevelopment, it can work to make itself an attractive and enjoyable place to live for
those looking to buy homes.

Another potential issue caused by this age distribution is a possible labor shortage. As the baby
boomers retire, most of them will take the valuable skills and years of experience with them
and will be replaced by a fresh-faced generation of echo boomers who have yet to receive the
on-the-job training required for an effective and efficient workforce. Whether this will affect
the development and profitability of businesses will depend on the ability of companies to
import trained foreign workers or to train their new hires more quickly and effectively. Los
Alamitos tends to attract highly educated citizens, so it is better positioned to maintain a high
level of employment and income than much of California and the nation.
Economic Vision
Economic development is the growth and structuring of a local economy toward community-
defined goals for economic well-being. Four common categories of economic development
goals are listed below.
1. Increased employment opportunities
2. Real increases in incomes and household wealth
3. Enhancements to the quality of life
4. Diversification and expansion of the tax base
In Los Alamitos, enhancing the quality of life is the highest priority goal, and diversification and
expansion of the tax base is a secondary goal, a tool for achieving the primary goal. The first
two categories, although important, do not rise to the level of goals that drive the City’s
economic vision.

Economic Development Element                                                           March 2015
The economic vision for Los Alamitos is:
   We envision our local economy as a valued resource that provides a stable and resilient
   tax base to support the public facilities and services that contribute positively to its
   quality of life. We recognize and capitalize on our city’s role as a jobs engine in the
   regional economy. We implement public policies and invest public resources to
   maintain Los Alamitos’s appeal as a business location and to attract continued private
   investment, but we do not sacrifice our quality of life for the sake of economic growth.
Economic Strategies
To realize the economic vision, the City may pursue a variety of strategies, and, over time, these
strategies may change to reflect changing conditions. This section identifies the strategies that
the City has followed in formulating the General Plan. Through future economic development
strategic plans, the City may identify and implement different strategies.
1. Maintain Industrial Uses
Industrial businesses are an important component of the local economy. The economic analysis
conducted for the General Plan suggested that these businesses will likely remain viable and
continue contributing more to municipal revenues than they require in public services.
To maintain the integrity of industrial areas and the attractiveness of Los Alamitos as a place for
industrial businesses to operate, the General Plan incorporates several approaches.
Most of the existing industrial uses are in two quarter-sections north of Katella Avenue and east
of Los Alamitos Boulevard, but two other industrial areas are west of Los Alamitos Boulevard.
The General Plan clearly delineates the area that is intended to accommodate industrial
businesses over the long term.
Industrial areas tend to have lower purchase/lease costs than retail and office areas, are not
often adjacent to noise-sensitive neighbors, and contain simple building forms that can be
adapted to a number of uses. As a result, many industrial parks in Southern California are
dealing with encroachment from uses such as churches, day-care facilities, and sports or fitness
schools. Such uses do not necessarily induce existing industrial businesses to leave, but they do
limit the ability of industrial property owners to bring in new tenants. Industrial businesses can
be quite sensitive to liability issues from parents with children navigating the same streets that
lack sidewalks and carry large trucks.
The General Plan seeks to limit non-industrial businesses in the primary industrial areas.
Accordingly, the General Plan provides a new land use designation (Limited Industrial) to allow
some flexibility for these non-industrial uses outside of the primary industrial area, while
prohibiting certain non-industrial businesses in the Planned Industrial land use designation.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                        10

Economic Development Element                                                            March 2015
Additionally, most relocating industrial businesses are seeking a new location to expand their
production to accommodate a new contract or a new product line. For these businesses, time is
of the essence. A three-month or longer process to obtain a conditional use permit or other
discretionary review can be a deal killer. Although the General Plan update does not affect the
existing zoning requirements, future efforts may explore the role of discretionary permit
reviews for industrial uses. The intent would be to streamline the process to the degree feasible
while maintaining protections for the community’s quality of life.
2. Capitalize on Medical Services
The medical services industry will continue to grow for many years, providing opportunities for
Los Alamitos to capture more economic activity and, consequently, more municipal revenues.
The Medical Center is already implementing a planned expansion, and this expansion might
accommodate all of the medical service industry that the community is willing to accept. The
General Plan has identified those areas where additional medical offices may be encouraged.
However, for areas that the City would like to see redeveloped in the future, additional
expansion of medical offices might be the most likely driver of such changes. Medical office
development might be able to afford the added costs to improve the look and feel of such
areas. Intensification of medical offices would allow the City to capitalize on the growth
potential of the medical services industry, but it would have to be compatible with the
community’s overall vision for Los Alamitos.
3. Create a Competitive Retail Environment
The economic analysis pointed out that Los Alamitos has done relatively well capturing its share
of retail spending in the past. With the Shops at Rossmoor and the new commercial
development in Cypress around the racetrack, however, Los Alamitos may not recover to its
pre-recession levels of retail sales. Many popular big-box retailers are already located around
Los Alamitos and in these two areas, and the racetrack area can accommodate additional big
box tenants. In contrast, there are few areas in Los Alamitos where redevelopment to create a
competitive big-box center would be financially feasible.
Los Alamitos has the potential to create a unique retail shopping environment. A walking,
human-scaled, experience-oriented shopping district is something that one must travel far from
Los Alamitos to find. Furthermore, the internet has not finished changing the nature of retail,
and the future of big box stores is uncertain. What is more certain is that Americans are social
creatures; regardless of how people satisfy their material needs, they still desire places where
they can socialize, hang out, dine with friends and family, and, perhaps, do a little shopping.
A downtown or town center provides a way for Los Alamitos to compete for taxable retail sales
in a way that complements the community’s quality of life. In addition to creating a competitive
retail environment in Los Alamitos, the General Plan recognizes the retail value of a larger
daytime population. More workers in the City means more retail spending. And with the
implementation of a downtown or town center, the City may capture more of the daytime
population’s taxable retail spending.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                       11

4. Sustain and Improve the City’s Fiscal Balance
In general, cities spend more providing public facilities and services to residential properties
than those properties generate in revenues. Retail, office, and industry, in contrast, tend to
generate more in revenues than they require in facilities and services. Sustaining a
municipality’s fiscal balance requires managing the balance between residential and non-
residential land uses.
The data suggests that Los Alamitos has a land use balance that most cities would envy. It is
jobs-rich and captures a better than average share of taxable retail sales. This does not mean
that the City is without financial pressures, but it does mean that as the region’s economy
recovers and continues to grow, Los Alamitos is well positioned to recover.
The General Plan focuses on maintaining a healthy land use balance in the future. To the degree
that the community desires to expand public facilities and services, the City will need to focus
on expanding economic activity in the City. Taxable retail sales is just one part of economic
activity. By focusing solely on the retail sales tax dollar, the community risks missing much
larger opportunities, ones that might be easier to capitalize on than chasing retail.
Among those opportunities are growth in the medical industry and increasing the vitality of the
manufacturing sector. Because Los Alamitos is essentially built-out, increasing economic activity
most likely means changing land uses and/or redevelopment of existing buildings. It is in the
land use and economic development policies that the General Plan will ultimately lay the
foundation for the City’s fiscal sustainability.
5. Attract Private Investment
A community that maintains and grows property values is one in which households want to
invest in housing and firms want to invest in operating their business.
Changes in local, regional, and national demographics will influence the housing market over
the next 20 years. How many households will move out of Los Alamitos, and how much demand
will there be from younger generations to buy that housing (and will they be able to afford it)?
It would certainly seem that the quality of the Los Alamitos Unified School District is and will
continue to be a key amenity that attracts households to live in the City. But there are other
cities in this school district and there are cities in other good school districts. Furthermore,
fewer households in the future will have children, which may make the school system less
important in many purchasing decisions. The General Plan emphasizes some of the other
factors that make the City an attractive place to live, especially in relation to other comparable
communities.
Similarly, the General Plan emphasizes what makes Los Alamitos a good place to operate a
business, now and in the future. A metric for this was to explore why a business would pay a
premium to locate in Los Alamitos. The point is not to make it more expensive, but to
understand what businesses would value and to deliver that in the General Plan.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                        12

Goals and Policies
Goal 1:     Development patterns and a mix of uses that provide a fiscal balance sufficient to
            continue and increase public investment in the community’s quality of life.
Policy 1.1  Fiscal decision making. Incorporate short-term and long-term economic and fiscal
            implications of proposed actions into decision-making.
Policy 1.2  Fiscal disclosures. Identify and disclose potential fiscal impacts, including direct and
            indirect costs, as part of land use or development applications requiring City
            Council action.
Policy 1.3  Ongoing funding. Identify and disclose if and how a program or project will be

            renews, or funds a program or project lasting more than one fiscal year
Policy 1.4  Retail and lodging amendments. General plan amendments changing from a land
            use designation that permits retail uses or lodging uses to a land use designation
            that does not allow retail or lodging uses should consider a development
            agreement or other legally enforceable obligation on the property owner(s) that
            requires the subject property generate the same or better fiscal balance for the city
            as it would have generated with a retail or lodging use.
Policy 1.5  Office and industrial amendments. General plan amendments changing from a
            land use designation that permits office or industrial uses to a designation that
            does not permit office or industrial land uses should consider a development
            agreement or other legally enforceable obligation on the property owner(s) that
            requires the subject property generate the same or better fiscal balance for the city
            as it would have generated with an office or industrial use.
Policy 1.6  Fiscal mitigation. Require a fiscal impact analysis and mitigation of any negative
            fiscal impacts for any requested general plan amendment.
Policy 1.7  Budgeting. Require City departments to submit an annual budget request free from
            reliance on one-time revenues (except for specific grant-funded projects) and
            unsustainable revenue and deficit spending.

            other educational and workforce development organizations.
Policy 2.5  Economic development marketing. Collaborate with regional economic
            development partners, such as the Los Alamitos Chamber of Commerce and the
            Orange County Business Council, to market Los Alamitos to potential new
            businesses.
Policy 2.6  Medical services. Capitalize on the City’s role as a regional medical services hub by

            destination and that emphasizes experience-oriented shopping.
Policy 3.2  Business development. Collaborate with the Chamber of Commerce, the Orange
            County Small Business Development Center, and other economic development

            retailers to business development services.
Policy 3.3  Quality retail environments. Require new, redeveloped, and revitalized retail

Policy 3.5  Public-private partnerships. Prioritize municipal initiatives and investments in areas
            in which private sector businesses and property owners are voluntarily providing
            private funding through special financing districts (such as assessment districts and
            business improvement districts).
Policy 3.6  Diversification. Prioritize municipal initiatives, investments, and development
            approvals that bring businesses in economic sectors not currently represented in

Open Space, Recreation, and Conservation Element
Parks, Recreation, and Open Space
Existing Conditions
Los Alamitos and Rossmoor are active communities with families, individuals, and schools that
emphasize the value of parks, recreation, and open space amenities. The City of Los Alamitos
provides parks, school fields, and recreation facilities and programming that directly serve the
residents of Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, Seal Beach, and Long Beach. Parks and school fields in
Rossmoor serve as a direct resource for Rossmoor residents and offer additional open space
resources for Los Alamitos residents.
Parks and Recreation Facilities, Events, and Programs
The City of Los Alamitos contains a wide range of parks and facilities that offer programmed
and unprogrammed space for casual and organized sports, general recreation, and quiet rest
and relaxation. Tables 1 and 2 offers a comprehensive inventory of parks and recreation
facilities in the City of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor. Figure 1 provides a map of each facility.
Los Alamitos
Public Parks. The City has 18 acres of public park space in its four neighborhood parks and five
pocket parks. The newest park facility, Coyote Creek Park, opened in 2013 and converted a
barren utility corridor into a passive, 3.7-acre greenway along the Coyote Creek Channel. Little
Cottonwood Park, at nearly seven acres, is the largest public park available to residents in the
City of Los Alamitos and offers large open spaces, fields, and playground areas.
Laurel Park softens the experience of traveling along Katella Avenue and buffers Los Alamitos
Elementary and McAuliffe Middle Schools from the heavy vehicle traffic. Laurel Park also hosts
games for the Los Alamitos Girls Softball League (LAGSL), which has provided a place for girls of
all levels to learn about and have fun playing softball since 1974. Orville Lewis Park sits at the
southwestern edge of the City to provide open space for residents of the Highlands
Neighborhood.
Five pocket parks bring small open space areas to a number of residential neighborhoods and
generally include grass and play areas for small children.
Other Spaces and Facilities under City Control or Contract. Four facilities comprise 27 acres of
park and recreation space through City ownership or joint-use agreements. The Aquatic Center
is home to the USA Water Polo National Training Center and an outdoor 50-meter pool. The
City leases and operates the facility and offers swimming, exercise, and other youth programs
throughout the year in the heated pool.
                                                                                                 1
Open Space, Recreation, and Conservation Element                                       March 2015
The Los Alamitos Community Center is the focal point for recreational activities and community
services in Los Alamitos and Rossmoor. The Community Center includes rooms for arts, crafts,
exercise and dance classes, and special programs. The activity rooms and kitchen facilities can
accommodate banquets, receptions, meetings, seniors, and fund-raising activities. The
Community Center is also the home of the Los Alamitos Senior Club and Senior Lunch and Bread
Program.
Adjacent to the Community Center is the Youth Center, which dates back to 1952 as an
organization serving the communities of Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, and Seal Beach. The Youth
Center is a nonprofit organization that maintains strong partnerships with the City of Los
Alamitos, the Los Alamitos Unified School District (LAUSD), and the Rossmoor Community
Services District. Its current building and gymnasium was completed in 1979 and is a
community landmark that has assisted countless groups, including other non-profit
organizations requiring use of the facility for valuable events on evenings and weekends. The
center provides children an opportunity to relax, learn, recreate, and be with friends through
after school drop-in, volunteer, and music programs, as well as summer and teen camps. The
building is also used in the morning hours by the City for the senior meals program.
Through long-term, facilities/joint-use agreements with LAUSD, the City is able to use and
program field space on McAuliffe and Oak Middle Schools. This includes hosting “Friday Night
Lights,” youth flag football for boys and girls of all skill levels in grades K–8 in Los Alamitos,
Rossmoor, and Seal Beach.
Other Spaces and Facilities Controlled by Other Agencies. Eight other private or public facilities
offer residents recreation space on a limited basis (by fee, athletic organization affiliation, or
membership). These facilities are not covered by a current agreement with the City but, with
the exception of St. Hedwig, are open to the public.
The Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB) has two parks and two special use facilities. The baseball
fields are leased by Los Alamitos Youth Baseball (LAYB), an all-volunteer organization that offers
baseball programs to boys and girls ages 4 to 14. LAYB celebrated its 50th anniversary as a
youth baseball league in 2012. The Arbor Dog Park and Fields are currently leased by the City of
Seal Beach from the JFTB for its residents, although the two parks are within Los Alamitos. The
Arbor Park Fields are prioritized for use by American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) Region
159, serving children in Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, and Seal Beach. AYSO is celebrating its 50th
year anniversary in 2014. The Navy Golf Course (222 acres) is open to the public on a
fee/membership basis.
Three public schools maintain playing fields that are available for use on a fee basis, and St.
Hedwig’s, a private K–8 school, maintains grass ball fields. Private indoor recreation facilities
(not shown in the tables or on the map) include gymnasiums at the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints and Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church, and commercial recreation facilities
that include indoor soccer, archery, gymnastics, and batting cages.

Events and Programs. Special community events offered by the City include the Race on the
Base, Spring Carnival, Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular, Music & Movies Events, Halloween
Trunk or Treat, and Winter Wonderland at the Plaza. These events are extremely popular and
attract people from Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, and surrounding communities. The City’s largest
event is the Race on the Base, an annual running and triathlon race for children and adults that
draws thousands from the entire southern California region.
The Los Alamitos Recreation and Community Services Department also conducts recreation
programs and classes for people of all ages and interests. Indoor and outdoor activities and
excursions are held all year long. The City also offers classes covering a range of topics such as
arts and crafts, exercise and fitness, sports, health and travel, animals, and volunteering.
Rossmoor
Public Parks. Rossmoor has 18.5 acres of public park space in its two neighborhood parks and
two pocket parks. Both Rossmoor and Rush Park were originally slated for use as schools.
Rossmoor Park never developed as a school and was developed into a park as Rossmoor built
out. In 1990, with a dwindling population of elementary school-age children, Rossmoor
residents approved a ballot measure to acquire Rush School and convert it into a public park.
Today, both of these neighborhood parks offer numerous athletic fields/courts, playground
areas, community rooms, and general open space. For example, both parks host games for the
LAGSL. The parks have become so popular that some residents complain about the lack of
parking and the athletic events that draw sizable crowds. The two pocket parks provide small
open space areas for people walking and exercising in Rossmoor.
Other Spaces and Facilities. The Montecito Center and four elementary schools provide 16.6
acres of park and recreation space in Rossmoor. Montecito Center offers nearly 1,500 square
feet of space for community events and activities, along with a large courtyard and patio.
During the school year, this facility is home to the Li'l Cottonwood Preschool. The fields and
open space areas of the four elementary schools are available for public use outside of school
hours. Individuals, families, and small groups use the school fields for general recreation,
informal games and practices, and passive open space.

Future Park and Recreation Space
Overall, there are nearly 318 acres of park and recreation facilities in Los Alamitos. Of this, 18.0
acres of parkland and 26.9 acres of recreation space in special use and school facilities that are
owned, operated, or under contract by the City for public use. An additional 269.6 acres of
recreation space (48.0 acres outside of the golf course) is on land outside of City control or
contract, but available for public use. Roughly 3.0 acres or recreation space are provided
through a private school (St. Hedwig) typically reserved for its students and families.
There is no state or federal statute on how to calculate the City’s level of park service.
Additionally, there is no state or federal minimum level of park or recreation space. It is up to
each jurisdiction to determine the appropriate amount of park and recreation space and what
does and does not count toward the target amount. Some guidance is provided by Section
66477 of the California Government Code (commonly referred to as the Quimby Act), but this
part of the Government Code does not apply to all development.
The City calculates the acreage of park and recreation facilities that serve the public as follows:
 18.0 acres | public parks
 26.9 acres | spaces and facilities owned or under contract by the City for public use
 13.5 acres | 5% of all other spaces and fields general available to the public, but outside of
    the City’s direct control or agreement
In total, this represents 58.4 acres of park and recreation space currently available to the public.
This figure completely excludes the three acres on St. Hedwig’s property and includes only five
percent of the land outside of the City’s direct control or agreement. While the City can assume
that well over 500 residents use these facilities at various times of the year (roughly five
percent of the City’s 2013 estimated population), there are no specific data sources to confirm
a precise number. However, given the level of participation of residents’ children in local sports
and recreation activities (school-sponsored and club), the number of residents could easily
equal 10 percent or more.
Using the conservative figure of 58.4 acres total and assuming the City’s estimated existing
2013 population of 11,384, the City currently provides 5.1 acres of neighborhood and
community park and recreation space for every 1,000 residents.
Accordingly, the types of activities, users, and families in Los Alamitos indicate that the City will
be best served by setting the following goal for park and recreation facilities:
Park and Recreation Goal. A minimum of 5 acres of park and recreation space per 1,000
residents.
Based on the City’s estimated buildout of 12,463 people, the City may need to provide up to
62.3 acres of park and recreation space to maintain a ratio of 5 acres per 1,000 residents, or 3.9
acres more than what is currently provided.

Underserved Neighborhoods. The location of park space is just as important as the amount of
space provided. It is not enough to provide a large amount of park land in one area of the City.
Individuals and families should be able to walk to a local park.
Though many of the City’s neighborhoods are close to park and recreation facilities, residents in
the Carrier Row, New Dutch Haven, Greenbrook, and Highlands neighborhoods cannot easily
access park space within Los Alamitos.
Future Park and Recreation Space. The City has many options to add new park and recreation
space and address underserved neighborhoods. Small pocket parks should be within walking
distance (1/4-mile) of the neighborhood being served. Neighborhood parks and other larger
park and recreation facilities, however, are citywide assets and can be address the needs of
underserved neighborhoods from any location in Los Alamitos.
   Acquire new park space. Explore options to purchase and convert a portion of the Navy
    Cruiser Course or former base housing into public parkland and recreation space. Consider
    options to purchase vacant and underutilized land in neighborhoods, as available.
   Extend and expand facility use agreements. Renew and renegotiate existing long-term
    facility use agreements with the LAUSD and JFTB. Enter into new agreements to open fields
    and facilities on additional areas of the base and other schools to the general public for
    recreation activity outside of school hours. Specifically, negotiate with JFTB leadership to
    enter into a lease agreement for the public use of Arbor Park (fields and dog park) in
    advance of the termination date of the current lease agreement between the JFTB, City of
    Seal Beach, and AYSO.
   Work with religious and other nonprofit institutions. Coordinate with religious and other
    nonprofit institutions in the City and identify opportunities for community events and for
    public use of open space on private property. This could include coordination with the
    preservation efforts for St. Isidore Historical Plaza and its possible role as a community
    center or a 21st century digital library.
   Identify options for new types of park facilities. Evaluate the potential for community
    gardens in the Apartment Row neighborhood and on school sites as joint-use facilities.
    Explore site and programming options for farmers markets, including Reagan Street, Pine
    Street, Laurel Park, and the JFTB. Identify opportunities to create an additional off-leash dog
    park in the City or on the JFTB.
Rossmoor. Those who live in Rossmoor indicate that they are adequately served by park and
recreation facilities, largely due to the fact that the elementary schools serve as de facto
parklands. Rossmoor has an estimated existing population of 10,234 and is served by 18.5 acres
of public parkland and another 16.6 acres of recreational space on the four elementary schools.
Due to the distribution of parks and schools, none of the residents are outside of walking

Open Space, Recreation, and Conservation Element                                        March 2015
distance to at least one of the facilities. This equates to 3.4 acres of park and recreation space
per 1,000 residents.
If Rossmoor is ever annexed into the City, the estimated buildout of both communities would
be approximately 23,000 people. The combined park and recreation space of both
communities, as calculated above, is 93.5 acres. With a City park and recreation goal of 5 acres
for every 1,000 residents, the total facility need would be 115 acres. Accordingly, if Rossmoor is
ever annexed, the City may need to add 21.5 acres of park and recreation space compared to
what is provided today to maintain the City’s park and recreation goal.
There is little vacant and underutilized land in Rossmoor, and the school district is unlikely to
close any elementary schools. However, the options stated above to add park and recreation
space in the City could also be used to address the potential gap in a scenario where Rossmoor
is annexed into the City.
Natural, Cultural, and Historic Resources
Natural Resources
History
Agricultural Roots. Los Alamitos and Rossmoor contain biological resources typical of the urban
areas in southern California. Los Alamitos and Rossmoor were part of a larger rural area during
the early 1900s primarily known for its agricultural production. Much of the natural grasslands,
other flora, and wildlife were destroyed or displaced by farming. Urban development of the
rural landscape necessitated additional plants and wildlife to be removed to accommodate new
housing sites, streets, and other public improvements. As a result, the original vegetation
(native chaparral and grassland) and associated wildlife have long since been replaced by
ornamental planting.
Floods and Flood Control. Following the devastating floods of 1914, impacted communities
supported the damming and eventual paving of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers to
protect life and property. By the 1950s, the San Gabriel River was converted from its natural
state into a concrete flood control channel. With the channelization of nearly all downstream
areas, the natural riparian habitat was largely destroyed.
In the 1960s, a growing environmental movement began to challenge this approach to river
management. By the 1980s and 1990s, local governments began to introduce goals of
enhancing habitat, recreation, and open space into plans that were previously focused solely on
flood protection, water supply, and water quality. The latest plans view the river systems as
integral parts of the southern California environment and promote their ecological restoration
and natural renewal.
Joint Forces Training Base. The JFTB was originally used in the 1920s and 1930s for agricultural
purposes. In May 1942, the property was commissioned as the Los Alamitos Naval Air Station,
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                       11

Open Space, Recreation, and Conservation Element                                       March 2015
after which it changed roles and operational control several times but maintained its military
function. The JFTB is currently licensed to the State of California by the Department of the Army
and is operated by the California Army National Guard.
Existing Conditions
Within Los Alamitos and Rossmoor, the current natural landscape consists primarily of trees
and managed park space. The trees and park spaces visually soften the hard urban landscape,
help to purify the air, and provide shade, recreation space, and shelter for humans, birds, and
animals. The JFTB is largely developed with buildings, roads, and an airfield. Some agricultural
fields, a 27-hole golf course, and two park facilities form the southern and eastern borders of
the base.
Coyote Creek Park is the newest park facility in the City and improved an area along the Coyote
Creek Channel that was devoid of trees and vegetation. The area now contains a passive
recreation space with landscaping composed of native plants of significant ecological value to
the region. The City funded this project through a grant from the Rivers and Mountains
Conservancy (RMC) and the Clean Drinking Water, Coastal and Beach Protection State Bond Act
of 2002.
Cultural and Historic Resources
Cultural resources can be regarded as symbols of a people and their civilization. These symbols
can represent human activity in pre-history as well as the present. Cultural resources can also
provide a sense of place, history, and pride for residents of a region.
No archaeological or paleontological sites have been discovered in the City or Rossmoor.
Additionally, no sites or structures are currently identified by the City as local landmarks (per
Chapter 17.22 of the City’s Municipal Code) and none are listed on the state or federal registers
of historic places. However, there are a number of sites and structures that may have local
historical significance. The City may seek state and federal registration for one or more of the
following sites and structures.
Los Alamitos Sugar Company Sugar Beet Processing Plant. In 1896, the Los Alamitos Sugar
Company was formed and constructed the first sugar beet factory in Orange County a year
later. The company brought jobs and development that led to the formation of the town of Los
Alamitos. The sugar beet factory operated until 1926, when an area-wide nematode infestation
depleted the soils of their nutrients. The factory complex changed hands many times until 1960,
when all but two of the buildings were torn down. Unfortunately, no structures remain, and a
plaque commemorates the original site of the plant. Located on a wall next to the post office,
the site is designated as Historical Site #46 by the Orange County Historical Commission.
Los Alamitos Fire Station/Museum. The Los Alamitos Museum is housed in a building
previously used as the Los Alamitos volunteer fire station (11062 Los Alamitos Boulevard). In
the late 1940s, the volunteer firemen began earning money to purchase the land for the
station. The County of Orange built the firehouse of adobe bricks, and the Los Alamitos

volunteers finished the inside. The station operated on a completely volunteer basis until the
Los Alamitos fire station was moved to its current address on Green Street in the 1970s. The
museum was dedicated in 1975 and opened with exhibits in 1976.
St. Isidore Chapel. The St. Isidore Chapel is the oldest public building in Los Alamitos. The St.
Isidore Parish was established in 1921—the sixth parish to be established in Orange County. Its
parishioners were field hands, employees of the sugar beet factory, farmers, ranchers,
dairymen and members of the community. In 1926, the church was built and named St. Isidore
after the patron saint of laborers and farm workers.
The original church, a simple chapel with brick facade and large windows, suffered substantial
damage in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. The chapel was rebuilt in a Spanish Revival style
that it maintains today. Iconic elements of the structure include beautiful plastered walls,
exposed wood beams, wrought-iron accents, and ceramic tiles. In the 1930s and early 1940s, 10
striking stained glass windows were installed.
This landmark played a central role throughout the history of the community—the Great
Depression, earthquakes and floods, and multiple wars. With the opening of St. Hedwig in
1960, St. Isidore was closed and stripped of its contents, including its bell, hand carved pews,
and Belgium-marble statues and altar. The church was refurbished and reopened in the 1970s,
after which it again became a focal point in the community.
The Orange Diocese closed St. Isidore in 1999 due in part to the cost to earthquake retrofit the
chapel. Concerned that the chapel may be demolished, a group of citizens coordinated with the
Orange Diocese to purchase and restore the site and its grounds. The group, currently known as
the St. Isidore Historical Plaza, plans to gift the property to the City of Los Alamitos with
stipulations that it indefinitely serve as a park and community center.
Private Homes. A number of private homes remain that were built well before the City’s
incorporation. The oldest house and structure in the City still standing is at 10802 Chestnut and
is thought to have been constructed in 1898. Other homes or locations of former homes that
may be of local historic significance are listed below.

Rossmoor. Rossmoor was marketed first as a subdivision of Los Alamitos and subsequently as
Long Beach's smartest new suburb. The first homeowners moved in by 1957, and Rossmoor is
now home to over 10,000 residents. Though many of the original houses remain, the majority
of homes are continually remodeled, and none of the original homes are considered to be of
historical value at this time. Within the commercial portion of Rossmoor, none of the buildings
were built before the 1950s and are not considered to be of historical value at this time.

Air, Energy, and Water Resources
Air Quality
Environmental Context. The City of Los Alamitos and community of Rossmoor are in the South
Coast Air Basin, which includes all of Orange County as well as the non-desert portions of Los
Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties. The basin is in a coastal plain with connecting
broad valleys and low hills; it is bounded by the Pacific Ocean in the southwest quadrant, with
high mountains forming the remainder of its perimeter. Due to its coastal location and
prevailing wind patterns, Los Alamitos and Rossmoor enjoy good to excellent air quality. Local
air pollutants are blown by prevailing winds from much of the basin toward inland areas.
Rules and Regulations. Air pollution generated by mobile and stationary sources in the City of
Los Alamitos is subject to the rules and regulations imposed by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District (SCAQMD), the California Air Resources Board, and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). State law also requires cities to address future impacts
on climate change. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 was the first legislation
recognizing the link between global warming and air pollution. This legislation requires cities to
reduce cumulative greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions due to public and private development
projects.
Criteria Air Pollutants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set national ambient air quality
standards for six common air pollutants (also known as "criteria pollutants") found all over the
United States. The state also sets ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These
pollutants are referred to as "criteria air pollutants” because the state and federal government
regulate them by developing human health-based or environmentally based criteria for setting
permissible levels. These standards are designed to protect “sensitive receptors,” or those most
susceptible to respiratory distress, such as persons with asthma, the elderly, very young
children, people already weakened by other disease or illness, and persons engaged in
strenuous work or exercise.
They six pollutants are ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur
dioxide, and lead. These pollutants can harm your health and the environment and cause
property damage. Of the six pollutants, particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most
widespread health threats. The limits based on human health are called primary standards.
Another set of limits intended to prevent environmental and property damage is called
secondary standards.
   Ozone. Ozone is a pungent, colorless gas that is typical in southern California smog. The
    major effects of "oxidants" are visibility reduction, vegetation damage, and aggravation of
    respiratory diseases and eye irritation. Peak ozone concentrations result in reduced lung
    function, particularly during physical activity. This effect is acute in the sick, elderly, and
    young children. Ozone levels peak during the summer and early fall months.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                           14

Open Space, Recreation, and Conservation Element                                         March 2015
   Particulate Matter. Particulate matter (PM10) is a complex mixture of extremely small
    particles and liquid droplets, consisting of components such as acids (nitrates and sulfates),
    organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. Particles that are 10 micrometers in
    diameter or smaller are particularly concerning because they generally pass through the
    throat and nose and enter the lungs. Once inhaled, these particles can affect the heart and
    lungs and cause serious health effects.
   Carbon Monoxide. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas emitted from
    combustion processes. The majority of CO emissions come from mobile sources in urban
    areas like Los Alamitos and Rossmoor. CO can cause harmful health effects by reducing
    oxygen delivery to the body's organs (like the heart and brain) and tissues. At extremely
    high levels, CO can cause death.
   Nitrogen Dioxide. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a group of highly reactive and irritating gases
    that form quickly from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road
    equipment. In addition to contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone and fine
    particle pollution, NO2 is linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system.
   Sulfur Dioxide. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is one of a group of highly reactive gasses that derive
    primarily from fossil fuel combustion at power plants and other industrial facilities. Smaller
    sources of SO2 emissions include industrial processes such as extracting metal from ore, and
    the burning of high-sulfur-containing fuels by locomotives, large ships, and non-road
    equipment. SO2 is linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system.
   Lead. Lead is a metal found naturally in the environment as well as in manufactured
    products. The major sources of lead emissions were historically from fuels in motor vehicles
    and industrial sources; although these emissions have been reduced dramatically as a result
    of EPA's regulatory efforts. The major sources of lead emissions to the air today are ore and
    metals processing and piston-engine aircraft operating on leaded aviation gasoline.
State standards. The SCAQMD also measures for compliance with two other state standards:
sulfate and visibility.
   Sulfates. Sulfates are the fully oxidized ionic form of sulfur, which emit primarily from the
    combustion of petroleum-derived fuels that contain sulfur. This sulfur is oxidized to sulfur
    dioxide (SO2) during the combustion process and converted to sulfate compounds in the
    atmosphere. The conversion of SO2 to sulfates takes place rapidly in urban areas and can
    decrease respiratory functions and increase risk of cardiopulmonary disease. Sulfates are
    particularly effective in degrading visibility and can harm ecosystems and damage property.
    The statewide standard is designed to prevent aggravation of respiratory symptoms.
   Visibility-Reducing Particles. Visibility-reducing particles consist of suspended particulate
    matter that vary greatly in shape, size and chemical composition, and can be made up of
    many different materials, such as metals, soot, soil, dust, and salt. The statewide standard is
    intended to limit the frequency and severity of visibility impairment due to regional haze.

Energy Resources
Energy issues impact a wide range of daily activities. This includes the more obvious uses of
energy for transporting, heating, cooling, and lighting. The use of energy is also affected by local
conditions such as land use patterns, transportation options, and individual consumer
consumption decisions. Finally, how we build and operate the buildings within our community
can reduce per capita energy demand, increase conservation opportunities, and incorporate
alternative energy sources.
Finding ways to reduce the energy demands (including transportation of water) and encourage
the development of renewable energy resources within the City can not only reduce our
reliance upon non-renewable energy resources, but can also make the City more ecologically
and economically sustainable.
Water Resources
This section addresses the sources, quantity, and quality of water resources for the Los
Alamitos and Rossmoor area. Additional information pertaining to water purveyors and supply
infrastructure is provided in the Public Facilities and Services Element.
Water Sources and Quantity. Groundwater for the City of Los Alamitos is provided by Golden
State Water Company (GSWC), which owns and operates the water lines serving the majority of
the City. A portion of the City and the community of Rossmoor are within the jurisdiction of the
City of Seal Beach water utility.
GSWC’s water supply comes from the Orange County Groundwater Basin (OCGB) and imported
water from the Municipal Water District of Orange County (MWDOC). Groundwater is pumped
from several wells in the OCGB. According to the 2010 Urban Water Management Plan
(UWMP)—West Orange County, prepared by GSWC, water supply for Los Alamitos is
considered 100 percent reliable and stable through 2035 for normal water years, single-dry
years, and multiple-dry years provided that water supply from the MWDOC and best
management practices of water extraction from the OCGB remain reliable and stable.
As stated above, the City of Seal Beach also provides water supply to portions of Los Alamitos
and the Rossmoor community. Seal Beach’s main sources of water supply are groundwater
from the OCGB and imported water from MWDOC. According to Seal Beach’s UWMP and
MWDOC’s 2010 Regional UWMP, imported waters from MWDOC would be 100 percent reliable
and stable through 2035 for normal water years, single-dry years, and multiple-dry years.
In addition, pursuant to Section 16.08.060 of the City’s Municipal Code, new developments are
required to submit project details and appropriate environmental documents in accordance
with state guidelines to ensure adequate water supply and infrastructure. Chapter 13.04 of the
municipal code identifies water conservation measures that the City may enforce during times
of drought or other conditions that would tax the water system and supplies. Section 13.05.040
of the municipal code sets standards for water use in landscaping to ensure water efficient
irrigation.

Water Quality. The state maintains a Drinking Water Program (DWP) that is responsible for
enforcing the federal and state Safe Drinking Water Acts. The DWP seeks to protect public
health and promote comprehensive water quality protection for drinking water, irrigation,
industrial, and other uses.
The Orange County Water District maintains a thorough groundwater protection policy that
includes water quality monitoring, cleanup of contaminants, regulatory agency support, toxic
residuals removal, and hazardous waste management. Additionally, the District provides water
quality information to regulators, other water agencies, and the general public.
Pursuant to Section 402 of the Clean Water Act, the EPA established regulations under the
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program to control direct stormwater
discharges. In Los Alamitos, the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)
administers NPDES permitting programs and is responsible for developing wastewater
discharge requirements.
As required by the City of Los Alamitos’s local implementation plan and municipal ordinances
on stormwater quality management (e.g., Chapter 8.44 of the Municipal Code, Stormwater and
Urban Runoff Pollution Controls), projects that result in 5,000 square feet or more of
impervious surfaces must submit a priority project-specific water quality management plan to
the City for approval prior to the City issuing any building or grading permits.

Existing Conditions
Regional Setting
The City of Los Alamitos is in northern Orange County and is bordered to the east by the cities
of Cypress and Garden Grove. The City of Seal Beach abuts the southern border; to the north,
across the county line, is the City of Long Beach in Los Angeles County. Rossmoor is in the City’s
sphere of influence, and the roadways and intersections within Rossmoor are therefore
considered part of the City’s transportation network in the general plan.
Primary regional access to Los Alamitos is provided by Interstates 405 and 605 (I-405 and I-605)
and State Route 22 (SR-22). Access throughout the City is provided by the arterial roadways:
Katella Avenue, Cerritos Avenue, Ball Road, Los Alamitos Boulevard, and Bloomfield Street.
The City’s roadways generally travel north uninterrupted into Los Angeles County jurisdictions.
Southbound travel, however, is limited to I-605 and Los Alamitos Boulevard due to the position
of the Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB) and its airfield. The JFTB and its restricted access
precluded the formation of north–south paths south of Katella Avenue between Los Alamitos
Boulevard and Valley View Street, creating more vehicular pressure for Los Alamitos Boulevard
as a southern route to I-405 and SR-22. The JFTB also restricts east–west travel south of
Farquhar Avenue, and the majority of vehicles using Katella Avenue to travel through the City.
Roadway Facilities
Freeways
Interstate 405. I-405 runs north–south immediately south of the City, extending from Irvine in
the south to the San Fernando Valley in the north. Near the study area, it generally provides
five travel lanes in each direction and an additional high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane in each
direction. The posted speed limit on I-405 is 65 miles per hour (mph), with local access provided
by Seal Beach Boulevard and Valley View Street.
Interstate 605. I-605 runs north–south west of the City, extending from I-405 in the south to
Duarte in the north. Near Los Alamitos it generally provides 4 travel lanes in each direction with
an additional HOV lane in each direction. The posted speed limit on I-605 is 65 mph, with local
access provided by Katella Avenue and Cerritos Avenue.
State Route 22. SR-22 runs east–west south of the City of Los Alamitos. It extends from Long
Beach in the west to Tustin in the east. Near the study area, SR-22 joins I-405 and generally
provides 5 travel lanes in each direction, with an additional HOV lane in each direction. Local
access is provided off Seal Beach Boulevard and Valley View Street.

Traffic Control Devices
There are a total of 26 signalized intersections within the City of Los Alamitos, some of which
are not maintained by the City, but by regional and adjacent jurisdictions. The majority of traffic
signals in the City are installed along Los Alamitos Boulevard and Katella Avenue. The signalized
intersections are:
Katella Avenue at:                  Los Alamitos Boulevard at:    Other intersections:
 Interstate 605                     Cerritos Avenue              Cerritos Avenue at Denni

shown in Figure 2. There are no signalized intersections within Rossmoor except at some of the
perimeter intersections.
Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Bicycle Facilities
Class I: Bike Path. Provides a completely separated right-of-way designated for the exclusive
use of bicycles and pedestrians with minimal interruption by motor vehicles. Within the City of
Los Alamitos, there is currently a bike path along the Coyote Creek Bikeway that runs adjacent
to the San Gabriel River through the City of Los Alamitos. There is also a quarter-mile bike path
north of Oak Middle School, connecting Oak Street with the Coyote Creek Bikeway. Within
Rossmoor, a Class I Bike Path is found within Rossmoor Park and along Wallingsford Road
connecting Katella Avenue to Hedwig/Foster Road.
Class II: Bike Lane. Provides a preferential right-of-way designated and striped for the exclusive
or semi-exclusive use of bicycles, with some allowances for vehicle parking. Existing bike lanes
exist along Bloomfield Street from the northern City limit to Katella Avenue in both directions of
travel and on Ball Road from Kaylor Avenue to the western City limit.
A Class II Bike Lane continues from Rossmoor Park along the entire length of Foster Road to the
southern end of Rossmoor.

Class III: Bike Route. Provides a route designated by signs or permanent pavement markings
that is shared with either pedestrians or motorists. Bike routes exist along Bloomfield Street
north of Ball Road past the northern City limit and along Ball Road through the City limits.
Class IV: Bikeway. Legislation passed in 2014 (AB 1193) introduced a new class of bicycle
facilities. Referred to as cycle tracks or separated bikeways, a Class IV bikeway provides a right-
of-way designated exclusively for bicycle travel adjacent to a roadway and which are protected
from vehicular traffic. Types of separation include, but are not limited to, grade separation,
flexible posts, inflexible physical barriers, or on-street parking. There are no existing Class IV
bikeways in Los Alamitos or Rossmoor.
Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities in Los Alamitos consist of sidewalks and crosswalks. Sidewalks are generally
provided throughout the City. Some locations provide a wide sidewalk with a comfortable
amount of space between the sidewalk and roadway edge. Other locations provide a sidewalk
immediately adjacent to the edge of the roadway, with some narrowed due to past roadway
widening.
Having crosswalks on all approaches to the signalized intersections allows pedestrians the
choice of where to cross and provides for good pedestrian access. All the signalized
intersections in the City of Los Alamitos have crosswalks on all approaches with the exception
of: Katella Avenue at I-605, and Carbon Creek Channel at Bloomfield Street.
Figure 3 identifies existing bicycle and pedestrian facilities in the study area. The all-way and
side-street stop-controlled intersections in the City of Los Alamitos have a mix of crosswalks on
all, some, and no approaches. At many of the side-street stop-controlled intersections,
crosswalks are only provided parallel to the major roadway (not across it).

Transit Facilities
Transit service is provided by the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA). Local bus
routes provide service along Los Alamitos Boulevard, Bloomfield Street, Katella Avenue, and
Cerritos Avenue. In 2010, OCTA also planned to operate a bus rapid transit route (BRT) along
Katella Avenue. Subsequent budget cuts postponed such plans indefinitely, and the study area
will continue to be served only by local bus service. The five lines are described below, and
Figure 4 shows existing bus routes and stops serving the City of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor.
Route 42/42A. Generally runs east–west, providing service from Seal Beach to Orange. The
major streets of service are Los Alamitos Boulevard, Lincoln Avenue, and Tustin Street. Typical
headways (the waiting time between buses at a stop) are 20 minutes.
Route 46. Generally runs east–west, providing service from Los Alamitos to Orange. The major
streets of service are Ball Road and Tustin Street. Within Los Alamitos, Route 46 only provides
service in the eastbound direction. Typical headways are 30 minutes.
Route 50. Generally runs east–west, providing service from Long Beach to Orange. The major
streets of service are Studebaker Road, Katella Avenue, and Tustin Street. In the study area,
Route 50 provides regular service in both directions of travel. Typical headways are 30 minutes.
Route 211. An express route that generally runs north–south via I-405, providing service
between Seal Beach and Irvine. Route 211 travels along Lampson Avenue through the study
area. Typical headways are 30 minutes.
Route 701. An express route that generally runs north–south via I-405 and I-605, providing
service between Huntington Beach and Downtown Los Angeles. Route 701 travels along
Lampson Avenue through the City. Typical headways are between 20 and 50 minutes.
Other Transportation Facilities
Railroad Facilities
There are no passenger rail lines through the City of Los Alamitos. The nearest passenger rail
lines are west of the City near Long Beach (Metro Blue Line) and north of the city near Norwalk
and Santa Fe Springs (Metro Green Line). Buena Park offers the closest Metrolink station
(Orange County Line) and Amtrak service (Pacific Surfliner). Right-of-way previously used by the
Southern Pacific Railroad is found in various parts of the City.
In the Planned Industrial area south of Cerritos Avenue between Los Alamitos Boulevard and
Bloomfield Street, the ROW has been reused for operations and access by the industrial
businesses. The ROW north of Katella Avenue between Lexington Drive and Bloomfield Street
has and will continue to be slated for a multipurpose Class I bike path.

Joint Forces Training Base not open to the public. The Army Airfield has two runways that
require permission prior to landing. Approaches and departures have specific flight routes to
assist in noise abatement. Typically, flights are only allowed to arrive/depart from the north,
south, and east along specifically defined routes that avoid flying over homes. No public airport
facilities exist in the City.
Freight System
The goods or freight movement system in Los Alamitos consists of designated truck routes. The
Los Alamitos Municipal Code (Chapter 10, Section 20) defines weight restrictions, specifies the
ability of trucks to enter areas not designated as truck routes, and defines the truck routes
within the City. Roads in the study area that contain truck routes include Katella Avenue, Los
Alamitos Boulevard, Bloomfield Street, Cerritos Avenue, and Ball Road.
Vehicles over four tons in gross vehicle weight are prohibited on Catalina Street between Los
Alamitos Boulevard and Cherry Street, Pine Street between Florista Street and Catalina Street,
Reagan Street between Katella Avenue and Catalina Street, and Cherry Street between Florista
Street and Catalina Street. Figure 5 illustrates the City’s existing truck routes.

Regulatory Framework
The regulatory framework informs the public and decision makers about the regulatory
agencies and policies that affect transportation in the City, and facilitates effective decisions
about planning improvements to transportation systems.
Federal Regulations
In 1982, the federal government passed the Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA). This
act requires states to allow larger trucks on the “National Network,” which consists of the
interstate system plus the non-interstate federal-aid primary system. “Larger trucks” are (1)
doubles with 28.5-foot trailers, (2) singles with 48-foot semi-trailers and unlimited kingpin-to-
rear axle distance, (3) unlimited length for both vehicle combinations, and (4) widths up to 102
inches. Interstate 605 in the City of Los Alamitos is an STAA route.
State Regulations
Assembly Bill 1358, Complete Streets Act. The California Complete Streets Act of 2008 requires
circulation elements to address the transportation system from a multi-modal perspective. The
bill states that streets, roads, and highways must “meet the needs of all users…in a manner
suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of the general plan.” Essentially, this bill
requires a circulation element to plan for all modes of transportation where appropriate—
including walking, biking, car travel, and transit. The Complete Streets Act also requires
circulation elements to consider the multiple users of the transportation system, including
children, adults, seniors, and the disabled.
Assembly Bill 32, Global Warming Solutions Act. With the passage of the Global Warming
Solutions Act of 2006, the State of California committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The California Air Resource Board (ARB), which is
coordinating the response to comply with AB 32, is currently on schedule to meet this deadline.
In 2007, ARB adopted a list of early action programs that could be put in place by January 1,
2010. In 2008, ARB defined its 1990 baseline level of emissions, and by 2011 it completed rules
for reducing GHG emissions. Rules on emissions, as well as market-based mechanisms like the
proposed cap and trade program, came into effect January 1, 2012. The cap and trade program
controls pollution by a governing agency selling permits on the amount of pollutants a firm can
emit. A firm’s pollutants cannot exceed the limit. Firms requiring the need to increase their
emissions must purchase permits from other firms requiring fewer permits.
Senate Bill 375. In 2008, the ARB adopted its Proposed Scoping Plan for AB 32. This scoping
plan included the approval of SB 375 as the means for achieving regional transportation-related
GHG targets. SB 375 provides guidance on how curbing emissions from cars and light trucks can
help the state comply with AB 32. SB 375 also provides CEQA streamlining incentives for
preferred development types. Residential or mixed-use projects qualify if they conform to the
Sustainable Communities Strategy. Transit-oriented developments also qualify if they 1) are at
least 50 percent residential, 2) meet density requirements, and 3) are within one-half mile of a

transit stop. The degree of CEQA streamlining is based on the degree of compliance with these
development preferences.
Senate Bill 743. SB 743 passed in 2013 and amends the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) to give individual agencies the ability to opt out of a congestion management program.
Additionally, this bill requires the State Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to develop
alternative impact criteria for transportation impacts in transit priority areas. The biggest
impact of this senate bill may be the requirement for OPR to look at changing CEQA significance
thresholds for traffic throughout the state. This could remove level of service (LOS) as a topic
for environmental analysis under CEQA. Official guidelines are expected to be approved in
2015.
Regional Plans and Programs
Southern California Association of Governments Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable
Communities Strategy (SCAG RTP/SCS). The SCAG RTP/SCS provides a regional transportation
plan for six counties in Southern California: Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles,
Ventura, and Imperial. The primary goal of the RTP is to increase mobility for the region. With
recent legislation, this plan also encompasses sustainability as a key principle in future
development.
Orange County Congestion Management Program (CMP). The Orange County CMP defines a
network of state highways and arterials, level of service standards, and related procedures and
provides technical justification for the approach. The CMP for Orange County was originally
adopted in 1991 and updated most recently in 2013. For consistency with the CMP, CMP-
designated intersections in the City (I-605 northbound ramps at Katella Avenue) should operate
at LOS E or better. Additionally, during the CMP monitoring process, if any CMP facility is
identified as operating at a deficient level, a deficiency plan is required to restore operations to
an acceptable level.
OCTA Commuter Bikeways Strategic Plan (CBSP). The CBSP is a regional planning document
that identifies existing and proposed bikeways in Orange County. OCTA last updated the CBSP
in 2009. Through the cooperation of the cities and the county, an inventory was taken of
existing bikeways, and priorities for new bikeways were identified. Prioritization of the
proposed bikeways was based on several factors, including input from local jurisdictions and
the public, as well as connectivity to transit and regional destinations.
Local Plans
Katella and Los Alamitos Commercial Corridors Plan. Through SCAG Compass Blue Print
funding, the City prepared a commercial corridor plan for Katella Avenue and Los Alamitos
Boulevard. This demonstration project analyzes and outlines actions the City can take to
capitalize on the future bus rapid transit routes/stations, stimulate new private investment and
redevelopment, and ultimately create great places in Los Alamitos. In addition to the Compass
Blueprint Principles, the demonstration project is driven by six specific project goals:
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                        18

   Enhance the City’s sense of identity along the corridors and at key gateways.
   Create a central, pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly place for those who live, work, learn, and
    shop in Los Alamitos.
   Create a reason for people to turn left or right from Katella Avenue onto Los Alamitos
    Boulevard.
   Consolidate scattered office, medical, retail, and service uses into logical districts and
    nodes.
   Develop strategies for the reuse of key commercial centers and other underutilized parcels
    and incentivize lot consolidation.
   Maximize the multimodal nature of the corridors and capitalize on future BRT investments.
Roadway Performance
Traffic Analysis Methodology
Level of Service
The City analyzed the operation of the roadway system in Los Alamitos and Rossmoor in terms
of level of service. Level of service is a general measure of traffic operating conditions whereby
a letter grade, from LOS A (no congestion) to F (high levels of congestion), is assigned. LOS E
applies to “at capacity” operations.
The flow of vehicles without significant impediments is considered “stable,” but when traffic
encounters interference that limits the capacity acutely, the flow becomes “unstable.” These
grades represent the perspective of drivers only and are an indication of the comfort and
convenience associated with driving such as speed, travel time, traffic interruptions, and
freedom to maneuver.
The Orange County CMP designates LOS standards at CMP intersections and requires that all
intersections operate at LOS E or better. One study intersection, Katella Avenue at the I-605
northbound ramps, is in Los Alamitos and is designated a CMP location. Katella Avenue is also
identified on the CMP highway system, although there are no specific CMP requirements for
roadway segment assessment. Since Los Alamitos maintains a stricter LOS requirement (LOS D)
than the CMP, the LOS standard for the City was used to evaluate all study locations.
Intersection Traffic Operations
Intersection operations were evaluated with the Traffix 8.0 level of service software, which is
consistent with the Intersection Capacity Utilization methodology as provided by the Orange
County Transportation Authority. Table 1 summarizes how the level of service corresponds to
intersection delay at the signalized study intersections. There are no unsignalized study
intersections.

The following assumptions were made in Traffix to conduct the analysis:
   Saturation flow rate of 1,700 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for all left turn lanes,
    through lanes and right turn lanes, except for exclusive right turn lanes that allow right turn
    on red, in which the rate is 1,955 vphpl. These assumptions are consistent with the Orange
    County CMP.
   Lost time factor of 0.05.
   De facto right turn lanes were not assumed.
Roadway Segment Traffic Operations
The City performed a roadway segment traffic operations analysis on selected roadway
segments to evaluate how the roadway network will perform under the general plan,
understand the amount of traffic that may use each roadway, and determine if the existing or
proposed lane configurations can adequately handle the volumes. The level of service for
roadway segments were calculated for key roadway segments in Los Alamitos’ regional
roadway system to evaluate existing traffic conditions. Daily capacity thresholds are shown in
Table 2.

Traffic Model
The City employed a travel demand forecasting model for Orange County (OCTAM) to evaluate
growth in the City of Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, and the region, incorporating land use to assign
traffic to the local roadway system. The model inputs land use, travel behavior, and roadway
characteristics (number of lanes, speed, etc.) to estimate traffic demand on roadways.
OCTAM was developed and maintained by OCTA for use in preparing regional transportation
studies. The City used version 3.4, which incorporates the latest available land use forecasts for
Orange County (Orange County Projections 2012). Consistent with state-of-the-practice travel
demand forecasting, model error was corrected using the methodologies in the National
Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 255 (Transportation Research Board 1982),
using the “difference method” for roadway segments and intersections (e.g., add model-
predicted growth to existing volumes).
OCTAM data is available for forecast years 2010 and 2035. As part of the forecasting process,
the socioeconomic data for the City of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor were updated with more
accurate information collected in 2012. Additionally, the City updated the roadway network
consistent with the future roadway network.
The OCTAM future roadway network assumptions incorporated into the travel demand model
are consistent with the SCAG RTP funded roadway projects list, the needs identified by
comparing the model results to the capacity tables referenced above. Specific roadway
improvements that were assumed include:
   Los Alamitos Boulevard modeled as a four-lane facility north of Katella Avenue, consistent
    with the Corridors Plan (retaining the current four active lanes and all turning movements,
    but avoiding an increase to six active lanes).
    I-605 and I-405 freeways assume new HOV lanes in each direction.
Existing Roadway Performance
Tables 3 and 4 present the existing traffic volumes and lane configurations at the study
intersections and segments. All intersections studied are currently operating at an acceptable
LOS, with many intersections operating at LOS A or B during one or both peak hours. All
roadway segments are currently operating at an acceptable level of service of D or better.

Forecast Roadway Performance
The analysis identified performance and potential impacts to the roadway system assuming
buildout of the general plan land use plan and regional growth by 2035. With some exceptions
(discussed below), the vast majority of intersections and roadways segments are forecast to
perform at acceptable levels of service. Tables 5 and 6 identify forecast performance levels.
Three intersections and five roadway segments along Katella and Cerritos Avenues are forecast
to degrade to LOS E or F in 2035.
   Los Alamitos Boulevard and Katella Avenue – LOS E during AM peak hour
   Bloomfield Street and Cerritos Avenue – LOS F in AM peak hour and LOS E in PM peak hour
   Wallingsford Road/Walnut Street and Katella Avenue – LOS F in AM peak hour
   Katella Avenue (segments)
    Between I-605 and Los Alamitos Blvd – LOS F
    Between Los Alamitos Blvd and Bloomfield St – LOS F
    Between Bloomfield St and Lexington Dr – LOS E
    Between Lexington Dr and Walker St – LOS E
   Cerritos Avenue (segment)
    Between I-605 and Los Alamitos Blvd – LOS E
To increase performance to an acceptable level of service at and along these intersections and
roadway segments, the City would need to obtain additional right-of-way.
   Los Alamitos Boulevard and Katella Avenue: an additional eastbound through lane along
    Katella Avenue would be needed.
   Bloomfield Street and Cerritos Avenue: an additional westbound left-turn lane and
    westbound right-turn lane would be required along Cerritos Avenue.
   Wallingsford Road/ Walnut Street and Katella Avenue: the northbound approach of
    Wallingsford Road would need to be widened, and an additional eastbound through lane
    would be required along Katella Avenue.
   Katella and Cerritos Avenues (segments): increase the number of through lanes throughout
    the segments.
Given existing right-of-way constraints, however, such actions are not considered feasible.
Instead, Policy 1.4 in this element exempts these intersections and roadways from the level of
service performance thresholds.

The degradation of performance is due primarily to growth in regional traffic. The localized
growth of the City and Rossmoor associated with the general plan buildout does not
significantly contribute to the performance failure of the intersections and roadways.
Modeling Los Alamitos Boulevard as a four-lane facility north of Katella Avenue improved the
performance of the Los Alamitos Boulevard and Katella Avenue intersection—as a four-lane
facility, it would not attract as much regional traffic as a six-lane facility. Performance along the
Los Alamitos Boulevard roadway segment north of Katella Avenue would remain at an
acceptable level of service.

Roadways
Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the City’s general plan roadway classifications. Each classification and
arterial highway is described in more detail below. All other roadways are local roads. Divided
roadways incorporate a physical median, two double-yellow lines, and/or continuous left-turn
lane between opposing travel lanes.
Roadway Classifications
Smart Street
A Smart Street is designated a six- to eight-lane divided roadway with a maximum right-of-way
width of 122 to 146 feet. The Smart Street classification is estimated to have a design capacity
of 72,000 vehicles per day in the eight-lane configuration and 60,000 vehicles per day in the six-
lane configuration.
Major Arterial
A major arterial is designated a six-lane divided roadway, with a typical right-of-way width of
120 feet. A major arterial is designed to accommodate a maximum of 54,000 daily vehicle trips.
Primary Arterial
A primary arterial is designated a four-lane divided roadway with a typical right-of-way width of
100 to 120 feet. A primary arterial is designed to accommodate a maximum of 36,000 daily
vehicle trips.
Secondary Arterial
A secondary arterial is designated a four-lane undivided roadway with a typical right-of-way
width of 80 feet. A secondary arterial is designed to accommodate a maximum of 24,000 daily
vehicle trips.

Los Alamitos Boulevard Redesign
Los Alamitos Boulevard is a six-lane street south of Katella Avenue, carrying over 45,000 cars
and trucks into and through the City on an average day. North of Katella Avenue, the traffic
volumes decrease significantly to 24–30,000 trips per day, and traffic backs up primarily during
the morning hours when students are driving to or being dropped off at Los Alamitos High
School. Moreover, the projected volume in 2035 is not expected to exceed 26–30,000 trips per
day, and the roadway will operate at a similar level of service as today.
Though the number of striped lanes decrease from six to four (two in each direction), Los
Alamitos Boulevard retains the same right-of-way width. As a result, the roadway itself is not
reduced, and the distance from curb-to-curb is roughly 95 feet. This is the distance that
pedestrians have to travel to cross from one side of Los Alamitos Boulevard to the other.
In addition to a daunting crossing distance, the extra-wide roadway encourages cars and trucks
to travel faster. The combination of speeding vehicles and large crossing distances ensure that
the only safe places pedestrians can cross Los Alamitos Boulevard are at signalized intersections
with a formal crosswalk.
Furthermore, businesses suffer when potential customers are passing by at high speed and few
pedestrians walk along the corridor. It is not sufficient for commercial businesses to be exposed
to a large number of vehicles. Those vehicles must be able to see the businesses and slow down
to visit them. Additionally, the businesses on either side of the street are too far apart to relate
to one another, and opportunities for synergy between businesses are compromised.
Accordingly, concepts were explored through the Commercial Corridors Plan that narrow the
roadway and enlarge the parkway and sidewalk areas along Los Alamitos Boulevard. These
concepts were strongly supported by the general public and business community in furtherance
of a walkable downtown environment.
Accordingly, the City’s policies and implementation program seek to redesign Los Alamitos
Boulevard north of Katella Avenue to maintain four through lanes and turning movements at
intersections while converting the remaining surplus space into an expanded parkway. Curb
extensions should be installed at intersections to reduce crossing distance. On-street parking
should be restricted north of Sausalito Street until after 9 AM to provide sufficient queuing
space for vehicles turning right onto Cerritos to access the high school in the morning. After the
redesign is complete, the City could conduct a speed study to determine if a speed limit
reduction from 35 to 30 miles per hour is justified.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Facilities
Overall, the City and Rossmoor provide adequate infrastructure for bicycles and pedestrians. In
many places, however, biking and walking environments are not pleasant and do not encourage
walking or biking—especially along larger roadways. Given the family-oriented nature of both
communities, the large number of children and schools, and the desire for a walkable
downtown, a number of improvements are identified to increase the communities’ safety and
quality of life.
Future Bicycle Facilities
The residents and employees of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor expressed a strong desire for a
greater ability to ride their bikes in and around the community. The addition of new bicycle
facilities and amenities will create an integrated, well-signed, and comprehensive bicycle
system. OCTA maintains a Bikeways Strategic Plan and makes recommendations for new bike
facilities within Orange County jurisdictions. Based on an analysis of the City’s roadways and
uses, a modified system of bicycle facilities is recommended on Figure 8 to enhance bicycle
travel within Los Alamitos.
Proposed Class I Bike Paths
Drainage Channels
The community currently uses bike paths along a number of drainage facilities within and
around Los Alamitos and Rossmoor. New multipurpose Class I bike paths could be added along
the Carbon Creek Channel north of the high school (connecting to the Coyote Creek Bikeway)
and the drainage channel that travels between Los Alamitos Boulevard and Farquhar Avenue,
passing Little Cottonwood Park and the Youth Baseball Fields.
These facilities already have pathways wide enough for maintenance vehicles and could easily
accommodate a bike path. Improvements through additional landscaping would turn what are
currently unimproved, functional open channels blocked by a chain-link fence or concrete block
wall into visual amenities that enhance connectivity. Concerns about privacy and access will
need to be addressed but should not be considered absolute barriers to the introduction of
new bicycle facilities on land owned by public agencies.
Railroad Right-of-Way
The City maintains its desire to convert the abandoned railroad right-of-way between
Bloomfield Avenue and Lexington Avenue to a multipurpose Class I bike path. Opportunities
may also include additional recreational features or the conversion of the land into a linear
park.
Proposed Class II Bike Lanes
Chestnut Street
A new Class II bike lane could be created along Chestnut Street from Katella Avenue to Catalina
Avenue. This could serve as another route for those looking to travel by bike along Los
Alamitos Boulevard, particularly if the adjacent alleyway is not improved.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                    35

Mobility and Circulation Element                                                        March 2015
Rossmoor
An existing Class I bike path travels from Katella Avenue down a wide 10 to 12-foot sidewalk
along Wallingsford Road until it reaches Hedwig Road. A Class II bike lane then follows Hedwig
Road, which turns into Foster Road past Rossmoor Park, until it reaches Druid Lane. At that
point, Foster Road turns into Yellowtail Drive, which runs approximately three-quarters of a
mile until it intersects with Saint Cloud Drive, just 150 feet to the west of Seal Beach Boulevard
and an existing Class I bike path.
Yellowtail Drive is not striped for a Class II bike lane, but could be, completing a bikeway for
those seeking a slower, safer alternative to traveling along Seal Beach Boulevard/Los Alamitos
Boulevard. The City could coordinate with the County of Orange to consider extending the Class
II bike lane along Yellowtail Drive.
Proposed Class III Bike Routes
Walnut Street
The Class III bike route along Walnut Street could be upgraded to a Class II bike lane and
provide greater awareness, signage, and striping for bicycles around Oak Middle School and the
streets that connect to the downtown area.
Los Alamitos Boulevard
Although OCTA shows a Class II bike Lane for Los Alamitos Boulevard, the downtown plan and
number of existing driveways may make a Class II lane unsuitable north of Katella Avenue.
South of Katella Avenue, the right-of-way configuration and lane geometries provide less
opportunity for an on-street facility without widening the roadway or right-of-way. If the right-
of-way were widened, a Class I bike path could be placed down at least one side of Los Alamitos
Boulevard.
Given the proximity of homes and newly developed shopping areas in Seal Beach, however, it is
unlikely that the roadway and/or right-of-way will be widened along any significant portion of
Los Alamitos Boulevard south of Katella Avenue. Nevertheless, Los Alamitos Boulevard is the
City’s only direct north–south route, and assigning a Class III bike route is appropriate to
facilitate access through the City.
Old Town West and Apartment Row Neighborhoods
Class III bike routes should be introduced along the streets that would connect the existing and
proposed bicycle facilities and facilitate bicycle access between schools, neighborhoods, and
the downtown area. Streets identified for new Class III bike routes are: Florista Street, Catalina
Street, Oak Street, Sausalito Street, Reagan Street, and Bloomfield Street.
Proposed Class IV Bikeways
There are no Class IV bikeways (aka separated bikeways or cycle tracks) planned in Los Alamitos
or Rossmoor.

Other Bicycle Improvements
Improved Connections to the San Gabriel River Trail
The San Gabriel River Trail is an off-road multipurpose trail, part of a 61-mile loop that travels
from the Pacific Ocean in Seal Beach to cities such as Long Beach, El Monte, and Asuza.
Thousands of bicyclists, runners, and walkers use the SGR Trail every day for commuting,
exercise, or general recreation. The Coyote Creek Trail connects to the SGR Trail just one mile
south of the access point at Oak Middle School. The Coyote Creek Trail is a heavily traveled bike
path with a significant number of serious riders (those with expensive gear traveling long
distances).
Some of these users may be eager to find a nice place to stop, rest, and grab something to eat
or drink. Los Alamitos enjoys direct access to the Coyote Creek Trail at three points in the City:
1) just north of Oak Middle School, 2) Cerritos Avenue, and 3) the northwest corner of Los
Alamitos High School.
Whether they stop for coffee, breakfast, a quick snack, or to peruse shops and services, people
using the Coyote Creek and SGR Trails represent potential customers for the businesses of Los
Alamitos. By improving the connection points to the Coyote Creek Trail, the City could
encourage some of those using the trail to visit the businesses and places in Los Alamitos,
particularly within the downtown area. Some might visit while using the trail and others might
return later after seeing a great place to eat or shop in the City.
Each connection point should become a visual landmark along the trail. Enhanced landscaping
should be combined with attractive signage, seating areas, lighting, and water fountains to
provide users with a nice place to rest during their time on the trail. The signage should include
direction markers to the downtown area. The landscaping should be low water consuming and
native, and the lighting should be powered by alternative energy if possible.
The path leading from the Coyote Creek Trail to City streets should be treated in the same
manner, with a special focus given to the connection along the northern edge of Oak Middle
School leading to Catalina Street, which ultimately leads to Los Alamitos Boulevard and the
downtown area.
Enhanced Bike Signage and Racks
Signage. Enhanced bikeway signage should be introduced along all three types of bikeways to
promote bicycle usage and provide directions on how to connect to other bikeways or key
points in the City. A local example of enhanced bikeway signage can be found in the
neighboring city of Long Beach, which has created “Long Beach Bikeway” signs and route
markers. These signs elevate the bicycle to a mode of transportation that is supported in the
City’s official infrastructure. The signs also allow easier use of the bikeways and directions for
those traveling within the City or to other cities and destinations.
The City may want to collaborate with the City of Long Beach to create bikeway signage that is
unique to Los Alamitos, but complementary to the signs in Long Beach. The neighboring cities

Mobility and Circulation Element                                                      March 2015
can work together to strengthen the local and regional system of bikeways in Southern
California.
Bike Racks. Enhanced bike racks are another feature that should be introduced along the
corridors. Going beyond conventional metal tubing, enhanced bike racks can be artwork that
shapes metal tubes into words or objects to provide the bike rack structure. These types of
racks enhance the right-of-way and serve as functional public art. They also present an
opportunity to connect to the adjacent businesses; e.g., a coffee cup-shaped bike rack in front
of Starbucks.
Bike racks can help draw in customers and complete the bikeway system. With more bikeways
and enhanced signage, more people know that they can bike safely around the community
corridor and how to get to key features and amenities. Enhanced bike racks are an attractive
way of telling people that they are welcome to stop in the downtown and other shopping areas.
Bike Parking. The installation of on-street or curb-adjacent bicycle parking may be considered
at key points in the downtown. Approximately 12 bikes can park in the space normally reserved
for a single car. Therefore, by replacing one parking space, corridor businesses could
accommodate space for up to 12 customers. On-street parking should be done primarily on side
streets where traffic is slower and limited to two lanes, but the spaces should still be highly
visible as one travels within the downtown area.
Future Pedestrian Facilities
The pedestrian facilities in Los Alamitos are generally well developed, although there is a lack of
connectivity in and around the downtown area and the adjacent medical center. The redesign
of Los Alamitos Boulevard north of Katella Avenue will contribute significantly toward the
improvement of connectivity and safety for pedestrians in the downtown area. The community
is also concerned with the safety of children and the amount of congestion created at
intersections of large roadways near schools.
Pedestrian Bridges
The City of Los Alamitos supports a world-class school district that provides educational and
recreational instruction to approximately 10,000 students. Though the majority of the
elementary schools are off the quiet, residential roadways in Rossmoor, Los Alamitos
Elementary and all of the District’s middle and high schools are along or near busy arterial
roadways. Students walking or biking to school must cross these roadways via crosswalks at
signalized intersections.
Although crosswalks are relatively safe and effective, they can create traffic congestion,
because cars must wait for the crosswalk to be entirely clear of pedestrians before turning
right. During school drop-off and pick-up hours, hundreds of students may need to cross the
corridors while a similar number of cars are trying to travel through the intersections (though
few make the light, creating a line of cars stretching down the block).
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                       38

Mobility and Circulation Element                                                        March 2015
The introduction of pedestrian bridges would separate the vehicular traffic from the pedestrian
and bicycle traffic. This separation would allow cars to travel through the intersection without
having to wait for the crosswalk to be clear, and pedestrians and bicyclists to cross the corridors
without risk of being struck by a moving vehicle. The City’s general plan transportation
consultant, Fehr & Peers, estimates that intersection capacities could increase by up to 10
percent if pedestrians are separated from and do not conflict with vehicles. Potential locations
are shown on Figure 8.
These bridges could also enhance the City’s identity at key entrance and exit points. The City
currently maintains four small monument signs at the ends of both corridors that welcome
people into Los Alamitos. Pedestrian bridges would offer larger, elevated signage opportunities
that mark a clear transition into and out of Los Alamitos. The bridges and accompanying
signage would be architecturally designed to emphasize the City’s high quality character.
Supplementary funding can be found in federal and state grant programs such as the Safe
Routes to School Programs, which provide funding for infrastructure projects that increase the
opportunity for children to walk and bike to school by making it safer to do so. Other funding
sources may include federal and state programs focused on improving walkability and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.
Intersection Improvements
Other types of improvements should be considered at key intersections in the City. This is
especially important for the intersection of Katella Avenue and Los Alamitos Boulevard, where
the need for safe pedestrian and bicycle crossing is critical. The heavy traffic volumes at this
intersection are the single biggest deterrent to people walking or riding their bike from south of
Katella Avenue to the northern half of Los Alamitos. Some examples of low cost pedestrian
intersection crossings include:
Countdown Signals
Countdown signals are used in conjunction with conventional pedestrian signals to indicate the
amount of time remaining to safely cross the street. These can enable pedestrians and bicyclists
to make better decisions about when it is safe to cross the street. Countdown signals are
becoming more common throughout California as Caltrans directs their installation along the
state highway system, and local jurisdictions install them during routine maintenance
operations.
Bicycle Traffic Signals
Bicycle-specific traffic signals alongside the traditional round red, yellow and green signals.
Bicycle-specific signals help alert cars and bicyclists when it is safe and appropriate for bicycles
to enter and cross the intersection.
In-pavement Lights
In-pavement lights at crosswalks alert motorists to the presence of a pedestrian crossing or
preparing to cross the street. The amber LED (light-emitting diode) lights are embedded in the
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                         39

Mobility and Circulation Element                                                        March 2015
pavement on both sides of the crosswalk and oriented to face oncoming traffic. When the
pedestrian activates the system, either by using a push button or through detection from an
automated device, the lights begin to flash at a constant rate, warning the motorist that a
pedestrian is in the vicinity of the crosswalk ahead. The amber LED lights flash in unison at a
rate designed for maximum motorist recognition and are visible during the daylight as well as at
night.
Pedestrian Scramble
A pedestrian scramble or exclusive pedestrian phase is a pedestrian crossing system that stops
all vehicular traffic and allows pedestrians to cross an intersection in every direction, including
diagonally, at the same time. This short, all-red light clearance interval provides a better
separation between cars and pedestrians and allows people to cross from one corner to
another in one movement.
Scramble timing also eliminates conflicts with turning vehicles if pedestrians and motorists obey
their signals. This crossing system does create longer wait cycles for cars, but the timing can be
designed to be on-demand so that wait cycles when pedestrians are not present are reduced
significantly. Scramble timing may eliminate the ability to synchronize timing at adjacent traffic
signals, and its benefits may not extend to vision-impaired pedestrians. Highly visible signage is
an essential companion to this option.
Raised, Colored, and Textured Intersections
Raised intersections are flat areas elevated three to six inches above the surrounding street
grade. The intersection and all adjoining crosswalks are accessed by gently sloping ramps. The
intersections are often constructed of a different type and/or color of materials than the
surrounding road. Vehicles automatically slow due to the change in grade and materials. Raised
intersections can lengthen the time it takes for vehicles to travel through the intersection and
can be slightly more expensive to build and maintain than a traditional intersection. This
treatment (raised elevation, coloring, and/or texturing) can be applied to the entire intersection
or just to the crosswalks for pedestrians and bicyclists.

Infrastructure
Water
The City of Los Alamitos and the community of Rossmoor both receive water service from the
Golden State Water Company (GSWC). GSWC owns and operates the extensive network of
water lines that serve the two communities and is part of the West Orange System of GSWC’s
Orange County District. The West Orange System serves most of the cities of Cypress, Stanton,
and Los Alamitos, small portions of the Cities of Seal Beach, Garden Grove and La Palma, and
adjacent unincorporated areas of Orange County including the community of Rossmoor.
Figure 1 displays the water service area of GSWC as it applies to the City of Los Alamitos and
Rossmoor.
As required by state law, an Urban Runoff Management Plan (UWMP) must be prepared every
five years for urban water suppliers like GSWC. According to the latest 2010 UWMP, GSWC’s
water system supply sources include a mixture of groundwater from the Santa Ana River Basin
and treated surface water purchased from the Metropolitan Water District Water District of
Southern California (MWDSC). The system has historically met between 42 and 83 percent of its
total water demand of pumping water from groundwater sources. In the future, groundwater is
expected to be approximately 62 percent of the West Orange System’s total supply.
GSWC operates several groundwater wells within the Orange County Groundwater Basin
(Basin), which is managed by the Orange County Water District (OCWD). OCWD regulates the
amount of groundwater pumped from the Basin and sets the Basin Production Percentage
(BPP) for all pumpers. GSWC pumps groundwater from the Basin for four of its systems
including the West Orange System which serves the City of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor.
There are approximately 20 active wells within the West Orange System with a total current
active well capacity of 11,750 gallons per minute (26 cubic feet per second) and a total capacity
of 18,954 acre-feet per year. The distribution system consists of water lines ranging in size from
2 inches to 6 inches in diameter which form a grid pattern throughout the City.
GSWC’s water supply is projected to increase by approximately 14 percent from 2010 to 2035
to meet associated project water demands, with this demand being met by imported water
from MWDOC and increased groundwater extractions.
There are currently no sources for recycled water for the West Orange System and is not
anticipated in the near future for this service area.
                                                                                                 1

The Water Conservation Act requires a water supply reliability assessment and a water
shortage contingency plan. The West Orange System obtains its water supply from two
sources: imported Metropolitan water from MWDOC and groundwater from the Orange
County Groundwater Basin. In general, GSWC’s supply of water is expected to be 100% reliable
through 2035 based on the analysis provided in the 2010 UWMP for both single year analyses
and multi-year analyses.
In addition, GSWC has a very detailed water shortage contingency plan that is broken up into
several stages dependent upon the severity of the shortage. Stages I–IV represent minimum to
critical water shortage supply conditions and a variety of voluntary and mandatory measures
that will be implemented for each stage of the shortage.
Consistent with state requirements enacted through Senate Bill No. 7 (SBX7-7) in 2009, the
West Orange System is required to reduce its urban per capita water use by 20 percent by
December 31, 2020. The water use baseline for the West Orange System is 151 gallons per
capita per day (gpcd) and the 2020 compliance goal is 140 gpcd.
Over the past few years, per capita water use has declined due to several reasons including
mild climatic conditions, economic recession, and residential-tiered conservation pricing
structure. Per capital water use has gone down 15 percent from 2008 (144 gpcd) to an
estimated 122 gpcd in 2010. The 2015 UWMP will assess the most recent water use trends. As
estimated, the West Orange System currently satisfies its SBX7-7 goals and will focus on
maintaining these savings up to and beyond 2020.

Sanitary Sewers
The Rossmoor/Los Alamitos Area Sewer District (RLAASD) has provided sewage collection
service for the City of Los Alamitos and the unincorporated area of Rossmoor and a small
portion of Cypress and Seal Beach since 1952. Wastewater is carried through pipes owned and
maintained by the RLAASD to larger sewer trunk lines owned and maintained by the Orange
County Sanitation District (OCSD). Figure 2 displays the sanitary sewer distribution network.
OCSD’s trunk sewers are typically grouped into 11 “trunksheds” which discharge to the
headworks of either Plant No. 1 (Fountain Valley) or Plant No. 2 (Huntington Beach). The City of
Los Alamitos falls within the Knott Trunkshed which generally discharges to Plant No. 2.
However, OCSD has the ability to divert flows to Plant No. 1 when necessary. These plants
provide primary and secondary treatment for an average dry weather flow of 250 million
gallons of wastewater per day (mgd). Plant 1 has a design capacity of 174 mgd and Plant 2 has
a design capacity of 276 mgd.
The majority of the sewer lines in the RLAASD boundaries are 8 inches in diameter. In general,
these sewer lines are located in the public right-of-way. Larger trunk lines are located along
Foster Road in Rossmoor, along Los Alamitos Boulevard north of Katella Avenue, and along
Katella Avenue. Table 1 lists the approximate line lengths relative to pipe diameters.

The City’s sanitary sewer system drains via gravity and the general drainage pattern is from east
to west and then north to south towards Seal Beach. Two OCSD trunk sewers and one lift
station (Westside Lift Station) serve RLAASD facilities: (1) the Los Alamitos Subtrunk sewer
following Bloomfield Avenue, Cerritos Avenue, Oak Street, Katella Avenue, and Los Alamitos
Boulevard and, (2) the Westside Relief Interceptor following Lexington Drive, Katella Avenue,
and Los Alamitos Boulevard.
The Los Alamitos Subtrunk flows to the OCSD Westside Lift Station where it is pumped to the
Seal Beach Boulevard Interceptor. The flow is transported to OCSD facilities where sewage is
treated and ultimately disposed of via ocean outfall facilities. There are three major sanitary
sewer drainage areas within Los Alamitos.

1. North Los Alamitos Sanitary Sewer Area. This area is bounded by Katella Avenue to the
south and Los Alamitos Boulevard to the east. Eight-inch diameter collectors drain in a
southerly direction to a twelve-inch trunk along Los Alamitos Boulevard. Flow in this trunk is
subsequently discharged to the Los Alamitos sub-trunk.
2. Katella Avenue Drainage Area. This area follows Katella Avenue from Los Alamitos
Boulevard east. Sewage flows is in a westerly direction as 8-inch diameter collector discharge
into an existing 12-inch trunk line in Katella Avenue. Flow in this trunk line is diverted at several
locations into the OCSD Westside Relief Interceptor.
3. Joint Forces Training Base. This area includes the entire Joint Forces Training Base plus
residential development east of Los Alamitos Boulevard. Sewage flow is in a westerly direction.
Eight-inch and ten-inch collectors discharge into the OCSD Westside Relief Interceptor in Los
Alamitos Boulevard.
In 2001, the RLAASD completed a comprehensive Sewer System Management Plan. The Plan,
prepared by Boyle Engineering, projected a peak flow of approximately 8.6 mgd for the entire
District, and found the sewer system to be generally capable of handling normal and peak
sewer flows. As part of the required Sewer System Management Plan, a Sewer System
Evaluation and Capacity Assurance Plan prepared by Psomas in 2005 also found the District's
existing collection system is capable of handling this flow without generating any significant
problems. This finding is reinforced by the fact that the RLAASD has not experienced any
historical sanitary sewer overflows.
Furthermore, OCSD upgraded the Westside Pump Station in 2009 to address capacity issues
with the pump station and to minimize future surcharge conditions. Additional OCSD
improvements are also proposed for the trunklines serving the Los Alamitos area, including
34,350 linear feet of replacement pipe for the Los Alamitos Sub-trunk and 32,100 linear feet of
replacement for the Westside Relief Interceptor Pipeline along the eastern border of the City.
There is no evidence of hydraulic deficiencies within the RLAASD system that discharges into
the OCSD trunklines.
Adjacent Sewer Systems
There are three areas within the City of Los Alamitos that are served by neighboring local
sewering agencies or discharge into adjacent systems:
1. El Dorado Park Estates East and Bungalows. The City of Long Beach Water Department
provides sewer service for the El Dorado Park Estates East and Bungalows neighborhoods.
2. Country Square. The Country Square neighborhood discharges northerly into Long Beach but
connects to the OCSD trunk line in Bloomfield Street.
3. Parkwood. The Parkwood neighborhood discharges southerly to the Seal Beach local
collection system.

Stormwater Drainage
Facilities
Stormwater drainage and flood control facilities in the City of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor are
maintained by the City, the Orange County Flood Control District (OCFCD), and the Los Angeles
Public Works Department. These agencies maintain flood control facilities to prevent or
minimize loss of life and property caused by flooding. Figure 3 displays the local and regional
drainage facilities for Los Alamitos and Rossmoor.
City of Los Alamitos
Local drainage patterns and facilities consist primarily of surface runoff intercepted by open
channels and underground pipe systems. The City maintains the following facilities:
Streets. Streets serve as the primary facility for conveying stomwater on City-owned land. The
majority of streets were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, when a slope from 0.15 to 0.25
percent was considered adequate. Most city streets are inadequately sloped to convey runoff in
compliance with current drainage standards (minimum slope of 0.50 percent).
City Storm Drain and Open Channel Facilities. City streets also route stomwater runoff to catch
basins that lead to storm drains or open channels. There are approximately 80 catch basins
throughout the City’s two square mile watershed, which intercept most of the local runoff for
storm drain and open channel facilities. Since most of the catch basins and storm drain systems
were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, they do not meet current design standards for
conveyance of the 10-, 25-, and 100-year event storms. Additionally, the number of catch
basins is inadequate based on current standards, which require storm drain interception for
every 1,000 feet of cumulative roadway length. Significant local storm drain facilities owned
and maintained by the City include:
   Rossmoor Highlands open channel (with east to west drainage).
   Katella Avenue drain (a regional drain with east to west drainage).
   Cerritos Avenue drain (east to west drainage).
Pump Station. The City owns and maintains a pump station at the cul-de-sac of Fenley Drive in
the College Park North area. The facilities are for the purpose of pumping local stormwater in
areas that are geographically depressed that prohibit gravity flow designed systems.
Orange County Flood Control District/Orange County Public Works
Flood control facilities in Rossmoor are the responsibility of the OCFCD, which are maintained
by the Orange County Public Works Department.
Streets. The majority of streets in Rossmoor were also constructed based on standards from
the 1950s and 1960s and are inadequately sloped to convey runoff in an efficient manner to
comply with current drainage standards.

County Storm Drain and Open Channel Facilities. There are several regional flood control
facilities located in the City of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor, including the following:
   Carbon Creek Channel (OCFCD Facility B01): Located in the northern-most portion of Los
    Alamitos, Carbon Creek Channel exists as a concrete trapezoidal channel that outlets to
    Coyote Creek. The channel also receives drainage from the Cities of Cypress, Anaheim,
    Fullerton, and Placentia.
   Los Alamitos Channel (OCFCD Facility C01): The Los Alamitos Channel exists as an earthen
    trapezoidal channel and generally parallels the Coyote Creek channel and San Gabriel River.
    The facility originates at Cerritos Avenue along the western portion of the City, and flows
    southwest to the Rossmoor Retarding Basin.
   Rossmoor Storm Channel (OCFCD Facilities C01S01–04): Originates in the eastern portion of
    the City of Los Alamitos and flows west, generally parallel to Howard Avenue and Farquhar
    Avenue as an earthen trapezoidal channel. After crossing Los Alamitos Boulevard, the
    channel traverses through the community of Rossmoor before draining to the Rossmoor
    Retarding Basin. This also includes the Kempton, Montecito, and Bixby Storm Channels.
   Katella Storm Channel (OCFCD Facility C01S05): The Katella Storm Drain exists as an
    underground, 10 feet by 8 feet reinforced concrete box along Katella Avenue (originating at
    Los Alamitos Boulevard), and terminates at the Los Alamitos Channel and Rossmoor
    Retarding Basin.
   Bloomfield Storm Channel (OCFCD Facility C01P02): The Bloomfield Storm Drain is a 72-inch
    reinforced concrete pipe that ties directly into the City storm drain system in Katella Ave
    and ultimately ties into the OCFCD Katella facility.
Multi-Jurisdictional
The City and Rossmoor are also served by a larger, multi-jurisdictional regional flood control
network that discharges the majority of its stormwater runoff into the San Gabriel River. The
Los Angeles County Flood Control District, through the Los Angeles County Department of
Public Works, maintains the San Gabriel River and Coyote Creek flood control facilities adjacent
to the City and Rossmoor.
Throughout the early 19th century, the San Gabriel River functioned as a tributary to the Los
Angeles River and also flowed directly to the ocean. Following a series of flood, the river
assumed a course similar to its current alignment. The floods of 1914 instigated a series of flood
control facilities and mechanized paving technology in the 1950s gave birth to the concrete-
lined channels seen today. These improvements did not yet reach the City and Rossmoor when
heavy storms caused deaths and substantial flooding damage in 1952. The final concrete
channelization of the San Gabriel River and Coyote Creek was completed soon after and has
protected both communities ever since.

Hazards
Flood Hazards
To identify a community's flood risk, the Federal Insurance Administration delineates flood risk
areas that form the basis of flood insurance rate maps (FIRM). Depending on their flood risk,
property owners may be required to purchase flood insurance (standard homeowner insurance
policies do not cover losses due to floods). Flood insurance is legally required for property
owners with land in an area deemed at risk of flooding during a 100-year flood event.
A 100-year flood event is fairly large but historically infrequent flood. To be precise, it is a flood
of a size that is projected to have only a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded each
year. However, this does not mean that this size of flood will only occur once every 100 years.
The likelihood of a 100-year flood occurring within a 100-year stretch of time is actually high,
but there is no way to predict when the next flood will occur—or the one after that.
As shown in Figure 4, only the drainage channels are in a 100-year flood zone risk area. With
the exception of the flood control facilities, entire City of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor are in a
Zone X (shaded)—defined as area that have a 0.2 percent chance of flooding every year (also
known as a 500-year flood zone). More detailed flood risk information can be found on the
following flood insurance rate maps: 06059C0104J, 06059C0112J, and 06059C0116J.
Localized Flooding Problems
Localized flooding has occurred at several locations throughout the city, including areas along
Portal Drive, Cherry Street, and Serpentine Drive; at low points along Katella Avenue; and along
Kempton Drive in the southern portion of the City. This flooding is due primarily to streets with
limited slope and an insufficient number of catch basins and inlets. These flooding issues will be
evaluated further under a future Master Plan of Drainage by the City.
A significant portion of the existing storm drain system was designed and implemented under
older flood control design standards that do not comply with current design standards. Recent
storms have resulted in minimal damage to property and no loss of life, indicating that the
existing system provides a minimal level of protection.
While the costs to upgrade the entire system to the current design standards is cost prohibitive,
improvements made after 1996 have incorporated the updated design standards and will
continue to be implemented with the following County of Orange design standards:
1. Building pads constructed one foot or more above the designated 100-year flood plain
2. Roadways and drainage facilities designated for the 10- and 25-year storm events
Design standards for determining local runoff include the following manuals:
1.      Orange County Hydrology Manual, October 1986
2.      Orange County Local Drainage Manual, January 1996

Seismic and Geologic Hazards
While there are no known active or potentially active earthquake faults located in the City of
Los Alamitos or Rossmoor, the entire Southern California region is considered to be seismically
active. Earthquakes create primary seismic hazards such as ground shaking, ground
displacement, subsidence, and uplift. These actions can, in turn, induce secondary hazards such
as ground failure, liquefaction, landslides, seismically induced water waves (tsunamis and
seiches), and dam failure.
Earthquake Faults
The closest earthquake faults in the Orange County-Los Angeles County region that are capable
of generating destructive earthquakes and surface rupture in Los Alamitos include: El Modena,
Elysian Park, Newport-Inglewood, Norwalk, and Whittier-Elsinore. The closest fault is the
Newport-Inglewood fault zone (see Figure 5), which produced the catastrophic 1933 Long
Beach earthquake that caused the devastation in the Los Alamitos/Rossmoor area. This
earthquake was estimated to be a magnitude 6.3 on the Richter scale. There are numerous
other faults within 50 miles that could cause minor to moderate damage depending on
magnitude of the seismic event.
Surface Rupture and Ground Shaking
Surface rupture resulting directly from earthquakes is unlikely to occur in Los Alamitos or
Rossmoor because no faults have been identified within the boundaries of either community.
In addition, the underlying soil and geologic structure influences the amount of ground shaking
and damage. The soils underlying Los Alamitos include alluvium deposits (a collection of a
variety of materials, including fine particles of silt and clay and larger particles of sand and
gravel). Alluvium deposits can become unstable during intense groundshaking and may create
ground movement during a seismic event.
High levels of groundshaking and soil movement may cause substantial damage to structures,
walls, and paved areas. Tilt-up structures, unreinforced masonry buildings, older buildings,
buildings over four stories in height, and mobile homes can be particularly susceptible to
earthquake related damage.
Landslides
Due to its flat topography, Los Alamitos and Rossmoor are generally considered at low risk for
earthquake-induced landslides. There may be some potential for landslides along drainage
channels and similar settings where steep banks or slopes occur. Also, landslide hazards can be
created during excavation and grading unless appropriate techniques are used.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction causes ground subsidence. It is the process by which the soils become fluid and
lose shear strength during an earthquake. Three simultaneous conditions are necessary for
liquefaction: 1) generally cohesionless soils, predominantly sand; 2) high ground water (where
the groundwater is less than 30 feet from the surface); and 3) ground shaking. Due to the
proximity of active and potentially active faults in and around Los Alamitos, the
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                     17

characteristically high water table, and the cohesionless subsoils, areas in the City with these
conditions may experience liquefaction during extreme ground shaking.
Seiches
Another potential secondary source of damage is from the generation of seiches. A seiche is the
oscillation of sloshing of water caused by seismic activity or landsliding. It may occur in a lake,
bay, or other enclosed body of water. It may result in damage to peripheral shore development
or to downstream development if water tops a dam. Due to dam upgrades, potential damage
to Los Alamitos from a failure of Prado Dam on the Santa Ana River is not an issue.
Infrastructure Hazards
Other hazards related to seismic and other geologic events include damage to roadways and
utilities. The City’s Emergency Operations Plan specifies municipal procedures to address
hazards created by damage to infrastructure. The County’s Emergency Operations Plan also
addresses these hazards.
Roadways. Evacuation and emergency vehicle access could be blocked if surface streets are
damaged or covered with debris. Freeway overpasses at Katella Avenue, Cerritos Avenue, and
Seal Beach Boulevard could collapse and block ingress and egress to the area.
Natural Gas. Natural gas service to the City and Rossmoor is provided by the Southern
California Gas Company. The gas mains in the City range in age from those installed in the
1940s to present day installations. The distribution system primarily consists of high and
medium pressure lines, ranging in size from 1/2 inch to 10 inches in diameter, which form a grid
pattern. One high pressure 34-inch gas line runs along Lampson Avenue and is a part of a large
transmission network system that supplies the greater Los Angeles and Orange County area.
Natural gas lines can fail due to seismic activity, possibly resulting in an explosion.
Electricity. The City of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor receives electrical service from the Southern
California Edison Company. Electrical infrastructure is located both above and below ground
level from Southern California Edison generating facilities to local receiving stations and
substations. In the case of a seismic event, electrical lines could fall to the ground and create
risks of electrocution or fire.
Underground Pipelines. Several pipelines underlie the City to transport oil, gasoline, and crude
oil. These pipelines run along Bloomfield Avenue and Los Alamitos Boulevard north of Cerritos
Avenue, and along Cerritos Avenue. The major threats posed by underground pipelines include
explosions, fire, and contamination of groundwater used as a drinking water source.

Airport Hazards
The Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base (JFTB) is in the southeastern portion of the City. The
airfield, operated by the National Guard Bureau, contains two runways with approximately
1,600 flights that arrive or depart every month.
The Airport Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP) provides a comprehensive plan for the area
surrounding each public airport in Orange County, as well as federal military airports. Crash
hazard areas and building height restrictions are identified for each airport, including
operations at the JFTB.
Crash Hazards
Aircraft failure and crashes are most likely to occur during takeoff and landing activities. Areas
around runways need to be clear from potential hazards to enhance the safety of the aircraft
and its passengers as well as the protection of people and property on the ground. These areas
are called clear zones and, as shown on Figure 6, are entirely within the boundaries of the JFTB.
Height Restrictions
To ensure the safe operation of aircraft activity at the JFTB, structures anywhere in Los Alamitos
or Rossmoor should not exceed the applicable elevations defined in the Federal Aviation
Regulations (FAR), Part 77 (Objects Affecting Navigable Air Space). This height restriction is 88
to 200 feet above ground level based on proximity to the runway.
Current zoning standards do not permit development higher than 70 feet in Los Alamitos or
Rossmoor. Nevertheless, all developments are subject to FAR Part 77 noticing requirements
and must file the necessary form(s) with the City’s Community Development department, the
County’s Planning division, and the Orange County Airport Land Use Commission.

Los Alamitos General Plan                    24
Public Facilities and Safety Element                                                       March 2015
Noise Hazards
Excessive noise can adversely affect human health and well-being, economic productivity, and
property values. Mobile and stationary noise sources contribute to overall noise levels, and the
impacts of both must be analyzed when planning the City’s future growth and management.
Noise Sources and Sensitive Receptors
Mobile
Surrounded by freeways, the primary noise source in Los Alamitos and Rossmoor is from
automobile, truck and motorcycle traffic. Noise from motor vehicles is generated by engine
vibrations, the interaction between tires and the road, and the exhaust system. Activities on the
Joint Forces Training Base also contribute periodic noise sources through aircraft activity,
although approaches and departures have specific flight routes to assist in noise abatement.
Stationary
Residential uses generate noise from landscaping, maintenance activities, and air conditioning
systems. Commercial and industrial uses generate noise from heating, ventilation, air
conditioning systems, loading docks, and machinery. Noise generated by residential or
commercial uses are generally short and intermittent. Industrial uses may generate noise on a
more continuous basis due to the nature of its activities.
Within the City of Los Alamitos, land uses are primarily residential, with retail along major
roadways and industrial uses in the northeastern and northwestern portions of the City.
Rossmoor is almost exclusively residential, with some commercial uses in the northeastern
corner of the community.
Construction activities are another regular and ongoing source of noise typically isolated to the
immediate vicinity of the construction site and occur during daytime hours in accordance with
municipal regulations. Construction activities also occur for relatively short-term periods—a
few weeks to a few months.
Sensitive Receptors
Sensitive land uses are those uses with human activities that may be subject to stress or
significant interference from noise. These include residences, schools, childcare facilities,
religious institutions, hospitals, libraries, parks and recreational facilities, health care facilities,
convalescent centers, and retirement homes. Such uses should be protected from unnecessary
noise to the maximum degree feasible.
Understanding the Measurement of Noise
Noise refers to sound pressure variations audible to the ear. The audibility of a sound depends
on how loud it is (amplitude), its pitch (frequency), and the person’s ability to hear. Whether
the sound is judged as noise depends largely on the listener’s current activity and attitude
toward the sound source, as well as the amplitude and frequency of the sound.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                            25

Public Facilities and Safety Element                                                              March 2015
To obtain convenient measurements, sound is measured in units of the decibel (dB). However,
the human ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies. At low frequencies (a rumble or roar),
the ear is not very sensitive, while at higher frequencies (a screech or a whine), the ear is most
sensitive. To reflect this varying sensitivity, an A-weighted decibel scale (dBA) is typically used
to approximate the sensitivity of the human ear. The scale ranges from zero for the least
perceptible sound to about 130 to 140 dBA, at which point most people begin to feel pain. A
sound level of 190 dBA will rupture the eardrum and permanently damage the inner ear.
The most common sounds vary between 40 dBA (very quiet) and 100 dBA (very loud). Normal
conversation at three feet is roughly at 60 dBA, while loud engine noises equate to 110 dBA,
which can cause serious discomfort. A listener often judges an increase in sound levels of 10
dBA as a doubling of sound. Examples of various noise sources and their decibel level are shown
in Table 2.

Noise Standards
City of Los Alamitos
The General Plan is a tool for managing noise by planning for and maintaining compatibility
between sensitive land uses and noise sources. Noise from stationary sources is regulated
through specific standards in Chapter 17.24 of the Los Alamitos Municipal Code and Division 6
of the Orange County Municipal Code (Rossmoor). The City’s noise standards are shown below
in Table 3 and are similar to the standards found in the County’s municipal code.
Table 4 provides additional guidance when considering the compatibility of proposed land uses
with existing noise levels in the proposed project area.
State of California
The State of California provides noise standards through Title 24 of the California Building Code.
Title 24 establishes standards for residential construction practices and building materials to
ensure that interior noise levels do not exceed 45 dBA. The state leaves it up to each
jurisdiction to determine acceptable interior and exterior noise levels by land use. The state
does provide some guidance through information presented in the table below.

Notes:
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). The energy-average of the A-weighted sound levels during a 24-hour period, with 5 dB added to
the levels from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM and 10 dB added from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM.
Compatibility Zones. The following zones indicate the degree to which listed land uses are compatible with noise levels shown in the table.
Zone A. Clearly Compatible. Specified land use is satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any buildings involved are of normal
conventional construction without any special noise insulation requirements.
Zone B. Normally Compatible. New construction or development should be undertaken only after detailed analysis of the noise reduction
requirements are made and needed noise insulation features in the design are determined. Conventional construction, with closed windows
and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning, will normally suffice.
Zone C. Normally Incompatible. New construction or development should normally be discouraged. If new construction or development does
proceed, a detailed analysis or noise reduction requirements must be made and needed noise insulation features must be included in the
design.
Zone D. Clearly Incompatible. New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.
Noise Analysis
Traffic Noise
A noise analysis was conducted to model noise of the existing roadway network using the
Federal Highway Administration’s Highway Noise Prediction Model. In a general plan noise
analysis, a 3 dBA increase is considered barely perceptible, and increases over 5 dBA are
generally considered readily perceptible. As shown in Table 4, noise-sensitive residential uses
are considered normally compatible under ambient noise conditions of 65 dBA CNEL. Because
the expected ambient noise increase would occur over a long period of time—over 20 years—

as opposed to an immediate change in noise, the noise analysis considers a noise increase of 3
dB or more to be a threshold of significance that requires mitigation.
Table 5 displays the existing (2014) and projected (2035) traffic noise levels for selected
roadway segments under buildout conditions. The table also shows the net change in the
ambient noise levels from existing conditions. The noise analysis indicated that the ambient
noise environment would be higher than 60 dBA CNEL along most of the studied roadway
segments.
While buildout conditions would be expected to result in increased noise levels, the maximum
increased would be 1.1 dBA. These incremental increases would be below levels considered
“barely perceptible” and would be below thresholds that require mitigation. This does note
render the City’s enforcement of its noise ordinance or the requirements that it can impose to
plan for and maintain compatibility between sensitive land uses and noise sources.

Traffic noise contours were estimated for conditions in the year 2035. Figure 7 shows the
projected future noise contours from roadway traffic along nearby freeways and major
roadways in Los Alamitos and Rossmoor. As shown, several areas will be exposed to noise levels
above 60 dBA CNEL. It should be noted, however, that these contours do not account for noise
attenuation provided by intervening structures or topographical barriers, which may
substantially reduce noise impacts for areas farther from the roadway areas.
Joint Forces Training Base
Aircraft Noise. The JFTB is a military aviation facility and operations involve aircraft and ground
vehicle activity. The base does not utilize live ordnance. The major sources of noise are
vehicular traffic on roadways, large events, and aircraft operations.
The Airport Environs Land Use Plan (AELUP) is a land-use compatibility plan that describes the
effects of aircraft noise on surrounding areas. Land uses within the airport planning area
boundaries are required to conform to noise restrictions established in the AELUP. Figure 6
shows the 60 and 65 dBA CNEL noise contours from the AELUP.
Approximately 50 existing homes are exposed to noise levels above 65 dBA CNEL in the
Highlands and New Dutch Haven neighborhoods. These homes have been or should be
sufficiently sound attenuated so that noise levels do not exceed an interior standard of 45 dBA
CNEL. Homes within the moderate noise impact zone (between 60 and 65 dBA CNEL) could be
seriously disturbed by single noise events, but are still considered compatible by the AELUP.
Other small areas within the 65 dBA CNEL noise contour consist of planned industrial and
professional office uses. However, these are not considered noise sensitive land uses and are
therefore considered compatible by the AELUP.
Vehicular Traffic and Events. The JFTB hosts community events and houses educational and
recreational facilities used by civilians. On weekends and other select training periods, activities
can increase substantially. The base maintains its major point of access off Lexington Drive. An
additional point of access is provided for the golf course, but it is not used to access other parts
of the Los Alamitos JFTB except in special circumstances. For special events, the base and the
City coordinate and open the Orangewood Avenue entry, but it otherwise remains closed.
The projected 2035 noise level contours for the segment of Lexington Drive between Katella
Avenue and the JFTB were calculated for a typical traffic condition, without events or military
exercises. The nearest homes are outside the 65 dBA CNEL noise contour, which falls within the
road’s right-of-way. The other access route to the Lexington Drive entrance is provided via
Farquar Avenue, but it is exposed to less noise than Lexington Drive. Therefore, during normal
traffic conditions, the residential areas along the roadways are compatible.
According to the JFTB staff, the base hosts major military training exercises approximately once
a month, when there is an increase in vehicular activity due to military truck conveys accessing
the base. These events would continue to be sporadic, causing noise increases due to truck
passbys that occur for short periods of time.

Public Services
Police Service
Los Alamitos
The Los Alamitos Police Department is committed to providing the highest degree of
professional police service in partnership with the community to ensure Los Alamitos is a safe
place to live, visit, and conduct business. The Department is based out of the civic center (see
Figure 8) along Katella Avenue and consists of two divisions: Operations and Support Services.
The Operations Division is comprised of those activities that are directly related to
enforcement. The primary responsibility of the Patrol Bureau is to ensure the safety and
security of the community. With an average response time to emergency calls of less than three
minutes, the Department is among the quickest, if not the quickest in Orange County.
In addition to the patrol function, the Operations Division encompasses the Detective Bureau,
Traffic Bureau, personnel and training, the reserve officer program, public information, and
professional standards.
The Support Services Division is overseen by a civilian manager and encompasses special
programs and those police functions that are not directly related to operations. This includes
the Records Bureau, court liaison, property & evidence, facilities, emergency preparedness,
information technology, administration of the Police Department’s grants and budget, animal
control, and the Community Outreach Program.
Rossmoor
Rossmoor is served by the Orange County Sheriff’s Department (OCSD) and the California
Highway Patrol (CHP). The OCSD North Operations Division, which is responsible for patrol
services in the north Orange County unincorporated areas and contract police services for the
cities of Yorba Linda, Stanton, and Villa Park. The Sheriff provides patrol services in the
Rossmoor community, while also offering a wide range of emergency, judicial, and law
enforcement services at the Sheriff’s headquarters in Santa Ana. The California Highway Patrol
provides traffic enforcement and accident investigation services. Personnel operate out of the
Westminster area office of CHP’s Border Division.

Fire Service
Los Alamitos and Rossmoor
The City of Los Alamitos contracts with the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA) for fire
protection and emergency medical services. Rossmoor, as an unincorporated community, is
also served by the OCFA. The OCFA is divided into three departments: Operations, Fire
Prevention, and Human Resources.
The Operations Department provides emergency response to fires, medical aids, rescues, and
hazardous materials incidents in both communities. The majority of service calls are for
emergency medical service. Due to the urban nature of Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, and the
surrounding communities, there is very little risk of wildland fire hazards (fires that burn in
woodland, brushland and grassland areas). The primary fire hazard is urban fires—those that
burn in developed areas and include commercial, industrial and residential structures.
The Fire Prevention Department consists of four sections. The Planning and Development
Services section works with the development community and municipal staff to ensure that
building and developments meet state and local fire and life safety requirements. The Safety
and Environmental Services section enforces codes and ordinances relative to fire and life
safety issues associated with commercial, industrial, and residential development, as well as
hazardous materials. The Pre-Fire Management section takes a proactive approach to fire
prevention through the systematic mitigation of risk in the OCFA communities. Finally, the
Investigation Services section is responsible for investigating or reviewing fires and determining
appropriate intervention strategies.
The Human Resources Department coordinates OCFA employment, the volunteer programs,
public education programs, and administration activities.
The local fire station for Los Alamitos and Rossmoor OCFA Fire Station #2, located at 3642
Green Avenue (see Figure 8). Additional resources are quickly available from the additional
OCFA stations and from the City of Long Beach and County of Los Angeles through a mutual aid
agreement. The closest OCFA stations are Station #17 in Cypress and Station #48 in Seal Beach.
Joint Forces Training Base
The California Military Department operates a fire station at the Joint Forces Training Base
(JFTB) and is specially trained for aircraft rescue while also providing basic fire protection

Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials are used in all segments of society. Hazardous material users include
manufacturing and service industries, agriculture, military bases, hospitals, schools and
households. The major transportation routes in Los Alamitos include the freeway system and
surface streets. These routes are used daily to transport hazardous materials from suppliers to
users. On these routes, transportation accidents involving hazardous materials can occur. The
threats posed by a transportation accident involving hazardous materials include explosions,
physical contact by emergency response personnel, and exposure to the public via airborne
exposure.
The Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) is the primary regulatory authority for the
interstate transport of hazardous materials. The DOT regulations establish criteria for safe
handling procedures, personnel qualifications and training, inspection requirements, and
equipment specifications. The California Highway Patrol enforces the intrastate transport of
hazardous materials and hazardous wastes.
The local regulatory authority for the onsite storage of hazardous materials in Los Alamitos and
Rossmoor is the OCFA. The OCFA conducts an inventory program of hazardous materials stored,
handled, and used within OCFA's jurisdiction, and maintains related information on a database
accessible to all emergency response agencies in the event of a major emergency. The
information is also provided to the public regarding the location, type, and health risks of
hazardous materials on a facility-specific basis.
As of July 2013, the Orange County Environmental Health Agency (OCEHA) manages the
Hazardous Materials Disclosure, Business Emergency Plan, and California Accidental Release
Prevention programs that were previously managed by the OCFA.
Joint Forces Training Base
The JFTB is considered a large quantity generator and can store hazardous waste at a central
accumulation site for up to 90 days and at five satellite accumulation points that can hold
hazardous waste for up to 180 days. All of the storage buildings in these areas are designed for
storing hazardous materials and waste. The buildings have locks and integral secondary
containment. Hazardous waste is collected by an outside contractor, OC Vacuum, who disposes
of the waste according to all federal and state regulations.
The OCEHA also acts as the inspection agency for the JFTB. The California Military Department
fire protection staff responds to low level hazardous material incidents while the OCFA
responds to higher level incidents on the base.
Emergency Procedures and Facilities
The City of Los Alamitos Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) addresses the jurisdiction's planned
response to natural disasters and public safety emergency situations. The EOP seeks to mitigate
the effects of hazards, prepare for measures to be taken which will preserve life and minimize

damage, enhance response during emergencies and provide necessary assistance, and establish
a recovery system in order to return the city to its normal state of affairs.
The EOP provides overall organizational and operational concepts for responding to various
types of identified hazards. Included are listings of responsible response agencies, emergency
action checklists for hazard-specific responses, and operational data such as listings of
resources, key personnel, and essential facilities. The EOP is updated on a periodic basis and
tested annually to improve disaster response and recovery operations.
The EOP is activated immediately upon the existence or declaration of a state of emergency for
the state or nation. It may also be placed into effect in case of local emergency by action of City
officials in accordance with Ordinance No. 248.
The County of Orange maintains an EOP that functions in a similar manner as the plan for the
City.
Hospital and Medical Facilities
Los Alamitos and Rossmoor residents are served by the Los Alamitos Medical Center. If the
need arises, there are numerous hospitals located in adjacent cities which could serve Los
Alamitos residents.
Facilities vital to post-earthquake disaster response efforts include fire control and law
enforcement facilities, hospitals, and emergency operations control and communication
centers. It is imperative such facilities be able to withstand the effects of a major earthquake
and remain fully functional. In this regard, factors warranting careful consideration include
seismic design and construction requirements, site location and accessibility, impacts resulting
from damage to adjacent buildings, and the degree of usability of vital facilities following an
earthquake.
State of California’s Office of Emergency Services at the JFTB
The State of California’s Office of Emergency Services (OES) has a facility at the JFTB. This JFTB
has a 10,000-foot long runway that is capable of accommodating any type of emergency
aircraft. The OES is staffed by full-time personnel and can activate its emergency services during
times of civil disturbance, floods, wild fires, and other emergencies. The OES cooperates and
coordinates with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and California National Guard in
the event of a wide-spread emergency.
Schools
The Los Alamitos Unified School District (LAUSD) is one of the best school districts in Southern
California and serves all of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor. The district also serves Seal Beach, the
Surfside community in Huntington Beach, and small portions of Cypress and Long Beach.
All of the district’s comprehensive schools have been honored as National Blue Ribbon Schools
and/or California Distinguished Schools. Additionally, many of the schools host athletic fields
and boast a history of successful community and high school sports teams.

Los Alamitos Unified School District contains six elementary schools, two middle schools, one
high school (see Figure 8). A continuation high school and adult school are operated out of the
high school campus. The City also contains one private K-8 school.

The total enrollment in LAUSD has grown from under 8,500 in 1996/97 to over 9,900 for the
latest 2013/14 school year. Those living and working in the district’s boundaries are given first
priority but the district also accepts interdistrict transfers based on remaining capacity.
According to the district, 20 to 30 percent of the latest enrollment figures represent
interdistrict transfers. This indicates that LAUSD has plenty of capacity to serve any increase in
demand created by an increase in the number of school children generated by existing
development as well as those introduced by new development.
The City enjoys a great working relationship with the district and maintains facility use
agreements for the dual use of recreation facilities.
Medical Services
The Los Alamitos Medical Center was founded in 1968 to meet the health care needs of a
growing community. The medical center has grown from a community hospital to a
comprehensive medical campus and completed a specific plan in 2011 to being a phased
expansion. The campus may ultimately grow to a main hospital and two patient care buildings
with over 300 beds, as well as a collection of medical office buildings, the Total Care Pavilion,
two parking structures, and associated administrative, storage, and mechanical buildings. The
Medical Center is a full-service medical facility that offers a complete array of medical programs
and patient services (see list below).

Emergency Department                Spine Surgery
In addition to the Los Alamitos Medical Center, the City contains dozens of other medical-
related businesses providing services such as dental care, basic and specialized medical care,
diagnostics, and research and development. Overall, the medical industry is an engine of the
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                          39

local economy and provides approximately one of every four jobs in Los Alamitos, as well as an
untold number of visitors. Together, this creates an impressive daytime population that
patronizes local businesses.
The medical industry is a growth sector. The United States lacks a sufficient number of hospital
beds, nurses, doctors, and most other factors related to medical care to deal with the aging of
the baby boom generation and the continued growth of the overall population. The growing
demand for medical services will generate continued employment growth, regardless of how
we as a society decide to pay for the increasing costs.
The City enjoys a great working relationship with the Los Alamitos Medical Center and will
continue to work together to improve the medical campus and the surrounding area in a
manner that best serves the Medical Center, the local community, and the city as a whole.
Solid Waste Disposal
The City of Los Alamitos contracts for the provision of solid waste and recycling services with
Republic Services for residential, commercial, and municipal addresses as well as city-sponsored
events. Service includes the curbside and roll-out collection and disposal/processing of green
waste, recyclable materials, and other solid waste through individual carts (trash cans), bins,
compactors, or boxes. Republic Services also provides annual holiday tree recycling and on-call
collection of bulky, household hazardous, universal, and electronic waste.
Rossmoor receives similar services from CR&R Waste and Recycling Services.
As required by law, both service providers are required to recycle or divert from landfilling
sufficient waste to ensure that each jurisdiction meets current state law requirements for
waste diversion. In 1989, the state set a goal to reach a diversion rate at 50 percent by 2000
and the current diversion rate achieved statewide is 65 percent. In 2012, the state increased
the diversion goal to 75 percent by 2020.
Los Alamitos Television
Los Alamitos Television (LATV) began as a small public-access channel in 1984 with the mission
to provide non-commercial local programming to and by the greater Los Alamitos community
(which includes Rossmoor). LATV evolved into a station that provides public, educational, and
governmental (PEG) programming with coverage on topics such as local government/agency
meetings, sports, travel, local issues and events, and elections.
For example, LATV serves as a resource for the dissemination of disaster preparedness and
safety information, including coverage of live events and videos tailored specifically to the local
residential and business communities. LATV can also assist in promoting ongoing community
programs, special events, business attraction/retention, and issues of public interest such as
recreation, recycling and conservation, and proposed public and private projects. Future
improvements may include the ability to simulcast programming through the Internet.

The City of Los Alamitos operates LATV, is the local franchising authority, and owns all LATV
assets and facilities. LATV is funded by a franchise fee from cable subscribers and from local
underwriting. LATV is overseen by the City’s Cable Television Commission, which consists of five
members, plus one-full time student member.
Animal Control
Animal control services involve the protection of people and property from the dangers and
nuisance of roaming uncontrolled animals. It also includes the protections of pets and wild
animals from the dangers they face in the wild and urban environment. Although Los Alamitos
and Rossmoor are in highly urbanized areas, wildlife does venture into both communities.
Coyotes are a particular nuisance and can pose a threat to small outdoor pets and unattended
children.
The City of Los Alamitos contracts for animal control services with the City of Long Beach. The
City of Long Beach provides emergency response to animal-related incidents, conducts legal
investigations, offers veterinary care and training, and administers emergency management.
Rossmoor is served by the County of Orange for animal control services, which provides similar
services as stated above.

Growth Management Element
Purpose
Growth Management addresses the location, timing and type of development within the City,
Rossmoor, and areas adjacent to the City. The Orange County Transit Authority (OCTA)
Countywide Traffic Improvement and Congestion Management Plans and programs encourage
all cities in Orange County to adopt General Plan Growth Management Elements to
demonstrate eligibility for Measure M and M2 funding.
This element contains a series of goals and policies to carry out the countywide program and
ensure that growth and development are based upon the City's ability to provide an adequate
circulation system and public facilities.
Given the broad scope of the Growth Management Element, many related goals and policies
are addressed elsewhere in the General Plan, particularly the Land Use, Mobility and
Circulation, and Public Facilities and Safety elements. A policy on level of service is duplicated
both in this element and the Mobility and Circulation element.
Legislative Context
Measure M
For more than 20 years, Measure M has been the major force behind traffic congestion relief in
Orange County. Measure M is the half cent sales tax for transportation improvements first
approved by Orange County voters in 1990, and renewed by voters for a 30-year extension in
2006. The combined measures raise the sales tax in Orange County by one-half cent through
2041 to alleviate traffic congestion.
Measure M1. Under the first Measure M program (M1), more than $4 billion worth of
transportation improvements for Orange County were achieved, including the widening of
State Route 22 (SR-22). As a result, M1 was responsible for adding 192 freeway lane miles,
improving 170 intersections and 38 freeway interchanges, and implementing Metrolink service
in Orange County, which now carries the equivalent of one lane of traffic on Interstate 5 (I-5).
Measure M2. With the sunset of M1, voters approved a continuation of transportation
improvements through the Measure M Transportation Investment Plan (M2). By the year 2041,
the M2 program plans to deliver approximately $15.5 billion worth of transportation
improvements to Orange County. Major improvement plans target Orange County freeways,
streets and roads, transit and environmental programs.
                                                                                                 1
Growth Management Element                                                              March 2015
M2020 Plan. The M2020 Plan expedites $5 billion of M2 transportation improvements through
bonding between 2012 and 2020. The plan includes detailed information on each project or
program, which includes several projects relevant to the Los Alamitos area.
   Freeway widening of I-405 between I-605 and SR-55. This may include the addition of
    general purpose and high-occupancy lanes and in each direction.
   Interchange improvement at I-605 and Katella Avenue. This would improve freeway access,
    arterial connection, interchange traffic operations; and enhance safety, pedestrian, and
    bicycle facilities within the interchange area.
Proposition 111
In 1990, the California Legislature enacted the Congestion Management Program (CMP) to
implement Proposition 111, a state-wide transportation funding proposal that required local
governments to implement mitigation measures to offset the impacts from new development
on the regional transportation system.
The goal was to link land use, transportation, and air quality decisions at the regional and local
level. The program required, among other things, that every county designate a congestion
management agency, which in turn would designate a regional roadway network for
monitoring purposes and develop a deficiency plan to address deficiencies in levels of service
on the network. The legislation also provided that jurisdictions that fail to comply with the CMP
requirements would lose their state gasoline tax revenues.
The CMP requirements include traffic level of service (LOS) standards, a trip reduction program,
and a seven-year capital improvement program. Many of the Proposition 111 requirements are
the same or similar to the requirements of Measure M.
OCTA is the designated congestion management agency (CMA) for Orange County and is
responsible for the conformance monitoring and biennial updating of Orange County’s CMP.
Compliance Requirements
To receive Measure M funds, the City must submit to the OCTA a statement of compliance with
the Countywide Growth Management components that are summarized below. The City’s
compliance with these components has been addressed in this element.
1. Adoption of a Growth Management Element that includes
     Traffic level of service standards
     A development mitigation program
2. Participation in inter-jurisdictional planning forums
3. Development of a seven-year capital improvement program
4. Adoption of a Transportation Demand Management Ordinance

            Forces Training Base (JFTB) regarding processes, operations, or projects in the City
            or at the JFTB that have the potential to impact the City of Los Alamitos, its
            residents, its businesses, or base operations.
Policy 1.5  Sphere of Influence. Embrace Rossmoor as a part of the City’s sphere of influence.
            Provide services to Rossmoor residents and businesses if and when they choose to
            contract with City services or be annexed by the City.

Bike Path (Class I Facility). Provides a completely separated right-of-way designated for the
exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians with minimal interruption by motor vehicles. A bicycle
path may be located on a portion of a street or highway right-of-way or in a special right-of-way
not related to a motor vehicle facility. It may be grade separated or have street crossings at
designated locations. It may be identified with “Bike Route” signs and also may have pavement
markings.
Bike Lane (Class II Facility). Provides a preferential right-of-way designated and striped for the
exclusive or semi-exclusive use of bicycles, with some allowances for vehicle parking. It is
usually located along the edge of the paved area or between the parking lane and the first
motor vehicle travel lane. It is identified by “Bike Lane” or “Bike Route” signage, special lane
lines, and other pavement markings. Bicycles have exclusive use of a bicycle lane for
longitudinal travel, but must share the facility with motor vehicles and pedestrians crossing it.
Bike Route (Class III Facility). Provides a route designated by signs or permanent pavement
markings that is shared with either pedestrians or motorists. There are generally no special lane
markings and bicycle traffic shares the roadway with motor vehicles.
Bikeway, Separated (Class IV Facility). Provides a right-of-way designated exclusively for
bicycle travel adjacent to a roadway and which are protected from vehicular traffic. Types of
separation include, but are not limited to, grade separation, flexible posts, inflexible physical
barriers, or on-street parking. Also referred to as a cycle track or protected bike lane.
Bikeways. Facilities that provide primarily for and promote bicycle travel. Bikeways are
categorized into four classes: Class I, bike path; Class II, bike lane; Class III, bike route; and Class
IV, separated bikeway.
Bond. An interest-bearing promise to pay a stipulated sum of money, with the principal amount
due on a specific date. Funds raised through the sale of bonds can be used for various public
purposes.
Brownfield. An area with abandoned, idle, or under-used industrial and commercial facilities
where expansion, redevelopment, or reuse is complicated by real or perceived environmental
contamination.
Buffer. An area established between potentially conflicting land uses, such as heavy industrial
and residential uses, which, depending on the potential impact, may utilize landscaping, earth
berms, structural barriers, setbacks, or roads to reduce or eliminate potential impacts.
Buildout. Development of land to its full potential, consistent with current or proposed
planning or zoning designations. Full potential may be defined as either: 1) the maximum
density or intensity permitted by planning or zoning designations; or 2) a projected level that is
generally greater than existing conditions but may be less than the maximum level permitted.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                              3

Glossary of Terms and Acronyms                                                         March 2015
Buildout, General Plan. The projected development of land within the General Plan area (City
of Los Alamitos and Rossmoor) by the year 2035, as permitted by the land use designations. The
theoretical buildout was based largely on the assumption that the majority of the City and
Rossmoor would not change. Some incremental intensification was assumed through small
projects (e.g., adding a second dwelling unit or expanding a storefront). A handful of parcels
were identified as areas where more substantial change could occur. For those parcels, the City
created a set of projections and estimated the amount of development that could occur
between now and 2035 (the horizon planning year for the General Plan).
Business Incubator. An organization designed to accelerate the growth and success of
entrepreneurial companies through an array of business support resources and services that
could include physical space, capital, coaching, common services, and networking connections.
Business incubation programs are often sponsored by private companies or municipal entities
and public institutions, such as colleges and universities. Their goal is to help create and grow
young businesses by providing them with necessary support and financial and technical
services.
C
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Legislation and corresponding procedural
components established in 1970 by the State of California to require environmental review for
projects anticipated to result in adverse impacts to the environment.
Capital Improvement Program (CIP). A program that schedules permanent improvements,
usually for a minimum of five years in the future, that fits the projected fiscal capability of the
local jurisdiction. The program generally is reviewed on an annual basis for conformance to and
consistency with the General Plan.
Carbon Dioxide (CO 2 ). An odorless, colorless gas formed during respiration, the combustion of
fuels, and certain industrial activities, among other processes. CO2 is the most abundant
greenhouse gas, with primary sources from transportation and electrical power generation.
Carbon Monoxide (CO). An odorless, colorless gas formed by the incomplete combustion of
fuels; majority of southern California CO emissions come from motor vehicles.
Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC). An ozone-depleting greenhouse gas previously used as a propellant
and a refrigerant.
City Limits. The legal boundaries of the geographical area subject to the jurisdiction of the City
of Los Alamitos government. For example, development applications for properties located
within the city limits must be reviewed by the City.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                         4

Clear Zone. Areas around runways need to be clear from potential hazards to enhance the
safety of the aircraft and its passengers as well as the protection of people and property on the
ground.
Coastal Zone. Refers to the land and water area of the State of California from the Oregon
border to the border of the Republic of Mexico, extending seaward to the state's outer limit of
jurisdiction, including all offshore islands, and extending inland generally 1,000 yards from the
mean high tide line of the sea. In significant coastal estuarine, habitat, and recreational areas it
extends inland to the first major ridgeline paralleling the sea or five miles from the mean high
tide line of the sea, whichever is less, and in developed urban areas the zone generally extends
inland less than 1,000 yards. Although neither Los Alamitos nor Rossmoor are within a coastal
zone, the surrounding cities of Long Beach and Seal Beach are within a coastal zone
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL). The energy-average of the A-weighted sound levels
during a 24-hour period, with 5 dB added to the levels from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM and 10 dB
added from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM.
Compatible. Capable of existing together without conflict or ill effects.
Complete Streets. Streets that comfortably accommodate all users, with particular emphasis
on pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation, as well as people of all ages and physical
abilities. The Complete Streets Act of 2008 requires circulation elements to incorporate
multimodal transportation into the General Plan.
Complete Streets Act. In 2008, the Governor signed Assembly Bill 1358, the California Complete
Streets Act. The Act states: “In order to fulfill the commitment to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, make the most efficient use of urban land and transportation infrastructure, and
improve public health by encouraging physical activity, transportation planners must find
innovative ways to reduce vehicle miles traveled and to shift from short trips in the automobile
to biking, walking and use of public transit.”
The legislation impacts local general plans by adding the following language to Government
Code Section 65302(b)(2)(A) and (B):
(A) Commencing January 1, 2011, upon any substantial revision of the circulation element, the
legislative body shall modify the circulation element to plan for a balanced, multimodal
transportation network that meets the needs of all users of the streets, roads, and highways for
safe and convenient travel in a manner that is suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context
of the general plan.
(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, “users of streets, roads, and highways” means bicyclists,
children, persons with disabilities, motorists, movers of commercial goods, pedestrians, users
of public transportation, and seniors.

Consistency, Consistent With. Free from significant variation or contradiction. The various
diagrams, text, goals, policies, and programs in the general plan must be consistent with each
other, not contradictory or preferential. The term "consistent with" is used interchangeably
with "conformity with." The courts have held that the phrase "consistent with" means
"agreement with; harmonious with." Webster defines "conformity with" as meaning harmony,
agreement when used with "with." The term "conformity" means in harmony therewith or
agreeable to (Sec 58 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 21, 25 [1975]). California State law also requires that a
general plan be internally consistent and also requires consistency between a general plan and
implementation measures such as the zoning ordinance.
Cultural Resources. Includes historic, archaeological, and paleontological resources, as well as
human remains.
Cumulative Impact. As used in CEQA, the total environmental impact resulting from the
accumulated impacts of individual projects or programs over time.

D
Decibel (dB). The unit of measure for loudness based on a logarithmic scale.
Decibel "A-Weighted" (dBA). The “A-weighted” scale for measuring sound in decibels, which
weighs or reduces the effects of low and high frequencies in order to simulate human hearing.
Every increase of 10 dBA doubles the perceived loudness even though the noise is actually ten
times more intense.
Dedication. The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and the
acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the public
function for which it will be used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites, or other public uses
often are made conditions for approval of a development by a city or county.
Density, Residential (dwelling units per acre or du/ac). The number of permanent residential
dwelling units per acre of land. Densities specified in the General Plan are expressed in dwelling
units per net acre (see Acreage, Net).
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                          6

Design Guidelines. A collection of statements and standards used to evaluate building and site
design of proposed development projects through the City’s site plan review process. All
property owners, developers and design professionals are encouraged to carefully review
applicable design guidelines before commencing planning and design studies, and to consult
with City staff should questions or the need for interpretation occur.
Design Review; Development Review. The comprehensive evaluation of a development and its
impact on neighboring properties and the community as a whole, from the standpoint of site
and landscape design, architecture, materials, colors, lighting and signs, in accordance with a
set of adopted criteria and standards. “Development Review” usually refers to a system
established in the Municipal Code, whereby projects are reviewed against certain standards
and criteria by a specially established design review board or other body such as the Planning
Commission.
Development Fees. Direct charges or dedications collected on a one-time basis for a service
provided or as a condition of approval being granted by the local government. The purpose of
the fee or exaction must directly relate to the need created by the development. In addition,
its amount must be proportional to the cost of the service or improvement. Fees can be broken
down into two major classes: 1) service charges such as permit fees covering the cost of
processing development plans, connection or standby fees for installing utilities, or application
fees for reviewing and considering development proposals; and 2) "impact" fees levied on new
development to cover the cost of infrastructure or facilities necessitated by development.
Development Project. A project that involves grading, demolition, construction, remodeling,
subdivision, new signs, or other land improvement or division for which discretionary planning
approvals or building permits are required.
Discourage. To advise or persuade to refrain from.
Downtown. A walkable, human-scaled area where people shop, work, eat, have fun, and spend
quality time with friends and family. People can also live adjacent to or in a downtown area. It
can also be thought of a central business, shopping, and social district. Such an area may also
serve the primary place where the people of Los Alamitos gather to celebrate as a community.
A downtown area may also be referred to as a town center. (See Town Center)
Drought-Tolerant Landscaping. Landscaping that uses water-conserving, drought-tolerant plant
species that are environmentally and horticulturally adapted to local conditions, and that uses
design strategies to minimize water use while maintaining an attractive and neat appearance. It
may also be referred to as xeriscape.
Dwelling Unit (du). A building or portion of a building containing one or more rooms, designed
for or used by one household for living or sleeping purposes, and having a separate bathroom
and only one kitchen or kitchenette.
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                       7

E
Easement. Usually the right to use property owned by another for specific purposes or to gain
access to another property. For example, utility companies often have easements on the
private property of individuals to be able to install and maintain utility facilities.
Encourage. To stimulate or foster a particular condition through direct or indirect action by the
private sector or government agencies.
Endangered Species, California. A native species or sub-species of a bird, mammal, fish,
amphibian, reptile, or plant, which is in serious danger of becoming extinct throughout all or a
significant portion of its range, due to one or more factors, including loss in habitat, change in
habitat, over-exploitation, predation, competition, or disease. The status is determined by the
California Department of Fish and Wildlife together with the California Fish and Game
Commission.
Endangered Species, Federal. A species that is in danger of extinction throughout all, or a
significant portion, of its range. The status is determined by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and
the Department of the Interior.
Enhance. To improve existing conditions by increasing the quantity or quality of beneficial uses
or features.
Environmental Impact Report (EIR). A report required pursuant to the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA) that assesses all the environmental characteristics of an area, determines
what effects or impacts will result if the area is altered or disturbed by a proposed action, and
identifies alternatives or other measures to avoid or reduce those impacts. (See California
Environmental Quality Act)
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Under the National Environmental Policy Act, a
statement on the effect of development proposals and other major actions that significantly
affect the environment. (see National Environmental Policy Act)
Ethos. The distinguishing character, sentiment, moral nature, or guiding beliefs of a person,
group, or institution.
Exaction. A contribution or payment required as an authorized precondition for receiving a
development permit; usually refers to mandatory dedication (or fee in lieu of dedication)
requirements found in many subdivision regulations.
F
Facade. A building “face” or exterior wall of a building, usually, but not always, the front wall,
including all openings and architectural ornamentation, facing a street or public way. The
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                         8

Glossary of Terms and Acronyms                                                             March 2015
facade is often the most important part of a building from an architectural design standpoint,
as it sets the tone for the rest of the building.
Fault. A fracture or zone of closely associated fractures along which rocks on one side have
been displaced with respect to those on the other side. A fault zone is a zone of related faults
which commonly are braided, but which may be branching. A fault trace is the line formed by
the intersection of a fault and the earth’s surface.
Feasible. Capable of being done, executed, or managed successfully from the standpoint of the
physical and/or financial abilities of the implementer(s). It is a term used in policy and
implementation action language that indicates that a decision or action is not mandatory, but
should be taken unless one can demonstrate an inability or undue hardship. It should be noted
that just because an action or feature is new (i.e., not typically done), or requires some
additional expense does not meant that it is infeasible.
Financial Sustainability. The assessment that the city and/or a project will have sufficient funds
to meet all its resource and financing obligations over a long period of time (e.g., 20 years),
whether these funds come from user charges or budget sources.
Fiscal Impact Analysis. A projection of the direct public costs and revenues resulting from
population, employment, or facility change in the jurisdiction. Such an analysis enables local
governments to evaluate relative fiscal merits of general plans, specific plans, or projects.
Flood, 100-year. In any given year, a flood that has a 1 percent likelihood of occurring, and is
recognized as a standard for acceptable risk. A 100-year flood event is fairly large but
historically infrequent flood. To be precise, it is a flood of a size that is projected to have only a
one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded each year. However, this does not mean that
this size of flood will only occur once every 100 years. The likelihood of a 100-year flood
occurring within a 100-year stretch of time is actually high, but there is no way to predict when
the next flood will occur—or the one after that.
Floodplain. The relatively level land area on either side of the banks of a stream regularly
subject to flooding.
Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The intensity of building on a site reflects a combination of a building’s
height, lot coverage, and overall massing distribution. To ensure that the building intensity of a
project is appropriate for the land use designation and community, a maximum intensity
standard is provided in the form of a floor area ratio (FAR). For example, a 60,000 square foot
building on a 120,000 square-foot parcel would have a 0.50 FAR. In the General Plan, the FAR
calculation excludes floor area used for structured parking to encourage its use and reflect its
much higher construction costs.
Form-Based Codes. A method of regulating development to achieve specific urban form.
Form-based codes use clear, graphic-based standards to address the relationship between

building facades and the public realm, the form, mass and scale of buildings in relation to one
another and the aesthetic character of buildings, urban spaces, streets and blocks.
G
Gateway. Gateways are entry points into key areas, typically a point along a roadway at which
a motorist gains a sense of having left the environs of one place and of having entered another
place. Gateways should be distinctive and attractive.
General Plan. A compendium of City policies regarding its long-term development, in the form
of maps and accompanying text. The General Plan is a legal document required of each local
agency by the State of California Government Code Section 65301 and adopted by the City
Council. California State law requires that a General Plan include elements dealing with seven
subjects--circulation, conservation, housing, land use, noise, open space and safety.
These can be arranged in a single element for each topic or combined into elements that
address multiple topics. For Los Alamitos, an element on growth management is also required
to ensure consistency with countywide plans, to be eligible for Measure M and M2 funding, and
to receive state gasoline tax revenues. The City’s General Plan also includes an optional element
on economic development.
General Plan Amendment (GPA). A modification made to an adopted General Plan.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). A combination of approaches, programs,
methodologies, and technologies to gather, store, manipulate, analyze, present, and interpret
spatial information and data.
Goal. A goal is a statement of desired future conditions, regarding a particular topic in the

time-dependent or more abstract in nature.
Green Building. Green or sustainable building is the practice of creating healthier and more
resource-efficient models of construction, renovation, operation, maintenance, and demolition.
Greenhouse Effect. A term used to describe the warming of the earth’s atmosphere due to
accumulated carbon dioxide and other gases in the upper atmosphere. These gases absorb
energy radiated from the earth’s surface, “trapping” it in the same manner as glass in a
greenhouse traps heat.
Greenhouse Gas (GHG). A balance of naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere determines
the earth’s climate by trapping solar heat through a phenomenon known as the greenhouse
effect. GHGs, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and water
vapor, keep solar radiation from exiting our atmosphere. In a process very similar to the
windows on a greenhouse, GHGs trap so much heat that the temperature within the earth’s
atmosphere is rising. GHGs are emitted through both natural processes and human activities.

J
Jobs/Housing Balance. A ratio expressed as the jobs in an area divided by the number of
dwelling units or households. It may be used to describe the adequacy of the housing supply
within a defined area to meet the needs of persons working within the same area. Due to the
wide geographic distribution of job opportunities in Southern California, it is generally
considered by local and regional planning agencies to be informative when looking at a
subregion or region. However it should not be relied upon for making decisions at a local level
within a single jurisdiction.
K

merger of districts with cities. Each county’s LAFCO is empowered to approve, disapprove, or
conditionally approve such proposals.
Local Coastal Program (LCP). Planning tool used by local governments to guide development in
the coastal zone, in partnership with the Coastal Commission. LCPs contain the ground rules for
future development and protection of coastal resources. LCPs specify appropriate location,
type, and scale of new or changed uses of land and water. The LCP includes a land use plan and
measures to implement the plan (such as zoning ordinances). Prepared by local government,
these programs govern decisions that determine the short- and long-term conservation and use
of coastal resources. Although neither Los Alamitos nor Rossmoor are within a coastal zone, the
surrounding cities of Long Beach and Seal Beach are within a coastal zone and maintain an LCP.

Mixed Use. The concept of mixed use essentially stands in contrast with single use
development. Whereas a single family residential zoning district generally permits only single
family homes, schools, and religious buildings, a mixed use district permits a wider variety of
residential and nonresidential land uses in the same area --- much as you see in walkable town
centers in older suburbs and cities.
Mixed use development is intended to provide for more walkable and dynamic areas in the city,
such as the proposed town center. Mixed use development can also foster more direct and
convenient pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular access between residences and businesses.
Additionally, in a built out city like Los Alamitos that lack significant amounts of vacant land,
mixed use can support higher intensity uses and bring new types of land uses and
opportunities.
The term mixed use can refer to many different types of land use combinations, depending on
the context. Examples are described below.
On the same parcel. Any mixture of dwellings and commercial land uses on a single parcel, such
as dwellings combined with offices, retail, or other non-residential uses. A common example is
a single building with retail stores on the ground floor and residential units on the upper floors.
On multiple parcels. Mixed use can also refer to multiple buildings with different uses on
multiple parcels where the different types of land uses are in proximity and planned as a
unified, complementary, and cohesive whole.
As a land use designation. A mixed use land use designation or zoning district permits a variety
of uses in a particular area. This mix of uses may take place in a single building, on a single
parcel, or in multiple buildings and multiple parcels. For example, a mixed use land use
designation may allow an office building to be built next to a retail store. It could also permit a
single building with both residential and nonresidential uses next to a group of townhomes.
In contrast, a single use land use designation or zone permits only one primary type of
development. For example, the R-1 (Single Family) Residential zoning district permits single-
family dwellings on individual parcels and planned-unit development with no mixed or
incompatible uses.
Mixed Use, Horizontal. Mixed use, horizontal: Two or more different types of uses are placed
next to each other, planned as a unit, and connected together with pedestrian and vehicular
access. For instance, multiple family building that is adjacent to a neighborhood commercial
development and office complex. This may take place on a single parcel or multiple parcels.
Mixed Use, Vertical. Where two or more different uses occupy the same building—usually on
different floors. For instance, retail on the ground floor and office and/or residential uses on
the second and/or third floors. Projects may also include a combination of vertically- and
horizontally-mixed uses in one or more buildings and on one or more parcels.
Modal Shift. The percent change in the number of trips made within, or originating from, a
specific geographic area during a defined period and using specific transportation methods or
Los Alamitos General Plan                                                                        15

“modes”, such as cycling, walking, riding public transit and driving automobiles. For example, a
modal shift increase of 15 percent in bicycle use means that the number of bicycle trips in an
area increased 15 percent over a previous period.
Multimodal Network: A transportation network that is designed and or operated in a manner
that meets transportation needs for different types of users, such as bicyclists, pedestrians,
public transit users, and motorists.
Multimodal Transportation. Refers to multiple modes of transportation, including, but not
limited to pedestrian, bicycle, automobile, or transit forms of travel.

contours are drawn similar to a topographic map.
Noise-Sensitive Use or Sensitive Land Use. A location where people reside or where the
presence of unwanted sound could adversely affect land use. Sensitive land uses include
schools, hospitals, senior housing and convalescent facilities, residential uses, places of
worship, libraries, and passive outdoor recreation areas.
Non-Conforming Use. A land use, structure, or parcel that was lawful before the adoption or
amendment of the Zoning Code, but that would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted
differently under the terms of the current Zoning Code or future amendments. (See Chapter
17.64, Nonconforming Uses and Structures of the Los Alamitos Municipal Code)

Specific Plan. Under Article 8 of the Government Code (Section 65450 et seq), a legal tool for
detailed design and implementation of a defined portion of the area covered by a General Plan.
A specific plan may include all detailed regulations, conditions, programs, and/or proposed
legislation which may be necessary or convenient for the systematic implementation of any
General Plan element(s). The contents are similar to those of a general plan except they will be
more comprehensive with respect to utilities and public facilities and their funding.
If a specific plan essentially provides more detailed policy guidance, it is a “policy” level plan
and is adopted by resolution. If it establishes development regulation, it is a “regulatory”
specific plan and becomes customized zoning for the affected property, and is adopted by
ordinance.
Sphere of Influence (SOI). The probable, ultimate physical boundaries and service area of the
city, as determined by the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) of the county. For Los
Alamitos, this includes the unincorporated community of Rossmoor.

the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
Town Center. A walkable, human-scaled area where people shop, work, eat, have fun, and
spend quality time with friends and family. People can also live adjacent to or in a downtown
area. It can also be thought of a central business, shopping, and social district. Such an area
may also serve the primary place where the people of Los Alamitos gather to celebrate as a
community. A town center area may also be referred to as a downtown. (See Downtown)
Note that there are many shopping areas (from small strip centers to large shopping malls) that
use the term “town center” or “town square” in their name. This should not be confused with
the City’s desire to create a more traditional town center or downtown area as described
above.
Traffic Calming. Measures designed to reduce motor vehicle speeds and to encourage
pedestrian use, including but not limited to:
    •   Narrow streets
