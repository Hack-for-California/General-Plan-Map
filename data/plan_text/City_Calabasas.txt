                          2030 General Plan
I.      INTRODUCTION
The Calabasas General Plan represents the City's comprehensive effort to define what
makes Calabasas a special place, delineate a vision for its future, and formulate action-
oriented programs to achieve that future. The Plan functions as a blueprint that defines
not only how the City will evolve through 2030, but the steps the community will take to
make this vision a reality.
Calabasas is located in western Los Angeles County along the heavily traveled Ventura
Freeway, approximately 25 miles from downtown Los Angeles. Neighboring cities
include Los Angeles, Agoura Hills, and Hidden Hills. A portion of the City's northern
boundary also borders Ventura County. As of 2014, the City of Calabasas' corporate
boundaries encompassed approximately 13.8 square miles, or 8,804 acres of land.
The City’s 2013 population is estimated at 23,802. In addition, the General Plan
addresses unincorporated areas surrounding the City that may be considered for future
annexation. As of 2014, these unincorporated areas total about 3.2 square miles
(2,022 acres) and include residential neighborhoods, commercial areas, open space,
and a public school. Planning boundaries are shown on Figure I-1.
I.A     General Plan Background
History of Planning in Calabasas
Prior to incorporation, Calabasas was an unincorporated community governed by the
County of Los Angeles. The formation of the city in 1991represented an effort by local
residents to exercise local control of the community’s future. Among the original goals
of incorporation were placement of greater emphasis on environmental protection and
design compatibility, and creation of transitions between urban and rural land uses.
Calabasas adopted its first General Plan in 1995. That plan, which was the result of a
four-year planning effort, established three dominant themes for the community: (1)
environmental responsibility; (2) local management and control; and (3) community
image. The plan included all elements required by California General Plan law, but
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS
                                             I-1

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
I.       INTRODUCTION
organized the elements in a somewhat non-traditional format. In addition, unlike most
general plans, the document was accompanied by a General Plan Implementation Guide
that included specific performance standards for new development in the community.
This guide was needed at the time because the City did not yet have its own
development code.
The City subsequently adopted a municipal code in 1998. At that point, the City had
two documents containing development standards with which to implement the General
Plan – the General Plan Implementation Guide and the Calabasas Development Code.
The two documents were generally in agreement, but certain inconsistencies between
the two documents created uncertainties as to how General Plan policies were to be
implemented. Therefore, a goal of the 2030 General Plan is to eliminate the
Implementation Guide and incorporate the principles and standards from the
Implementation Guide into an updated development code.
Genesis of the 2030 General Plan
The preparation of the 2030 General Plan involved an approximately 21-month process
involving the City Council and Planning Commission, a General Plan Advisory Committee
(GPAC) made up of 20 individuals representing broad segments of the community, key
community stakeholders, City and consultant staff, and the public at large. The
extensive public involvement process for developing the General Plan included:
    x   Establishment of the GPAC by the City Council
    x   A series of 17 meetings with the GPAC to obtain input on the issues of
        concern and preferred approaches to resolving these issues
    x   Two public workshops to gather input from the community on the direction
        of the plan
    x   A two-day visioning charrette where public input was gathered and a series
        of concepts for land use and parks were developed for key areas of the
        community
    x   A communitywide telephone survey to gauge community opinion regarding a
        range of issues relevant to the General Plan
    x   A 4th of July booth providing information about the General Plan update and
        gathering community input on the General Plan
    x   Development and maintenance of a web page providing information to the
        community about the General Plan process and work products
                                                                       CITY of CALABASAS

I.B      Nature and Purpose of the General Plan
The Calabasas General Plan functions as a guide to the type of community that
Calabasas citizens desire for their future and provides the means by which that desired
future can be achieved. The General Plan is a "constitution" for local decision making
that addresses the range of immediate, mid-, and long-term issues with which the
community is concerned, including but not limited to environmental sensitivity and
preservation, public services, and economic vitality. The Plan is intended to allow land
use and policy determinations to be made within a comprehensive framework that
incorporates public health, safety, and "quality of life" considerations in a manner that
recognizes the resource limitations and the fragility of the community's natural
environment.
According to the State guidelines for the preparation of general plans, the role of the
General Plan is to establish a document that will "...act as a 'constitution' for
development, the foundation upon which all land use decisions are to be based. It
expresses community development goals and embodies public policy relative to the
distribution of future land use, both public and private" (General Plan Guidelines, 2003).
As further mandated by the State, the General Plan must serve to:
    x    Identify land use, circulation, environmental, economic, and social goals and
         policies for the City and its surrounding planning area as they relate to land
         use and development;
    x    Provide a framework within which the City's Planning Commission and City
         Council can make land use decisions;
    x    Provide citizens the opportunity to participate in the planning and decision-
         making process affecting the City and its surrounding planning area; and
    x    Inform citizens, developers, decision-makers, and other agencies, as
         appropriate, of the City's basic rules which will guide both environmental
         protection and land development decisions within the City and surrounding
         planning area.
State law requires that the General Plan include seven mandatory elements, but allows
flexibility in how each local jurisdiction structures these elements. The general contents
of the seven state-mandated elements are described on the following page.
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
I.      INTRODUCTION
                          Mandated General Plan Elements
       The LAND USE ELEMENT designates the general distribution and
         intensity of uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space,
         education, public buildings and grounds, waste disposal facilities, and
         other categories of public and private use.
       The CIRCULATION ELEMENT is correlated with the land use element,
         and identifies the general location and extent of existing and proposed
         major thorough-fares, transportation routes, terminals, and other local
         public utilities and facilities.
       The HOUSING ELEMENT is a comprehensive assessment of current
         and projected housing needs for all economic segments of the community.
         It embodies policy for providing adequate housing and includes action
         programs.
       The CONSERVATION ELEMENT addresses the conservation,
         management, and use of natural resources, including water, soils,
         biological habitats, and mineral deposits.
       The OPEN SPACE ELEMENT details programs for preserving open
         space for natural resource protection, the managed production of
         resources, outdoor recreation, and protection of public healthy and safety.
       The NOISE ELEMENT identifies and appraised noise problems within
         the community and forms the basis for land use distribution.
       The SAFETY ELEMENT establishes policies and programs to protect
         the community from risk associated with seismic, geologic, flood, and fire
         hazards.
The Calabasas General Plan also includes four elements beyond those required by State
law. These include:
    x  Community Design: This element establishes policies and programs relating
       to the overall design of the community, including guidelines relating to
       architectural design, building height and massing, and landscaping.
    x  Parks, Recreation, and Trails: This element establishes policies and
       programs for the maintenance and enhancement of municipal parks,
       recreational services, and trails.
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS
                                              I-6

                                                                        CITY OF CALABASAS
                                                                       2030 GENERAL PLAN
                                                                    I.      INTRODUCTION
    x   Cultural Resources: This element establishes policies and programs relating
        to the preservation of existing cultural resources within the community and
        development of cultural amenities that community residents desire.
    x   Services, Infrastructure, and Technology: This element establishes policies
        and programs relating to municipal and education services, water, sewer,
        and storm drain facilities, and technological infrastructure and development.
Though not mandated by State law, these General Plan elements have the same force
and effect as the elements required by the State.
I.C     Internal General Plan Consistency: Competing Objectives
In addition to providing a comprehensive view of the community's future physical,
social, and economic environments, general plans must be internally consistent. In
order to function as a useful statement of local policy, the various components of the
General Plan need to "comprise an integrated, internally consistent and compatible
statement of policies for the adopting agency" (Government Code, Section 65300.5).
The following factors must be considered with respect to internal consistency:
    x   Equal Status Among General Plan Elements - All elements of the General Plan
        have equal legal status. Because no element is legally subordinate to
        another, the General Plan must resolve potential conflicts between or among
        the elements through clear language and policy consistency.
    x   Consistency Between Elements and Within Individual Elements - All General
        Plan elements must be consistent with one other. Any individual provision of
        the General Plan should not require the City to take an action prohibited by
        another General Plan provision. In addition, the assumptions and vision
        used to create individual portions of the General Plan need to be uniform and
        consistent.
    x   General Plan Text and Diagram Consistency - Because General Plan text and
        diagrams are both integral parts of the General Plan, they must be consistent
        with each another. Thus, the diagrams of the General Plan are intended to
        be a graphic reflection of the General Plan text.
    x   Competing Objectives – Although the General Plan must be internally
        consistent, it is important to recognize that community objectives are
        sometimes inherently in conflict. Therefore, blind pursuit of one objective
        may, in some cases, inhibit the achievement of other community objectives.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS
                                             I-7

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
I.       INTRODUCTION
        For example, the Calabasas General Plan recognizes the need to minimize
        water consumption in light of limited water resources. However, to eliminate
        watering of sites being graded for permitted development or eliminate
        landscape irrigation may conflict with objectives relating to maintenance of
        air quality or community design and beautification. Thus, when
        implementing the General Plan, decisionmakers must strike a balance
        between competing objectives, recognizing that all objectives cannot be fully
        implemented all the time.
I.D     General Plan Format & Organization
The Calabasas General Plan is organized into 13 chapters, which include this
Introduction, 11 General Plan elements, and a chapter describing General Plan
implementation programs. An appendix describing policy terms used in the Plan is also
included, as is a glossary. The 11 General Plan elements encompass all of the elements
required by California General Plan law as well as several optional elements. The
content of each of the 13 General Plan chapters is summarized below.
The Introduction (Chapter I) provides an introduction to the community of Calabasas,
the overall General Plan document, and an overview of Calabasas' vision for the future.
The Land Use Element (Chapter II) details Calabasas' program to manage its physical
environment, and meets State requirements for the Land Use Element. Land use
objectives, general plan approaches, and policies are presented. In addition, Chapter II
delineates the land use districts presented on the General Plan Land Use Map. The land
use districts define acceptable land uses throughout the General Plan study area as well
as allowable development intensities for each defined use.
The Open Space Element (Chapter III) details Calabasas' commitment to preserving open
space in and around the City. It also identifies additional areas that the City may wish to
set aside as open space and describes methods by which the City will manage hillside
areas and associated resources.
The Conservation Element (Chapter IV) describes Calabasas' program to manage its
natural environment. The primary objective of this element is to define environmental
features within the plan area and provide each feature with an appropriate level of
protection. With the exception of cultural resources (covered in the Cultural Resources
Element in Chapter XI), this element meets State requirements for conservation
elements. Specifically, the Conservation Element covers the following issues:
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS
                                            I-8
                                                                         CITY OF CALABASAS
                                                                        2030 GENERAL PLAN
                                                                     I.      INTRODUCTION
    x   Biotic Resources                             x   Energy Resources
    x   Air Quality                                  x   Solid Waste Management
    x   Water Resources                              x   Mineral Resources
    x   Soil Conservation and Preservation
The Housing Element (Chapter V) presents Calabasas' commitment to provide housing
opportunities to meet the needs of all economic segments of the community, and to
ensure the continued high quality of the City's housing stock. This element contains the
following components.
    x   Housing Needs - summarizes existing and projected needs for housing for
        all economic segments of the community, including new construction needs
        and particularly the needs of such groups as the handicapped, the elderly,
        large families, female-headed households, and the homeless
    x   Opportunities for the Creation of New Housing - examines the inventory of
        land that is available to meet identified needs for new housing construction
    x   Constraints on the Production of Housing - explores governmental and non-
        governmental obstacles that need to be overcome if the City of Calabasas is
        to meet its housing needs
    x   Housing Goals, Quantified Objectives, Programs, and Specific Actions -
        outlines the specifics of Calabasas' housing improvement program for the
        years 2014 to 2021
The Circulation Element (Chapter VI) outlines the City's program to provide mobility
within the General Plan study area. This element addresses motor vehicle, bicycle, and
pedestrian circulation, as well as parking issues. A major thrust of this element is to
ensure that roadways and transportation facilities support, rather than lead, the type of
community which Calabasas wishes to maintain. Thus, environmental considerations
have been incorporated into the Circulation Element and recommendations to increase
the traffic carrying capacity of the area's roadway system were designed to recognize
and protect significant environmental features.
The Safety Element (Chapter VII) addresses the relationship between natural and
manmade hazards and existing and future development. Key features of this element
are the definition of "acceptable risk" and identification of the extent to which natural
and manmade hazards will be managed in order to protect public health and safety.
The Safety Element meets State requirements and addresses the following specific
topics:
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

The Noise Element (Chapter VIII) identifies existing and projected future noise sources
and levels throughout the City. It also provides policies and standards to limit noise
exposure. The Noise Element meets the requirements of State General Plan law.
The Community Design Element (Chapter IX) establishes policies and programs relating
to the overall design of the community, including guidelines relating to architectural
design, building height and massing, and landscaping. This is an optional element that
is not mandated by State General Plan law.
The Parks, Recreation, & Trails Element (Chapter X) identifies recreational needs and
establishes policies and programs for the maintenance and enhancement of municipal
parks, recreational services, and trails. This is an optional element that is not mandated
by State General Plan law.
The Cultural Resources Element (Chapter XI) identifies community cultural resources and
establishes policies and programs relating to the preservation of existing cultural
resources within the community as well as development of cultural amenities that
community residents desire. This is an optional element that is not mandated by State
General Plan law.
The Services, Infrastructure, and Technology Element (Chapter XII) establishes policies
and programs relating to municipal and education services, water, sewer, and storm
drain facilities, and technological infrastructure and development. This is an optional
element that is not mandated by State General Plan law.
General Plan Implementation Programs (Chapter XIII) defines the specific programs and
actions that the City will undertake to ensure implementation of its General Plan goals,
objectives, approach, and policies.
I.E     Community Vision
The Calabasas General Plan is intended to provide a vehicle for maintaining the
community qualities that make Calabasas a desirable place to live while facilitating
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS
                                             I-10
                                                                         CITY OF CALABASAS
                                                                        2030 GENERAL PLAN
                                                                     I.      INTRODUCTION
limited changes that will further enhance the quality of life that Calabasas residents
enjoy. Keys to maintaining the desirability of Calabasas are:
    x    Protection of the natural environment that attracted many residents to the
         area;
    x    Managing municipal affairs in a manner that is consistent with local social
         values; and
    x    Enhancing the physical appearance of the community’s built environment.
Calabasas is located in a beautiful natural setting that the community intends to protect
for the enjoyment of future generations. The current density of population within the
community is low to moderate and continuation of this characteristic is a key part of
Calabasas' vision. In recognition of the importance of retaining the characteristics that
make Calabasas a special place, the General Plan is strongly oriented toward protecting
the natural environment and managing the manmade environment, thereby ensuring
that future development occurs in a manner that is consistent with local community
values.
The General Plan provides a long-term action agenda to follow in achieving the vision of
Calabasas residents, which is expressed in three dominant themes:
    x   Environmental Responsibility – preservation/enhancement of natural
        resources and living within the limits imposed by available resources
    x   Community Character – protection of Calabasas’ special character
    x   Quality of Life – maintaining an outstanding quality of life for Calabasas
        residents
Environmental Responsibility
Maintenance of a high quality of life is dependent upon a high quality environment.
Thus, the area's natural environment is invariably cited as the key to Calabasas'
desirability and preservation of open space is generally cited as the community's
number one priority. Protecting the area's remaining natural hillsides, ridgelines, and
significant habitat areas, as well as preserving remaining open lands in their natural
state, are important concerns of area residents.
Calabasas' view of environmental issues is broad, extending beyond the City's
immediate physical environment to such issues as water resource conservation, solid
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

waste management, night sky and glare considerations, air quality, and energy
conservation. This broad view of the environment also extends geographically, and is
reflected in the community's participation in regional planning and visioning programs,
including programs that only indirectly affect the City of Calabasas.
Environmental Responsibility Goals
1.   Recognize that the area’s natural environment is a critical community asset.
2.   Place the highest priority on protection and stewardship of designated open space
     and acquisition of additional land for designation as open space.
3.   Minimize the environmental impacts of development, including impacts to
     landscape and viewsheds, through excellent community and project design.
4.   Minimize the environmental impacts of City activities by making environmental
     sensitivity a key consideration in the provision of municipal services and facilities.
5.   Become a municipal role model in addressing global environmental issues.
Community Character
Because no two sites or neighborhoods are exactly alike, working with nature does more
than protect the inherent environmental or visual value of natural resources. It can also
give developers and site planners greater opportunities to create built environments of a
higher quality, with a more distinctive local identity, and with reduced impacts on the
region as a whole. As such, working with nature is an important complement to another
priority - ensuring that the built environments themselves are of the highest possible
quality. This is the focus of the community character theme.
The community character theme in Calabasas has many components. Foremost is the
community's identification with the area's natural environment and remaining open
lands, which is also discussed as part of the environmental responsibility theme. Other
components involve the maintenance of existing established neighborhoods and
enhancement of specific local areas to improve the overall image of the community.
Community Character Goals
1.   Provide guidelines for public and private development that recognize, maintain,
     and enhance the scenic beauty afforded by Calabasas’ natural environment.
2.   Define and preserve the character of established residential neighborhoods.
3.   Facilitate appropriately-scaled infill development in existing commercial districts.

5.   Provide a balanced transportation system that facilitates a variety of ways to move

Quality of Life
No single definition of “quality of life” applies universally as the term means very
different things to different people. Nevertheless, the citizens of Calabasas have
defined a number of specific goals for enhancing the overall quality of life in the
community. These goals complement the environmental responsibility and community
character goals listed above to identify the keys to maintaining a high quality of life in
Calabasas.
Quality of Life Goals
1.   Encourage a high level of citizen involvement in shaping the community’s future.
2.   Provide municipal infrastructure and services that are responsive to the
     community’s needs and priorities.
3.   Preserve and enhance areas of visual, cultural, historical, archaeological, and urban
     design significance.
4.   Provide recreational and cultural activities and facilities that meet community needs
     and preferences.
5.   Provide for a variety of housing types that meet the needs of Calabasas citizens in
     a manner consistent with the City’s environmental responsibility and community
     character goals.
6.   Facilitate high quality economic development that meets the community’s
     employment and service needs in a manner consistent with the City’s
     environmental responsibility and community character goals.

                           2030 General Plan
II.       LAND USE ELEMENT
The Land Use Element of the General Plan establishes Calabasas' vision and fundamental
land use philosophy, including directing development to the most suitable locations,
and maintaining the environmental, social, physical, and economic health and vitality of
the area. The Element therefore focuses on the organization of the community's
physical environment into logical, functional, and visually pleasing patterns that are
consistent with local social values. Of primary concern are the type, intensity, location,
and character of land uses that will be permitted in the future.
Calabasas' land use pattern is well established and is not intended to change over time.
Future growth will primarily consist of infill development, and minor extension of rural
residential development at the edge of the urban area. Nevertheless, as development
occurs, the City will continue to face significant challenges. Calabasas' natural setting
and significant environmental features need to be protected and preserved, and at the
same time, private property rights must be recognized and respected.
It is the goal of the Land Use Element to:
 Direct the amount and location of land uses in conformance with environmental
     carrying capacities and the other goals of the General Plan.
 Within the constraints of these carrying capacities, provide a distribution of land
     uses that maintains, yet also enhances the environmental, social, physical, and
     economic well-being of Calabasas.
II.A Municipal Boundaries
Objective
Maintain and adjust City boundaries in a manner that encompasses the entire Calabasas
community and that provides for rational management of the area's natural
environment.

General Plan Approach
The central concept of Calabasas' approach to the possible extension of its present
boundaries is to emphasize the following:
     x   Defining those areas that have traditional social and cultural ties to
         Calabasas, and which are generally considered to be part of the community
         of Calabasas
     x   Identifying lands that have a
                                                     Annexations to Calabasas must be
         significant physical and/or
                                               approved by the Los Angeles County Local

California annexation law requires the consent of landowners within uninhabited areas,
and of registered voters within inhabited areas, in order to permit lands to be annexed
into a city. The wide variation in the circumstances of unincorporated lands
surrounding Calabasas necessitates different approaches to annexation policy in
different areas.
It is not the intent of the City to offer increases in the planned development intensity of
unincorporated lands as an inducement for landowners to annex property into the City
of Calabasas. For the most part, land uses in the areas being considered for future
annexation would not be expected to change upon annexation. The one exception is
the Craftsman’s Corner area north of the Ventura Freeway and generally east of Parkway
Calabasas. This area is within the City of Hidden Hills’ sphere of influence (SOI) and
would therefore need to be removed from the Hidden Hills SOI and included within the
Calabasas SOI prior to any annexation of that area. If annexed in the future, that area
may be contemplated for a mix of residential and non-residential uses, possibly
including a performing arts venue or other similar facility. For those properties not
                                                                              CITY of CALABASAS

already located within Calabasas’ corporate boundaries, the land use designations
shown on the General Plan Land Use Map (F    Figure II-1, page II-17) are those that the City
of Calabasas intends to apply upon annexation. Previously unforeseen annexation
opportunities involving properties not indicated on Figure II-1 may arise from time to
time and the City may consider such annexations as appropriate. Such consideration
shall require an amendment to the General Plan.
Policies
II- 1   Work with residents and landowners of the unincorporated areas contemplated
        for annexation to determine whether any interest exists in these communities
        for annexation to the City of Calabasas.
II-2    Facilitate future annexations by coordinating the definition of sphere of
        influence boundaries with surrounding cities.
II-3    Pursue annexation of those areas where residents (in inhabited areas) or
        landowners (in uninhabited areas) desire to become part of the City of
        Calabasas.
II-4    Specifically pursue annexation of the Craftsman’s Corner area in unincorporated
        Los Angeles County, north of the Ventura Freeway and east of Parkway
        Calabasas. Within this area, facilitate a mix of commercial, institutional, and
        residential uses, potentially with a focus on creative and/or performing arts.
II-5    Require annexation proposals to demonstrate a positive relationship between
        City facility and service costs and the revenues that will be generated
        subsequent to annexation with the exception of areas to be annexed for the
        purpose of parks, schools, open space, and other public facilities.
II-6    Oppose the creation of any other urban entities where such entities would have
        a negative impact on Calabasas.
II-7    For any annexation territory, all vested entitlements shall be recognized and
        retained by the City upon annexation, unless otherwise revised by mutual
        agreement of the City and the affected property owners, such that any revisions
        to vested entitlements will result in improved development patterns and
        conditions having less environmental impact. Because previously vested
        projects may not be fully consistent with the provisions of this General Plan,
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

          modifications to such projects may be found consistent with the General Plan if
          the following criteria are met:
          x   The overall density/intensity of the modified project is no greater than that
              of the vested project;
          x   The modified project will not result in any environmental impacts greater
              than those which would have resulted from the vested project; and
          x   The modified project achieves a substantially greater degree of consistency
              with the policies and objectives of the General Plan and complies more fully
              with the standards and requirements of the Development Code than the
              vested project.
II.B Community Structure
Objectives
 Maintain Calabasas as a predominantly residential community with commercial,
     office, and business park uses playing a secondary, supporting role.
 Maintain a well-designed, high quality, and functional mix of open space, urban and
     rural residential, and supporting commercial and business park land uses which
     reflects local community values and integrates the resolution of other general plan
     issues into a cohesive pattern.
General Plan Approach
Calabasas' vision is to continue to be a low intensity, primarily residential community
nestled in a natural environmental setting. In general, urban development will not
extend beyond the areas that are now developed or designated for urban development.
Rural residential uses will be located at the fringe of the urban area, transitioning into
primarily open space uses with widely scattered home sites. Thus, consistent with Los
Angeles County’s Santa Monica Mountains North Area Plan and Local Coastal Plan, it is
the City's vision that the rural, open character of lands to the south of existing urban
development and approved urban density projects be preserved, including lands along
Las Virgenes Road south of Lost Hills Road and lands along Mulholland Highway west of
Old Topanga Canyon.
Low intensity rural residential and open space designations have been provided on the
General Plan Land Use Map to recognize those areas that have already been committed
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

                                                                        2030 GENERAL PLAN
                                                                II.      LAND USE ELEMENT
to those uses, as well as to ensure that the intensity of future residential development is
compatible with local social values and the significance and sensitivity of the area's
natural environment. It is the City's vision that any new development occurring within
these rural and undeveloped areas fit in with, rather than replace, the area's existing
natural environment.
Land uses within Old Town and adjacent areas to the west along Calabasas Road up to
Parkway Calabasas will continue to emphasize a pedestrian-oriented mix of retail and
office uses. It is the City's desire to recreate the character of the traditional small town's
"downtown" within this area, emphasizing the area's function as a community gathering
place. Thus, the combination of individual developments within and adjacent to Old
Town along Calabasas Road should provide a variety of plazas, as well as indoor and
outdoor gathering areas that are accessible to the public. Old Town will retain its
unique character and continue to provide restaurant and specialty commercial uses.
Enhancement of the area's western character will continue to be undertaken in
accordance with the Old Town Master Plan and Design Guidelines.
Calabasas Road will retain its current urban character between Old Town and Parkway
Calabasas. The City's vision is that future redevelopment of lands along both sides of
Calabasas Road with a mix of office, retail, and residential uses would complement the
uses planned for Old Town Calabasas and provide the impetus for creating the
pedestrian-oriented "city center" and gathering place that is desired.
The current mix of uses along the north side of the Ventura Freeway, from the Parkway
Calabasas interchange to the westerly City limits, will generally be retained, though the
area northeast and southeast of the Mureau Road/Las Virgenes Road intersection, which
is currently developed with business park uses, may transition to a mix of office, retail,
and multi-family residential uses. The City's vision for commercial development along
Calabasas Road between Parkway Calabasas and Mureau Road is for low key commercial
uses that are compatible with the area's biological sensitivity, and that will not dominate
views of natural oak studded hillsides from the Ventura Freeway.
Natural hillsides will continue to dominate the Ventura Freeway corridor west to the Las
Virgenes Road interchange. The office/business park uses in the northeast quadrant of
the interchange may gradually transition to a mix of office, retail, and multi-family
residential uses that create a village ambiance. Development of the northwest quadrant
will be limited to the lower portions of the hillside so as preserve the existing oak
woodlands, and not dominate views from the Ventura Freeway. Freeway-oriented
commercial uses will continue in the southern quadrants of the Las Virgenes
                                                                            CITY of CALABASAS

interchange, focusing on urban design improvements to reduce the visual clutter
created by a proliferation of driveways and signs. New commercial development and
residential development may occur along the east side of Las Virgenes Road at Agoura
Road. The Agoura Road corridor, currently dominated by suburban-scaled office and
business park uses will gradually transition to a mix of office, retail, and residential uses
that creates a strong “sense of place.”
The planned mixed uses along Agoura Road will transition to the existing business park
uses west of Lost Hills Road. Business park uses will extend west along Agoura Road
and the southerly freeway frontage to the western city limits. Commercial retail uses
will be located at the northwest corner of the Agoura Road/Lost Hills Road intersection.
Policies
II-8     Emphasize retention of Calabasas' natural environmental setting, neighborhood
         character, and scenic features as a priority over the expansion of urban areas.

         housing types that:
         x  Are visually attractive and compatible in intensity, dwelling unit size, and

            future residents.
II-11    Promote a mix of retail and service commercial, office, and business park areas
         that:
         x  Meet the retail and service needs of Calabasas citizens;
         x  Contribute to a sound local economic base; and
         x  Are visually attractive and compatible in number, intensity, building scale,
            and architectural design with the community's natural environment and
            character.

      network of protected areas with a high degree of continuity and a systematic
      order of purposes, including resource conservation, recreation, and protection
      of public safety.

      and General Plan Land Use Districts table (T  Table II-1) if the proposed project is
      consistent with General Plan goals, objectives, approaches, and relevant policies
      and performance standards. Development intensities greater than the basic
      development intensity outlined in Table II-1 may be permitted, up to the

II.C General Plan Land Use Districts
Table II-1 outlines the various districts that are delineated on the Calabasas General
Plan Land Use Map (F  Figure II-1). Three levels of land use are designated. At the
broadest level, urban land uses are distinguished from non-urban and open space uses.
At the second level, urban land uses are organized into Residential, Business, Mixed Use
and Public Facilities land use types. Non-urban and open space uses include rural and
open space uses. Each of these general land use types is assigned a "Basic Land Use
Intensity."
At the most detailed level, specific land uses are designated. For each land use, a
description of appropriate uses is provided along with a definition of the maximum
allowable intensity that may be permitted. As discussed in Land Use Policy II-14, the
assignment of maximum development intensity to the land uses identified on the
General Plan Land Use Map does not imply that all parcels could be developed at their
maximum intensity or that any specific parcel is entitled to the maximum intensity. If a
proposed project is consistent with General Plan goals, objectives, approaches, and
policies, as well as performance standards contained in the Development Code, the
basic development intensity identified in Table II-1 and on Figure II-1 may be exceeded,
up to but not beyond the maximum intensity.

                 Guidelines for Clustered Development
Avoid:
x  Disturbing areas within or adjacent to floodplains, stream buffer areas,
   wetlands, oak woodlands, habitat linkages, or other sensitive biological
   features;
x  Developing on steep slopes, hilltops, and ridges where development would
   be highly visible;
x  Placing numerous houses with access drives along collector and arterial
   roads;
x  Backing houses directly or visibly onto collector and arterial roads; and
x  Destroying existing tree stands, especially along rights-of-way.
Require:
x  The resulting development after clustering to be consistent with the
   development’s natural setting and the adjacent residential neighborhoods,
   if any;
x  Substantial buffering and screening for development near all public rights-
   of-way;
x  Preservation or enhancement of existing wooded areas and sensitive
   environmental areas;
x  Homeowner-managed recreation areas and common spaces within larger
   clusters;
x  Covenants and/or easements to permanently protect the undeveloped open
   space areas that remain after clustering is accomplished; and
x  Appropriate sites for community facilities.
Permit/Encourage:
x  Refinement of road and street design to better protect existing
   topography and landscape features such as streams and drainage
   patterns (measures include narrower road sections, steeper grades,
   reduced curve radii, no curbs, etc.); and
x  Private courts and lanes instead of flag lots.

III. OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
III.A       Open Space
The preservation of the remaining open space lands within Calabasas and acquisition of
new lands for open space designation are consistently identified as the community’s
highest priority. Open space is a key component of the City’s character, representing a
scenic resource of great value and importance to the quality of life for Calabasas
residents. Open space protection contributes to public health and safety, and creates
opportunities for public recreation. It also protects significant environmental resources
as many of the open space areas within and around Calabasas contain an abundance
and variety of sensitive vegetative and wildlife habitats.
As of 2014, the current inventory of designated open space within City boundaries is
approximately 3,805 acres. Figure III-1 shows designated open space lands, while
Figure III-2 shows the ownership of open space lands in Calabasas. Table III-1 shows
the acreage of land within the City boundaries that is
either designated as open space
                                                    As used in this element, the term “open
under the General Plan or zoned as
                                                       space” refers to land that is either
open space. Table III-1 also lists
                                                     designated or zoned “Open Space.”
the average number of acres of                   “Vacant land,” on the other hand, is land
each type of open space per 1,000                  that is not developed, but has a land use
residents based on the estimated                 designation other than “Open Space.” In

about 12.7 acres per 1,000 residents. Other open space-designated lands in and
around the City are owned by various public agencies, homeowner associations, and
other private parties.
Objectives
 Maintain a citywide open space system that conserves natural resources, preserves
    scenic beauty, promotes a healthful atmosphere, provides space for a variety of
    recreational activities, and protects public safety.
 Continue to acquire additional land for open space designation with the goal of
    increasing the inventory of designated open space within the City to 4,000 acres.
General Plan Approach
The high quality of life for Calabasas residents is dependent upon a high quality natural
environment and protection of the area's beauty. The preferred method of managing
remaining open space is to set such lands aside in large natural parks or conservation
areas. However, protecting such resources requires more vigorous action than simply
setting them aside. Because the City's fiscal resources are not sufficient to purchase all
remaining undeveloped lands, a crucial issue is how to protect environmental resources
while recognizing the property rights of private landowners. Thus, the Calabasas
General Plan recognizes basic property rights, and limits the intensity of area
development to that which is consistent with environmental values and the carrying
capacity of the land.
One of the keys to maintaining the overall environmental health of the Calabasas area is
to combine open space preservation with environmental design and site planning that
works with nature to minimize the loss of such resources, reduce the offsite impacts of
development, and restore, where possible, the environmental and landscape quality that
may have been destroyed by past actions. To that end and because no two sites are
exactly alike, development requirements in Calabasas must demand protection of the
environment, but must also be realistically flexible to allow developers and builders to
better match their proposals to the environmental and landscape resources of their
sites.
Open space in Calabasas should represent an extensive network of protected areas with
a high degree of visual and physical continuity, and a systematic order of purpose. As
noted above, the preservation of remaining open space lands and acquisition of new
lands for open space designation is the highest priority of the community.

2030 GENERAL PLAN
III.      OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
The 1995 General Plan identified a target of 3,000 total open space acres for Calabasas.
This goal has been achieved and a new goal of 4,000 open space acres has been
established. Therefore, in addition to continuing to seek the retirement of development
rights for additional lands, improving the management of lands already designated as
open space will be a priority for the City. For example, the City does not currently have
a centralized mechanism for coordinating protection or management of this land use
type. Many open space areas are the result of set-asides that were features of past
development agreements. In some cases, management responsibility for these areas
has not been made clear as part of the approval process. This situation can be avoided
in the future by ensuring that when an open space dedication is associated with
approval of a project, management responsibilities are made clear, and possible
endowments for management funding are arranged before final approval is given for the
project.
Acquisition efforts, which could include a benefit assessment district or bond issue,
should focus on high priority parcels. Lands that are potential candidates for
acquisition and designation as open space, in whole or in part, include several hillside
properties that are current designated Hillside Mountainous (HM) (see Figure III-3).
Policies
III-1    Continue to acquire desirable lands for open space designation through
         dedications, purchases, and/or annexations.
III-2    Limit the permitted intensity of development within lands designated as open
         space to that which is consistent with the community’s environmental values and
         that will avoid significant impacts to sensitive environmental features, including
         but not limited to woodlands, riparian areas, wildlife habitats, wildlife movement
         corridors, and habitat linkages.
III-3   Partner with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the Mountains
        Restoration Trust in their development rights purchase programs to retire
        development rights for key properties within the City; support the efforts of the
        National Park Service and California Department of Parks and Recreation to
        expand areas devoted to regional recreational open space within and adjacent to
        Calabasas.

                               Open Space Functions
Protection of Significant Environmental Resources
Much of the designated open space within Calabasas contains an abundance and
variety of sensitive vegetative and wildlife habitats and linkages. It also represents
a scenic resource of great value and importance to the quality of life of area
residents and enhances the visual experience of visitors to the area.
Protection of Public Health and Safety
Hillside areas within Calabasas are potentially unstable platforms for development
and are also susceptible to wildfire. Thus, the General Plan includes policies and
criteria to provide a margin of safety and protection against slope failure and
wildfire. The application of these criteria will minimize the extent of hillside
development and potentially increase the amount of land designated as open space.
Also, maintaining open space lands in their natural state, and, correspondingly,
restricting new development to infill areas and along only the fringes of the City’s
existing built-up areas, reduces exposure to wildfire.
Managed Production of Resources
Open space for the managed production of resources typically includes areas
reserved for mineral extraction or agricultural production. There are no areas
within Calabasas that have been determined to either contain significant mineral
resources, as defined by the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act, or that would be
appropriate for mineral extraction if significant resources are found at some future
date. In addition, although some areas within Calabasas are used for grazing, the
preservation of lands for production of resources does not appear to be warranted
in light of other substantial concerns such as environmental protection and public
health and safety.
Public Recreation
These open space areas include public parks managed by the City of Calabasas and
Los Angeles County, as well as active recreation areas owned and managed by the
National Park Service as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area. It is the intent of the City to preserve existing recreational areas and expand
the amount of land devoted to public recreation to meet a performance standard of
3.0 acres of active local recreational land per 1,000 residents.
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

III-4   Partner with adjacent jurisdictions to retire development rights for key properties
        in and around the City.
III-5   Limit and direct landform modification within areas designated as open space
        areas to preserve ridgelines and other significant landforms.
III-6   Limit road access into areas designated as open space in order to protect
        environmental resources and preserve the visual character of designated open
        space lands.
III-7   Require that development within and adjacent to designated open space areas be
        screened with native or transitional landscaping in order to minimize the
        prominence of the development and emphasize natural features.
III-8   Improve public access to designated open space areas in a way that protects
        environmental resources, but increases the ability of the public to enjoy and
        benefit from the open space.
III-9   Establish coordinated management of open space functions at the City.
III-10 Ensure that deed restrictions on, and conveyances of, designated open space are
        properly recorded so that ownership and land management responsibilities are
        clear.
III.B      Hillside Management
Objective
Maintain and/or restore significant natural systems and resources associated with
hillside environments, including but not limited to, primary ridgelines, sensitive
vegetation and wildlife habitats, special geologic features, natural drainage swales and
canyons, and steep slopes exceeding 20%.
General Plan Approach
The natural hillside areas within Calabasas are significant visual and biological resources
as well as a key factor in the City’s unique setting and community character. Remaining
hillside and canyon areas encompass the majority of the remaining oak woodlands and
riparian areas and form much of the basis of Calabasas’ natural beauty.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

                                                             III.     OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Hillside settings offer a variety of amenities such as reduced densities, a more rural
character, significant views of valleys and hills, proximity to large natural open space
areas, and privacy. If development is improperly planned, the very amenities that
people seek as precious attributes of hillside living can be altered or destroyed. In
addition, the cumulative effects of improper hillside development can include alteration
of sensitive biological habitats and habitat linkages, erosion and degradation of water
quality, increased downstream runoff and flooding problems, slope failures, fire
hazards, high utility costs, and lack of safe access for emergency vehicles.
Proper planning of hillside areas is also required for safety reasons. Generally speaking,
hillsides are unstable landforms. Consequently, development on hillsides increases the
likelihood of soil erosion, silting of lower slopes, slope failure, and flooding. In
addition, despite the best efforts of geologists and civil engineers, manmade slopes
created by development within hillside areas can be subject to slope failure.
Overall, the preferred option for undeveloped hillside lands is to maintain them in their
natural condition. However, as a means of balancing the desire and need for preserving
hillside areas with a recognition of property rights, the General Plan defines those areas
that, because of their environmental significance, require varying degrees of protection,
and also provides for areas where development and varying degrees of landform
modification may occur.
A key concept of the Calabasas General Plan is to define permitted land use intensities
within remaining open hillside areas on the General Plan land use map in a manner that
is consistent with Calabasas' vision. The basic development intensities of the land use
map in the Land Use Element aim to maximize the amount of hillside area left in a
natural state.
Policies
III-11   Maintain the existing visual character of hillsides, recognizing both the visual
         importance of hillsides from public view areas and the importance of providing
         panoramic views from hillsides.
III-12   Minimize the alteration of existing landforms and maintain the natural
         topographic characteristics of hillside areas, allowing only the minimal
         disruption required to recognize basic property rights.
III-13   Protect the natural character of hillside areas through land sculpturing (contour
         grading) that blends graded slopes and terraces with the natural topography.

III-14 Preserve all significant ridgelines and other significant topographic features
       such as canyons, knolls, rock outcroppings, and riparian woodlands. Significant
       ridgelines are shown on Figure III-4. Exceptions may be granted to
       accommodate General Plan designated trails, viewpoints, and fuel modification
       measures needed for the protection of public health and safety.
III-15 Preserve natural drainage courses and provide drainage in a more natural
       appearing condition rather than with standard concrete box drainage channels.
III-16 Avoid mass graded "mega-pads" for development. Smaller steps or grade
       changes shall be used over single large slope banks.
III-17 Protect graded areas from wind and water erosion through slope stabilization
       methods (i.e., planting, walls, or netting). Interim erosion control plans shall
       also be required.
III-18 Prohibit new development, except for trails, on slopes of 50% or greater, unless
       either development is required for safety reasons or allowing such development
       would be more protective of ridgelines or other hillside resources.

IV. CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Calabasas recognizes its role as steward of all lands within its jurisdiction, as well as its
responsibility to promote and participate in solutions to the global environmental
concerns. The City will continue to take an active role in the management of its natural
resources for the benefit of present and future residents.
The general goals of the Conservation Element are to:
    x   Preserve significant environmental features within Calabasas and provide for
        their wise management.
    x   Minimize the consumption of natural resources needed to support life in
        Calabasas and ensure the wise use of those resources.
Open space and hillside management issues are covered in the Open Space Element

2030 GENERAL PLAN
I V.     CONSERVATION ELEMENT
General Plan Approach
Calabasas is home to large expanses of open land, natural hillsides, natural stream
channels, wildlife, and panoramic views. It is a high priority of the City to protect and,
where feasible, enhance the biological productivity and quality of vegetative and wildlife
habitats in Calabasas. Thus, the City will continue to take a proactive approach to the
management of biological resources, focusing on promoting the continued existence
and enhancement of habitats that support native flora and fauna.
It is the City’s intent to preserve large self-sustaining habitat management areas within
Calabasas. To that end, the City will continue to facilitate, where possible, public
acquisition of lands and open space easements within significant resource areas, while
recognizing the existence of private property rights. Calabasas will also continue to
work with federal, state, and private entities involved in the protection of the Santa
Monica Mountains to establish multi-species habitat conservation programs within the
National Recreation Area. Such conservation programs may include acquisition of land
and development rights within the National Recreation Area for habitat preservation.

linkages, and wildlife movement corridors in                      Sensitive species are
Calabasas, while Figure IV-2 illustrates the locations           specific organisms that
of potentially sensitive biological resource areas              have regionally declining

allowing property owners to maintain basic property
rights. Programs include development clustering,
development rights purchase programs, and financial participation by new development
to support these programs.
Policies
IV-1      Maintain an up-to-date inventory and map of sensitive, threatened, and
          endangered flora and fauna within Calabasas, as well as sensitive biological
          habitat areas and habitat linkages.

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
I V.    CONSERVATION ELEMENT
General Plan Approach
An urban forest is the sum total of all vegetation growing in an urban area. The quality
of landscaping and the existence of an urban forest within a community helps determine
the overall visual character of the built environment. Restoration and maintenance of
the urban forest requires the development and implementation of an urban forestry
management program.
The benefits of urban trees are numerous. Trees beautify the City, and give the streets
their character. They protect the quality of scenic corridors by screening unsightly
features and reinforcing the natural character of such areas. Trees strengthen the visual
quality of the streetscape, providing the basic structure around which all activity occurs.
Thematic planting programs unify a neighborhood, providing a sense of identity.
Even in the most urban environment, trees increase contact with nature, presenting
birds and sights that vary over the seasons. Trees mitigate the effects of air pollution,
urban “heat island” effect, and solar heat reflection. Finally, trees enhance and protect
values within the community. All of the benefits described above are goals that the City
will achieve through implementation of an urban forestry program.
Calabasas has adopted an Oak Tree Ordinance that requires reforestation, registration,
and preservation of all healthy oak trees, unless reasonable and conforming use of a
property justifies the removal, transplanting, altering, and/or encroachment into the oak
tree’s protected zone. The Ordinance also requires establishment of an Oak Habitat
Preservation Program to provide for reforestation and replacement of woodlands, public
acquisition of woodlands, and public education regarding habitat preservation.
Continued enforcement of the Oak Tree Ordinance will be a key component of the
maintenance and enhancement of the urban forest in Calabasas.
The City has also adopted an Urban Forestry Strategic Plan to create and maintain an
urban forest that enhances the quality of life in Calabasas. The plan’s objectives include
visual quality enhancement, resource protection, and pollution abatement. This plan
will also continue to be an important component of the City’s program to enhance the
urban forest.

IV.C      Air Quality
Objectives
 Achieve and maintain air quality levels that meet or exceed Federal and State
    standards by achieving consistency of General Plan policies and subsequent new
    development projects with the South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) and
    the air quality provisions of the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) prepared by the
    Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG).
 Reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels as stipulated in the California
    Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32).
General Plan Approach
Good air quality is important for the health of those who work and live in Calabasas, and
for the visual beauty of the area. Calabasas is located at the northwestern boundary of
the South Coast Air Basin, and is a route for air exchange between the coastal and
inland valley areas. The ocean breezes create relatively good air quality conditions in
Calabasas compared to much of the Basin. However, air pollution produced by activities
in Calabasas is carried downwind to other parts of the Basin. Therefore, the City has an
obligation, as well as a desire, to reduce local air pollutant emissions and contribute to
the improvement of regional air quality. In addition to the direct health threats posed
by many air pollutants, certain pollutants are considered greenhouse gases that, when
emitted into the atmosphere, contribute to global climate change. Greenhouse gases
include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide, all of which are generated in
part by human activity. Thus, actions taken by the City to reduce air pollution in the
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

Calabasas area will also help reduce the City’s contribution to global climate change.
This is consistent with AB 32, which calls for a greenhouse gas emissions cap for 2020
that would reduce such emissions to 1990 levels (essentially a 25% reduction below
2005 emission levels).
Automobiles are the primary sources of air pollution              AB 32 mandates annual
in Calabasas. Secondary sources include individual                reporting of greenhouse
facilities such as residences and commercial                         gas emissions from
establishments and equipment on construction sites.               greenhouse gas sources

prolonged exposure to pollutants.
While the majority of the populace can overcome
short periods of poor air quality, selected segments of the population are more
vulnerable. Specifically, young children, the elderly, and people with existing health
problems are most susceptible to respiratory complications. These segments of the
population tend to congregate in land uses that are thereby designated sensitive
receptors, including schools (particularly pre-schools and nursery schools), hospitals,
and senior housing. Sensitive receptors in Calabasas include the Motion Picture and
Television Fund facility, the Silverado Senior Living community, and local schools. The
City places special emphasis on protecting these sensitive receptors from unacceptable
concentrations of air pollutants.
To address air quality issues in southern California, the South Coast Air Quality
Management District has developed an Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). The
policies in this Air Quality section of the Conservation Element reflect Calabasas’ intent
to implement the provisions of this regional plan at the local level.
Policies in the AQMP address air pollution generated directly from individual facilities,
such as sulfur oxide emitted from industrial facilities, through a permitting process and
onsite control measures. Calabasas will also work to reduce the amount of air pollution
indirectly generated by facilities, such as the emissions generated by a remotely located
power plant as a result of electricity use at a facility within the City, by promoting energy
conservation.
Emissions from existing transportation activities pose a more complex problem, as they
are related to development patterns and lifestyle choices made by local residents.

Sprawling development and the widespread use of single occupant vehicles have been
major reasons for the air pollution problems in the South Coast Air Basin. The cities and
communities within the greater Los Angeles area have largely been laid out in a manner
that is dependent on the automobile, linked together with an extensive street and
freeway system dedicated primarily to the private automobile.
Reliance on the private automobile can be reduced through innovative transportation
control measures and transportation demand management programs, as well as
communitywide public awareness and governmental leadership to promote alternatives
to the private automobile. Reducing dependency on the use of single occupant
automobiles, both now and in the future, will reduce the overall number of vehicle trips
and will have a positive effect on the regional air emission burden.
Emissions from new development, including construction emissions and the emissions
from vehicle trips generated by the development, are addressed through the project
review process. For any proposed development that entails more than the “basic land
use intensity” described in Table II-1 of the Land Use Element, the City will require
specific emission reductions for new development as compared to “unmitigated”
emissions. Such emission reductions can be achieved through implementation of a
variety of possible control measures for different project types, including energy
conservation measures, alternative energy measures, and trip reduction measures.
Development proponents are allowed to select the specific control measures that are
most appropriate to their project.
Policies
IV-14     Minimize reliance on single occupant vehicle travel and reduce the number of
          vehicles on City streets during peak travel hours by maintaining transportation
          demand management programs in commercial and business park

IV.D      Water Resources
Objectives
 Minimize water consumption by existing and new development through an emphasis
    on drought-tolerant planting techniques, use of water-efficient plumbing, and water
    reclamation.
 Limit development in Calabasas to levels that are within the service capabilities of
    the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District (LVMWD).
 Meet National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) water quality
    standards for runoff from developed areas.
 Maintain water quality within natural drainage courses in order to avoid adverse
    effects upon resource dependent recreation as well as the biological carrying
    capacity of the riparian areas associated with the drainage courses.
General Plan Approach
Calabasas recognizes the critical nature of water resources relative to regional
growth in southern California. Water service in the City is provided by the Las
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

                                                                      2030 GENERAL PLAN
                                                          IV.    CONSERVATION ELEMENT
Virgenes Municipal Water District (LVMWD), which purchases imported water from
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a water wholesaler. Calabasas has
no local source of drinking water. However, the LVMWD uses recycled water,
recovered from the wastewater treatment process at the Tapia Water Reclamation
Facility, for irrigation of public landscaping such as highway medians, golf courses,
and school grounds.
Reducing the City’s dependence on imported water through the use of water
conservation measures increases the chances of recovery in the event of drought or
other emergency and saves money and energy associated with transporting water.
Water conservation methods apply to all new developments, including proposals to
intensify or remodel existing office, business park, retail, or multi-family developments.
The City’s water conservation performance objectives and LVMWD requirements for
strict water conservation include: water conserving fixture design and installation;
ultra-low flow toilets; hot water circulation systems; use of drought tolerant plantings
and efficient irrigation systems and techniques; and maximum use of recycled water
during and after construction.
Landscaping on residential and commercial properties is subject to City review
consistent with the City's Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance. Commercial properties
requiring service are subject to LVMWD review of plumbing plans prior to approval, and
onsite inspections once constructed to ensure proper compliance. The LVMWD reviews
residential proposals for adequate fire sprinkler flows and proper meter sizing.
Conservation measures will continue to be implemented to achieve the City’s objective
of minimizing the per capita rate of water consumption within Calabasas.
Another challenge involving water resources in Calabasas is the maintenance of good
water quality through stormwater management. Surface water bodies in Calabasas and
associated floodplains are shown on Figure IV-3.
The City addresses water quality concerns by ensuring that designs for pollutant
management are part of the overall planning and approval processes for new
development proposals. As a “co-permittee” under the Federal Clean Water Act
(National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System - NPDES), the City has adopted the Los
Angeles County Standard Urban Stormwater Mitigation Plan (SUSMP) and has updated
the SUSMP in accordance with regional requirements issued by the Los Angeles Regional
Water Quality Control Board. The City will continue to fulfill its water quality
responsibilities as a co-permittee under the NPDES program by requiring the use of best
management practices (BMPs) on new development and redevelopment. Calabasas will
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

also continue to monitor emerging technologies and techniques of minimizing water
quality impacts from municipal runoff, and to require the implementation of new BMPs
as they are devised.
Policies
IV-21    Coordinate land development review with the Las Virgenes Municipal Water
         District to ensure that adequate water supplies are available to support any new
         development.
IV-22    Ensure that new buildings are designed to minimize domestic water use based
         on the requirements of the City’s Green Building Ordinance and consider
         establishing incentives to achieve greater water use efficiencies than are
         required by the Ordinance.
IV-23    Promote the use of drought-tolerant plants and efficient landscape irrigation
         design in existing developed areas and as part of new public and private
         development approvals.
IV-24    Where reclaimed water service is or can be made available, promote the use of
         dual water systems on new development to facilitate the use reclaimed
         wastewater for landscape irrigation.
IV-25    Protect natural drainage courses within Calabasas and maintain appropriate
         setbacks from riparian habitats.
IV-26    Continue undertaking the activities necessary to fulfill the City’s responsibilities
         as a co-permittee under the Federal Clean Water Act, including implementation
         of the Los Angeles County Standard Urban Stormwater Mitigation Plan. Continue
         to monitor emerging technologies and techniques for minimizing water quality
         impacts from municipal runoff, and update the SUSMP as new Best Management
         Practices are established.
IV-27    Require runoff mitigation plans as part of the application and development
         review process that illustrate the Best Management Practices (BMPs) to be
         employed to prevent pollutants from running off the project site into area
         waterways. BMPs may include, but are not limited to, the use of biofiltration
         techniques and/or provision of subsurface filtering.

IV.E        Soil Conservation and Preservation
Objective
Avoid potentially significant impacts relating to soil erosion through the application of
appropriate soil management techniques.
General Plan Approach
Grading and construction associated with development projects can cause soil erosion,
including removal of topsoil, and can create large amounts of dust. The City will
continue to require developers to implement water erosion control plans in accordance
with National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements and dust
control plans in accordance with South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)
requirements.
Grading can also result in significant changes to site topography, which can in turn
result in long-term topsoil loss. In addition, unbalanced grading can create the need for
transport of soils on or offsite. Consequently, to the maximum extent practical,
alteration of natural landforms should be minimized and grading should be balanced
onsite.
Policies
IV-30     Require the use of best management practices for soil erosion control as part
          of any grading activity or natural landform alteration. Additionally, require
          erosion control measures prior to grading operations commencement.
IV-31     Promote balanced onsite grading operations to eliminate the need for
          transporting soils on or offsite. In addition, promote phased grading
          operations instead of mass grading. The extent of clearing and grubbing

         operations, as well as the area being graded at any particular point in time,
         should be limited to the minimum necessary.
IV-32    Regulate construction activities to eliminate potentially destructive practices
         that remove topsoil or place soils in areas intended to be preserved in open
         space, as well as practices such as dumping of construction wastes in
         unauthorized areas, washing out concrete trucks and spreading lime-laden
         water.
IV.F     Energy Resources
Objective
Minimize per capita consumption of non-renewable energy resources within Calabasas
through promotion of efficient land use patterns, reductions in vehicle miles traveled,
incorporation of best management practices for energy conservation into new and
existing development, and increased use of alternative sources of energy.
General Plan Approach
Reducing the amount of non-renewable energy consumed by Calabasas residents and
businesses will reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and will allow many
users to save money over time through reduced utility costs. Opportunities for the City
to promote energy conservation are available at the community/neighborhood, site, and
building design scales (see the box on the following page).
Energy can be saved by incorporating passive heating and cooling measures such as
south facing windows that allow heat from the sun in, so that active measures such as a
natural gas-powered furnace are not necessary. Energy consumption through indirect
uses can often be reduced though careful planning, such as reviewing landscape plans
to ensure that the design requires minimal water and fuel to maintain the landscape.
The City of Calabasas will continue to promote such energy conservation measures.
The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating
System™ is a nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction and operation
of high performance green buildings. Though largely focused on energy efficiency,
LEED promotes a whole-building approach to sustainability that also considers
sustainable site development, water savings, materials selection and indoor
environmental quality.

                            Energy Conservation Opportunities
          Community/Neighborhood Design: The City can reduce the
          consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel in vehicles by improving
          pedestrian and bicycle circulation within Calabasas, and promoting
          mixed use development where residents can live near where they work
          and shop, thus reducing the need for, and distance of, vehicle trips.
          Site Design: Site design affects energy consumption in several ways.
          Structure orientation and placement partly determine the effectiveness
          of passive heating and cooling design measures at the building scale.
          Structure orientation affects the amount of solar gain and the
          effectiveness of solar shading devices (e.g. shade trees near building
          facades, permanent awnings, and solar shade screens). Site design
          can influence the natural ventilation and shading during the cooling
          season, and the use of south facing facades for passive solar heating
          systems. Site design can also have an effect on indirect energy uses,
          such as water use for irrigation.
          Building Design: The energy used to operate a building can be
          categorized into direct and indirect uses. Space conditioning (heating
          and cooling) and appliance operation are the most direct energy uses.
          Water supply, waste water treatment, and solid waste disposal
          consume energy indirectly. Use of energy efficient or alternative
          energy technologies as well as technologies that minimize water use
          and waste generation can substantially reduce overall energy
          consumption.
The City has embraced the LEED system and will continue to do so in the future. The
City’s Green Building Ordinance requires new non-residential structures of between 500
and 5,000 square feet to achieve a LEED “Certified” rating and requires buildings of over
5,000 square feet to achieve at least a “Silver” rating. In addition, the Calabasas Civic
Center is the first municipal complex of its kind in the United States to achieve Gold
LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

Policies
IV-33   Continue to implement the City’s Green Building Ordinance to achieve energy
        efficiency and consider establishing incentives to achieve energy efficiencies
        higher than those required by the Ordinance.
IV-34   Promote community/neighborhood designs that minimize energy use. For
        example:
        x   Identify and implement programs to facilitate safe and pleasant pedestrian
            circulation.
        x   Establish and maintain a communitywide system of bicycle lanes and
            coordinate the development of a regional bicycle system with neighboring
            jurisdictions.
        x   Promote the development of fueling facilities for alternative fuel vehicles.
        x   Promote development and redevelopment of mixed use designs that allow
            residents to live near where they work and shop.
IV-35 Promote site designs that minimize energy use. For example:
         x   Develop building groups or clusters with plazas or open areas that promote
             exterior accessibility and enjoyment within a protected environment.
         x   Construct internal circulation roadways at the minimum widths necessary
             for safe circulation to minimize solar reflection and heat radiation.
         x   Where possible, locate reflective surfaces on the north and east side of
             buildings to minimize potential heat gain and reflection to adjacent
             buildings.
         x   Use light-colored pavement to reduce the urban “heat island” effect.
         x   Orient the maximum amount of non-reflective glass possible toward the
             south to maximize solar access.
         x   Incorporate the use of broad, deciduous trees in landscaping plans,
             especially near buildings and in and around large expanses of parking lots
             or other paved areas.
IV-36 Promote building designs that minimize energy use. For example:
         x   Use appropriate building shapes and locations to promote maximum
             feasible solar access to individual units.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

IV.G      Solid Waste Management
Objective
Minimize the amount of solid waste generated within Calabasas and maximize
participation in source reduction, recycling, and composting activities.
General Plan Approach
As in most cities, there is great potential to reduce solid waste generation within
Calabasas. Recycling and composting help divert waste from landfilling, and often
result in cost savings. Calabasas has met the State goals of Assembly Bill (939), which
requires 50% solid waste diversion. New regulations are currently being reviewed that
would increase the diversion rate to 75% by 2020. The City will continue to make efforts
to achieve diversion goals.
The Calabasas Sanitary Landfill is expected to close during the lifetime of the General
Plan. Calabasas realizes the urgency of the situation and plans on making arrangements
to ensure that waste disposal needs are met. In response, the City promotes solid waste
reduction through 35 diversion programs aimed at reducing the amounts of solid waste
going to landfills. Major programs include residential and commercial site pickup,
government source reduction, greenwaste reduction, electronic disposal, recycling,
economic incentives, and educational programs.
Policies
IV-41 Continue to meet or exceed state requirements for the diversion of solid waste
        from landfills.
IV-42 Adhere to the following hierarchy of integrated solid waste management options:
         x   Recognize source reduction as the waste management option of choice.
         x   Exhaust source reduction, recycling, and composting possibilities before
             resorting to landfilling of solid wastes.
IV-43 To reduce the volume and toxicity of products and packaging, encourage the
        purchase of products and packaging that: (1) are recyclable and/or are made
        with recyclable materials; (2) use minimal packaging; and (3) have reduced
        toxicity.
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

IV-44 To change patterns of consumption that produce unnecessary waste generation,
        encourage the following:
         x   Replacement of disposable materials and products with reusable materials
             and products
         x   Reduction of yard waste through backyard composting and low maintenance
             landscaping
         x   purchase of products with longer life spans, and products that are easily
             repairable
         x   Recycling of construction wastes
         x   Purchase of products that reduce energy consumption
IV-45    Ensure that adequate landfill capacity is available to meet the City’s future solid
         waste disposal needs.
IV.H      Mineral Resources
Objective
Manage mineral resources, if any, within Calabasas in a manner that emphasizes the
significance and sensitivity of the local natural environment rather than the conservation
and development of identified mineral resources.
General Plan Approach
The primary mineral resource found in southern California is construction aggregate.
The City of Calabasas lies mainly on sedimentary rock, which is typically not associated
with aggregate resources. A 1994 report by the California Geological Survey designated
areas in the western portion of Calabasas as Mineral Resource Zone (MRZ) 1, indicating
that no significant mineral deposits are present. The California Surface Mining and
Reclamation Act (SMARA) of 1975 does not require local governments to protect land
designated as MRZ 1.
The remainder of the City is designated MRZ 3, indicating that the significance of
mineral resources could not be evaluated from available data. The City is responsible
for recognizing lands designated as MRZ 3 and, if significant aggregate resources are
ultimately found, State policy favors conservation and development of those resources.
However, the City is permitted to adopt plans that discourage development of mineral
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

 V.      HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
V.A Introduction
State housing element statutes (Government Code Sections 65580-65589.8) mandate
that local governments adequately plan to meet the existing and projected housing
needs of all economic segments of the community. The law recognizes that in order for
the private market to adequately address housing needs and demand, local
governments must adopt land use plans and regulatory systems that provide
opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing development. As a result, State
housing policy rests largely upon the effective implementation of local General Plans and
in particular, local Housing Elements. Housing element statutes also require the State
Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to review local housing
elements for compliance with State law.
California’s Housing Element law requires that each city and county develop local
housing programs to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all
income groups. The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) is
responsible for developing and assigning these regional needs, or “RHNA”, to Southern
California jurisdictions. Pursuant to the RHNA planning period and consistent with State
Law, the Calabasas Housing Element is an eight-year plan extending from 2014-2021.
Calabasas’ Housing Element identifies strategies and programs that focus on:
1) conserving and improving existing housing; 2) providing adequate housing sites; 3)
assisting in the provision of affordable housing; 4) removing governmental constraints
to housing development; and 5) promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.
Public Participation
Section 65583(c)(8) of the Government Code states that the housing program in the
housing element shall include “a diligent effort by the local government to achieve
public participation of all economic segments of the community in the development of
the housing element, and the program shall describe this effort.” Opportunities for
community stakeholders to provide input on housing issues and recommend strategies
are critical to the development of appropriate and effective programs to address the
City’s housing needs. Calabasas has solicited input from the public throughout the
year-long housing element process: during development of the draft element; during
public review of the draft element; and during the adoption process.
The City solicited public input early during preparation of the Element through
dissemination of an on-line housing needs survey. The ten question survey was posted
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

on the City’s website from November 1, 2012 – January 3, 2013, with 74 completed
surveys received. The following summarizes some of the primary input received from
the housing needs survey, with the complete survey results included in Appendix A:
    •   Over half of respondents indicated the housing they live in was in need of minor
        repairs (43%), modest rehabilitation improvements (7%), or major upgrades (5%).
    •   Of the 3 areas identified for transition to mixed use in the 2030 General Plan,
        48% of respondents identified the East Village/Calabasas Road area as having the
        greatest potential for development within the planning period.
    •   42% of respondents identified senior housing as the type of housing most in
        need in Calabasas.
    •   A variety of write-in comments were provided, including the need for more
        affordable housing options, provision of housing in a mixed use context near
        services, single-level housing for aging populations, outreach on available
        rehabilitation assistance to older homeowners.
Calabasas conducted a public workshop on February 7, 2013 before the Planning
Commission to solicit input on housing needs and to confirm policy direction in the
Element. Notification of the workshop was provided in the local newspaper and posted
on the City’s website. Direct notification was also provided to local stakeholders
including: for-profit and non-profit housing developers; advocacy groups representing
lower income populations; and adjacent jurisdictions. The Planning Commission
requested that staff reach out directly to the senior residents of Calabasas and inquire
about their specific needs so that future housing programs and policies included in the
updated Housing Element can be responsive to those needs.
Accordingly, on February 13, 2013 staff emailed a brief survey to 200 Calabasas seniors
who are part of the “Savvy Seniors” program. Within a few weeks, staff received 45
completed surveys (23% return rate), summarized as follows (refer to Appendix A for
complete results):
    •   52% of respondents indicated that they would like to have other family members
        live in Calabasas but the family members cannot afford to rent or buy here.
    •   If faced with the challenge of leaving their home, the majority of respondents
        stated that they would prefer to live in an independent living facility.
    •   20% of respondents living in a single-family home indicated they would
        potentially be interested in providing a small second unit on their property to
        house a family member or caregiver, and/or to provide rental income.
The housing needs and issues raised in the two Calabasas surveys are addressed within
the Housing Element’s policies and programs. For example, the Housing Rehabilitation
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

Program will include an expanded senior outreach component; the sites inventory
identifies several sites within walking distance of commercial services and emphasizes
redevelopment of older uses in the East Village for mixed use development; and the
second unit ordinance is being re-evaluated to provide expanded opportunities.
Relationship to Other General Plan Elements
The Calabasas 2030 General Plan is comprised of the following eleven elements: Land
Use; Circulation; Housing; Conservation; Open Space; Parks and Recreation; Noise;
Safety; Community and Economic Design; Cultural Resources; and Communications,
Technology and Infrastructure. The City’s 2008-2014 Housing Element was developed
in conjunction with the 2030 General Plan, and is entirely consistent with the policies
and proposals set forth by the Plan. The current 2014-2021Housing Element update
maintains this internal consistency. Whenever any element of the General Plan is
amended in the future, the Housing Element will be reviewed and modified, if necessary,
to ensure continued consistency among General Plan elements.
Resources for Program Implementation
Calabasas has one primary funding source available for implementation of Housing
Element programs – the Affordable Housing Fund, generated from inclusionary housing
in-lieu fee and commercial affordable housing impact fee revenues. The Housing
Element recommends allocation of the current $1.3 million Affordable Housing Fund
balance towards: Affordable New Construction; Preservation of At-Risk Housing; and the
Home Repair Loan program. Other funding resources include Community Development
Block Grant, which funds the Single-Family Rehabilitation Program, and General Fund
monies, which fund the Rental Assistance Program. In addition, the City will continue to
generate modest levels of inclusionary in-lieu and commercial affordable housing
impact fee revenues which will further support affordable production and preservation
activities.

V.B Residential Sites Analysis
California Housing Element law requires that each jurisdiction develop local housing
programs to meet their “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all income
groups. This “fair share” allocation concept seeks to ensure that each jurisdiction
accepts responsibility for the housing needs of not only its resident population, but also
for the jurisdiction’s projected share of regional housing growth across all income
categories. Regional growth needs are defined as the number of units needed to
accommodate forecasted household growth, as well as units needed to compensate for
anticipated demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal” vacancy rate.
In the Southern California region, the agency responsible for assigning these regional
housing needs to each jurisdiction is the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG). The regional growth allocation process begins with the State
Department of Finance’s projection of Statewide housing demand, which is then
apportioned by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
among each of the State’s official regions. For 2014-2021, SCAG was allocated a total
housing need range of 409,060 to 438,030 units.
SCAG has determined the projected housing needs throughout its region for the 2014-
2021 Housing Element cycle, and has allocated this housing need to each jurisdiction by
income category. This Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) represents the
minimum number of housing units each community must plan for by providing
“adequate sites” through general plan and zoning. An important component of the
Housing Element is the identification of adequate sites for future housing development
to address the City’s RHNA. Calabasas’ 2014-2021 RHNA allocation is 330 units
distributed among the following income groups: 44 extremely low income; 44 very low
income; 54 low income; 57 moderate income; and 131 above moderate income units.
The City plans to fulfill its share of regional housing needs using a combination of the
following methods:
    •   Residential projects with development entitlements;
    •   Vacant residential sites;
    •   Underutilized residential and mixed-use sites; and
    •   Second residential units.
Calabasas’ residential sites capacity from the above sources provides for 747 additional
units, including sites suitable for development of 331 lower income, 171 moderate
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

Projects with Entitlements
Calabasas currently has two residential projects with development entitlements that will
contribute towards addressing its future RHNA needs. Projects under construction with
occupancy projected to occur prior to 2014 – such as the 60 unit Horizons 55 senior
condominiums – are discussed in the Background Report under Review of
Accomplishments (Appendix C). Only those projects with occupancy in the 2014-2021
planning cycle are credited towards the sites inventory, as presented in Table V-1.

         approved by the City Council in 2007 for 86 condominiums. Since the
         approval, the original applicant (Standard Pacific Homes) sold the property as
         entitled to Calabasas Blue. The new owners opted to modify the approved
         project to minimize some of the project's environmental impacts – especially
         the site grading – reducing the number of units to 78. Paxton Calabasas is

         fulfilling the City’s inclusionary requirement, the project developers (D2
         Development & The New Home Company) are providing double the number of
         affordable units required under the City’s inclusionary ordinance (10% instead of
         5% very low income units), in exchange for development concessions for
         increased height and reduced parking stall width.
Vacant Residential Sites
The City’s 2030 General Plan included a parcel-specific inventory of all vacant
residential land in Calabasas. The inventory is hereby updated for the 2014-2021
Housing Element. The land survey documents a total of 1,344.2 vacant residential
acres, presented in Table V-2.

   Notes:
   1. For single-family residential zoned areas (HM, RS, and RR zones), estimated build-out potential includes
   one dwelling per existing legal lot, and additional dwellings on larger properties where potentially
   allowable under the City’s zoning and subdivision requirements.
   2. Vacant lots zoned Rural Community (RC) have not been included in the sites inventory as most are
   undevelopable due to a variety of significant site constraints, and thus realistic unit potential is minimal
   and difficult to predict.
                                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

 V.     HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
Although the vast majority of the vacant acreage in Calabasas is in the Hillside/
Mountainous (HM) district, only a relatively few number of units can be developed in HM
areas due to severe physical constraints, lack of roads and sanitary sewers, and safety
issues. Other vacant single-family land is limited to areas designated Rural Residential
(RR), also subject to significant development constraints related to topography and
access. Only 14 acres of vacant, unconstrained Residential Single-Family (RS) land
remains in Calabasas, supporting densities up to 6 units/acre. In total, approximately
212 new single-family housing units can be developed on sites that have not already
received land use entitlements.
In terms of multi-family sites, the 2030 General Plan designated the following three
vacant sites for multi-family development at densities of 20 units per acre:
     The Las Virgenes site (Site #3 in Multi-family Sites Inventory in Appendix B)
        consists of two large hillside parcels totaling over 70 gross acres under
        single ownership. This site is located on the Las Virgenes Road corridor,
        which links directly into the Ventura Freeway and has been transitioning to
        residential use over the past several years. The General Plan designates 6
        acres of the site’s buildable area near Las Virgenes Road as Residential
        Multiple-Family (RM 20), providing for 120 multi-family units. An additional
        10 acres of the site is designated Planned Development (PD), accommodating
        a mix of residential, retail and office uses, with the goal of creating a “village
        center” along Las Virgenes Road. The PD portion of the site provides for
        densities of 20 units/acre and up to 60 multi-family units - permitted both
        stand-alone residential and residential/commercial mixed use - as well as up
        to 155,000 square feet of commercial development. Residential
        development is a mandatory use in the PD district, with the commercial
        component not permitted to develop without the residential use.
        The purpose of the PD designation is to encourage innovative land use planning
        on larger parcels, providing flexibility from prescribed zoning standards to
        achieve a superior design. With the exception of a 35-foot height limit and
        parking requirements consistent with the City’s standards by land use type, the
        Development Code does not define development standards for the PD district.
     Old Town Mixed Use (Site #4 in Multi-family Sites Inventory in Appendix B)
        consists of a vacant, one-acre parcel located on the north side of Calabasas
        Road on the eastern edge of Old Town Calabasas. The site is flat and well
        situated to infill development, located less than ¼ mile to transit and
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
 V.    HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
       shopping, including a grocery store. The General Plan designates the site as
       Mixed Use 1.0, providing residential uses “by right” at densities of 20 units
       per acre, as well as accommodating commercial uses at a combined intensity
       up to 1.0 FAR. The Mixed Use 1.0 designation requires residential uses to
       constitute a minimum 50% of the overall project floor area. Twenty multi-
       family units can be accommodated within the mixed use development
       standards on this site, with additional units achievable under the City’s
       density bonus ordinance for affordable housing, similar to the Old Town
       Senior Housing project recently developed nearby.
     A small, 0.36 acre parcel on Las Virgenes Road is designated CMU 0.6 (Site
       #5 in Multi-family Sites Inventory in Appendix B). The parcel is surrounded
       to the north and east by a commercial, office building and associated parking
       lot, to the south by the 101 Freeway, and to the west by Las Virgenes Road.
       This triangularly-shaped parcel is relatively flat and not subject to any known
       environmental constraints to development. The site is well situated to infill
       development, located less than ½ mile to transit and shopping, including a
       grocery store. The General Plan designates the site as Mixed Use 0.6,
       providing residential uses “by right” at densities of 20 units per acre, as well
       as accommodating commercial uses at a combined intensity up to 0.6 FAR.
       The Mixed Use 0.6 designation requires residential uses to constitute a
       minimum 20% of the overall project floor area. Seven multi-family units can
       be accommodated within the mixed use development standards on this site.
Underutilized Residential Sites
The Calabasas 2030 General Plan identified the following three distinct areas as
appropriate for long-term transition to relatively high intensity, pedestrian-oriented
environments with an integrated mix of uses:
     West Village - The Agoura Road corridor is currently dominated by office and
       business park uses. The Land Use Plan’s vision is to gradually transition the
       corridor to a mix of office, retail, and residential uses that creates a village
       ambiance and strong “sense of place.” With 80 acres designated for mixed
       use at an FAR of 0.75, 229 multi-family units could be accommodated.
     East Village – The mixed use area along both sides of Calabasas Road
       provides an opportunity for recycling and intensification of existing uses to
       create a mix of office, retail, and residential uses to complement the uses
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

                                                                      2030 GENERAL PLAN
 V.     HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
        planned for Old Town Calabasas and provides the impetus for creating a
        pedestrian-oriented "city center" and gathering place. The 81 acres
        designated mixed use in this area, at an 1.0 FAR, provide for 191 new units.
      Las Virgenes/Mureau – City Hall, including the City library, vacated its
        original Business Park location when the new Calabasas Civic Center and
        Library opened in mid 2008. The 28 acres of existing office/business park
        uses in this area may gradually transition to a mix of office, retail, and multi-
        family residential uses that create a village ambiance. With a permitted FAR
        of 0.75, 81 multi-family units can be accommodated.
Other than the one acre vacant commercial mixed-use (CMU) parcel in Old Town
described above, these mixed use areas were not anticipated to transition within the
2008-2014 Housing Element period and thus were not included in the prior Housing
Element sites inventory. More recently, as the availability of vacant sites has diminished,
the City has seen multi-family development occurring through redevelopment of
existing commercial sites, such as the Canyon Creek senior housing project and The
Village project on the prior Calabasas Inn site. For purposes of identifying properties
suitable for intensification during the 2014-2021 Housing Element, City staff conducted
a land use survey in December 2012 of parcels in the CMU and RM zoning districts,
identifying underutilized parcels based on the following criteria: 1) significant
underutilization of permitted density or floor area (FAR); 2) existing use approximately
30+ years old, or surface parking lot; and 3) low building structure value.
As summarized in Table V-3, 21.6 acres of RM and CMU designated parcels meet the
City’s underutilized sites criteria, including a balance of CMU sites in the East and West
Village, as well as two underutilized RM sites. These sites are #6–#10 in the Multi-
Family Sites inventory in Appendix B, and are described in the narrative which follows.

2030 GENERAL PLAN
 V.    HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
     Site 6 is a 6.6-acre site partially developed with the Rancho Pet Kennel. While
       the northern portion of the site is hilly, a sizable flat area of approximately 5
       acres is readily buildable. The existing kennel facility consists of an 800
       square foot main house approaching 60 years in age, and a series of
       peripheral structures which house the dogs and serve as storage. County
       assessor records indicate the value of site improvements comprise only one
       percent of the property’s total assessed value, further indication that existing
       uses on the kennel site would not constitute a constraint to site
       development. In terms of potential environmental constraints, because the
       site is located within 500 feet of a freeway, the General Plan will require a
       health risk analysis to demonstrate residents would not be exposed to health
       risks exceeding SCAQMD standards. In addition, the General Plan will require
       mitigation to achieve acceptable interior noise levels, and depending on the
       layout of the project, may also require mitigation for exterior noise. The
       2030 General Plan designates the Pet Kennel site for Residential, Multi-
       family, providing for a lower intensity multi-family use at 12 units per acre.
       With 5 buildable acres, the Pet Kennel site can accommodate 60 units.
     Site 7 is an underutilized commercial property comprised of two adjacent parcels
       totaling 39,300 square-feet. The main parcel, abutting Las Virgenes Road, is
       28,700 square-feet and is developed with a 12,100 square-foot commercial
       building (shopping center) and a portion of the associated parking lot. The
       second parcel is 10,625 square feet and houses the remainder of the parking lot
       for the shopping center. The building is currently occupied by a variety of
       commercial uses such as restaurants, a laundromat, a liquor store, etc. The
       building (nearly 50 years old) dates from 1965, is in poor physical condition, and
       fails to meet current building codes. Additionally, the current zoning
       designation of CMU permits a floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.6, compared to the
       developed FAR of just 0.4. A new commercial development has been approved to
       the north of the site, and once constructed, could serve as incentive for the
       redevelopment of this underutilized site. Redeveloped to its full potential, the
       site could continue to accommodate a variety of commercial uses, as well as the
       integration of multi-family residential. An estimated 18 units at 20 unit/acre
       densities can realistically be accommodated on this site.
     Site 8 consists of a single, 2.5 acre parcel located at 4235 Las Virgenes Road.
       The site is currently home to the Calabasas Presbyterian Church, which occupies
       roughly one-third of the property. Approximately one acre of the site is occupied
       by three prefabricated, temporary buildings dating from 1991 and totaling 7,650
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

     square-feet, a 400 square-foot shed constructed in 1963, and the Church
     parking lot. The remaining 1.5 acres of the site is undeveloped. The site is
     zoned RM-16, allowing up to 16 units per acre of residential multi-family
     development for a total development potential of 39 moderate-income units.
     The zoning designation also allows for maximum site coverage of 55%. With an
     existing FAR of 0.1 and site coverage of just 8.8%, this site is significantly
     underutilized. Additionally, the four structures are functionally obsolete and the
     City does not anticipate that the buildings have a much longer functional life
     span. City Planning staff recently fielded an inquiry regarding development of
     multi-family residences on the undeveloped portion of this site. In such a
     scenario where only the remaining undeveloped portion of the site is developed,
     the site could still accommodate approximately 24 dwelling units in addition to
     the existing four buildings. Considering the age of the buildings and how greatly
     underutilized this site is, potential for redevelopment or partial redevelopment is
     high.
    Site 9 is located in the East Village mixed use area. The vision presented in the
     City’s 2030 General Plan for the East Village is a comprehensive revitalization of
     the area, creating an expanded “village” environment by including new
     professional offices, retail commercial uses, visitor accommodations, and
     residential development connected with pedestrian spaces, plazas and parks.
     The five underutilized parcels that comprise Site 9 are zoned Commercial Mixed
     Use CMU .95, with redevelopment of CMU parcels required to include a minimum
     20% residential component. With the General Plan’s vision and zoning
     requirements in mind, the realistic unit potential for site 9 was calculated based
     on 50% of the area being developed to include housing. Site 9 is comprised of
     five adjacent parcels located on the north side of Calabasas Road, abutting the
     101 Freeway. Collectively these five parcels offer nearly twelve acres of prime
     real estate in the heart of the City, with potential for new mixed-use
     development replacing obsolete 30-40 year old buildings, and offering potential
     for as many as 115 new housing units. For the purposes of discussion, Site 9
     has been broken down into two groups: Site 9A and 9B.
     Site 9A is comprised of two parcels under common ownership: (1) a 47,700
     square-foot parcel located at 24005 Calabasas Road and developed with a 7,200
     square-foot restaurant building built in 1972; and (2) the adjacent 21,000
     square-foot parcel developed as a parking lot for the restaurant. The floor area
     ratio (FAR) for Site 9A is just 0.11, well below the permitted intensity of 0.95
     FAR. Additionally, the existing building does not comply with current building
                                                                       CITY of CALABASAS

       codes and is considered sub-standard when compared to the existing buildings
       across the street. Planning staff has been contacted by the property owner of
       Site 9A with inquiries about redevelopment, applicable zoning regulations, and
       what the City envisions for the property. Because these parcels are greatly
       underutilized, the building is sub-standard, the location is squarely within a part
       of the City for which revitalization is envisioned, and interest in redevelopment
       has been expressed on the part of the property owner, the potential of
       redevelopment for this site very high.
       Site 9B is comprised of three adjacent parcels located at 23945, 23901, and
       23801 Calabasas Road. 23945 Calabasas Road is a 58,000 square-foot parcel
       developed with a 53,000 square-foot office building; 23901 Calabasas Road is a
       195,000 square-foot parcel developed with a 100,00 square-foot office; and
       23801 Calabasas Road is a 174,000 square-foot parcel developed with a 95,000
       square-foot office. The three offices are all two-stories and approximately 30
       years old. All three parcels are zoned CMU 0.95 and could accommodate up to
       twenty (20) dwelling units per acre and an FAR of 0.95. With a combined
       existing FAR of 0.58, Site 9B is developed at an intensity well below the allowable
       FAR. Additionally, all three buildings do not comply with current building codes
       and are considered sub-standard when compared to the existing office buildings
       across the street. Site 9B occupies the center portion of the East Village where,
       as stated in the 2030 General Plan, opportunities for more of a pedestrian-
       focused downtown environment are unmet. Redevelopment of these properties
       with residential or mixed-use projects (with a residential component) would
       comply with General Plan policies and would be supported by the City. Planning
       staff has fielded inquiries from two major developers interested in purchasing all
       three parcels and redeveloping the properties in compliance with the General
       Plan policies and the CMU 0.95 zoning.
     Site 10 is a 1.96-acre parcel adjacent to Calabasas City Hall and currently
       improved as a private surface parking lot. The parking lot provides overflow
       parking spaces for City Hall employees and employees in the office buildings
       across the street. The General Plan designated this site for mixed use, and the
       site has been zoned CMU 0.95, providing for residential densities of 20 dwelling
       units per acre and accommodating 39 multi-family units. This is located in the
       heart of the City’s downtown and, with the lone improvement being a parking
       lot, it would require very minor demolition and development preparation.
       Additionally, the existing overflow parking offered by this site would not need to
       be replaced upon redevelopment because it serves as overflow only. The subject
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

         pedestrian connectivity. The center currently has underutilized spaces;
         additionally, ample street parking is available.
Second Residential Units
Second units are self-contained living units with cooking, eating, sleeping, and full
sanitation facilities, either attached to or detached from the primary residential unit on a
single lot. Second units offer several benefits. First, they typically rent for less than
apartments of comparable size, and can offer affordable rental options for seniors,
college students and single persons. Second, the primary homeowner receives
supplementary income by renting out their second unit, which can help many modest
income and elderly homeowners remain in or afford their homes.
Calabasas has significant additional site capacity to accommodate second units,
although has experienced a relatively limited number of second unit applications, with
just four during the 2008-2012 period. Particularly in light of its aging population, the
City is interested in facilitating the provision of second units as a means of allowing
seniors to remain in their homes. In the City’s Senior Housing Needs Survey conducted
in conjunction with the Housing Element, approximately one-quarter of non-renter
respondents indicated an interest in having a second unit either for a caregiver, family
member or to generate rental income. Given this level of interest, the Housing Element
includes a program to evaluate and amend the City’s current second unit standards to
provide greater flexibility, such as an increased unit size subject to a CUP, to encourage
the provision of both attached and detached second units.
With modification of second unit standards to facilitate, combined with enhanced
marketing of second unit opportunities, the City projects a modest increase in the rate
of second unit production to twelve units during the 2014-2021 planning period. Rent
levels on second units are generally less than a one bedroom apartment, and thus can
be assumed to fall within levels affordable to moderate income households.

In terms of evaluating the adequacy of sites to address the affordability targets
established by the RHNA, Housing Element statutes provide for use of “default densities”
to assess affordability. Based on its population, Calabasas falls within the default
density of 20 units per acre for providing sites affordable to very low and low income
households; sites suitable for moderate income households can be provided at 12 units
per acre. Allocating Calabasas’ residential sites inventory based on these density
thresholds, combined with the 12 very low income units known in entitled projects,
results in the provision of sites suitable for development of 331 units affordable to
lower income households, 171 units affordable to moderate income households, and
245 units for above moderate income households. A comparison of this income
distribution with the City’s RHNA identifies sufficient sites at appropriate densities to
accommodate Calabasas’ regional housing needs.
It is to Calabasas’ benefit that its residential site capacity exceeds the minimum RHNA
required within each income category to help offset any sites that may be developed
with fewer units than assumed in the Housing Element sites inventory. A healthy buffer
above the required RHNA therefore provides a “margin of safety” from having to rezone
additional sites during the 2014-2021 planning period of the element.

Availability of Public Services and Facilities
The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District (LVMWD) provides both water and wastewater
service in Calabasas. As part of the 2030 General Plan update, the City worked with
LVMWD to ensure coordination of the updated Land Use Plan with the district’s water
and sewer facilities master plans. The General Plan directs new development to areas
with adequate water and sewer facilities, or where facilities are planned consistent with
the LVMWD’s master plan.
LVMWD indicates projected water supply is adequate to serve the expected demand
from incremental new development. As part of the development process, the City
determines whether projects are required to submit water pressure and flow demand
calculations to provide information to determine if adequate line capacity exists.
Similarly, a sewer study may be required to determine if adequate line capacity exists
and to project future flow volume and remainder capacities in the downstream
segments.
SB 1087, effective January 2006, requires water and sewer providers to grant priority for
service allocations to proposed developments that include units affordable to lower
income households. Pursuant to these statutes, upon adoption of its Housing Element,
the City will provide the Element to the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District, along with
a summary of the regional housing needs allocation.
Environmental Constraints
As described in greater detail in the Housing Element Background Report, portions of
Calabasas are subject to seismically induced liquefaction and expansive soils. However,
with implementation of the Calabasas Building Code and policies contained in the Safety
Element that require site specific engineering studies prior to development, the General
Plan EIR concludes that these geologic impacts are less than significant.

V. C Housing Conservation and Maintenance
Objective
Conserve and improve existing housing in Calabasas.
General Plan Approach
Maintaining the quality of existing housing and neighborhoods is an important goal for
Calabasas. While the vast majority of housing in Calabasas is in excellent condition, the
City does contain several neighborhoods developed in the 1960s and 1970s that are
beginning to exhibit signs of deferred maintenance. In addition, the City has 140 rent-
restricted affordable apartment units at risk of conversion to market rents, as well as
Calabasas Village Mobile Estates, which provides over 200 mobile home park spaces
with relatively affordable rents. The City has made it a high priority to preserve its
existing stock of affordable housing.
Policies
Policy V-1      Preserve the character, scale and quality of established residential
                neighborhoods.
Policy V-2      Offer rehabilitation and home improvement assistance to low and
                moderate income households, seniors and the disabled.
Policy V-3      Improve and implement the code enforcement program to ensure a high
                quality of life is maintained within the City’s residential neighborhoods.
Policy V-4      Undertake proactive steps to preserve existing assisted rental housing
                at-risk of conversion to market rents.
Policy V-5      Encourage retention of Calabasas Village Mobile Estates as mobile home
                park use to provide a relatively affordable form of housing, and maintain
                permanent mobile home park zoning.
                                                                            CITY of CALABASAS

Policy V-6     To the extent financially feasible, provide limited rental assistance to
               extremely low and lower income, senior, and disabled tenants to address
               increasing rents in the community. Maintain a rent database to track
               changes in the local rental market.
Policy V-7     Maintain the City’s condominium conversion ordinance to preserve the
               City’s existing rental housing stock.
Programs
1. Residential Rehabilitation Program: The City of Calabasas receives approximately
$85,000 annually in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds through the
County, of which it allocates $70,000 toward the residential rehabilitation program.
This program provides $5,000 in grants and deferred zero interest loans of up to
$10,000 to lower income owner-occupants of mobile homes, single-family homes and
condominiums. The program typically runs a wait list of six-plus months, with an
average of 5-10 households assisted annually. Discussions with the program
administrator indicate increasing difficulty in recent years qualifying many homeowner
applicants because they have incomes above the 80% income threshold mandated under
CDBG.
    2014-2021 Objective: Continue to provide rehabilitation loans and grants to
    qualified homeowners. The objective is to assist an average of five households
    on an annual basis, for 40 households over the planning period.
2. Home Repair Program: In 2012, the City initiated a new program to assist low and
moderate income property owners of severely dilapidated units cited for code violations
to make needed repairs to make the units safe and habitable. The program is intended
for single-family home properties and permitted secondary dwelling units with a Notice
of Violation on file and documented code deficiencies require repairs, replacement, or
reconstruction to such an extent that the value of the work is expected to exceed
$15,000. The City has allocated $500,000 in Affordable Housing Funds to the
program, and has adopted program guidelines which provide for loans of up to
$100,000 for repairs necessary to bring substandard properties into conformance with
the Calabasas Building Code (including plumbing, electrical and structural).
    2014-2021 Objective: Coordinate with code enforcement to identify low and
    moderate income homeowners in need of substantial rehabilitation
    improvements, and provide loans on an as-needed basis.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

3. Rental Assistance Program: Since 2004, the City has provided a Rental Assistance
Program for extremely low and lower income senior and disabled residents in Calabasas
Village Mobile Estates, expanded in 2007 to encompass qualifying residents in the City’s
apartment complexes. In December 2010, the City Council made the program
permanent and expanded the capacity to 50 households and increased the subsidy
amount to $175, plus a yearly increase based on the Consumer Price Index. The Rental
Assistance Program helps to address one of Calabasas’ primary affordable housing
needs – rental overpayment – and encompasses assistance to those most in need,
households earning extremely low incomes.
     2014-2021 Objective: Continue to provide rental assistance to extremely low to
     low income senior and disabled households at-risk of displacement. Provide
     ongoing assistance to 50 households, contingent on availability of funds.
4. Rental Registration Program: In June 2004, the City Council adopted Ordinance No.
2004-191, establishing a Rental Registration Program as a means of developing an
inventory of rental units, monitoring rent levels, and minimizing renter displacement
resulting from rapidly increasing rents. The ordinance requires owners of four or more
rented dwellings (including mobile homes) to annually register units with the City and to
report any increase in rent of 5% or greater, except those associated with a new tenancy.
The ordinance requires the City to be notified of the increase at least 60 days prior to
the effective date of the increase.
Planning staff annually contact rental property owners to maintain the rent database.
The database includes property owner information; annual rental rates; and all reported
increases for each unit. Over 1,300 apartment units, 210 mobile home park spaces, and
10 condominium units are registered.
     2014-2021 Objective: Continue to maintain the Rental Registration Database as
     a tool to monitor rent levels in the community and ensure 60-day notification to
     the City of significant (>5%) increases in rents.
5. Mobile Home Park Preservation: Calabasas contains one mobile home park – the 210
space Calabasas Village Mobile Estates. As described under the Rental Assistance
Program (#3), as a means of assisting extremely low to lower income park tenants
affected by rising park space rents, the City offers a rental assistance program.
Recognizing that mobile homes provide relatively affordable housing for many seniors
and lower income households, the City is committed to preserving Calabasas Village
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

 V.     HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
Mobile Estates. The City’s General Plan and Development Code establish a distinct
mobile home park designation. With these designations in place, a park owner seeking
closure would have to first justify a General Plan amendment and zone change to the
Planning Commission and City Council, and comply with State regulations governing
mobile home park closures. By preserving Calabasas Village Mobile Estates, the City is
helping address the housing needs of extremely low, low and modest income residents.
The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) offers a Mobile
Home Park Resident Ownership Program (MPROP) to assist resident organizations, non-
profit housing providers, or local public agencies to acquire and own mobile home
parks. The program offers low interest loans for the purchase or rehabilitation of a
mobile home park.
    2014-2021 Objective: Should tenants of the park indicate interest in purchasing
    the park as a means of maintaining control over space rent increases, provide
    information on available State MPROP funding and assist with the subdivision
    map waiver process consistent with the Subdivision Map Act.
6. Preservation of Assisted Housing: Calabasas contains two apartment complexes
originally financed through the Los Angeles County Multi-Family Mortgage Revenue
Bond Program – the 698 unit Malibu Canyon apartments and the 600 unit Archstone
Calabasas. Under the County bond program, 20 percent of each project’s units are
required to be provided to low income (80% AMI) households at affordable rents,
equating to a total of 260 income and rent restricted units. While the affordability
restrictions on Archstone Calabasas extend to 2028, the regulatory agreement and
associated affordability restrictions on Malibu Canyon expire in June 2016, placing the
140 low income units in this project at-risk during the planning period.
City staff has been in contact with both the Los Angeles Community Development
Commission (CDC), and the California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC) to
explore options for preserving the at-risk units.       Both Agencies believe the City’s
options are quite limited, and offered the following two suggestions:
     Purchasing affordability from the owner of Malibu Canyon Apartments to
        preserve a portion of the affordable units. However, unless outside funds could
        be used to leverage the City’s Affordable Housing Fund resources, preservation
        will be short lived given the limited amount of City funds available.
     Pursuing transfer of all or a portion of the project to a non-profit purchaser. The
        challenge with this option is that this is a 698-unit resort-style apartment
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

         community. Such a property, or even a portion of such a property, is most likely
         financially out-of-reach for most affordable housing developers.
Given these constraints, the City will proceed with the following steps:
     •  Economic Analyses: Conduct economic analyses to determine the present-value
         cost of buying-down rents.
     •   Meet with Property Owner:      Contact the property owners to discuss City’s
         desire to preserve as affordable housing, and explore incentive options –
         such as rent buy downs - in exchange for long-term use restrictions.
     •   Explore Funding Sources/Program Options: As necessary, contract with the
         California Housing Partnership Corporation to explore outside funding sources
         for a rent buy down and/or other program options for preservation.
     •   Tenant Education: Based on California law, property owners are required to
         give a twelve-month notice of their intent to opt out of low income use
         restrictions. The City will work with tenants to provide education regarding
         tenant rights and conversion procedures.
     2014-2021 Objective: The City’s objective is to preserve the 140 at-risk rental
     units in Malibu Canyon Apartments, and will undertake the following steps: 1)
     conduct economic analysis; 2) meet with property owner; 3) explore funding
     sources/program options; and 4) provide technical assistance and education to
     affected tenants.
7. Condominium Conversion Ordinance: Apartment projects proposed for conversion
to condominium ownership are subject to the City’s Residential Condominium
Conversion regulations (Section 17.34.310). The City mandates a Relocation Assistance
Program to assist displaced tenants in finding equivalent or better housing. Under the
City’s General Plan, the City will not approve any condominium conversion when the
vacancy rate within the City for multifamily housing is less than four percent.
It may be appropriate to strengthen the City’s current Ordinance to preserve the existing
rental housing stock and require affordable units in projects approved for conversion.
Similar to many jurisdictions with inclusionary housing ordinances, Calabasas may want
to extend its inclusionary housing requirements to condominium conversions to provide
affordable homeownership opportunities.
     2014-2021 Objective: Implement the City’s Condominium Conversion
     Ordinance. Evaluate strengthening the current Ordinance to extend the City’s
     inclusionary housing requirements to encompass condominium conversions.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

V.D Variety of Housing Sites
Objective
Provide adequate housing sites through appropriate land use and zoning designations
to accommodate the needs of existing and future Calabasas residents.
General Plan Approach
A key element in satisfying the housing needs of all segments of the community is the
provision of adequate sites for a range of types, sizes and prices of housing. The City’s
2030 Land Use Plan provides for a mix of housing, including single-family homes,
condominiums, apartments, residential/commercial mixed use, and second units.
Future housing growth in Calabasas will be accommodated on vacant residential sites,
development of mixed use infill on key commercial corridors, and annexation of
unincorporated areas adjacent the City.
Policies
Policy V-8     Provide site opportunities for development of housing that respond to the
               diverse housing needs of Calabasas residents and workforce in terms of
               density, location and cost.
Policy V-9     Provide opportunities for multi-family housing and mixed use
               development consistent with the City’s regional housing needs
               requirement (RHNA), as mandated by the State.
Policy V-10    Provide for the development of second units in existing single-family
               neighborhoods to provide additional opportunities for rental housing
               which conforms to the development standards within the underlying
               zone.
Policy V-11    Pursue strategic, phased annexation of unincorporated areas adjacent to
               the City to provide additional growth opportunities.
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

8. Residential Sites Inventory: As part of the Calabasas 2030 General Plan, the City
undertook an extensive public process to identify and designate suitable sites for multi-
family housing as required to accommodate Calabasas’ regional housing needs (RHNA).
Several sites were redesignated for by-right densities of 20 units per acre, and three
areas were designated for residential/commercial mixed use, also permitted at 20
unit/acre densities. These sites have been rezoned consistent with the General Plan as
part of the update to the City’s Development Code in January 2010. These rezoned sites
provide the basis for the 2014-2021 Housing Element residential sites inventory.
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65583.2(h), Calabasas’ multi-family sites that had
been subject to a rezone program to address a prior RHNA shortfall are required to
permit a minimum density of 20 units/acre. The City’s recent experience has been that
developers are seeking to maximize permitted zoned densities, and in some instances
exceed these densities through use of tools such as density bonuses. For example,
Canyon Creek, the 75-unit senior affordable housing project completed in 2011, was
granted a 35% density bonus, with which the developer was able to provide
approximately 19 more units than what the maximum development standards for that
zone allowed at the time of approval. Nonetheless, the City will monitor the impacts of
its 20 unit/acre maximum by-right density on development feasibility and modify as
appropriate.
    2014-2021 Objective: Maintain a current inventory of vacant and underutilized
    residential sites, and provide to interested developers in conjunction with
    information on available development incentives. Monitor the impacts of the City’s
    maximum 20 unit/acre density, report on in the Annual Housing Element Report to
    HCD, and modify the maximum density threshold as appropriate.
9. Second Units: A second unit is an attached or detached dwelling unit which provides
complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons on the same parcel as
the primary single-family dwelling. Second units offer several benefits. First, they
typically rent for less than apartments of comparable size, and can offer affordable
rental options for seniors, college students and single persons. Second, the primary
homeowner receives supplementary income by renting out their second unit, which can
help many modest income and elderly homeowners remain in or afford their homes.
Pursuant to current State law, Calabasas provides for second units through a ministerial,
non-discretionary process, and permits on properties with RS, RR, HM and OS zoning,
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

 V.      HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
subject to the standards for such units specified in Section 17.32.180 of the
Development Code.
While Calabasas continues to process second unit applications, with just four
applications during the last 2008-2012 planning period, the level of activity has been
fairly limited. Considering the benefits second units can offer an aging population in
particular, the City will undertake the following actions to encourage and facilitate the
provision of second units:
     •   Re-evaluate current second unit standards, including requirement for adherence
         to 30% lot coverage maximum. Consider allowance for reduced setbacks and
         deviations from other standards through a minor variance process.
     •   Consider allowing an increased unit size above the current 700 square foot
         maximum subject to a conditional use permit.
     •   Develop design guidelines and sample second unit site plans.
     •   Develop an educational brochure on second units, and discuss with development
         applicants opportunities to integrate second units in project design.
     2014-2021 Objective: By 2015, re-evaluate the City’s current second unit standards
     and amend the Development Code to better facilitate the provision of second units
     for seniors, caregivers, and other extremely low and lower income households.
     Develop an educational brochure and make information available on the City’s
     website, at the City Hall public counter, and at the Senior Center. Prepare design
     guidelines and sample site plans, and encourage residential developers to integrate
     into project design as a form of multi-generational housing.
10. Annexation of Unincorporated Areas: Calabasas has numerous unincorporated
areas adjacent the City boundaries, and has identified annexation of key areas as a goal
of the 2030 General Plan. The Plan specifically identifies Craftsman’s Corner, located
north of the Ventura Freeway and east of Parkway Calabasas as a priority for annexation.
The Land Use Plan designates the 65-acre Craftsman’s Corner area as Mixed Use at a
1.0 FAR, providing for 300 multi-family units.
     2014-2021 Objective: Pursue phased annexation of adjacent unincorporated
     areas to provide additional growth opportunities consistent with infrastructure
     capacities.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

V.E Development of Affordable Housing
Objective
Assist in the provision of a variety of housing types to address the needs of all economic
segments of the Calabasas community.
General Plan Approach
Similar to most of southern California, housing affordable to lower and moderate
income households in Calabasas is not being produced without some level of subsidy
and/or development incentive. The City’s inclusionary housing ordinance requires
market-rate housing developments to provide a portion of units affordable to low and
moderate income households, or to pay an in-lieu housing fee. Commercial
development is also required to pay an impact fee to address the additional demand
generated for affordable housing.
Policies
Policy V-12     Continue to require new housing development to set-aside a portion of
                units for lower and moderate income households through the
                Inclusionary Housing Ordinance. Only if that is not economically feasible,
                allow for payment of an in-lieu fee, but this is considered the less
                desirable alternative.
Policy V-13     Support the provision of affordable housing to employees in Calabasas
                through the Commercial/Industrial Development Impact Fee Program.
Policy V-14     Provide financial and/or regulatory incentives to facilitate the
                development of affordable housing.
Policy V-15     Encourage affordable housing units to be dispersed throughout a project,
                and not grouped together in a single area.
Policy V-16     Encourage use of sustainable and green building design in new and
                existing housing to reduce energy and water consumption.
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

                                                                       2030 GENERAL PLAN
  V.     HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
Programs
11. Inclusionary Housing Program: Calabasas’ Inclusionary Housing Program1 requires
all residential projects of five or more units to provide 5-20% of the total number of
units in a project at affordable rent or sales levels. Instead of requiring a fixed
percentage of all units to be allocated for affordable housing, the City’s program allows
for a range of affordable units depending on whether the units are targeted toward very
low, low or moderate income households.
Where the Planning Commission determines that provision of onsite affordable units is
not feasible, the Commission may approve one or more of the following alternatives to
satisfy the inclusionary requirement:
     •   Offsite construction of affordable units within ½ mile of the project site,
         equal to the number of affordable units that would otherwise be required
         onsite
     •   Offsite construction of special needs housing, such as emergency shelters,
         special care homes, employee housing, senior housing and hospices (each
         offsite special needs unit shall satisfy the requirement of two of the required
         affordable units)
     •   Conversion of market-rate housing to affordable levels through
         establishment of affordability covenants
     •   Rehabilitation of substandard housing deemed uninhabitable by the City
     •   Preservation of existing affordable housing at-risk of conversion to market
         rate within a five-year period
     •   Payment of in-lieu housing fees to be deposited into an Affordable Housing
         Fund to be used for the preservation and development of housing affordable
         to very low, low and moderate income households.
In 2006, the City Council adopted the following updated in-lieu fees to reflect current
market conditions and the increased affordability gap: $17,713 per apartment unit,
$44,947 per condominium/townhome unit, and $62,500 per single-family home. The
higher in-lieu fee has resulted in several developers pursuing ways to include the
affordable units within their projects or at an offsite location.
     2014-2021 Objective: Continue to utilize the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance as
     a tool to integrate affordable housing within market rate developments, or
1 Chapter 17.22 (Affordable Housing) of the Calabasas Municipal Code.
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

    alternatively, to provide affordable units in offsite locations. Provide
    development applicants with information on available options and incentives for
    fulfillment of inclusionary requirements, including density bonuses, and promote
    through the Affordable Housing brochure and webpage. Identify specific projects
    and programs for expenditure of Affordable Housing Fund revenues.
12. Commercial Affordable Housing Impact Fee Program: The Calabasas Housing
Element also establishes the commercial/industrial impact fee program to mitigate the
impact of new commercial/industrial development on the need for affordable housing.
Under this program, new commercial, office or manufacturing development that
introduces new workers into the community and thereby creates a need for more new
housing than is available within a five-mile radius of the site, shall either, as determined
to be appropriate by the Community Development Director:
    •    Design the development as a mixed use project, providing housing
         affordable to employees within the project site; or
    •    Pay an housing impact fee to the Affordable Housing Fund
To date, all new commercial/industrial developments have opted to pay the impact fee.
The City Council increased the commercial impact fees in conjunction with the
inclusionary housing in-lieu fees in 2006 to $1.80 per square foot for retail, and $3.00
per square foot for office, R&D, industrial and warehouse space. Commercial Impact Fee
revenues are deposited into the Affordable Housing Fund.
    2014-2021 Objective: Continue to implement the Commercial Impact Fee
    Program as a means of generating funds to provide affordable housing
    opportunities to Calabasas’ workforce.
13. Affordable Housing Development Assistance: The City’s Affordable Housing Fund,
generated from Inclusionary Housing and Commercial Impact Fee revenues, serves as
the primary source of funds to support the production of affordable housing in the
community. The City has accumulated approximately $2.3 million in its Housing Fund
to date, and has expended $1 million of these funds in support of the 75 unit Old Town
Senior Housing project. The City will continue to support development of affordable
housing through assistance in site identification, and provision of financial and
regulatory incentives.
    2014-2021 Objective: Provide financial, regulatory and site identification
    assistance to facilitate production of affordable housing consistent with the
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

    General Plan. Develop a project concept for expenditure of City Affordable
    Housing Funds, and by 2018, issue a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for project
    development, with a goal to achieve one project within the planning period.
14. Green Building: “Green buildings” are structures that are designed, renovated, re-
used or operated in a manner that enhances resource efficiency and sustainability.
These structures reduce water consumption, improve energy efficiency, lessen a
building’s overall environmental impact, and are more efficient and less costly to
operate (and therefore more affordable). As part of the City’s Green Initiative, Calabasas
has taken a number of significant actions towards becoming a sustainable city,
including:
    •   Adoption of a Green Building Ordinance applicable to all new construction,
        and completion of the Civic Center to the LEED gold standard
    •   Implementation of an aggressive recycling program, with a goal to exceed
        the State mandated 50% diversion rate
    •   Provision of educational information to residents on how to improve home
        energy efficiency and sustainability
    •   Promotion of available green rebates and financial incentives for single-
        family homes, multi-family structures and commercial properties, including
        participation in the County’s new Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)
        Program.
    •   Transition to alternative fuel vehicles for the City’s fleet of automobiles,
        trucks and vans for City employees, and public transit and old fashioned
        trolley cars that serve the public
    •   Adoption of a second-hand smoke ordinance and ban on use of polystyrene
        in food establishments
    •   Conversion of the City’s vehicular fleet to alternative fuel vehicles
    •   Implementation of a “Dark Skies” ordinance to encourage lower level
        illumination during night-time hours
The 2030 General Plan is predicated on making Calabasas a more sustainable
community. The Land Use Element establishes a new Mixed Use designation where
people can live, work and shop without having to rely upon automobiles, and promoting
the integration of residential uses in most commercial districts. The Conservation
Element establishes numerous policies in support of sustainable development,
including:
                                                                            CITY of CALABASAS

V.F Removal of Constraints to Housing
Objective
Address and remove governmental constraints that may hinder or discourage housing
development in Calabasas.
General Plan Approach
As mandated by the state, the Housing Element must address, and, where legally
possible, remove governmental constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement,
and development of housing. Calabasas will implement the following policies and
programs to mitigate governmental constraints on residential development and facilitate
the development of a variety of housing.
Policies
Policy V-17        Offer regulatory incentives and concessions, including density bonuses,
                   to offset or reduce the costs of developing affordable housing.
Policy V-18        Promote the timely processing and approval of residential projects that
                   meet General Plan policies and City regulatory requirements.
Programs
15. Density Bonus Ordinance: Zoning Code Section 17.22 sets forth the City’s density
bonus incentives consistent with State law 2. In summary, applicants of residential
projects of five or more units may apply for a density bonus and additional incentive(s) if
the project provides for one of the following:
     •    10% of the total units for lower income households; or
     •    5% of the total units for very low income households; or
     •    A senior citizen housing development or mobilehome park that limits
          residency based on age requirements for housing for older persons; or
     •    10% of the total dwelling units in a condominium for moderate income
          households.
2 Projects which comply with the City’s inclusionary housing ordinance (and meet the requirements of Code
Sections 17.22.020(A) and 17.22.020(B)) are eligible for density bonuses and incentives.
                                                                                       CITY of CALABASAS

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
 V.     HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
The amount of density bonus varies according to the amount by which the percentage of
affordable housing units exceeds the established minimum percentage, but generally
ranges from 20-35% above the specified General Plan density. In addition to the density
bonus, eligible projects may receive 1-3 additional development incentives, depending
on the proportion of affordable units and level of income targeting. The City offers the
following development incentives in conjunction with the density bonus:
    •   A reduction in parcel development standards (coverage, setback, zero lot line
        and/or reduced parcel sizes)
    •   Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing project
    •   Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the
        City that would result in identifiable cost reductions
Pursuant to State requirements and at the request of the developer, the City will also
permit a reduced parking ratio for density bonus projects. To the extent the density
bonus cannot be accommodated due to the City’s development standards, the City will
waive or modify applicable standards to accommodate the bonus.
For the 75-unit Old Town Senior Housing project approved by City Council in January
2008, the City granted a 35% density bonus (to an FAR of 1.35) and three development
concessions in exchange for provision of 100% lower income units (30-60% AMI).
    2014-2021 Objective: Continue to implement the Affordable Housing Density
    Bonus as a means of enhancing the economic feasibility of affordable housing
    development. As a means of promoting the use of density bonus incentives, the
    City will develop an Affordable Housing brochure and webpage describing
    density bonus provisions, as well as other City housing programs including
    inclusionary zoning, second units, reasonable accommodation and fair housing.
16. Development Code Amendment: In 2010, Calabasas incorporated provisions for
emergency shelters within its Development Code in compliance with SB 2. However, the
City’s Code provisions specified a minimum 1,000 foot separation between shelters,
whereas State statutes do not allow for this. Per State law, no city or county may require
a separation distance greater than 300 feet. Therefore, the City’s Development Code
must be further amended to correct this inconsistency.
    2014-2021 Objective: Amend the Development Code to reduce the separation
    requirement between emergency shelters from 1,000 to 300 feet.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

Objective
Promote Equal Housing Opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion,
ethnicity, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability or household
composition.
General Plan Approach
To adequately meet the housing needs of all segments of the community, the housing
program must include actions that promote housing opportunities for all persons
regardless of race, religion, sex, family size, marital status, ancestry, national origin,
color, age, or physical disability. More generally, this program component entails ways
to further fair housing practices, including accommodations for persons with
disabilities.

                encouraging universal design.
Policy V-21     Support the development and maintenance of affordable senior rental
                and ownership housing and supportive services to facilitate maximum
                independence and the ability of seniors to remain in their homes and/or
                in the community.
Programs
17. Fair Housing: The City uses the services of The Housing Rights Center (HRC), and
staff directs any inquiries regarding fair housing issues or tenant/landlord disputes to
the HRC. The Council provides services to jurisdictions and agencies, as well as the
general public, to further fair housing practices in the sales and rental of housing.

    program outreach by providing Fair Housing brochures at City Hall, the Library and
    Community Center, and incorporating fair housing information in the City’s
    Affordable Housing brochure and the City’s website.
18. Universal Design/Visitability. As Calabasas’ population continues to age, the ability
to provide housing that is accessible to people of all abilities becomes increasingly
important. The majority of the community’s housing stock was built prior to 1991,
when current ADA accessibility standards took effect, and thus it is important for the
City to facilitate the retrofit of existing housing to provide greater accessibility, as well
as to promote accessibility in new construction.
The goal of universal design is to accommodate a wide range of abilities, including
children, aging populations, and persons with disabilities, by providing features in
residential construction that enhance accessibility. Examples of universal design
features include:
    •    Entrances without steps that make it easier for persons to enter the home;
    •    Wider doorways that enhance interior circulation and accommodate strollers and
         wheelchairs;
    •    Lever door handles that are easier to use, especially by parents with an infant or
         persons with arthritis; and
    •    Light switches and electrical outlets that are located at a height more convenient
         and accessible to the elderly.
Housing that is “visitable” is accessible at a basic level, enabling persons with disabilities
to visit the homes of their friends, relatives, and neighbors. Visitability can be achieved
in new construction by utilizing two simple design standards: 1) providing a 32-inch
clear opening in all interior and bathroom doorways; and 2) providing at least one
accessible means of ingress and egress for each unit. As a means of promoting
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

distribute to residential builders.
    2014-2021 Objective: Develop universal design brochure in 2014.
19. Senior Housing Opportunities. Senior citizens (age 65+) have grown to comprise
20 percent of Calabasas’ households, with more than 40 percent of these householders
over the age of 75. Of Calabasas’ approximately 1,500 senior homeowners, nearly 30
percent live alone. And one-quarter of the City’s elderly residents have some type of
disability. Addressing the housing needs of seniors requires strategies which foster
independent living (such as accessibility improvements, universal design, second units,
and rehabilitation assistance, as described under other Housing Element programs), as
well as strategies which encourage the provision of variety of supportive living
environments for seniors of all income levels. Additional supportive services will be
provided through a new Senior Center, which is being planned for a site adjacent to City
Hall.
With recent development of the 75-unit Canyon Creek Apartments for lower income
seniors, and near completion of the 60-unit luxury independent living project on Malibu
Hills Road (Horizons 55), Calabasas will be providing expanded housing options for
active seniors of varying economic means. Integration of mixed use housing
opportunities in the Downtown within walking distance of services can also provide
housing suitable for seniors.
    2014-2021 Objective: Continue to actively pursue opportunities to provide a range
    of housing options to address the diverse needs of Calabasas’ growing number of
    senior citizens. Consult with senior housing and gerontology experts to assist the
    City in adequately planning for these major demographic changes in the population.
20. Housing Opportunities for Persons Living with Disabilities: The North Los Angeles
County Regional Center (NLACRC) is among 21 regional centers operated by the State
Department of Developmental Services to provide services and support for adults and
children with developmental disabilities. The NLACRC currently provides services to 146
developmentally disabled residents within zip code 91302, which encompasses greater
Calabasas.
The Regional Center reports that 60 percent of their adult clients with developmental
disabilities live with their parents, and as these parents age and become more frail, their
adult disabled children will require alternative housing options. The Regional Center
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
 V.     HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2021 UPDATE
has identified several community-based housing types appropriate for persons living
with a developmental disability, including: licensed community care facilities and group
homes; supervised apartment settings with support services; and for persons able to live
more independently, rent subsidized, affordable housing. The City will work with the
NLACRC to implement an outreach program informing Calabasas families of housing
and services available for persons with developmental disabilities, including making
information available on the City’s website.
Calabasas currently supports the provision of housing for its disabled population,
including persons with developmental disabilities, through several means, including:
    •   By-right zoning for licensed residential care facilities (6 or fewer residents) in all
        residential zones, and provisions for larger care facilities (7 or more residents) in
        multi-family residential, mixed use and certain commercial zones, subject to a
        conditional use permit.
    •   Adoption of zoning ordinance provisions to specifically define supportive and
        transitional housing as a residential use of property, and to permit in residential
        zone districts subject only to those restrictions and processing requirements that
        apply to other residential dwellings of the same type in the same zone.
    •   Adoption of procedures for an individual with a disability to request a reasonable
        accommodation from zoning and building standards. No special permit or fee is
        required.
    •   Programs to facilitate affordable housing, including Inclusionary Zoning, Density
        Bonuses, and Affordable Housing Development Assistance.
    2014-2021 Objective: Continue to support a variety of housing types to help
    address the diverse needs of persons living with disabilities, and work with the
    NLACRC to publicize information on available resources for housing and services.
    Evaluate the use of funds available for supportive housing and services in future
    affordable housing projects on an annual basis. Discuss with affordable housing
    providers their ability to provide for persons living with disabilities in housing
    projects, with a goal of applying for and securing funds at least once during the
    planning period.

                           2030 General Plan
VI. CIRCULATION ELEMENT
The Circulation Element of the Calabasas General Plan addresses broad issues of
physical mobility -- how goods and people move about within the community.
Transportation is one of the most pervasive issues of the General Plan, and is related to
land use, community design, air quality, energy consumption, and the City's
infrastructure. Moreover, circulation issues are not simply local concerns, but require
coordination with regional, state, and federal agencies, as well as adjacent communities.
The goal of the Circulation Element is to achieve and maintain a balanced, safe, and
problem-free transportation system that:
    x   Provides easy and convenient access to all areas of the community
    x   Improves present traffic flows while maintaining Calabasas' rural, small town
        sense of place
    x   Protects significant environmental features
    x   Reduces dependence on single occupant automobile travel by providing a
        high level of pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit travel opportunities
    x   Considers the movement of people and vehicles in the design and operation
        of transportation systems
    x   Recognizes the special mobility needs of seniors, youth, and persons with
        disabilities
    x   Preserves a sense of comfort and well-being throughout the community by
        minimizing the intrusiveness of commercial/business park and regional
        traffic on neighborhood streets and quality of life
A number of circulation and capacity problems currently hinder levels of service on the
Ventura Freeway (U.S. 101) and other regionally significant roadway corridors such as
Malibu Canyon Road-Las Virgenes Road. Interchanges on the Ventura Freeway (Valley
Circle Boulevard, Parkway Calabasas, Las Virgenes Road, and Lost Hills Road) are
particularly constrained, largely due to the effects of regional traffic. Because Caltrans
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
VI.     CIRCULATION ELEMENT
controls freeway interchanges, the City must coordinate with Caltrans to develop
appropriate designs for these facilities.
Achieving circulation goals is further complicated by the following conditions:
    x   Residential growth in nearby communities, combined with employment-
        generating development in the San Fernando Valley, West Los Angeles, and
        Ventura County, has resulted in traffic volumes that exceed the design
        capacity of the Ventura Freeway. Thus, regional traffic has spilled onto
        Calabasas' roadway system, creating significant congestion during peak
        commute hours.
    x   Some intersections in the City operate below desired levels of service and
        some road segments carry traffic volumes in excess of their desired service
        level volume.
    x   Physical, environmental, and neighborhood compatibility constraints prevent
        roadway widening in many areas.
    x   Many existing and previously planned roadways traverse sensitive
        environmental areas and cannot be extended or widened without creating
        significant environmental impacts.
    x   Calabasas is primarily a low intensity bedroom community that is part of a
        sprawling metropolitan region. As such, the nature of the community is not
        conducive to widespread transit use.
    x   The City intends to limit future roadway network "improvements" in order to
        protect significant environmental resources and the quality of life within
        existing neighborhoods. Thus, the General Plan defines a circulation network
        that represents a balance between achieving and maintaining desired
        roadway and intersection performance levels, protecting the quality of life in
        existing and future neighborhoods, and preserving the natural environment
        adjacent to area roadways.
VI.A        Vehicular Circulation
Objectives
 Where it is feasible to do so in a manner consistent with the non-circulation policies
    of the General Plan, achieve and maintain level of service (LOS) C for all intersections
    and roadway links within the City except as indicated on Figure VI-1.

General Plan Approach
A key concept in the Calabasas General Plan is that the area's roadway and
transportation system is an integral part of the community's character. Therefore, while
it is important to provide for the movement of traffic, this goal should not compromise
the more important objective of preserving the essential character and natural
environment of the area.
Calabasas rejects the notion that a constantly expanding circulation network and
endless sequence of programmed street improvements can solve the problems of local
traffic congestion. Construction of every roadway needed to move automobiles at ideal
levels of service to support the intensity of future development desired by property
owners would result in an irretrievable loss of significant environmental features and
community character. Expansion of the area's roadway system will not in all cases
respond to the varying landscapes of Calabasas and will tend to preclude non-
automobile modes of travel, potentially resulting in the loss of opportunities to improve
1 “Cut through traffic” is traffic that would need to pass through a local street to reach a collector or arterial
roadway (these street types are shown and defined on Figure VI-1). For example, a new development that
could only gain access to a collector or arterial via an existing local street would generate “through traffic” on
that street.
                                                                                            CITY of CALABASAS

the quality of life in Calabasas. Thus, the City will take a balanced approach to future
transportation improvements. To achieve this sense of balance, the Circulation Element
emphasizes the themes shown on the following page. In addition, the City will:
    x  Expand the capacity of the existing roadway system consistent with the
       Circulation Element where it is warranted, feasible, and environmentally
       prudent to do so.
    x  Provide for the efficient movement of vehicles by designing, constructing,
       and maintaining a roadway circulation network that will function at an
       acceptable LOS C except as indicated on Figure VI-1 (see Table VI-1 for
       general descriptions of levels of service A-F).
    x  Require each new development that would contribute to the need for
       improvements or additions to the City's circulation system to fund its pro-
       rata share of such improvements or additions.
    x  Provide a system of bicycle routes and pedestrian links such that pedestrian
       and bicycle travel become safer and more useful for everyday tasks such as
       travel to shopping, work, and recreational facilities.
    x  Achieve and maintain a mix of land uses that integrates places of residence,
       retail commerce, daily service needs, work, education, and recreation in
       order to minimize vehicle trips and trip lengths.
    x  Limit future development intensity to a level commensurate with maintaining
       the City’s level of service objectives for area roadways and intersections.
    x  Require site plans for individual development projects to minimize or
       eliminate through traffic within existing residential neighborhoods.
    x  Improve the capacity of existing roadways through implementation of
       transportation system management and intelligent transportation system
       concepts.
    x  Continue to participate in developing regional circulation improvement
       measures in cooperation with the State, nearby cities, and the counties of Los
       Angeles and Ventura.
    x  Continue to implement applicable provisions of the Los Angeles County
       Congestion Management Program by requiring development projects to
       analyze and provide appropriate mitigation for traffic impacts on regional
       circulation facilities.

Balance - An efficient transportation system should offer travelers in Calabasas
reasonably efficient automobile traffic distribution and viable alternatives to
automobile travel. Implementation of the Circulation Element will improve the
balance between various modes of transportation by increasing the desirability of
transit, walking, and bicycling.
Coordination Between Land Use, Transportation and Environmental Protection
Programs. The General Plan coordinates land use, transportation, air quality, and
other environmental concepts and strategies. The objectives of the General Plan are
designed to improve traffic flow and local air quality, reduce energy conservation,
and protect sensitive environmental resources by:
    x    Increasing roadway capacity where such increased capacity is feasible
         and environmentally prudent
    x    Reducing the number of automobile trips by continually improving
         transportation system and demand management and providing
         alternatives to automobile use
    x    Reducing the length of automobile trips by integrating land uses
    x    Providing an arrangement of land uses that promote efficient travel
         patterns
    x    Limiting the intensity of future development to that which can be
         accommodated on a roadway system that has been planned to protect
         community character and significant environmental features

  * Volume-to-capacity (V/C) ratio is a measure of the volume of traffic on a roadway or at an intersection
  as compared to the capacity of that roadway or intersection. For example, if the volume of traffic at
  intersection were 900 vehicles per hour and the capacity was determined to be 1,000 vehicles per hour,
  the V/C ratio would be 0.9 (900/1,000).

Freeway diversion during peak hours causes congestion at freeway interchanges and
adjacent surface streets in Calabasas. Intersections and roadway segments affected
by freeway diversion are listed below.
     Interchanges                                   Roadways
     x   Lost Hills Road/Ventura Freeway            x  Lost Hills Road
     x   Las Virgenes Road/Ventura Freeway          x  Las Virgenes Road
     x   Parkway Calabasas/Ventura Freeway          x  Calabasas Road
Calabasas does not encourage the diversion of traffic from the Ventura Freeway to City
surface streets. Nevertheless, it is recognized that the freeway interchanges and
portions of the above-listed roadways immediately adjacent to the Ventura Freeway may
experience higher levels of traffic congestion than would be acceptable in other areas of
the City.
Performance Objectives and Planned Improvements
The performance objective for all City roads and intersections is LOS C except at freeway
interchanges and the two-lane segment of Calabasas Road that traverses Old Town
Calabasas. The performance standard at the freeway interchanges has been set at LOS
D, while the performance standard through the Old Town Calabasas portion of
Calabasas Road has been set at LOS F. The standards are based on the actual function
of these roadways. The freeway interchange standard reflects the fact that the
interchanges are subject to regional influences beyond Calabasas’ control, specifically
the diversion of regional through traffic from the Ventura Freeway. The standard for the
Old Town portion of Calabasas Road reflects the City’s desire to maintain the character
of that roadway despite the high levels of traffic congestion.
Calabasas will continue to require new developments to mitigate their traffic impacts,
either through construction of new roadways, reduction in demand for vehicular travel,
or payment of mitigation fees, which are to be based on the projected costs for planned
system improvements and each new development’s proportional share of the total
traffic affecting the location where the improvement is planned. Planned improvements
will be necessary to mitigate traffic impacts associated with proposed developments so
that an acceptable level of service can be maintained. The mitigation requirement will
continue to be proportional to the impact created by each new development and will
recognize a fee credit to developers who construct portions of ultimate capacity
enhancement improvements.

VI.      CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Seven locations have been identified as “Critical Intersections and Roadway Corridors”
because of their importance with respect to overall vehicle movement in Calabasas. In
some of these locations, expansion of the roadway network, if not properly scaled to the
local neighborhood and environmental conditions, could adversely affect Calabasas'
quality of life. These "Critical lntersections and Roadway Corridors" include:
     x   Old Topanga Road/Mulholland Highway                    x  Agoura Road
     x   Calabasas Road/Parkway Calabasas                       x  Thousand Oaks Boulevard
     x   Lost Hills Road                                        x  Mureau Road
     x   Las Virgenes Road
For each of these critical locations, specific provisions have been formulated to enhance
the roadway's capacity while protecting significant environmental features and adjacent
neighborhood areas. Table VI-2 illustrates potential improvements to the specific
“critical intersection and roadway corridors.” Additional improvements other than those
listed, are to be thoroughly analyzed and coincide with the objectives of the City.

                              Topanga Canyon Road, between Mulholland Highway and Park Ora,
                              limits this route’s capacity.
                         x    Recognize that Mulholland Highway, west of Old Topanga Canyon
                              Road is a rural, twisting route with many driveways, and provides
                              access to schools. As a result, the actual capacity of the roadway is
                              less than its theoretical capacity.
                         x    Maintain the rural character of lands along Old Topanga Canyon

Traffic Calming
Calabasas believes in using “traffic calming” techniques to slow traffic on local roadways
or, in some cases, divert traffic from roadways not intended to accommodate high traffic
levels. The effect of traffic calming is to create a safer, quieter environment for adjacent
land uses. Under the City’s Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program, Calabasas has
implemented various techniques to reduce traffic speeds and cut-through-traffic on
residential streets. Traffic calming techniques have included, among others, speed
humps, roundabouts, and neck-downs. Speed humps are raised roadway pavement
areas running across the entire width of a street that normally have a height of three to
four inches and a length of approximately twelve feet. Roundabouts are at-grade
intersections having a one-way circular roadway around a curbed central island. Neck-
downs consist of landscaped islands used to either narrow down a roadway, or to define
a parking lane on either side of a roadway. They can be used to define entries into local
residential neighborhoods, thereby discouraging through traffic, and to create subtle
changes in direction along existing roadways.

VI.B        Bikeway System
Objective
Develop and maintain a comprehensive and safe bicycle system that:
    x   Provides recreational opportunities and can serve as a partial alternative to
        automobile use
    x   Connects major destinations within and outside of the City
    x   Provides appropriate connections to regional routes and the bicycle facilities
        within adjacent jurisdictions
General Plan Approach
Creating a system of bicycle facilities for Calabasas is important, both as recreation and
transportation. The hilly nature of Calabasas is a significant constraint to the
widespread use of bicycles within the Calabasas area. However, despite the area's hilly
terrain, many Calabasas residents desire an expanded bikeway system that can be used
both as a means of transportation and for recreation.
In recognition of the importance of bikeways, the City has adopted a Bicycle Master Plan
that identifies existing and proposed routes within Calabasas, as well as routes
connecting to similarly designated routes in neighboring communities (see Figure VI-2).
By providing bicycle routes throughout the City, riders will be able to travel with a
greater sense of security. Thus, the City's vision is to establish a system of bicycle
routes along major north-south and east-west routes within the City as shown in the
Bicycle Master Plan. This system has been designed to encourage bicycle travel as an
alternative when:
    x   Commuting to school or work
    x   Riding for recreation or fitness along roadways
    x   Riding off-road in the hills and mountains of Calabasas
To facilitate the use of bicycles in Calabasas, the City will:
    x   Continue to develop and expand the system of bicycle facilities in order to
        connect residential areas to schools, parks, and employment and shopping

The State of California identifies bicycle facilities in three classifications, according to
the degree of exclusiveness with
which the paths are preserved for
bicycle use. The classifications do                       Bicycle Facility Types
not constitute a hierarchy of
bikeways. Each class has its                    Class I - path on a right-of-way completely
appropriate application, and may                separated from roadways
include other uses such as hiking,
equestrian and pedestrian modes.                Class II - striped one-way lanes set aside
                                                for bicycle travel on roadways
Class I Bike Path: A Class I Bike Path
                                                Class III – on-road routes marked by signs
serves corridors which are not                  only
served by streets and highways or
where wide rights-of-way exist,
permitting such facilities to be built
separate from roadway traffic. These alternative transportation routes may serve a
variety of users. Bike paths can provide recreational opportunities for bicycles,
equestrian and pedestrian users, or in some instances, may serve as high speed
commute routes where vehicle cross traffic can be minimized. Existing opportunities for
the designation of bike paths in the City is somewhat limited because of environmental
considerations.
Class II Bike Lanes: Class II Bike Lanes are intended to delineate the on-street rights-
of-way assigned to bicyclists and motorists, and to provide for more predictable
movements of each. Where adequate roadway width is or can be made available, Class II

in many areas, all roadways that do not contain Class II Bike lanes are considered Class
III Bike Routes, even if specific signage is not provided.
Policies
VI-14 Encourage bicycling by preserving existing bicycle paths, lanes, and routes, and
         developing new and expanded bicycle facilities that offer direct connections
         between residential and non-residential areas, in accordance with the Calabasas
         Bicycle Master Plan.
VI-15 Ensure that parking for bicycles is available at major destinations to promote
         bicycle riding for commuting and recreation.
VI-16 Make the safety and convenience of bicycle riders the primary concern with
         regard to determining locations for bicycle facilities.
VI-17 Implement a safe routes to school program to help ensure that students can
         safely walk or bicycle to and from school.
VI.C         Pedestrian Circulation
Objective
Continue to enhance Calabasas’ pedestrian circulation system to ensure that walking is
a viable transportation option for all City residents.
General Plan Approach
Land use patterns and associated urban design elements influence how much walking
can safely and effectively occur in a community. Circulation systems that are designed
with pedestrians in mind tend to increase outdoor activity and community interaction.
In order to be effective in inducing people to walk, pedestrian paths need to be
interesting, enjoyable, and provide access to destinations. Creating a network of paths
that connect key features such as parks, schools, civic facilities, shops, and services is
vital to the success of encouraging people to walk. Those most in need of pedestrian
access include children, teenagers, the elderly, and those who cannot afford a car or
choose not to drive.

The pedestrian system in Calabasas consists of sidewalks, crosswalks, access ramps,
overpasses, and tunnels. The system also includes neighborhood and park path
systems, and dedicated trail facilities that are shared with bicyclists and other users.
Although pedestrian facilities are available in many parts of the community, some areas
lack sidewalks, while other pedestrian connections are discontinuous. It is the City’s
intent to continue to improve the pedestrian system in Calabasas by adding and
enhancing sidewalks and multi-use paths where these are lacking or in need of repair,
requiring community design standards that do not inhibit walking, and implementing
traffic calming in appropriate locations. In particular, the City intends to improve
pedestrian systems in the City’s commercial and mixed use districts. Such
improvements will be made over time as properties redevelop.
Policies
VI-18 Promote pedestrian system improvements that create and sustain vibrant and
         active streets in major places of activity as well as providing direct connections
         between residential and non-residential areas.
VI-19 Provide neighborhood streets that are walkable and that contribute to the
         physical safety and comfort of pedestrians.
VI-20 Develop an inventory of and plan for implementing needed pedestrian system
         improvements and possible pedestrian system enhancements.
VI-21 Require new development in Calabasas to incorporate pedestrian-oriented
         circulation features, as described in the Community Design Element. Such
         features should include amenities that make walking not only available, but
         desirable.
VI-22 As commercial and mixed use districts redevelop over time, consider re-
         designing roadways in these areas to improve pedestrian circulation (possible
         re-design options include, but are not limited to, roadway narrowing, crosswalk
         enhancements, streetscape treatments that buffer pedestrians from traffic, and
         widened sidewalks). Roadways should be re-designed only if the re-design
         would not create unacceptable levels of service or unsafe conditions for vehicular
         traffic.

VI.D         Transit
Objectives
 Continue to provide a local transit system that meets the changing needs of the
     community and provides access to the employment centers, commercial areas,
     parks, and other gathering places for all City residents.
 Continue to cooperate with regional transit agencies to provide transit service to
     other parts of the Southern California region.
General Plan Approach
Public transit provides a variety of economic, community, environmental, and health
benefits. For example, it can help establish corridors that become natural focal points
for economic and social activities. These activities help create strong neighborhood
centers that are more economically stable, safe and productive. Transit also enhances
equity by creating jobs, getting people to work, and providing quality transportation
access for individuals who cannot afford automobiles. Finally, use of public transit
saves energy and reduces congestion and air pollution by reducing vehicle miles
traveled.
Calabasas has a well-developed transit system, given the City’s suburban setting. There
are no major deficiencies in the transit system. The City’s Transportation Department
provides a free shuttle service with lines operating throughout the City. The City also
runs the Calabasas Trolley, a free service that runs an hour-long loop connecting the
east and west sides of the City on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The City is served
by various Los Angeles County Metro routes that provide regional service between
Calabasas and the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles.
Transit use is high in Calabasas relative to other similar communities. According to
surveys conducted by the City, 18% of students ride the bus or shuttle to school. The
same surveys showed that 16% of the community utilizes the City shuttles, with 6%
riding the shuttles at least once a week.
It is the City’s intent to continue to provide a variety of transit options that meet the
needs of Calabasas residents and businesses as well as to participate in development
and operation of regional transit systems. Transit needs are likely to evolve over time as
Calabasas’ population ages. The City will continue to monitor the established transit
system and adjust transit programs to meet changing needs.

VII. SAFETY ELEMENT
The Safety Element is concerned with identifying and, whenever possible, reducing the
impact of natural and man-made hazards that may threaten the health, safety, and
property of Calabasas residents, business owners, and visitors. The element
emphasizes hazards reduction and accident prevention for known hazards and potential
disasters. In addition, the element emphasizes the importance of reducing risk and the
effects of disaster prevention and/or preparedness.
The Safety Element establishes mechanisms to reduce death, injuries, property damage
and the economic and social dislocation resulting from hazards such as fires, floods,
earthquakes, landslides, and other hazards. Hazards are an unavoidable aspect of life,
and the Safety Element cannot eliminate risk completely. Instead, the Element contains
policies to minimize the level of risk.
Numerous potential hazards that could affect life and property are present in and
around Calabasas. Safety hazards can be generally grouped into two categories:
naturally-occurring and man-made. Some hazards – flooding, for example – can be
categorized as both naturally-occurring and man-made. Flooding could occur naturally
as a result of intense precipitation in a short duration which causes rivers, natural
drainage courses, or low-lying areas to overflow affecting surrounding properties.
Man-made flooding could occur as a result of failure of a dam, obstruction of a natural
drainage course, to a fire hydrant being broken in an automobile accident.

Objective
Minimize the potential for loss of life, physical injury, property damage, and social
disruption resulting from seismic ground shaking and other geologic events.
General Plan Approach
Like all of Southern California, Calabasas is subject to substantial seismic hazards.
These seismic hazards can affect the structural integrity of buildings and utilities, and,
in turn, cause property damage and
potential loss of life. Although it is not
possible to prevent earthquakes, their

precise time of such an event cannot be
accurately predicted.
Calabasas is not located within an Alquist-Priolo Fault-Rupture Hazard Zone
(California Geological Survey, 1999). However, a number of active and potentially
active faults are located within 25 miles of the City. A partial list of these faults
includes:

Although no known faults are located within Calabasas, the aforementioned fault
systems could cause property damage, possibly resulting in injury and loss of life in the
event of a major earthquake due to ground motion. The level of impact resulting from
any seismic activity will depend on factors such as: distance from epicenter, earthquake
magnitude, and characteristics of soils and subsurface geology. Figure VII-2 depicts the
seismic hazard zones delineated by the California Department of Conservation.
The City will require building
design to be commensurate with
                                             The California Building Code (CBC) is

buildings and buildings that serve
needed disaster recovery functions
need to be designed to withstand a greater degree of groundshaking than low
occupancy, low risk buildings. For all buildings, once environmental protection policies
are met, construction techniques will be regulated according to the latest edition of the
California Building Code (CBC) with City of Calabasas amendments or increased
requirements as necessary to reduce geologic and seismic risks to acceptable levels.
Portions of Calabasas may be susceptible to liquefaction (see Figure VII-2). Liquefaction
results when water-saturated, sandy unstable soils are subject to intense shaking, such
as that caused by an earthquake. These soils lose cohesiveness, causing unreinforced
structures to fail. The primary factors for increased liquefaction susceptibility include
areas subject to high seismicity, shallow groundwater, and young, poorly consolidated
sandy alluvium. When this type of sandy alluvium is present, liquefaction susceptibility
is generally considered high if groundwater depth is less than ten feet beneath the
ground surface, moderate if ground water depth is between ten and thirty feet, and low
if groundwater is between thirty and fifty feet deep. Liquefaction usually is not
considered a significant hazard if the groundwater table is more than 50 feet below the
ground surface level.
The topography within Calabasas varies and features vertical slopes and steep canyons.
The major environmental factors controlling stability of the steeper hillsides include
precipitation, topography, geology, soils, vegetation, and man-made alterations of the
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

natural topography. Development on hillside areas where steep slopes are present can
increase rates of erosion and exacerbate landslide hazards that may threaten structures.
However, methods contained within the CBC reduce negative impacts associated with
development on slopes.
Although it is not possible to eliminate all the risks associated with seismic related
hazards, it is the intent of the Safety Element to use available tools, such as geotechnical
studies, appropriate land-use decisions and adequate building codes to reduce risks.
Policies
VII-1    Incorporate adequate mitigation measures into proposed development projects
         to achieve an acceptable level of risk from potential seismic hazards resulting
         from ground motion or fault rupture.
VII-2    Emphasize prevention of physical and economic loss associated with
         earthquakes and other geologic disasters through early identification of
         potentially hazardous conditions prior to project approval.
VII-3    Facilitate rapid physical and economic recovery following an earthquake,
         geologic disaster or wildland fire through early investigation of the event and
         implementation of effective new standards for design of structures.
VII-4    Discourage development within potential landslide areas and areas with severe
         soils limitations as the City’s preferred management strategy, and as a higher
         priority than attempting to implement engineering solutions.
VII-5    Where engineering solutions to slope stability constraints are required,
         implement landform grading programs so as to recreate a natural hillside
         appearance.
VII-6    Prior to approval of development projects within the liquefaction or landslide
         hazard zones depicted on Figure VII-2 or other areas identified by the City
         Engineer as having significant liquefaction or landslide hazards, require
         applicants to prepare site-specific liquefaction and/or landslide studies and
         mitigation. Such studies shall be subject to review and approval by the City
         Engineer.

VII.B Stormwater Management and Flooding
Objective
Minimize the potential for loss of life, physical injury, property damage, and social
disruption resulting from flooding.
General Plan Approach
Flooding is the inundation of normally dry land as a result of a rise in the level of
surface waters or the rapid accumulation of storm-water runoff; it becomes a hazard
when the flow of water has the potential to damage property and threaten human life or
health. Flood risks are greatest, and flood hazards most severe, in winter, when water
bodies are usually full and soils saturated. Flooding is primarily a natural process and,
therefore, difficult to prevent.
However, land use and development
decisions have a significant effect on
                                                   A 100-year flood is calculated to be the

that crosses multiple jurisdictional
boundaries.
Figure VII-3 depicts the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood zones in
Calabasas. A small portion of western Calabasas is within the 100-year floodplain;
however, the majority of the City is not located within any designated flood zones.
Calabasas will facilitate efforts with local, state, and federal agencies, including special
districts, to address flooding issues. Development will generally be discouraged in
flood-prone areas and individual developers in the City will be required to mitigate their
potential contributions to downstream flooding problems.
Policies
VII-7      Incorporate adequate mitigation measures into proposed development projects
           to achieve an acceptable level of risk from potential flooding hazards.

2030 GENERAL PLAN
VII.     SAFETY ELEMENT
VII-8     Discourage development within flood hazard areas and encourage retention of
          natural drainage as the City’s preferred management strategy, and as a higher
          priority than attempting to implement engineering solutions.
VII-9     Ensure that new flood control and drainage facilities as well as improvements
          to existing facilities are consistent with the General Plan’s environmental
          protection standards.
VII-10    For discretionary development projects, limit new impervious surfaces to those
          that will not individually or cumulatively increase harmful runoff into natural
          stream channels downstream.
VII-11    Setbacks from stream beds should be sufficient to avoid possible adverse
          effects associated with future stream bank erosion.
VII.C        Fire Hazards
Objective
Minimize the potential for loss of life, physical injury, property damage, and social
disruption resulting from urban and wildland fires.
General Plan Approach
Fire is a unique hazard in that it can result both from natural processes and from the
intentional or accidental actions of people. There are three main types of fire hazards:
(1) wildfires, which affect open space and development on the urban fringe; (2)
structural fires, which occur in buildings; and (3) industrial fires, which generally result
from the ignition of flammable materials. While fires are not entirely preventable, it is
possible to create conditions that reduce the chances of fire and that facilitate efficient
response in case fire breaks out. When a fire does ignite, quick response from
firefighters and an adequate supply of water are essential in minimizing damage.
General factors that affect an area’s risk from fire hazards include its location, land
uses, distance from fire stations, ease of accessibility by fire-fighting equipment, and
adequacy of water supply. More specifically, the extent and severity of damage by fires
are determined by several key factors affecting vulnerability. All of Calabasas is
designated as a very high fire hazard zone.

Measures in the CBC reduce fire hazards in structures. These include use of specific
building construction materials, fire separation walls, building separation, and use of
fire sprinklers. Included in development regulations are requirements for minimum
road widths that provide adequate access for firefighting equipment and evacuation of
residents, as well as clearance around structures (fuel modification areas) to prevent the
rapid spread of fire.
Water availability and peak load water supply are essential in combating wildfires. Peak
load water supply refers to the sum total of water required for fire flow, operational
daily consumption, and emergency storage. As development occurs, peak load water
supply reserves will need to be increased. Since increasing demands on groundwater
basins can create deficiencies in local water supplies, it will be necessary for Calabasas
to obtain additional water in the future from sources such as the State Water Project to
ensure that peak load water supply demands are met.
Policies
VII-12    Emphasize prevention of physical and economic loss associated with wildland
          fire through early identification of potentially hazardous conditions prior to
          project approval.
VII-13    Promote fire prevention as the City’s preferred management strategy; facilitate
          programs that are aimed at the prevention of fires.
VII-14    Discourage development and encourage sensitive siting of structures within
          hazardous fire areas as higher priorities than attempting to implement fuel
          modification techniques that would adversely affect significant biological
          resources.
VII-15    Require design and siting of new development within areas subject to wildfires
          in a manner that minimizes the threat of loss from wildland fire.
VII-16    Ensure that new development is designed so as to facilitate access by
          firefighting equipment and to maintain adequate evacuation routes.
VII-17    Do not permit development within areas that do not have adequate water
          pressure or fire flows until sufficient pressure and fire flows can be reliably
          provided.

gas exposure.
General Plan Approach
Radon is a cancer-causing natural radioactive gas that is invisible, odorless, and
tasteless. Radon forms from the radioactive decay of small amounts of uranium
naturally present in the rocks and soil. It can affect indoor air quality, particularly in
mountainous areas. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings and is
a leading cause of non-smoking lung cancer deaths. The aim of the Safety Element is to
minimize risks from radon exposure.
The California Geological Survey has developed a radon potential zone map for southern
Los Angeles County. The map, shown on Figure VII-4, is based on the relative radon
potentials of different geologic units. Geologic unit radon potentials were evaluated
using short-term indoor-radon measurement data, provided by the Department of
Health Services (DHS) Radon Program and airborne radiometric data from the National
Uranium Resource Evaluation Project conducted in the 1970s and early 1980s. The DHS
indoor-radon data from Southern Los Angeles County range less than 0.3 picocuries per
liter (pCi/L) to 159.6 pCi/L. The radon level at which the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) recommends considering remedial actions for radon reduction in
residences is 4.0 pCi/L. The City of Calabasas is reported to have a moderate potential
for radon levels to exceed 4.0 pCi/L (Dept. of Conservation, California Geological
Survey, 2005).
Policies

VII.E        Hazardous Materials
Objective
Protect life and property from potential short- and long-term adverse effects associated
with the transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials within
Calabasas.
General Plan Approach
Calabasas is traversed by a major transportation artery: US Highway 101.
Transportation of hazardous materials occurs along this route, thus potentially exposing
people to potential catastrophic events. Hazardous chemicals or gases may be released
accidentally at an industrial site or from trucks transporting hazardous materials. Such
an event could require evacuation, and depending on the hazard and its severity,
evacuation may be required for a few hours or several days. The release of hazardous
materials requires an immediate response in order to protect human health and safety,
and/or the environment. The Emergency Operations Section of the Los Angeles County
Fire Department’s Health Hazardous Materials Division (HHMD) provides 24-hour
emergency response services to hazardous materials incidents occurring throughout Los
Angeles County.
The Los Angeles County Hazardous Waste Management Plan, which the City has
adopted, requires businesses that handle, store, or generate hazardous materials to
obtain certain permits and prepare certain plans based on the amount of hazardous
materials involved. The Inspection Section of the HHMD permits and inspects hazardous
material handling and hazardous waste- generating businesses to ensure compliance
with federal, state and local laws and regulations.
The City will continue to maintain permitting requirements that parallel County
requirements for businesses within Calabasas that handle, store, or generate hazardous
waste. Recognizing that the residential sector is a major producer of hazardous wastes,
Calabasas has also implemented a household hazardous waste collection program so
that household hazardous wastes are collected and disposed of in a safe manner. This
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

program will continue to be implemented and will be expanded as appropriate to
address the City’s hazardous waste disposal needs.
Policies
VII-21    Manage activities within Calabasas involving the transport, use, store or
          dispose of hazardous materials in a responsible manner that protects public
          health, safety, and the environment.
VII-22    Promote the availability of safe and legal options for the management of
          hazardous wastes generated by businesses and households within and
          adjacent Calabasas.
VII-23    Promote community education and understanding of sound management
          practices for the storage, handling, use, and disposal of hazardous materials.
VII-24    Enforce the requirement that industrial facilities and construction sites have
          adequate Hazardous Materials Handling and Spill Response Plans to ensure that
          the goals of pollutant control are consistent with the City’s public safety needs
          and the General Plan’s water quality objectives.
VII.F       Disaster Response
Objective
Maintain a system of emergency services and disaster response preparedness that will
save lives, protect property, and facilitate recovery with a minimum of social disruption
following both minor emergencies and major catastrophic events.
General Plan Approach
The management of emergencies and disasters consists of three distinct phases: (1)
mitigation of potential hazards and pre-event preparedness (including event
forecasting, response planning, training and public education); (2) response during or
soon after the event, most often by fire, police and medical-services personnel and
trained volunteers (also includes public alerts and notification, evacuation, search and
rescue, and critical, short-term assistance to victims); and (3) post-event recovery,
which generally includes debris removal, re-establishment of public and private
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

services, financial and other longer-term types of assistance to victims, reconstruction,
and collection and analysis of data related to the event.
The City will continue to maintain an up-to-date emergency response operations plan to
detail Calabasas’ planned response to emergency situations. Local disaster response
will continue to be coordinated under the Calabasas Emergency Response Program
(CERP), a volunteer program made up of home owner representatives, medical
professionals, communications experts, and business representatives. The CERP
provides information to Calabasas residents so they can be prepared for potential
emergencies. Following a disaster, the CERP’s role is to assess and communicate
neighborhood conditions to the City’s Emergency Operations Center. The CERP medical
disaster team also provides basic first aid services from medical cache (first aid storage
units) located throughout Calabasas (locations include Grape Arbor Park, De Anza Park,
Calabasas Tennis and Swim Club, Calabasas High School, and Calabasas Hills Park).
Mutual aid agreements with regional agencies will be maintained to ensure the City’s
ability to receive assistance when demands for emergency services are greater than the
City’s available resources. The City will also continue to utilize the Emergency
Management Information System (EMIS), a computer database system that provides
detailed, real time information about emergencies from the County Emergency
Operations Center.
Policies
VII-25    Continue to implement local preparedness planning and operations and
          participate in multi-jurisdictional disaster preparedness planning and
          operations.
VII-26    Coordinate planning activities with adjacent jurisdictions to promote the
          provision of quality medical and emergency medical care facilities and to
          identify and revise possible unnecessary constraints on their development.
VII-27    Follow or adhere to Standardized Emergency Management System (SEMS), a
          framework for standardizing emergency-response procedures in California to
          facilitate the flow of information and resources among agencies in responding
          to multi-agency emergencies.

VIII. NOISE ELEMENT
The purpose of the Noise Element is to limit the exposure of the community to
excessive noise level. The Noise Element is to be used to guide decisions concerning
land use and the location of common sources of excessive noise levels. To that end, the
Noise Element identifies and addresses noise sources and establishes projected noise
levels for significant noise generators.
Vehicle traffic, especially along the Ventura Freeway corridor, is by far the greatest
source of noise affecting Calabasas residents. Other sources include traffic on arterial
roadways, such as Las Virgenes Road, Lost Hills
Road, Calabasas Road, Old Topanga Canyon Road,
and Mulholland Highway. In particular, truck traffic         Noise is generally defined

generally considered sensitive receptors where
excessive noise can interfere with normal activities.
VIII.A       Noise Background
Noise level (or volume) is generally measured in decibels (dB) using the A-weighted
sound pressure level (dBA). The A-weighting scale is an adjustment to the actual sound
power levels to be consistent with that of human hearing response, which is most
sensitive to frequencies around 4,000 Hertz (about the highest note on a piano) and less
sensitive to low frequencies (below 100 Hertz). Table VIII-1 lists a range of typical noise
levels that one may encounter.
Sound pressure level is measured on a logarithmic scale with the 0 dB level based on the
lowest detectable sound pressure level that people can perceive (an audible sound that
is not zero sound pressure level). Based on the logarithmic scale, a doubling of sound
energy is equivalent to an increase of 3 dB and a sound that is 10 dB less than the
ambient sound level has no effect on ambient noise. Because of the nature of the

human ear, a sound must be about 10 dB greater than the reference sound to be judged
as twice as loud. In general, a 3 dB change in community noise levels is noticeable,
while 1-2 dB changes generally are not perceived. Quiet suburban areas typically have
noise levels in the range of 40-50 dBA, while noise levels along arterial streets are in the
50-60+ dBA range. Normal conversational levels are in the 60-65 dBA range, and
ambient noise levels greater than 65 dBA can interrupt conversations.
In addition to the instantaneous measurement of sound levels, the duration of sound is
important since sounds that occur over a long period of time are more likely to be an
annoyance or cause direct physical damage or environmental stress. One of the most
frequently used noise metrics that considers both duration and sound power level is the
equivalent noise level (Leq). The Leq is defined as the single steady A-weighted level
that is equivalent to the same amount of energy as contained in the actual fluctuating
levels over a period of time (essentially, the average noise level). Typically, Leq is
summed over a one-hour period.

The time period in which noise occurs is also important since noise that occurs at night
tends to be more disturbing than noise that occurs during the daytime. The Community
Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) recognizes this fact by weighting hourly Leqs over a 24-
hour period. Essentially, the CNEL is a 24-hour average noise level that adds 5 dB to
evening (7 PM to 10 PM) noise levels and 10 dB to nighttime (10 PM to 7 AM) noise
levels to account for the greater sensitivity to noise during those time periods.
Depending on the type of land use that is exposed to such unwanted sounds, noise can
have little effect or a substantially adverse effect on the use of land. Land uses that are
generally more sensitive to noise are those where people spend considerable time
inhabiting a site and would be disturbed by loud single event or continuous noise
influences. These uses include residences, schools, parks, hospitals, libraries,
hotels/motels, places of worship, and auditoriums. Land uses that are not typically
noise sensitive are those that generate noise themselves or that are otherwise resilient
to loud noise exposures. Such uses include active recreation centers, offices,
commercial retail centers, business parks, utility stations, etc.
Land use types with the greatest sensitivity to noise typically have more stringent noise
standard requirements, while non-noise sensitive land uses or uses with reduced noise
sensitivity have less restrictive standards. Where the addition of a new noise source has
a potential adverse affect on an existing use (particularly a sensitive noise receptor), the
new noise and its source will be examined to determine if any noise standards, onsite or
offsite, will be exceeded. Where noise standards will be exceeded, mitigation must be
included as part of the proposed project to reduce noise levels to below threshold
criteria. Some traditional approaches to addressing noise issues, such as sound walls,
may not be acceptable in certain circumstances because of conflicts with other
community objectives.
VIII.B       Noise Levels in Calabasas
Figure VIII-1 shows noise levels measured at 20 locations throughout the City in 2007.
Table VIII-2 identifies those sites measured on Figure VIII-1. Figure VIII-2 displays
existing noise contours for Calabasas, which are estimates of noise levels based on the
measured levels shown in combination with modeling of roadway noise based on 2007
traffic data. The highest noise levels in Calabasas are generally adjacent to the Ventura
Freeway and arterial roadways, while residential neighborhoods generally experience
relatively low noise levels.

Open space, hillside management, and low density residential areas in Calabasas are
areas where ambient noise levels are low. Such areas allow retreat from urban activities
by providing tranquility and a sense of peacefulness. These areas also contain
biological resources and diversity that are important environmental considerations to
the Calabasas community. Wildlife moves between plant communities or habitats and
open space areas along corridor systems. Generally absent from open space areas is
urban noise encroachment.
VIII.C      Noise Objective and Policies
Objective
Achieve and maintain noise compatible land use relationships consistent with the nature
and character of individual land uses.
General Plan Approach
The Noise Element establishes noise compatible land use performance standards for the
range of uses present in and around Calabasas. These standards were used in creating
the General Plan Land Use Map to promote an appropriate pattern of land uses that
preserves a quiet environment where such an environment is desired. Uses where a
quiet environment is particularly desirable include residences, schools, medical facilities,
and hotels.
The Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments matrix (F      Figure VIII-3)
establishes noise levels that are compatible with new uses proposed in the City. This
matrix will be used to determine whether a proposed new use would be compatible with
the ambient noise environment in which it is proposed as well as whether or not the
proposed new use would create noise compatibility conflicts with established uses.
In addition to addressing the potential noise impacts associated with new development,
the City intends to proactively address existing noise issues and those that could arise
between existing developments. To this end, the City intends to identify and, where
possible, mitigate the effects of existing noise sources, such as the Ventura Freeway. As
part of the Development Code update, the City will also establish a noise ordinance that
governs allowable noise levels on private properties in Calabasas.
As noted above, noise encroachment into open space, hillside mountainous, and low
density residential areas can potentially destroy the tranquility associated with open
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

space (including the ability to retreat from the stress of urban activity) and cause wildlife
displacement where urban noises and influences exceed the tolerance levels of certain
species. It is the desire of the City to prohibit the encroachment of urban noise into
these areas, thereby retaining the tranquility of open space and low density residential
areas as well as the wildlife movement and biological diversity that is present in such
areas. Consequently, projects that cause a significant adverse effect on open space,
hillside management, or low density residential areas that cannot be mitigated will not
be allowed.
Policies
VIII-1    Use the Land Use Compatibility for Community Noise Environments matrix
          (F
           Figure VIII-3) to determine the compatibility of land use when evaluating
          proposed new land uses in the City. The matrix shall be used as a guide to
          assist in determining the acceptability of noise for existing or proposed land
          use.
          In this matrix, the degree of acceptability is categorized by noise exposures
          that are normally acceptable, conditionally acceptable, normally unacceptable
          and clearly unacceptable. Action on proposed projects shall be guided
          according to the degree of land use/noise acceptability as follows.
          x    Normally Acceptable: The potential for project approval should not be
               encumbered by land use/noise compatibility issues
          x    Conditionally Acceptable: The potential for project approval should not be
               encumbered by land use/noise compatibility issues, provided the applicant
               has included measures or conditions that are acceptable to the Planning
               Commission or appropriate planning authority and ultimately result in land
               use/noise compatibility.
          x    Normally Unacceptable: The potential for project denial will be considered
               likely as a result of land use/noise incompatibility, unless extraordinary
               circumstances are present that do not involve adjacent properties or uses.
               Overriding project benefits cannot be utilized to justify extraordinary
               circumstances.
          x    Clearly Unacceptable: If a project falls into this category, it shall not be
               approved due to land use/noise compatibility issues.
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

VIII. NOISE ELEMENT
VIII-2   If a proposed development project that will create or affect existing noise
         sensitive land uses is proposed in a location that is within a 60 dBA or greater
         CNEL noise contour, as determined by independent experts or consultants
         hired by the City, require that the project applicant demonstrate that, unless
         mitigation is available: (1) the project will not generate noise exceeding the
         “normally acceptable” range for existing uses on adjacent properties; and (2)
         adjacent influences will not generate ambient noise on the project site that
         exceeds the “normally acceptable” range for the proposed use.
VIII-3   Locate and design noise-sensitive land uses and noise generators in such a
         manner that noise objectives will be maintained.
VIII-4   Emphasize the following as the City's preferred noise management strategies,
         and as higher priorities than construction of noise barriers:
         x    Avoiding placement of noise-sensitive uses within noisy areas
         x    Increased setbacks from noise sources
         x    Building orientation that shields noise sensitive portions of a project from
             noise sources
         x    Use of sound attenuating architectural design and building features
VIII-5   lncorporate noise considerations into the design of transportation systems
         and ensure that noise impacts associated with roadway extensions and
         capacity enhancement projects are mitigated to acceptable levels.
VIII-6   lncorporate consideration of noise impacts to significant wildlife habitats into
         the development/environmental review process.
VIII-7   Prohibit the creation of helicopter pads, except where needed for emergency
         services.
VIII-8   Use noise standards in the review of proposed developments to determine
         whether the proposal promotes acceptable noise compatible land uses both
         during construction and subsequently.
VIII-9   Pro-actively address noise along the Ventura Freeway and other major
         corridors.

IX. COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
The Community Design Element focuses on creating a desirable environment in which to
live, work, and play. While the Community Design Element is an elective and not
required element of the General Plan, community design includes the relationship
between buildings, streets, land uses, open space, circulation, height, massing, natural
features, and human activity and, as one of the most visible aspects of the City, warrants
comprehensive coverage in the General Plan.
The goal of the Community Design Element is to maintain a high quality appearance in
the existing and future built environment, while protecting and preserving the hillsides,
ridgelines, and open space areas that provide the visual backbone for the community
and are the connecting fabric for a variety of community neighborhoods and uses.
The Community Design Element begins with an overview of the existing physical
development and regulatory framework of the City. Next, objectives and policies are
organized under following topics:
     x  Citywide Community Design
     x  Neighborhoods
     x  Scenic Corridors
Community Character
Calabasas draws its identity from
the beauty of its natural
environment: the rolling hills, oak
woodlands, canyons, wildlife, and
its overall suburban and semi-rural
character. Entering Calabasas from
the east, there is a sense of leaving
metropolitan Los Angeles behind. Vistas become broader and the sight of undeveloped
hillsides dotted with oak trees signals an exit from suburbia.
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

IX.     COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
The following features combine to create Calabasas' unique character:
    x   An impressive physical setting, dominated by rolling hills, oak woodlands,
        canyons, riparian areas, and wildlife;
    x   Large areas of natural hillsides visible from the Ventura Freeway, and a
        community character as seen from the Freeway that is dominated by natural
        environmental features;
    x   Diverse topography
        with large areas
        unbroken by man-
        made slopes, and
        long-range vistas of
        open ridgelines and
        mountain slopes that
        define the extent of
        urban development;
    x   A sense of leaving the
        Los Angeles
        metropolitan area
        upon entering
        Calabasas due to the contrast between the intensity of the metropolitan area and
        the openness and scenic beauty of the community's natural environment;
    x   The historic identity and the western character of Old Town and an emphasis on
        Old Town as a community cultural center and gathering place;
    x   A low-rise character in the City's commercial and office areas;
    x   A compact, well-defined urban area that is bounded by semi-rural residential
        and natural open space;
    x   Availability of nearby commercial facilities, services, and office uses in business
        districts that are separated from the City's residential neighborhoods; and
    x   A lack of night lighting and existence of dark skies, enhancing the visibility of
        stars at night.
A key element of Calabasas’ character is the contrast between the intensity of the
metropolitan area and the openness and scenic beauty of the City’s environment.
The existing development patterns of Calabasas are characterized primarily by low
density residential development with concentrations of commercial and office
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

development adjacent to the freeway corridor. Due to the abundant and wide
distribution of open space, a variety of neighborhoods and uses are linked by open
space. The typical uses are segregated into several general types of development:
single family residential tract development; semi-rural residential development; multiple
family residential development; commercial, office, and industrial development; and
public uses.
Single family residential tract
developments in Calabasas are
usually relatively small residential
enclaves surrounded by natural
areas such as open hillsides and
canyons. Some of these enclaves
have been developed as private,
gated communities with only one
or two main access roads. While
this development pattern provides
residents with a feeling of
security, it tends to restrict inter-
neighborhood connections and
create inwardly focused neighborhoods. This type of development stands in sharp
contrast to the more semi-rural, less formal development style of neighborhoods
constructed over a period of many years.
Semi-rural residential development is also found in the City, mostly in the southern
portion of the City along canyons and in the hills. Architectural styles of semi-rural
residential development vary widely and landscaping is informal or natural. The semi-
rural character is reinforced through minimal public improvements such as the lack of
streetlights, sidewalks, and curbs and
gutters. The City will continue to
ensure that new development is
harmonious with surrounding natural
areas.
Multiple family residential development
is concentrated in Malibu Canyon, Lost
Hills, and the eastern Calabasas Park
area. Some multiple family residential
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

IX.      COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
development lacks sufficient landscaping and provides little architectural interest or
detail to contribute to the desired community character.
Commercial, office, industrial development can be generally categorized into four types:
freestanding and strip mall developments located along the Ventura Freeway, a large
“lifestyle” commercial center (i.e., The Commons), business park uses along Agoura
Road, and the Old Town commercial district. While some older commercial projects
present a positive image for the City, other projects lack interesting building forms and
details, adequate landscaping, screening of parking and storage areas.
Public and quasi-public uses in the community are focused along Las Virgenes Road and
near The Commons while schools are located throughout the community with a
concentration on the east side of the City along Mulholland Highway.
Existing challenges created by the current community form are:
     x   Managing future development and redevelopment to minimize impacts to open
         space and viewsheds
     x   Improving connectivity between uses, neighborhoods and open space
     x   Creating desirable pedestrian environments and gathering spaces
     x   Establishing community gathering places and focal points for the east and west
         sides of town
     x   Ensuring high quality design consistent with Calabasas’ desired character
Existing Regulations
The form, and to some extent the architectural design, of the urban environment is
largely the result of standards and regulations imposed on new development. For many
years, the Los Angeles County Zoning Ordinance was relied upon as the primary
document used to regulate development in Calabasas. Upon incorporation, the City
adopted the County’s Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances pending completion of its own
development standards. After incorporation, the City adopted its own General Plan and
Municipal Code aimed at more effectively controlling development. The City has also
enacted ordinances, processes and master plans, including those described below, to
help shape community design and character in a manner that is much improved with
respect to overall design, landscaping, and compatibility with surrounding open spaces
and land uses.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

Site Plan and Development Review
Since incorporation, the City has also enacted a Site Plan
Review Ordinance and a Development Review Process.
These items currently provide the regulatory standards,
design guidelines, and procedures for the review of all
development projects in the City, including the exterior
appearance of buildings.
Old Town Calabasas Master Plan and Design Guidelines
and Commercial Zoning District
The purpose of the Old Town Calabasas Master Plan and
Design Guidelines, adopted in 1994, is to ensure that a
“sense of place” special and unique to the City of
Calabasas could be retained and enhanced to reflect the
history and spirit of Calabasas. The design guidelines are
intended to facilitate and define the theme of “Old West”
by establishing high quality streetscape, site, building, and landscape designs to
complement the project setting. Both public and private improvements are addressed in
the document.
The Old Town Calabasas Commercial Zoning District, last updated in 2003, specifies a
variety of office, retail, and other commercial uses that are appropriate within Old Town,
and ensures that development is designed to preserve and enhance the area’s historic
character and comply with the Old Town Calabasas Master Plan and Design Guidelines.
It is noted that portions of Old Town are within the City of Los Angeles and any
applicable regulations from that jurisdiction would apply to those areas.
Scenic Corridor Overlay Zone
The purpose of the Scenic Corridor Overlay Zone, first adopted in 1991 and most
recently updated in 2006, is to protect an important economic and cultural base of the
City by preventing the destruction of the natural beauty and environment of the City; to
safeguard and enhance property values; to protect public and private investment and
buildings and open spaces; and to protect and enhance the public health, safety, and
welfare.
The Scenic Corridor Overlay Zone is intended to be applied to major roadways within the
City, from which the traveling public may enjoy scenic views of the hill and mountain
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

areas to the north and south of the community and scenic views of the City itself and
surrounding landscape, from the hill and mountain areas within the City. The
boundaries of the Scenic Corridor Overlay Zone along designated roadways includes all
properties located within 500 feet of the right-of-way of the road designated as a scenic
corridor, located between the right-of-way of the designated road and the prominent
ridgeline that defines the viewshed from the scenic corridor, and where the director
determines development may have an impact upon the designated scenic corridor.
Designated scenic corridors within Calabasas include: Mulholland Highway, Las
Virgenes Road, Old Topanga Canyon Road, and the Ventura Freeway. Scenic corridors
are discussed in section IX.C of this element.
Las Virgenes Gateway Master Plan and Las Virgenes Road Corridor Design Plan
The Las Virgenes Gateway Master Plan and the Las Virgenes Road Corridor Design Plan,
both adopted in 1998, are companion documents. The Gateway Master Plan provides
direction on the planned development or redevelopment of private properties along the
corridor while the Corridor Design Plan focuses on the desired appearance and
functionality of the public realm, including the roadway, sidewalks, street lighting and
furnishings, landscaping, etc.
The Las Virgenes Gateway Master Plan recognizes the location of the intersection of Las
Virgenes Road and the Ventura Freeway as a gateway to the San Fernando Valley and
Santa Monica Mountains as well as the City of Calabasas. The area contains some of the
most scenic and diverse topography in the region and past urban development has
threatened to negatively affect much of the natural semi-rural character. The Las
Virgenes Gateway Master Plan sets goals and objectives to guide land use planning
efforts, revitalization plans, and the review of new private development proposals. The
Master Plan provides specific land use and development criteria and design guidelines
for this section of the City. A semi-rural theme, rooted in California’s history of simple,
massive (adobe and timber-based) construction, is emphasized with “Monterey” style
cited as an example of appropriate architectural design.
The Las Virgenes Road Corridor Design Plan provides a comprehensive master plan for a
six mile length of Las Virgenes Road addressing beautification and circulation planning.
A unified landscape plan is provided addressing signing, street lighting, street trees,
parkway landscaping, medians, sidewalks, street furnishings and other elements
establishing suitable character for various zones along the corridor. Native landscaping
and rustic themes are emphasized.

West Calabasas Road Master Plan
The West Calabasas Road Master Plan, adopted in 2006, provides design direction on
the planned development or redevelopment of private properties along the corridor as
well as on the desired appearance and functionality of the public realm, including the
roadway, sidewalks, street lighting and furnishings, landscaping, etc.
Guidelines provide instruction on design details to create “upscale country” and “country
corporate” themes that build on both the history of the area and the more recent
developments to unify West Calabasas Road and provide a cohesive environment. Two
distinct types of land uses are addressed: vehicle dealerships and medical facilities and
accompanying overnight accommodations. The guidelines address overall design
principles, site planning, landscaping, building design, and site features.
Mulholland Highway Master Plan
The Mulholland Highway Master Plan, adopted in 1997, not only provides for traffic and
circulation infrastructure but also provides guidance regarding beautification,
landscaping and utility improvements. The goal of the plan is to help restore the original
beauty of Mulholland Highway.
IX.A      Citywide Community Design
The objectives and policies in this section relate to a larger community design ethos that
necessarily involves entire neighborhoods, districts, or other sub-regions of the City.
Within these areas, multiple parcels and a mixture of land uses are typically affected.
Objectives
 Focus new development in and near areas that already contain existing
    development.
 Preserve significant natural features, designated open space, and biological habitats.
 Preserve and enhance a pleasant visual experience for residents and visitors,
    emphasizing prominent and distinctive vistas, view corridors, and natural features.
 Create pedestrian access and connectivity opportunities as well as human-scaled
    gathering places.
 Promote high quality design for structures and building sites.
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
IX.      COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
General Plan Approach
Community design focuses on defining the physical forms and environmental features
that contribute to community character. The themes of environmental sensitivity,
compact urban form, and inviting pedestrian access are key elements to future
development in Calabasas. It is a high priority of the City to protect the natural
environment, hillsides, open spaces, and views as the City continues to realize some
future development. Calabasas is committed to promoting sustainable practices
through General Plan community design goals and policies that complement such
policies in the Conservation Element.
The primary community design concept
for the General Plan is that new
development should conform to the
character of its natural setting.
Therefore, new development should be
accomplished through infill and
revitalization of existing developed
areas in order to conserve undeveloped
areas. By creating a more compact
urban form, many benefits may be
realized, including maximizing open
space, reducing energy costs,
enhancing public transit feasibility,
creating more walkable environments,
and providing greater connectivity and
synergy between land uses.
The challenge lies in how to accommodate and shape future development in infill
locations in a way that retains the character of Calabasas and minimizes environmental
effects. With this infill approach in mind, the City also seeks to accommodate housing
demand through the redevelopment of commercial areas of the community with
somewhat higher density mixed use development. This will create a series of mixed use
community areas linked by open space and areas of larger residential development.
Within the mixed use areas, the formation of inviting pedestrian areas and local
gathering spaces will be important in creating a desirable atmosphere and a sense of
community.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS
                                             IX-8
                                                                        CITY OF CALABASAS
                                                                       2030 GENERAL PLAN
                                                    IX.     COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
Calabasas recognizes that it is, and will continue to be, a low-profile, residentially-
oriented community and the City intends to maintain its unique character as a friendly,
family-oriented community in a picturesque natural setting.
Residential “mansionization” (building of excessively large houses on small lots) is
perceived by some as a concern in Calabasas. This type of development can result in
houses with large bulk that are out of scale with existing neighborhoods and that have
the potential to change the character of the neighborhood. It can also result in minimal
setbacks and landscaping along street frontages; decreased availability of light, air, and
privacy; view blockage; and excessive grading for large building pads. The General Plan
aims to prevent overbuilding by requiring that new residential construction be
compatible with the surrounding community character and the physical limitations
presented by the natural terrain. The City recognizes that development of individual
small lots, in itself, does not necessarily create negative impacts, as long as certain key
design concepts are incorporated to mitigate potential negative impacts.
Policies
IX-1    Through community input and design review, ensure that new development and
        redevelopment is of high quality design, is aesthetically pleasing, and
        contributes to a positive image for the City.
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

       districts, and areas of historical, cultural, and urban design significance.
IX-3   Ensure that new development projects become assets to the community through
       direct contribution to the enhancement of Calabasas' visual environment.
IX-4   Protect and enhance historic resources such as Old Town, in collaboration with
       all other affected jurisdictions as appropriate.
IX-5   Ensure that new development is aesthetically compatible with the area’s natural
       environment and that it contributes to a positive image for the City.
IX-6   Require that new developments preserve views of identified scenic resources
       from designated corridors.
IX-7   Where applicable, enhance view corridors that are oriented toward existing or
       proposed community amenities, such as recreation facilities, parks, open space,
       or natural features.
IX-8   Require that new developments establish architectural and siting design themes
       that are compatible with the surrounding context, including:
       x    Prominent design features existing in the immediate area (i.e. trees,
            landforms, historic landmarks);
       x    Existing and planned development, buildings and structures; and
       x    The natural environment (i.e., hillsides, washes, native vegetation,
            community landscaping).
IX-9   Require that new developments create pleasing transitions to surrounding
       development. For example, where applicable:
       x    The bulk of new structures should be compatible with the area's environment
            and with adjacent development;
       x    Setbacks from streets and adjacent properties should be in proportion to the
            structure and the function of the street and shall encourage pedestrian scale
            and uses (for example, zero setbacks from property lines and street right-
            of-way are appropriate within Old Town); and
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

      x   Multi-story structures should be made less imposing by physically stepping
          the upper stories of the structures back from street level.
IX-10 Within residential neighborhoods, protect neighborhood character by
      maintaining the mass, scale, and height of structures at a size that is compatible
      with the size of the parcel upon which the structure is located, as well as the size
      of adjacent development.
IX-11 Promote an assembly of distinct neighborhoods that encompass a range of
      housing types which:
      x   Provide a refuge from the congestion of the adjacent metropolitan area;
      x   Are visually attractive and compatible in intensity, dwelling unit size, and
          structural design with the need to protect the surrounding natural
          environment; and
      x   Meet the needs and suit the lifestyles of current and future residents.
IX-12 Provide appropriate transitions between different projects and between suburban
      and rural/semi-rural land uses through the provision of buffer areas,
      landscaping, and other similar treatments, such as hedges, walls, fences, berms,
      or landscaped open space.
IX-13 Promote the establishment and maintenance of the following features to enhance
      community character:
      x   Gathering, meeting, and recreational places;
      x   Commercial facilities that facilitate, rather than hinder, pedestrian circulation
          within the facility, as well as between commercial facilities and adjacent
          residential neighborhoods;
      x   Development designs that enhance a feeling of being safe
      x   Traditional, rather than trendy or "franchise" architecture that complements
          the natural character of Calabasas' setting;
      x   Distinctive buildings that contribute to, rather than detract from, Calabasas’
          character;
      x   Hillside residential development designs that feature natural rather than
          manmade forms and that emphasize the use of custom foundations in place
          of slab construction;
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

IX-14 Promote lower level lighting/illumination citywide through implementation of
        lighting standards such as the City’s “Dark Skies” ordinance.
IX-15 Ensure that public improvements such as streets, sidewalks, drainage facilities,
        and streetlights are aesthetically pleasing and contribute to a positive image for
        the City. For example, where applicable:
        x   Use earth-tone tinted concrete for drainage features;
        x   Provide natural-looking treatments for culverts incorporating native stone
            material; and
        x   Install streetlights and traffic signals that are attractive and low glare.
IX-16 Integrate sustainable practices into the design of developments, including site
        planning, building form, materials, and landscaping.
IX.B       Neighborhoods
Different areas of Calabasas exhibit a variety of design characteristics and themes. This
variety is an important component of the community identity of Calabasas. Several
neighborhoods within Calabasas warrant specific design direction. The following four
neighborhoods are a focus of this section: Las Virgenes/Westside, East Village, North
Mulholland, and South Mulholland. For the purposes of this section, the subtitle
“neighborhoods” refers to subareas of the City that are actually collections of
neighborhoods located in the same general area. Figure IX-1 shows the location of
each neighborhood.

General Plan Approach
As stated earlier, strategic infill development is preferred to development in
undisturbed, natural areas. The greatest opportunities for strategic infill development
in Calabasas lie at the western and eastern gateways to the City, in the Las
Virgenes/Westside and East Village neighborhoods. Mixed use infill development will
characterize these neighborhoods. Additionally, none of the major entrances to the
City, such as the East and Las Virgenes/Westside areas, currently presents a significant
visual entry statement. Development of these entrances should include recognizable
elements that represent the quality development and way of life of Calabasas. The
North Mulholland and South Mulholland neighborhoods are more residentially focused
neighborhoods; therefore, protection of the existing community character is an
important community design concept for these neighborhoods.
Las Virgenes/Westside
The Las Virgenes/Westside area encompasses the portions of the City of Calabasas
along Las Virgenes Road and Agoura Road. Currently, the area hosts a variety of uses
from business park, commercial, and hotel to single and multi-family residential uses.
Visitor-serving support uses, such as gas stations and drive-thru restaurants, are
situated near the freeway. The character of Agoura Road and Las Virgenes Road ranges
from an urban feel of larger office complexes and small retail operations to a semi-
rural, ranch, natural character. There is a need to create a focal point and more
integrated, inviting mix of land uses, gathering places and pedestrian environment.
This area is also considered a gateway to the Santa Monica Mountains and the western
entry into the City; Las Virgenes Road is also designated as a scenic corridor, as
discussed later in this element.
Combining the desire to direct
development to infill and redevelopment
opportunities (versus undeveloped
hillside areas) and to facilitate a “village
center” for the Westside of town, the Las
Virgenes/Westside concept was created.
The Las Virgenes/Westside is comprised
of a mixed use district with residential,
retail and office space that has a distinct
village feel. The area provides enhanced
streetscapes and public gathering

spaces focused on an enhanced Las Virgenes Creek walkway. Specific visioning for the
Las Virgenes/Westside area was conducted and is presented on Figure IX-2; Figure IX-3
provides several sketches depicting the future potential for the Las Virgenes/Westside.
Portions of the vision for this area would be implemented as properties in the area
redevelop over time. In addition, specific direction is provided for a prominent site east
of the Agoura Road/Las Virgenes Road intersection due to the need for special
standards that address unique features, conditions, and constraints. For these reasons,
this site is designated Planned Development in the Land Use Element.
For the Planned Development site, a welcoming pedestrian level presence at street level
along Las Virgenes Road is a key element. Buildings and uses should have a strong
connection and interaction to the street in order to integrate the site with the mixed
uses along Agoura Road. Store fronts at the ground level will be customer oriented,
while uses above include office or residences (or perhaps commercial uses such as a
restaurant with views of the Las Virgenes/Westside). Buildings are envisioned to
maintain good building form, including stepbacks and balconies. High quality, iconic
architecture will screen parking structures and follow architectural direction in the Las
Virgenes Gateway Master Plan. Overall, the project will be nestled into the topography
using techniques such as contour grading, terraced building forms and tuck-under
parking.
Objectives
 Near Las Virgenes Road and Agoura
    Road, foster the creation of a mixed
    use residential, retail, and office
    district with a distinct village feel.
 Foster connections to Las Virgenes
    Creek.
Policies
IX-17 Provide a mix of uses that creates
         a destination area where people can come and stay – live, shop, relax, play.
IX-18 Facilitate the development of more amenities in western Calabasas, such as
         shopping, pedestrian facilities, and gathering places.

2030 GENERAL PLAN
IX.      COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
IX-19     Facilitate the development of a mixed use commercial core along Agoura Road
          that is supported by office and residential uses.
IX-20 Emphasize the use of natural materials such as wood and stone on new
         development in order to enhance the area’s semi-rural/ranch character.
IX-22 Develop a unified streetscape identity for Las Virgenes and Agoura Road with
         landscaping improvements, intersection treatment, better building street
         presence, and improved pedestrian orientation.
IX-23 Create stronger connections with Las Virgenes Creek through building
         orientation, outdoor dining and pedestrian access.
IX-24 Create gathering spaces in new development to enhance pedestrian activity,
         provide community focal points, and strengthen linkages between uses.
East Village
The East Village area is actually a collection of four distinct areas: Calabasas Park, Old
Town Calabasas, The Commons, and Craftsman’s Corner. Calabasas Park and Old Town
Calabasas have well established identities and not much revitalization or infill is
envisioned for these areas. Currently, challenges include lack of connectivity between
these subareas, visual clutter along the freeway, unscreened parking lots along
Calabasas Road, and the unmet opportunity for more of a downtown environment for
the east side of the community.
The vision for The Commons and
Craftsman’s Corner areas is to create an
expanded “village” environment by including
new professional offices, retail commercial
uses, visitor accommodations, cultural arts
facilities, and residential development
connected with pedestrian spaces, plazas,
and parks. Specific visioning for portions of
the East Village area was conducted and is
presented on Figure IX-4.

                                                   IX.     COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
Objectives
 Maintain the well-established
    traditional character of Calabasas
    Park and Old Town.
 Revitalize the Craftsman’s Corner
    area and enhance The Commons area
    by creating an expanded village
    environment that includes new retail
    commercial, visitor accommodations,
    and residential development with
    limited new professional offices and
    cultural arts facilities connected through pedestrian spaces, plazas, and parks.
Policies
IX-25 Facilitate the establishment of a "downtown" district for Calabasas Road east of
        Parkway Calabasas emphasizing a pedestrian-oriented mix of retail, office and
        residential uses as well as pedestrian connections to adjacent residential areas.
IX-26 Use The Commons as a successful example for the quality of design and public
        spaces.
IX-27 As properties along Calabasas Road redevelop over time, require placement of
        buildings at the street edge to
        enliven the street scene and
        enhance the pedestrian
        experience and reduce the
        visibility of parking areas from
        public view.
IX-28 Reduce the visibility of parking
        areas from public rights-of-way
        using appropriate building
        placement, landscaping, and
        other design techniques.
IX-29 Annex and revitalize Craftsman’s Corner through redevelopment with a mix of
        uses (possibly including a focus on creative or performing arts), improving
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

IX.     COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
        circulation, and raising the quality of building design to meet or exceed the
        surrounding areas. In conjunction with revitalization, create a vehicle and
        pedestrian connection (freeway overpass) between Craftsman’s Corner and The
        Commons that may also act as a gateway element. Also, create pedestrian and
        bicycle connections between Calabasas and Hidden Hills.
IX-30 Beautify and buffer the freeway edge while preserving views of surrounding
        hillsides.
IX-31 Establish parking strategies such as shared parking facilities or establishing
        parking districts to increase efficiency and enable redevelopment of selected
        areas.
North Mulholland
The North Mulholland area encompasses the areas along Mulholland Highway in the
northeast portion of the City including Mullwood, Park Moderne (also known as the “Bird
Tract”), Gelson’s shopping center and a number of schools. This area is largely
suburban and low density in character with four or five residential neighborhoods that
are somewhat physically disconnected. Several schools in this area provide cohesive
elements. Park Moderne is characterized by small winding streets and big trees.
Throughout the area, original single-story homes are recycling to larger, two-story
structures that are not always in scale and character with existing neighborhoods.
Infrastructure for pedestrians and bicyclists is sometimes lacking and there is a desire to
make the street environments more inviting.
Objectives
 Preserve the traditional
    community scale of
    residential neighborhoods,
    ensuring the consistency
    of new development with
    the existing established
    character.
 Enhance connectivity
    between diverse
    neighborhoods, schools,
    and commercial centers.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

                                                  IX.     COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
Policies
IX-32 Develop and implement design standards relating to floor area ratios, building
        setbacks, and residential design guidelines in order to ensure that home
        remodels are compatible with existing neighborhood character and scale, and
        protect neighbors’ privacy.
IX-33 Improve connectivity between neighborhoods through pedestrian and bicycle
        improvements and unifying design elements such as parkway landscaping and
        trees.
IX-34 Improve facilities along streets for walking and bicycling.
IX-35 Beautify streets by planting additional trees and undergrounding utilities.
South Mulholland
The South Mulholland area encompasses the south central portion of the City along
Mulholland Highway and includes Calabasas Highlands and Old Topanga Canyon.
Neighborhoods within this area exhibit an eclectic range from newer large homes to
older, low density subdivisions. The area is characterized by a “country” feeling, often
with narrow roads, abundant undeveloped lands, hilly topography, and minimal
infrastructure.
Antiquated “cabin lot” subdivisions within the Santa Monica Mountains (Calabasas
Highlands and Old Topanga Canyon) are located in this area of the City. These
subdivisions, created prior to the adoption of the California Subdivision Map Act, were
originally intended for small cabins and were designed without considering the area’s
steep topography and lack of services. As a result, many lots are narrow (some as
narrow as 20-feet wide), have inadequate
roadway access, and have substandard onsite
sewage disposal systems. Because of these
and other constraints, separate overlay
zoning districts were established for the Old
Topanga and Calabasas Highlands
neighborhoods in 2000 and updated in 2003
to help address issues unique to these
individual neighborhoods. In addition to
adopting overlay zoning for these areas,
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

CITY OF CALABASAS
2030 GENERAL PLAN
IX.     COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
another strategy successfully employed by the City has been to purchase substandard
lots as the lots become available in order to retire development potential.
Objectives
 Preserve the existing semi-rural community character of this area of Calabasas by
    maintaining undeveloped hillsides and natural features to the maximum extent
    practicable.
 Encourage patterns of smaller-scale residential development that blend with the
    natural landscape and the traditional development of that community.
Policies
IX-36 Maintain abundant open space and the small-scale, semi-rural character of
        existing neighborhoods.
IX-37 Integrate buildings into the site topography in order to minimize visual impacts
        and disturbance of biological resources.
IX-38 Maintain and complement design features that contribute to the eclectic charm
        of the existing neighborhoods.
IX-39 Allow widening of streets only as necessary for public safety purposes.
IX-40 In neighborhoods comprised
        of small “cabin lots”, all new
        residential development
        projects, including the
        construction of individual
        dwellings and home
        additions, must conform to
        the Overlay District
        standards for that area. In
        addition, it is the
        responsibility of property
        owners in new developments
        within “cabin lot”
        subdivisions to provide adequate and safe access, including access for
        emergency vehicles, and adequate off-street parking.

IX-41 Continue to implement the Old Topanga Overlay zone and the Calabasas
        Highlands Overlay zone standards.
IX-42 Pursue consolidation of substandard lots as opportunities are presented and
        funding is available in order to retire development potential.
IX.C      Scenic Corridors
Much of what forms the visual image of Calabasas comes from what is seen from motor
vehicles. At present, this image
is one of rugged terrain, oak
woodlands, ridgelines, and
canyons when viewed from the
majority of the City’s major
streets.
Exceptions to this view occur
along some portions of the
Ventura Freeway and along the
Las Virgenes Road commercial
section, where buildings and
signs partially block hillside views. In the years following the City’s incorporation this
situation has improved significantly, although a number of nonconforming signs remain.
Objective
Protect and enhance public views from scenic corridors within the community.
General Plan Approach
The intent of establishing scenic corridors is the preservation of public views of
important scenic resources such as significant ridgelines identified in the Open Space
Element. A description of the Scenic Corridor Overlay Zone is provided earlier in this
element under the Existing Regulations section. Four scenic corridors have been
identified as described below and shown on Figure IX-5. The City has also enacted a
Scenic Corridor Ordinance to implement policies protecting these corridors.
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

IX.     COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
The Mulholland Highway Scenic Corridor extends from Mulholland Drive through the
unincorporated territory to Las Virgenes Road. As with all of the City’s scenic corridors,
the viewshed includes both rural and urban areas. The corridor contains diverse
topography, including sandstone hills and ridges, immense granite outcrops, stream
and riparian habitat, and open areas of rolling meadow and oak woodland.
The Las Virgenes Scenic Corridor is a key cross-mountain roadway that provides primary
access to the Malibu Creek State Park area and the Pacific Coast. Dominant features
include rolling hills, oak woodlands, and primary wildlife linkage along Malibu Creek and
its surrounding wetland habitat.
The Old Topanga Canyon Scenic Corridor extends from the urban residential area north
of Mulholland Highway to its ascent of the Calabasas Ridge into the coastal zone of
Topanga Canyon. The rural portion provides an interior route throughout the Santa
Monica Mountains and contains some of the most scenic vistas of the inland valley,
steep canyon walls, and a year-round watershed that fosters a riparian setting and a
vigorous oak canopy.
The Ventura Freeway Scenic Corridor is a heavily traveled, high-density corridor that
encompasses much of Old Town Calabasas, Calabasas Road, and the Calabasas Grade.
Beautification of the existing 500-foot corridor and preservation of significant
ridgelines, rolling hills, and oak woodlands are of concern here. Existing negative
aspects of the corridor, such as freeway oriented signs and uses, are also a concern.
Policies
IX-43 Require new development to be designed in a manner consistent with the Scenic
        Corridor Overlay Zoning requirements and the Scenic Corridor Design Guidelines.

X.      PARKS, RECREATION & TRAILS ELEMENT
Calabasas is committed to ensuring that its citizens have ample access to high quality
spaces for leisure and active recreation. Despite constraints on land available for active
use parks, the City has acquired or built a wide array of recreational facilities. Calabasas
has also been an active steward of the natural environment, acquiring open space and
partnering with other agencies to preserve natural resources. The City also provides a
variety of recreation services such as sports leagues, education classes, cultural events,
entertainment experiences, and other leisure activities for the community.
Many recreational facilities in and around Calabasas, but not operated by the City are
also available to Calabasas residents. These include Malibu Creek State Park, the
Headwaters Corner Education Center, King Gillette Ranch, Las Virgenes Unified School
District (LVUSD) sites, and private facilities such as Calabasas Golf Course and multiple
homeowner association-operated play areas, sports fields, and pools.
Calabasas’ environmental setting is ideal for the development of trails and passive
recreational opportunities. However, because of topographic and land constraints, it is
not necessarily suitable for the development of active sports facilities such as soccer and
baseball/softball fields. The City operates three sports fields: two with multi-use
backstops (De Anza and Creekside parks) and one youth T-ball field (Grape Arbor Park).
The City is strongly committed to developing and maintaining facilities that support the
range of recreational activities desired by community residents in a manner that is in
harmony with the sensitive nature of Calabasas’ environment.
In 2004, Calabasas adopted a Park & Recreation Master Plan (Master Plan) that identifies
existing and future park and recreation service needs as well as ways in which these
needs can be met. The Master Plan identifies and evaluates existing park and recreation
areas; assesses the need for additional park land, open space and specialized facilities;
establishes criteria and standards for site selection, design, and management; and
recommends an approach to implementation. A Recreation Needs Assessment
conducted as part of the Master Plan concluded that the City has sufficient
neighborhood park acreage, but is deficient with respect to community parks.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

Consequently, the Master Plan recommends the development of two additional
community parks that would provide a community park within 1.5 miles of every
Calabasas resident. The Recreation Needs Assessment also reported unmet demand for
soccer fields, aquatic facilities, a teen center, a senior center, and cultural arts facilities.
These needs as well as the need for additional recreational facilities, such as indoor and
outdoor basketball courts, have been confirmed through community surveys that have
consistently indicated a desire for more recreational facilities in Calabasas.
X.A Active Use Facilities
Objective
Provide active parks and sports fields that meet the recreational needs of Calabasas
residents.
General Plan Approach
The biggest challenge for Calabasas with respect to the provision of sports fields is
identifying space for expansion of facilities to meet currently unserved recreation
demand. In addition to statistical evidence that the community is underserved in select
sports facilities, the community has expressed a need for additional facilities, such as
sites for sports fields, public pools, a teen center, and performing arts facilities.
As of 2014, the City of Calabasas owns and operates 56.6 acres of developed park
land, or about 2.4 acres per 1,000 residents. Among the facilities operated by the City
are two mini-parks, two neighborhood parks, one community park, five special use
areas and one undesignated/undeveloped park site. Existing City park facilities are
summarized in Table X-1 and mapped on Figure X-1.
Calabasas will continue to augment its inventory of City-owned and operated
recreational facilities as circumstances allow. The City will strive to achieve a target of
three acres of active parks per 1,000 residents and will develop new active parks as
opportunities arise. However, topographic constraints and lack of vacant land within the
City are significant constraints to the development of new sports fields, particularly
facilities that require large, areas of flat land. Consequently, the City will continue to
expand its partnership with the public school system to develop joint use of existing
schools and other facilities to meet its recreational needs.

Calabasas has established successful joint use agreements with the Las Virgenes Unified
School District (LVUSD) and other arrangements by which LVUSD facilities are used for
non-school recreation functions since incorporation in 1991. Table X-2     2 lists the LVUSD
schools and facilities currently being utilized for non-school recreation functions.
These agreements are a partnership where the City pays for upgraded fields and
maintenance on those fields in exchange for public use outside of school hours. The
relationship has been beneficial to both the LVUSD and the City and is popular with
residents. To alleviate the lack of sports fields, the City will continue to seek to
establish joint use agreements at LVUSD sites within the city limits. LVUSD school sites
that could potentially provide additional sports fields include Calabasas High School, A.E
Wright Middle School, Bay Laurel Elementary School, Chaparral Elementary School, and
Lupin Hill Elementary School (some of these schools are already used for City
recreational activities, but have the potential for expanded use).
Partnering with neighboring communities also allows Calabasas to satisfy community
recreation needs despite the City’s land constraints. The Community Center is jointly
owned and operated by the joint powers authority with the City of Agoura Hills.
Residents of both communities can access and utilize the facilities. The 30,000 square
foot facility features tournament-
level basketball courts, a full-service
fitness studio, a 35-foot realistic
rock climbing wall, a multi-purpose
activity room with a patio, a
dance/exercise studio, and a large
banquet hall for special events and
rentals. The joint powers agreement
between Agoura Hills and Calabasas
successfully provides recreation
opportunities that both communities
would not be able to satisfy alone.
The City will continue to work with
neighboring communities to
establish and maintain joint use programs in order to support a wide range of quality
recreational activities, and to maintain the facilities needed to support those activities.

Beyond joint use agreements, one site within the current corporate boundary and two
sites adjacent to the corporate boundary could potentially serve a wide range of quality
recreational activities if successfully acquired and developed. Though increased use of
existing facilities is the highest priority option for meeting the community’s recreational
needs, the City will monitor the possibility of acquiring sites for the development of new
parks. Potential park sites are listed on page X-9. The locations of potential park sites

as well as potential expansion areas for Juan Bautista de Anza and Gates Canyon parks
are shown on Figure X-1.
The only public swimming pool in Calabasas is located at the Calabasas Tennis and
Swim Center (TSC). The TSC includes an 8-lane, 25-yard, heated outdoor lap pool as
well as a teaching/therapeutic
pool. It is heavily used by TSC
members and drop-ins, and is the
site of the City’s popular Calabasas
Lagoon swim instruction and swim
team programs. Aquatic exercise
also occurs in the pools. In
addition, the TSC pools are used
by the City and other day camps in
the summer time, which adds to
the volume. The swim lessons
program is extremely popular.
Since the TSC is an enterprise
fund, revenues generated from the facility completely cover the cost of operations,
including the cost of operating the pools. To help alleviate continued demand at the
TSC pool, the City may pursue a joint use agreement for the pool at Calabasas High
School. The City may also consider a new aquatic facility in western Calabasas. Land
availability, the availability of funding for this type of capital project, and operations
funding will be important factors in the decision of whether to add new aquatic facilities
and which type to add.
Policies
X-1      Work to provide adequate facilities to support a wide range of recreational
         activities for children, adults, families, senior citizens, and area employees and
         businesses, as outlined in the 2004 Park & Recreation Master Plan.
X-2      Pursue expansion of joint use/park facilities with the Las Virgenes Unified
         School District as the highest priority for meeting demand for sports fields and
         other selected recreational facilities.

                                 Potential Future Park Sites
   Pontopiddan Site
    This 7.5-acre site located along the west side of Las Virgenes Road is designated
   Residential-Single Family. However, acquisition of the entire site for development of a
   park facility remains a possibility. This site is likely too small to accommodate sports
   fields, but could accommodate various smaller scale facilities, such as basketball or
   tennis courts, a skateboard park, aquatic facilities, a playground, and/or picnic facilities.
   County Site
   An approximately 74.2-acre property in unincorporated Los Angeles County north of
   U.S.101 and east of Lost Hills Road is a possible near-term location for limited
   development of sports fields. Although much of this site would require substantial
   grading to accommodate sports fields, flat areas present in portions of the site could
   potentially accommodate 1-2 fields while the remainder of the site could facilitate
   passive recreational activities.
   Calabasas Landfill Site
   The 400.8-acre Calabasas Landfill is a potential long-term solution to the City’s sports
   field needs as it offers the best opportunity for a large park and sports complex. The site
   is not scheduled for closure until 2022 and would require time for post-closure
   procedures. Despite the potential drawbacks of the landfill site, it is the only large site
   convenient to Calabasas that has the potential to be developed into an attractive sports
   complex. The City will monitor the opportunity to either acquire the site for future
   development as an active use recreational facility or enter into a joint use arrangement
   with the County of Los Angeles and/or the City of Agoura Hills.
X-3     Pursue establishment of joint use park facilities with neighboring communities
        to provide land for active recreational opportunities for selected programs.
X-4     Pursue acquisition of sites that could be utilized as active recreational facilities
        in the future.
X-5     Expand City-operated recreational facilities to the extent that such facilities can
        be developed without unacceptable environmental impacts.
X-6     Pursue the development of an additional aquatic facility either through a joint

X.B Trail System
Objective
Maintain a system of trails that provides recreational opportunities.
General Plan Approach
Trails in Calabasas accommodate a broad variety of interests and abilities, from hiking,
mountain biking, horse riding, jogging, or simply walking. The Calabasas Trails Master
Plan, adopted in 2007, provides a blueprint for the development of community trails.
Trails in Calabasas accommodate a broad variety of interests and abilities. The Master
Plan identifies a trail network serving virtually every neighborhood, and providing local
and regional connections. Calabasas’ open space and trail system is shown on Figure
X-2.
Calabasas is fortunate to be surrounded by open space and park land owned by a variety
of national and state agencies, including the National Park Service (NPS), State of
California, the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority (MRCA) and the Santa
Monica Mountains Conservancy. This open space and park land is part of the Santa
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. In addition to the publicly-owned open
space surrounding the City, the City has more than 3,000 acres of protected open space
within its boundaries, including land owned by the City of Calabasas, the Mountains
Recreation and Conservation Authority, Las Virgenes Municipal Water District, and many
of the homeowners associations in the City.
Calabasas recognizes the importance of the open space and trail system as a unifying
element that ties the diverse areas of the community together. A community survey
indicated that six of the top ten preferred recreation activities in Calabasas are trail-
related. There is also a desire for a variety of trail types and distances, trailheads and
trail amenities, in addition to better integration and connections of neighborhoods with
open space and trails. Thus, the connectivity of the trail system in neighborhood and
urban areas will be expanded through use of urban connections, parks and trails and
rural connections. A range of trail types will continue to be provided to address a
variety of needs, including loop trails, 30-minute hikes, and all day hikes. Trailheads

bicycling. The City will also continue to integrate the trail system with support facilities
(such as trash receptacles, benches, signage, and restrooms) that weave to and through
active and passive open spaces and parks.
Policies
X-8      In coordination with Los Angeles County, the Santa Monica Mountains
         Conservancy, the State Parks Department, and the National Park Service,
         continue to develop and maintain a system of hiking and riding trails that
         provide safe, enjoyable access into the area’s natural environment.
X-9      Locate and construct trails in such a manner as to minimize maintenance
         requirements and maximize access.
X-10     Make trails and staging areas easily accessible to the public in order to facilitate
         their use.
X-11     Connect trail systems with existing open space areas and community activity
         centers.
X-12     Incorporate trail design into plans for natural drainage channels, street rights-
         of-way, landscape corridors, utility rights-of-way, public easements, and open
         space areas.
X-13     It is the policy of the City to: 1) require recreation and trail planning and
         construction as conditions of approval for future development projects on land
         adjoining trails or where proposed new trails are planned; and, 2) require all
         project plans to provide access to trail heads located on adjacent public lands.
         This policy must be achieved within the legal limitations of the City’s land use
         power and with due respect for private property rights.
X-14     Retain existing City-owned rights-of-way that have potential to assist in the
         implementation of the trail system. Obtain rights-of-way from other entities
         (e.g., utility districts) that assist in the implementation of the trail system.
X-15     Implement trailheads and signage where roads intersect trails and a suitable
         pull-out or curb cut can be attained, especially in rural areas.
                                                                             CITY of CALABASAS

XI. CULTURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
Local history, cultural diversity, and artistic expression play vital roles in establishing
identity and enriching human life in communities. Calabasas enjoys a richness in its
history that sets the stage for ongoing community development in a way that
acknowledges and memorializes the past, while informing decisions about the
community’s ongoing cultural development. The Cultural Resources Element
establishes policies that both lay a foundation to protect and interpret cultural resources
(paleontological, archaeological, and historic) and encourage and foster the
community’s cultural and artistic development.
XI.A        Pre-Historic Resources
Calabasas Pre-history
At Spanish Contact, the Calabasas area was occupied by the Chumash, a diverse
population living in settlements along the California coast from Malibu Creek to the
southeast, Estero Bay in the north, including the islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and
Santa Cruz, and as far as Tejon Pass, Lake Casitas and the Cuyama River inland.
Following the 1542 Cabrillo voyage, many small Chumash settlements were abandoned
and some of the largest historic towns were founded. This change in population
distribution is attributed to growth in importance of trade centers and the development
of more integrated political confederations. The Chumash economic system enabled
them to make efficient use of diverse environments within their territory.
Acorns and seeds were traded between the islands and mainland, and interior
populations who lacked marine resources traded with coastal populations for fish and
other seafood.
The Spanish viewed the Chumash as unique among California tribes due to their
knowledge of the sea, canoe building expertise, ceremonial organization, their interest
in acquiring and displaying possessions, willingness to work, and extensive trade
networks. The protohistoric Chumash maintained the most complex bead money
                                                                            CITY of CALABASAS

system documented in the world. The major inland village of Ta'lopop was established
just to the southwest of Calabasas along Las Virgenes Creek. Information obtained
since the 1870s suggests that the Chumash were divided into political provinces, with
each containing a major capital. Numerous place names exist in the region, including
the following:
    Huwam: Village at Rancho El Escorpion, west end of the San Fernando Valley
    Kaspat kaslo'w: "nest of the eagle" - Mountain west of San Fernando Valley
    Kats'ikinhin: "pine tree" - Village on Las Virgenes Creek, inland from Malibu
    Ta'lopop - a village on Las Virgenes Creek
Objectives
 Enhance community appreciation for the importance of archaeological and
    paleontological resources
 Protect significant archaeological and paleontological resources.
General Plan Approach
The community’s rich history of the Chumash peoples, early Spanish contact, and
Mexican land granting patterns continue to be preserved and promoted through
education programs and cultural events. The City will continue to work with community
groups to identify locations for facilities that celebrate local cultural heritage. Examples
include a living history Chumash village and an agricultural history museum. Areas
within Calabasas that are of potential archaeological sensitivity are shown on Figure XI-
1.
Archaeological resources are particularly vulnerable to urban development. Other
threats include unrestricted public access to and vandalism of valuable sites. In order to
avoid conflicts arising between land-modifying development and the preservation of
precious archaeological resources, the incorporation archaeological resources study into
the planning process from the earliest planning stages is emphasized through this
Element.
Before construction is begun on a project, it must be ascertained what archaeological or
paleontological resources are present which might affect or be affected by the project.
Such planning involves the systematic identification of archaeological and
paleontological resources via preliminary site surveys, evaluation of these resources,
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

XI.B        Historic Resources
Calabasas History
From Spanish contact (voyages of Cabrillo in 1542 and Vizcaino in 1602), through the
Mexican and American Periods, land use patterns changed little in the Santa Monica
Mountains. The Portola-Crespi Expedition of 1769 passed through Calabasas, while
returning to San Diego. Juan Bautista de Anza (1773-1775/1776) helped establish the
Franciscan missions and Spanish settlements in the region, and opened the door to
future development. A branch of the El Camino Real passed through Calabasas after
leaving the San Fernando Valley, a route that was frequently traveled by Native
Americans, soldiers, explorers and civilians alike. Today, the Ventura Freeway (U.S.
Highway 101) follows the former alignment of the El Camino Real. Additionally, Malibu
Canyon was not only a major Native American trade corridor to the Pacific Ocean, but
early settlers also used the route and connecting trails to access Stokes, Piuma, Liberty,
and other canyons.
During the Mexican Period, large land grants dominated the region. Prior to this time,
the Spanish Crown permitted settlement and allotted certain land concessions, but the
deed remained in their possession. These Spanish entitlements were actually no more
then permits that allowed people to graze the land. One concession under the Spanish
rule and District of Santa Barbara was made in the vicinity of Calabasas and granted
under the name of El Paraje de Las Virgenes. It was not until the Mexican Period
however, that the basic tenants of the Land Grant system and ultimately, the land use-
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

XI.     CULTURAL RESOURCES ELEMENT
settlement pattern for the area changed. The project area was sandwiched between
Rancho Las Virgenes on the north and Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit to the south.
By the 1840s and 50s, cattlemen, sheepherders, squatters and ranch owners were
acquiring portions of former Mexican land grants in the region. Legendary landowners
such as Miguel Leonis, the co-owner (along with his wife Espiritu) of Rancho El
Escorpion, Domingo Carrillo and Nemisio Dominguez of Rancho Las Virgenes, and
Matthew Keller of Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit, owned much of the property in and
around Calabasas. Just to the west, Don Pedro Alacantara Sepulveda built an adobe
(which still stands, and is under the jurisdiction of the State Park system) for his wife
Maria Magdalena Soledad Dominguez circa 1853.
After the Mexican American War and statehood, land use and ownership patterns
evolved slowly. Leonis remained a major local ranch owner, and he enlarged and
remodeled his Monterey-style house. The Leonis Adobe remains the most enduring
historic example of this period of Calabasas history and serves as an anchor for Old
Town Calabasas.
After the turn of the century, several select spots in the Calabasas area developed into
weekend respites from the city. Crater Camp in Monte Nido was opened in 1914 as a
year-round picnic ground. The Calabasas Highlands community was subdivided in the
1920s, and reflects a development style that links Calabasas to its neighbor Topanga in
style and parcel pattern.
Unreliable water sources remained a constraint to larger scaled subdivision and
development in Calabasas through the first half of the 20th Century. With the founding
of the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District in 1958, a consistent water supply was
obtained. This development coincided with the state’s investment in the freeway
system. These two structural events led to a sustained development boom as the
rapidly urbanizing San Fernando Valley pushed westward along the U.S. 101 corridor. In
1969, Warner Ranch was purchased and subdivided, ushering in the master planned
Calabasas Park area. The upgrading of U.S. 101 (the Ventura Freeway) to a full freeway
occurred in the 1960s and developers began subdividing communities in proximity to
freeway interchanges at Valley Circle/Mulholland Drive, Parkway Calabasas, Las Virgenes
Road, and Lost Hills Road. Residents were not the only newcomers to Calabasas.
Corporations also decamped to Calabasas, to new office parks attracted corporate
clients, particularly in the 1980s. Lockheed Corporation moved from its historic
Burbank “skunkworks” location to a new corporate headquarters in Calabasas Park in the
early 1980s. The building was later occupied by Countrywide Financial. Other

corporations set up headquarters along the Agoura Road corridor between Las Virgenes
and Lost Hills Road.
After cityhood, a concerted effort was made to better regulate development and a
number of regional landscaping and urban design projects were initiated. Notable
among these are streetscape improvements in Old Town Calabasas and the restoration
of Las Virgenes Creek in the Ventura Freeway corridor.
The development of the Civic Center at the Commons in 2008 marks a milestone in the
City’s cultural development. In January 2008, the City adopted the Historic Preservation
Ordinance, further pursuing protection of the community’s cultural heritage. This
General Plan Element supports and builds on desires to sustain and develop a cultural
heritage in Calabasas.
Objectives
 Preserve the special historical features within Old Town as a focal point for
    community life.
 Extend the historical, old west character of existing buildings within Old Town to
    adjacent properties.
 Enhance community appreciation for the importance of historic resources and
    protect significant resources.
General Plan Approach
Calabasas will continue to facilitate the preservation and protection of historic
resources. These efforts will be implemented through the City’s Historic Preservation
Ordinance, which requires the creation of a Historic Preservation Commission and
creates a process by which the City can evaluate potential historic resources and, as
appropriate, designate historic landmarks, districts, and landscapes.
Old Town Calabasas is the historical and cultural heart of the community. As such,
preservation of historical features within Old Town is a pivotally important part of
Calabasas' vision. In addition to preserving actual historic buildings within Old Town,
the City has adopted design guidelines that will ensure that future development in and
adjacent to Old Town is compatible with its historic community character. Streetscape
design features and building facade modifications will be applied to newer structures
adjacent to Old Town to address design incompatibilities where modern architectural
adversely clashes with Old Town’s historic character. In this regard, the General Plan
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

reinforces the goals and policies of the Old Town Calabasas Master Plan and Design
Guidelines adopted in 1994.
The ongoing protection of Old Town will benefit from a unique cooperative effort with
the City of Los Angeles, as a significant portion of the Old Town area is within that city.
This effort includes the continued pursuit by Calabasas of the program to detach Old
Town from the City of Los Angeles and annex it into Calabasas. If detachment and
annexation is not forthcoming, Calabasas will continue to pursue other cooperative
programs with Los Angeles to ensure consistent, compatible development standards in
the area.
Policies
XI-3     Ensure proper treatment of historic resources before development occurs at a
         site where such resources are present, through enforcement of the City’s Historic
         Preservation Ordinance.
XI-4     Emphasize preservation and adaptive reuse as the preferred approach to the
         management of historic properties. Where preservation or adaptive reuse are
         not possible, require that new development reflect the character and
         historic/cultural references of the original features in their site context. Finally,
         facilitate the relocation of historic features if the preferred preservation in place
         is not possible.
XI.C         Cultural Amenities
Objective
Build the cultural foundations of Calabasas by involving broad segments of the
community in the production, support, and presentation of art and cultural programs,
installing art in public places, providing working and display space for local artists, and
identifying a site for an arts and cultural center.
General Plan Approach
Calabasas recognizes that its residents desire opportunities to build community values.
Since incorporation, the City has attempted to build a variety of community programs to
cater to the residents’ need for cultural amenities. The City sponsors and organizes
local art exhibits, performances, festivals, cultural events, and forums for local arts
                                                                             CITY of CALABASAS

organizations and artists. For example, the Calabasas Fine Arts Festival has been held
annually since 1997 and attracts over 15,000 thousand collectors & art buyers each
year. Seasonal festivals such as Egg-Stravaganza, 4th of July, Pumpkin Festival,
Halloween Carnival, and Snow, Snow, Snow offer cultural opportunities for residents of
all ages. The Calabasas Orchestra brings music to the community by catering to
numerous styles of orchestral music, ranging from Bach and baroque era to Gershwin
and contemporary. Through the Park and Recreation Department, a number of classes
are offered to residents, including courses in music, arts & crafts, acting, and theater.
The City’s Art in Public Places Ordinance provides aesthetic enhancement and
enrichment of the community through the inclusion of fine art throughout Calabasas.
The goal of the Ordinance is to provide a collection of nationally recognized, permanent
outdoor sculpture to be enjoyed by all. To accomplish this, the Ordinance requires any
person constructing or reconstructing a commercial building to either: (1) provide a
sculpture or other art work; or (2) pay a fee that can be used to purchase art for other
public places in the City.
Promotion of cultural amenities will remain a priority for the City. The City will continue
to implement its Art in Public Places program and to sponsor and organize local art
exhibits, performances, festivals, cultural events, and forums for local arts organizations
and artists. Promoting locally produced art and local cultural programs will expand
outreach and publicity. The City’s website and quarterly “Class Catalog” produced by
the Community Services department will continue to be used as a way to update
residents about the diverse cultural amenities available to them.
The City will also pursue the development of venues for cultural events such as live
music and dance. The “Craftsman’s Corner” area north of the Ventura Freeway,
currently located in unincorporated Los Angeles County, has been specifically identified
as a possible location for future annexation and development of a performing arts
venue.
Policies
XI-5    Promote and develop cultural programs for residents of all ages, including
        theatrical, musical, dance, and other performing arts activities.
XI-6    Promote the establishment of venues for theater, dance, music, and children’s
        programming.

XII. SERVICES, INFRASTRUCTURE & TECHNOLOGY ELEMENT
Communities need a variety of basic services and infrastructure in order to function.
The City provides some of these services and infrastructure, while others are provided
by other agencies. Careful coordination of land development with both City
departments and outside agencies that are responsible for providing municipal services
and infrastructure is needed to avoid gaps in service provision.
Prudent fiscal management is required to ensure adequate municipal income to pay for
the services and facilities provided or contracted for by the City. In addition, adequate
municipal income is required to provide and maintain community amenities.
Issues covered in the Services, Infrastructure, and Technology Element include:
    x   Fiscal Management                     x    Wastewater Service & Infrastructure
    x   Municipal Services                    x    Storm Drains

XII.A       Fiscal Management
Objectives
 Maintain a stable stream of municipal income that is adequate to provide the level of
     municipal services desired by Calabasas residents and businesses.
 Require developers to pay for all of the infrastructure, public facilities, and service
     costs that they create.
General Plan Approach
Calabasas recognizes that protecting environmental quality and enhancing the quality of
life for Calabasas residents requires a stable stream of municipal income. The City also
recognizes that expanding the community’s retail and employment sectors to generate
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

income entails certain costs, but will not sacrifice the area's natural environment or its
residents' quality of life in the pursuit of municipal income. Calabasas places a greater
priority on protecting the natural environment and the desirability of existing residential
neighborhoods than on creating sales tax-generating and employment-generating uses.
The City intends to live within its means and to provide services to its residents at levels
it can afford. Thus, new retail and employment generating land uses need to be
compatible with community objectives related to environmental quality and the quality
of existing residential neighborhoods.
The principle that "new development shall pay its own way" is a key concept of the
Calabasas General Plan. Developers will need to provide or funds needed new services
at no net cost to existing residents and businesses.
Policies
XII-1   Facilitate retail and service businesses in those sectors patronized by the local
        population and travelers along the Ventura Freeway.
XII-2   Facilitate attractive retail development in Old Town, Calabasas Road, Agoura
        Road, and Ventura Freeway interchanges at Parkway Calabasas, Las Virgenes
        Road, and Lost Hills Road.
XII-3   Establish and maintain a proactive program to attract commercial businesses to
        those locations within the City of Calabasas that the General Plan land use map
        has identified as being appropriate for commercial or mixed use, and work with
        potential commercial developers to ensure that projects are compatible with
        adjacent uses.
XII-4   Consider financial incentives consistent with other General Plan provisions for
        new sales tax-generating and employment-generating uses where there is a
        clear "pay-back" to the City in the form of increased municipal revenue.
XII-5   Ensure that the scale of commercial development in the City is compatible with
        surrounding neighborhoods.
XII-6    Where a development project may have a negative effect on municipal income,
         require the preparation of a fiscal impact analysis, as well as appropriate
         mitigation for any identified net costs to the City.

              new development do not exceed capital facility capacities;
         x    Does not adversely affect the level of service provided to existing
              development; and
         x    Does not increase the cost of providing public services to existing residents
              and businesses.
XII-8      While requiring new development to pay its own way, maintain flexibility with
           respect to financing infrastructure improvements for new sales tax-generating

XII.B        Municipal Services
Objectives
 Ensure that local police and fire services meet the needs of the community.
 Provide convenient library facilities that meet the community’s needs.
 Coordinate development activity with the provision of municipal services and
    facilities in a manner that:
    x   Maintains defined performance standards
    x   Eliminates gaps in service provision to new development
    x   Realizes cost efficiencies
    x   Achieves an equitable sharing of the cost of municipal services and facilities
        based on the principle that new development is to pay for itself, both in
        terms of capital facilities and ongoing operations and maintenance
General Plan Approach
The provision of municipal services and facilities is intended to advance Calabasas'
vision for its future and support the land use mix needed to achieve that vision. The

availability of adequate municipal services and facilities to a particular site is a
prerequisite to permitting development of that site in accordance with General Plan
policies, but is not considered to be a justification for development in and of itself.
In addition to parks and recreational services (addressed in the Parks, Recreation &
Trails Element), key municipal services in Calabasas include police protection, fire
protection, and libraries. These services as well as landscape maintenance are
discussed below.
Police Services
All police services are provided through contract with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s
Department. It is anticipated that this relationship will continue over the life of the 2030
General Plan.
It is Calabasas’ vision that crime prevention be emphasized at least on an equal basis
with law enforcement. The net result of this emphasis will be a safer community and a
reduction in the cost of providing police protection services within Calabasas. Police
services will seek to reduce the potential for crimes of opportunity through
implementation of "defensible space" concepts.
To assist in reducing the likelihood of criminal activity, the City will continue working
with the Sheriff's Department to maintain crime prevention programs. The City will also
involve the Sheriff's Department in the development review process to ensure that new
development that is permitted within the City increases surveillance potential, and is
within the ability of the Sheriff's Department to provide police protection service.
Fire Protection Services
Fire protection service in Calabasas is provided through contract with the County of Los
Angeles Fire Department. The County operates two stations within Calabasas as well as
stations in Agoura Hills, Monte Nido, and Topanga Canyon. The City receives fire
protection and paramedic services as well as wildland fire protection and forester tree
service from the Department of Forestry and Fire Warden. It is anticipated that these
relationships will continue over the life of the 2030 General Plan.
Calabasas's vision is that fire prevention be emphasized at least on an equal basis with
fire suppression. The net result of this emphasis will be a safer community and a
reduction in the cost of providing fire protection services within Calabasas. Fire services
will seek to reduce the potential for structural and wildland fires. Services will include

brush clearing within hillside residential areas.
To assist in reducing the likelihood of a disastrous fire, the City will continue to
coordinate land use planning activities with the County Fire Department. The City will
also work with the Department as part of the development review process to ensure that
new development permitted within the City is within the capability of local fire stations
to provide service.
Library Services
The Calabasas Civic Center includes a library that holds 90,000 volumes of reading
material, a children’s reading room, specialty collection areas, a young adult area,
technology center and a reading area for adults. The Friends of the Calabasas Library, a
volunteer group of citizens, provides funds for library programs and events for
Calabasas residents. The City will continue to provide library services that meet the
desires of the community and to promote and support volunteer organizations that help
foster library functions and events.
Landscape Maintenance
The City of Calabasas maintains special assessment districts called landscape
maintenance district (LMDs) that were established to fund and maintain landscaping and
appurtenances for slopes and common areas. There are currently four LMDs within the
City. LMD funds are used for the maintenance of existing landscaping and may also be
used for the enhancement of the existing landscaping and the installation or
maintenance of select hardscape features, such as stamped concrete medians, concrete
paseos, fencing, slumpstone borders, irrigation controllers and decorative lighting. The
City intends to retain and, as necessary, expand these districts in order to maintain and
enhance landscaping and hardscaping in commercial and mixed use districts.
Policies
XII-10    Continue coordination and information exchange between the City of
          Calabasas and local service providers such as the County sheriff’s and fire
          departments and the Las Virgenes Unified School District.

XII.C Educational Services
Objectives
 Promote access for Calabasas residents to high quality local educational services by
    facilitating the acquisition of school sites and the construction of adequate school
    facilities to serve the needs of Calabasas residents and working with Las Virgenes
    Unified School District to promote cooperative educational programs.
 Engage cooperative school/public facility planning, which will ensure provision of
    adequate school facilities and quality educational programs in a manner consistent
    with the goals and strategies of the Calabasas General Plan with respect to facility
    location, use type, timing, funding, recreational and social joint use programs, and
    the creation of an overall sense of community.
General Plan Approach
Although the provision of public school facilities is the responsibility of the Las Virgenes
Unified School District (LVUSD), the City of Calabasas will assist by working with the
LVUSD to develop new school and park facilities together as multiple-use facilities in
order to minimize costs and to maximize utilization. To the extent possible, new school

and park facilities will be located and developed as integrated units serving as
neighborhood cores. Existing school facilities will, to the extent feasible, be adapted
and redeveloped to function as multiple-use cores to give identity to existing
neighborhoods.
As discussed in the Parks, Recreation & Trails Element, the City will work with the LVUSD
to guide the location and design of school and joint school/park sites. New
development will be required to be responsible for providing the necessary funding or
resources to establish facilities commensurate to the project's impact. The City will also
work with the LVUSD to formulate cooperative educational programs.
Policies

         District and coordinate land development review activities with the District's
         master planning efforts.
XII-17   Require new development to provide full mitigation for school impacts, subject
         to the provisions of State law that limit the City's ability to require school
         mitigation.
XII-18   Work with the Las Virgenes Unified School District to assist in the formation of
         special assessment districts for construction of additional schools.

ensure that new development
permitted by the City is within the LVMWD’s ability to provide water and sewer service.
Water infrastructure is designed to respond to the various land use water demands while
also being able to provide service at the peak demand period.
Water conservation practices will continue to be promoted and required through
restrictions on water intensive land uses, water flow devices as well as promotion of
native landscaping. In addition, the LVMWD makes extensive use of recycled water as
about one-quarter of the potable water served to LVMWD customers is reused within the
service area to irrigate landscapes. The expanded use of recycled effluent will be
encouraged throughout the City.

XII.E Wastewater Service & Infrastructure
Objective
Assure that wastewater management infrastructure is adequate to meet projected needs
and are provided in a manner that supports water dependent resources, enhances
recreational opportunities, and preserves and enhances riparian habitats, water quality,
and the environment.
General Plan Approach
The LVMWD is responsible for wastewater treatment in the Calabasas area. Through a
Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (JPA), the LVMWD and the Triunfo Sanitation District
(TSD) jointly own and operate Tapia Water Reclamation Facility (WRF), which treats and
recycles wastewater generated in Calabasas. The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles
County are responsible for maintaining the collection systems and billing individual
customers. The City will continue to work with the LVMWD as part of the development
review process, to ensure that new development permitted by the City is within its
ability to provide sewer service.
Certain areas within Calabasas remain on private septic systems. These areas include
portions of Calabasas Highlands, Saint Andrews Lane and Turtle Creek Road located
west of Mulholland Highway, Dry Canyon Cold Creek Road and the connector roads
Dorothy Road, Valdez Road, and Canyon Drive, Old Topanga Canyon Road between
Mulholland Highway and Mulholland Drive and Black Bird Way, and Hummingbird Way.
Failed septic systems can potentially contaminate both surface water and groundwater.
Consequently, the City will continue to consider expansion of the sanitary sewer system
to provide sewer access in areas of the community where public sewers are currently
lacking.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

XII.F Storm Drains
Objective
Promote effective stormwater management to minimize flood hazards and to protect
slopes, streams, and wetlands from erosion and sedimentation to avoid the degradation
of environmental quality, wildlife habitat, and natural system aesthetics.
General Plan Approach
Stormwater discharges consist of surface water runoff generated from various land uses
which discharge into waters of the State. The quality of these discharges varies and is
affected by geology, land use, season, hydrology, and sequence and duration of
hydrologic events. In general, pollutants in the water runoff can impair the waterways,
thereby discouraging recreational use of the resource, contaminating drinking water
supplies, and interfering with the habitat of fish, other aquatic organisms and wildlife.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

Municipal point source discharges from urbanized areas remain a leading cause of
impairment of surface waters in California.
Public street catch basins within Calabasas are maintained by the Los Angeles County
Road Department and drainage area catch basins are maintained by the County of Los
Angeles Flood Control District. The storm drain and catch basin system is generally
adequate and upgrades needed to facilitate new development will be implemented in
conjunction with the development. The City will also work with the local agencies to
ensure that services and new development permitted by the City is within the ability of
the agencies to provide drainage and stormwater service.
Calabasas requires implementation of Storm Water and Runoff Pollution Prevention
Controls (Best Management Practices) for Development Construction and Redevelopment
controls for private and public projects within the City boundaries. Implementation of
applicable state and federal requirements for new development will continue throughout
the life of the General Plan.
Policies
XII-29    Employ appropriate stormwater management practices to prevent stormwater
          problems from urban runoff, which may include flooding, erosion, or stream
          channel scouring in natural drainage systems. These practices at a minimum
          will include the collection, control and treatment of stormwater runoff at a rate
          and quantity that prevents damage to both man-made and natural drainage
          systems.
XII-30    Promote natural stormwater control mechanisms such as engineered and City-
          approved detention/retention basins and drainage swales to manage
          stormwater runoff.
XII-31    Encourage the use of semi-pervious or pervious surfaces and other low-impact
          development techniques to minimize stormwater runoff from individual sites.
XII-32    Prevent water quality degradation through implementation of Best Management
          Practices and educational programs to reduce pollution entering surface
          waters.
XII-33    Encourage regional approaches to managing stormwater in order to provide
          improved performance, maintenance and cost efficiency.

        a regular review of the General Plan and implementation efforts, integrating
        State requirements for mitigation monitoring under the California
        Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
XIII.A Follow-Up Studies and Actions
The City will update and maintain a Development Code that provides rules and
standards that implement the General Plan. The Development Code will detail the City's
development/environmental review process, maximum allowable impacts for individual
development projects, and performance standards that must be met by new
development. Each of these components will be consistent with 2030 General Plan
goals, policies, and approaches.

Future Annexations
The City of Calabasas will undertake studies to determine the feasibility of annexing
areas within the City’s plan area (as depicted on Figure I-1 in Chapter I, Introduction),
but outside the Calabasas corporate boundaries. Such studies will assess: (1) whether
or not property owners within the potential annexation areas have interest in annexing
to the City; (2) whether political obstacles that may make annexation infeasible exist; (3)
the potential benefits of annexation to the City; and (4) the fiscal impacts of annexation.
In particular, the City will pursue studies to determine whether or not annexation of the
Craftsman’s Corner area north of the Ventura Freeway and generally east of Parkway
Calabasas is feasible. This area is currently within the City of Hidden Hills’ sphere of
influence, so it would need to be removed from the Hidden Hills sphere prior to
annexation to the City. Any study of the feasibility of annexing this area would
necessarily involve discussions with officials at the City of Hidden Hills and the County
of Los Angeles. In conjunction with any annexation of the Craftsman’s Corner area, the
City will prepare a specific plan that identifies appropriate land uses.
Calabasas Resources Inventory
A general inventory of resources within the Calabasas plan area has been developed in
conjunction with this General Plan and other ongoing planning studies. Because many
General Plan policies are keyed to environmental resources, it is imperative that the
information presented in these maps accurately reflects the most current information
available. Therefore, the resources inventory will be continually updated to incorporate
new data on such topics as:
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

development/environmental review process, using:
    x   Environmental documents
    x   Cumulative resource/impact studies
    x   Regional data collection efforts
New Technologies
The General Plan specifies that the City will identify and implement techniques to
improve water quality, reduce water consumption and solid waste generation, and
conserve energy. Research that expands our understanding of these issues and
suggests new technologies to address the problems is continually being undertaken.
New technologies will be reviewed continually and the development code and other
relevant planning documents will be updated as appropriate to incorporate new
technologies.
Small Lot Consolidation
The City will continue to pursue programs to provide incentives for owners of existing
small residential lots to consolidate their holdings into larger parcels. The programs will
consist of pursuing formation of a non-profit entity that would "purchase" these
properties, paying for them with shares in the entity. The non-profit entity would then
consolidate properties into a single development, and re-subdivide the consolidated
property pursuant to the provisions of the General Plan. Once subdivided, parcels would
be sold, with the proceeds going to the original landowners in the form of dividends.
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

Capital Improvement Program Maintenance
The City will continue to maintain a Five-Year Capital lmprovement Program that will be
consistent with the goals, policies, and programs of the General Plan.
Maintenance and Update of Transportation Funding Programs
The City will maintain cumulative traffic impact fees for all new discretionary
development projects and update fees as appropriate. The fees will be updated as
necessary to reflect changed conditions and will provide sufficient funds to implement
the Capital lmprovement Program and mitigate the effects of cumulative development in
the City.
Traffic impact fees will enable the City to continue to collect funds from all
developments occurring within the City. These funds will then be used for the sole
purpose of implementing various improvements to the City's arterial street system. The
traffic impact fee system will continue to distribute the costs of identified arterial street
improvements to new development based solely on the proportional share of total traffic
that the proposed development will generate. Each improvement will be necessary to
mitigate traffic impacts associated with proposed developments so that an acceptable
level of service will continue to be maintained. Fees will continue to be directly
proportional to the benefit that each new development will ultimately receive. Also, the
City will continue to recognize a fee credit to developers who construct proportions of
the identified traffic improvements.
Update and Expansion of Landscape Maintenance Districts
The City will investigate the need to update and expand existing landscape maintenance
districts to fund needed landscape/hardscape maintenance and upgrades in commercial
and mixed use districts. These districts will continue to be funded through
assessments on properties within the district.
Local Transit Services
The City will continually investigate ways in which local transit services can be improved
to meet community needs. Implementation of transit service improvements will be
dictated by need and availability of funding. As existing business and mixed use areas
redevelop over time, the City will require facility improvements in conjunction with new
development that facilitate transit service.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

XIII. GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
Oak Tree Reforestation Fund
The City will pursue establishment of an oak tree reforestation fund. Funding for such a
program could potentially come from fees paid to the City in cases where the onsite
preservation of existing oaks is not possible.
Transportation Planning
The City will develop a corridor plan for the section of Calabasas Road between Parkway
Calabasas and the Old Town area to address future traffic growth resulting from General
Plan buildout. The corridor plan will provide a focused study of the roadway segment
and identify options for improving vehicle flow and overall mobility along the segment.
XIII.B      Intergovernmental Coordination and Community Involvement
Calabasas is committed to truly representational government that seeks appropriate
responses to specific issues. The intergovernmental coordination and community
involvement program proposes actions that reflect this commitment. For example,
some issues, such as the protection of natural resources, not only affect the City of
Calabasas, but also affect adjacent jurisdictions, as well as agencies charged with the
management of regional resources. Many issues cross geographic boundaries, and
therefore require concerted efforts by several governmental entities before they can be
resolved. lntergovernmental coordination means actively pursuing regional solutions to
regional problems. Calabasas is committed to working with its neighbors to address
these issues.
At the same time, Calabasas recognizes that to be truly representational, local
government must reflect the values of the people it serves. Therefore, the City has
established mechanisms for informing the community on local issues and soliciting
citizen input.
Multi-Species Habitat Preservation Programs
Calabasas will continue to support the efforts to create multi-species habitat and open
space preservation programs, and will facilitate the establishment of such programs by
the following means.
     x  The City shall pursue formation of a communitywide assessment district or
        other similar mechanism to purchase such development rights as may be
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

        attached to lands designated for Preservation and Retention in the City's Land
        Management System.
    x   The City shall pursue an open space dedication program similar to a parks
        dedication program. In such a program, each developer would be required to
        dedicate land to an appropriate agency or pay an in-lieu fee where dedication
        is not appropriate.
    x   To ensure the long-term preservation of lands set aside for open space, the
        City will require that development rights or a conservation easement be
        granted to the City, or that another acceptable means of ensuring
        preservation of such lands in perpetuity is established.
    x   The City will use the guidelines described in the Development Review
        Program to encourage clustered development where appropriate, preserve a
        high quality of life and buffer lands dedicated for preservation from adjacent
        development.
Coordination of Land Use Planning Activities
Calabasas will undertake the following in order to ensure that land use planning in
Calabasas will actively pursue review of the land use planning efforts of adjacent
jurisdictions and provide constructive comments regarding the impacts that such
programs will have on the City.
    x   Work with Los Angeles County and other jurisdictions as part of the Ventura
        Freeway Corridor Policy Coordinating Committee to achieve compatibility
        between the Calabasas General Plan and the planning efforts of Los Angeles
        County. Work with Los Angeles County, other jurisdictions, and residents to
        update that portion of the Santa Monica Mountains Area Plan that is within
        the Calabasas General Plan study area.
    x   Continue to work with other local agencies and community groups as a
        means of increasing the effectiveness of Calabasas' voice in regional
        planning efforts and the planning efforts of adjacent jurisdictions.
    x   The City will pursue establishment of interjurisdictional agreements for the
        mitigation of development impacts on a case-by-case basis. It is the City's
        intent that such interjurisdictional agreements support the City's policy of
        using adjacent jurisdictions' General Plans and Master Plans as the basis for
        defining appropriate mitigation of interjurisdictional development impacts.
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

    x    On an annual basis, the City will initiate discussions of issues of mutual
         interest with local, regional, State, and Federal agencies whose efforts could
         benefit or adversely affect the City of Calabasas.
Coordination of Circulation Facility Funding
To the degree feasible and to the extent permitted by inter-agency cooperation,
Calabasas will pursue establishment of reciprocal traffic improvement programs with
jurisdictions that affect and are affected by traffic in Calabasas (the cities of Malibu, Los
Angeles, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village, Agoura Hills and the counties of Los Angeles
and Ventura) to ensure that traffic resulting from development in these communities
does not adversely affect City streets, and to ensure that traffic resulting from
development in Calabasas does not adversely affect the street system in other
jurisdictions.
Calabasas will work with Caltrans, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, Los Angeles and
Ventura counties, and the cities of Los Angeles, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village, and
Agoura Hills to coordinate regional transportation facilities. Coordination efforts will
include:
    x    Updating information on the status of development projects, roadway
         facilities;
    x    Supporting regional public transportation along the Ventura Freeway;
    x    Coordinating with Caltrans, Ventura County, and cities to the west of
         Calabasas to establish a system of park-and-ride lots along with an active
         rideshare matching program; and
    x    Coordinating revisions to the City's circulation and bicycle plans with regional
         circulation planning efforts.
Expansion of Park Facilities and Programs
To ensure the availability of adequate park and recreation programs and facilities,
Calabasas will coordinate recreational programming, park planning and park acquisition
activities with Los Angeles County, the Las Virgenes School District, the city of Agoura
Hills, and local homeowners' associations. City efforts shall include, but not be limited
to:
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

        of active park land.
Update of Technological Capabilities
The City will continue to update communication technology capabilities and implement
new technologies as they become available. Communication technology improvements
will be coordinated by the City’s Media Operations Department, which will continue to
monitor system needs and technological advances and regularly report to the City
Council on recommendations for system enhancements.
Review of Trail Availability
Along with the National Park Service, State Department of Parks and Recreation, and Los
Angeles County, the City will establish and participate in an annual survey of
recreational trails to ensure appropriate maintenance and confirm that trails are open
and available.
Coordination of Planning Programs with the Las Virgenes Unified School District
Calabasas will continue to coordinate future development with the Las Virgenes Unified
School District (LVUSD) by:
     x  Participating with the LVUSD in joint land use/facilities planning efforts;
     x  Requesting that the LVUSD indicate the level of facilities available to serve new
        development projects requiring discretionary review by the City;
     x  Coordinating with the LVUSD in future updates to its Master Plan of Schools,
        which outlines specific sites needed to support buildout of the Calabasas General

Library Funding
The City will conduct an evaluation of the possible expansion of library facilities,
including analysis of the feasibility and desirability of development impact fees and
other sources of funding and developing a new library branch on the west side of
Calabasas.
Maintenance of Disaster Preparedness
The City will maintain a Multi-Hazard Functional Plan to coordinate disaster recovery
activities within Calabasas. As part of this effort, the City will actively solicit the input of
local disaster preparedness agencies, including, but not limited to, fire, police, and the
American Red Cross. Local disaster response will continue to be coordinated under the
Calabasas Emergency Response Program (CERP).
To ensure adequate provision of emergency services in the event of a local disaster, the
City will continue to maintain mutual aid agreements with the Santa Monica National
Recreation Area, the counties of Los Angeles and Ventura, and the cities of Los Angeles,
Hidden Hills, Agoura Hills, and Malibu.
Enhancement of Community Awareness
The effectiveness of the programs described in the Calabasas General Plan is dependent
on the participation of Calabasas residents. To ensure that residents are made aware of
these programs, the City will publicize local programs and provide a forum for public
debate of local issues.
The City will continue to use its newsletter to publicize City-sponsored programs,
including, but not limited to, the following:
    x    Recycling efforts
    x    Ridesharing programs
    x    Recreation programs
    x    Water conservation techniques

Calabasas will also continue to use local cable television and the City’s website as means
of providing public information. Ways in which the use of digital media can be
expanded for providing public information will continue to be investigated and, as
appropriate, implemented. The City’s metropolitan area network will continue to be
expanded to provide broadband connections to public facilities and connect to regional
networks.
The City will also invite agencies involved in water and energy conservation programs to
set up educational displays in City Hall and other community facilities.
Where appropriate, the City will hold "Town Hall Meetings" to facilitate public discussion
of current issues facing the community.
Involving the Community in the Development Review Process; Identification of
Social Compatibility Impacts
In order to facilitate citizen participation in the development review process in a manner
that is meaningful to individuals at the neighborhood level, Calabasas encourages
informal meetings between citizen groups and developers on proposed development
projects. The purpose of such meetings is to facilitate interaction between the
developer and neighborhood interests in a relaxed, informal setting, and to provide the
developer with the opportunity to inform and obtain feedback from the neighborhood.
Specifically, the City encourages developers to meet with affected citizens, and ask
Calabasas citizens to give direction to proposed developments by:
    x    Delineating neighborhood values, goals, and objectives;
    x    Participating in choosing among alternative project designs; and
    x    Participating in the review and modification of development plans.
Although the results of these informal meetings are not binding upon the City, early
consultation and discussion between developers and affected citizens can significantly
facilitate the development review process by resolving issues of social compatibility
before public hearings begin.
Inviting Citizens in Community Decisionmaking
Many of the questions facing the City of Calabasas are complex issues requiring policy
recommendations and an evaluation of tradeoffs that are not easily done in a public
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS

forum. To address these issues, the City Council may appoint task forces to research
specific issues and provide policy direction to the City Council or Planning Commission.
Members of these task forces would be appointed by the City Council. The task forces
will be requested to provide recommended policy direction within a specific time frame,
and will be disbanded after the presentation of their recommendation.
Monitoring of Community Satisfaction: Community Survey
To provide local decisionmakers with regular input on how satisfied Calabasas residents
are with their community and their quality of life, the Calabasas Community Survey will
continue to be updated every two years. Future surveys should address not only general
plan issues such as land use, housing and circulation, but also more specific issues
facing the City at the time of the survey.
Providing Cultural Amenities
In order to expand cultural opportunities for Calabasas residents of all ages, the City
will:
     x  Expand City cultural programs, including theatrical, musical, dance, and
        other performing arts activities
     x  Actively seek the development of public and/or private venues for theater,
        dance, music, and children’s programming
XIII.C          Strategic Planning Programs
Annual General Plan Review
California Government Code Section 65400(b) requires the planning agency of each city
and county in the State to provide an "annual report to the legislative body on the status
of the (general) plan and progress in its implementation." Such a report will be prepared
and delivered annually to the Calabasas City Council.
In addition, AB 3180 (Ch. 1232, Stats. 1988), which amended the California
Environmental Quality Act, requires every city and county to develop a monitoring or
reporting plan in order to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects. For those
environmental mitigation strategies outlined in the 2030 General Plan EIR, the annual
                                                                        CITY of CALABASAS
                                           XIII-12

                                                                        CITY OF CALABASAS
                                                                       2030 GENERAL PLAN
                                                  XIII. GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
report prepared for the City Council regarding implementation of the General Plan will
also be used to satisfy AB 3180 requirements.
Pursuant to the provisions of the 2030 General Plan, the City Council will not permit new
development to cause the performance of public services and facilities to fall below
performance standards included in the updated Development Code. The annual report
on General Plan implementation will be used to identify the performance of services and
facilities in relation to the performance standards adopted as part of the Development
Code update.
Among the statutory responsibilities of California cities and counties is to "annually
review the capital improvement program of the City or county and the local public works
projects of other local agencies for their consistency with the General Plan ..."
(Government Code Section 65103(c)). Also, pursuant to State law (Government Code
Section 65401), all departments within the City and all other local government agencies
(including the County school districts, and special districts) must submit a list of
proposed capital improvement projects to the City. The City is then responsible for
reviewing these projects for conformity with the General Plan and reporting back to the
agency. The City will execute these requirements for General Plan consistency reporting
and review capital improvement plans to the best of its ability. The annual General Plan
implementation report process required by Government Code Section 65400(b) will be
used to comply with these reporting requirements.
Maintenance of an Up-to-Date General Plan
To continue to function as the "constitution" for managing the community's future, the
General Plan should reflect current conditions and social values. As a result, State law
provides for amending and updating the General Plan. By law, the General Plan may be
amended a maximum of four times per year (multiple changes may be grouped into
each amendment). State law also requires the City's Housing Element to be updated
every 5 years.
It is anticipated that the annual General Plan review will result in amendments to the
General Plan that are needed to keep the document up to date. In addition, citizens and
landowners may apply for General Plan Amendments. The City Council and Planning
Commission may initiate, or any citizen may apply to amend General Plan text, exhibits,
or maps. In order to ensure a compatible and internally consistent General Plan, any
proposed change to the General Plan must be consistent with the criteria and conditions
of the balance of the General Plan text, as well as with General Plan maps and exhibits.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

2030 GENERAL PLAN
XIII. GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
General Plan amendment requests will be processed in accordance with State planning
law, CEQA, and City ordinances. There are three categories of General Plan
amendments, with each type being of a different complexity to review and process in
accordance with State requirements. Fees for these amendments will reflect the cost of
processing each type of application. The three types of amendments, as shown in Table
XIII-I, include Major, Minor, and Technical amendments.
                                              Table XIII-1
                           Types of General Plan Amendments
                                            Major Amendments
Major amendments are any changes to the goals, policies, or actions that would alter the basic policy
directions previously set forth within the Plan. A Major Amendment is also a change that would increase
development intensity or extend urban services into areas previously intended to be committed to rural or
open space use. Under State law, each element of the General Plan may be amended four times per year;
however, there is no limit on the number of individual changes any single General Plan Amendment may
consider.
                                            Minor Amendments
Minor Amendments will be considered on an ongoing basis and will be grouped together, as needed, to
form individual amendments for final action by the City. Minor Amendments include mapping or simple
textual changes that do no increase maximum allowable development intensity and do not create the need
for extension of urban services to an area. Under State law, each element of the General Plan may only be
amended four times per year; however, there is no limit on the number of individual changes any single
General Plan Amendment may consider.
                                           Technical Corrections
Amendments of this nature are essentially changes to the data base and statistics used in the preparation
of the General Plan and contained in the appendices to the General Plan, as well as corrections of
grammatical and typographical errors that do not change the meaning of policies and actions as adopted.
These will be processed on an ongoing basis. Because Technical Revisions are editorial rather than
substantive in nature, more than four Technical Revisions may be approved by the City for any individual
element within a year.
Interpretation of the General Plan Land Use Map
In any case where uncertainty exists regarding the location of boundaries of any land
use category, proposed public facility symbol, circulation alignment, or other symbol or
line found on the official maps, the following procedures will be used to resolve such
uncertainty:
     x    Boundaries shown as approximately following lot lines shall be construed to
          be following such lot lines.
     x    Where a land use category applied to a parcel is not mapped to include an
          adjacent street or alley, the category shall be considered to extend to the
          centerline of the right-of-way.
                                                                                       CITY of CALABASAS
                                                    XIII-14
                                                                        CITY OF CALABASAS
                                                                       2030 GENERAL PLAN
                                                   XIII. GENERAL PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
     x   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the limits of any
         municipal corporation shall be construed as following such limits.
     x   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following section lines,
         half-section lines, or quarter-section lines shall be construed as following
         such lines.
     x   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following railroad lines shall
         be construed to lie midway between the main tracks of such railroad lines.
     x   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following high water lines
         shall be construed to follow the mean high water lines of such lakes, and, in
         the event of change in the mean high water line, shall be construed as
         moving with the actual mean high water line.
     x   Boundaries shown as following or approximately following the centerlines of
         streams, creeks, rivers, or other continuously flowing water courses shall be
         construed as following the channel centerline of such water courses taken at
         mean low water, and, in the event of a natural change in the location of such
         streams, rivers, or other water courses, the zone boundary shall be construed
         as moving with the channel centerline.
     x   Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or approximately parallel
         to, any of the features listed above shall be construed to be parallel to such
         features and at such distances as are shown on the maps.
     x   Symbols that indicate appropriate locations for proposed public facilities are
         not property-specific. They indicate only the general area within which a
         specific facility should be established.
Resolution of Competing Objectives
It is the intent of the Calabasas General Plan to present straightforward goals,
objectives, approaches, policies, and implementation programs, and to present
sufficient information with which to make consistent land use and policy decisions.
Nevertheless, the inclusion of goals, objectives, approaches, policies, and
implementation programs that are based on competing community values is inevitable.
An example of such a case is the requirement for regular watering of areas being graded
and the desire for water conservation.
Where such competition between competing values results in seemingly incompatible
policies or implementation actions, the General Plan text often describes the relative
priorities of the competing objectives. In the absence of such specific direction, City
decisionmakers will be required to determine the relative priorities of the values upon
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

which the policies or implementation actions are based, and to act based on that
determination.
Maintenance of Adequate Municipal Services and Facilities
As part of the annual General Plan review, the City will conduct an assessment of the
municipal services and facilities being provided to Calabasas residents and businesses.
The assessment will determine whether the performance level of municipal services and
facilities fulfill General Plan objectives and policies. This review will also include an
evaluation of the adequacy of City facilities and equipment; personnel staffing and
program needs; and five year equipment, facility, and staffing needs based on
anticipated growth and desired levels of service.
If General Plan objectives and policies are not being met, the following procedures will
be implemented:
    x    The City will determine the nature and geographic extent of the deficiency,
         and may establish a Municipal Facilities lmprovement Area.
    x    Upon establishment of a Municipal Facilities Improvement Area, the City
         Council will direct the City Manager to prepare a program for City Council
         adoption to ensure that the performance objectives will be met at the earliest
         possible date.
    x    As part of the program to cure the identified deficiency, appropriate
         limitations on new development will be established within the improvement
         areas to facilitate elimination of the deficiency. These limitations will remain
         in effect until the deficiency is eliminated.
    x    New development within the improvement area will be required to provide
         such facilities as are necessary to ensure that the services and facilities
         provided to the new development meet established performance standards,
         and that the services and facilities provided to existing development will not
         be further degraded.
Promoting Energy Conservation
Calabasas will enforce and periodically update the Green Building Ordinance to minimize
energy conservation requirements of new development in the City. The City will also set
an example for energy conservation by minimizing energy consumption in City
operations. Techniques for energy conservation include, but are not limited to:
                                                                           CITY of CALABASAS

     x  Emphasizing fuel efficiency in the purchase and use of City-owned vehicles
     x  Periodically reviewing energy use by City operations and implementing
        programs to conserve energy
     x  Encouraging the use of bicycles by providing bicycle storage facilities at all
        City facilities
     x  Achieving adopted solid waste source reduction and recycling goals in
        municipal operations
Expansion of Parks and Recreational Facilities
To ensure that adequate parks and recreational facilities are available to Calabasas
residents of Calabasas, the City shall allocate funds for:
     x  Continued operation of existing City parks and recreational
        facilities/activities
     x  Securing public access to Las Virgenes Unified School District sites for non-
        school recreational programs during after school hours
     x  A fair share of maintenance costs for joint school/park facilities
The City will also pursue additional sources of funds for the acquisition and
development of additional active park land at the locations identified in the Parks,
Recreation & Trails Element (Chapter X) or other identified suitable locations.
Responsible Regionalism: Project Review
Calabasas will provide timely review and constructive comments on the projects
proposed or considered by other agencies that potentially affect Calabasas. The City
will base its comments and requests for mitigation of impacts upon the provisions of
this General Plan and will actively lobby jurisdictions to apply the same principles of
recognizing each agency's General Plan or Master Plan that Calabasas uses in mitigating
interjurisdictional impacts of City projects.
                                                                         CITY of CALABASAS

The purpose of this Appendix is to define the terms used to describe the City of
Calabasas' policy commitments. Table A-1 presents definitions for basic terms, such as
"permit," "encourage," "manage," "require," "ensure," and others, not in alphabetical
order, but in increasing levels of commitment, ranging from "recognize" to "ensure."
Table A-2 defines terms such as "should," "shall," and "feasible," which are used to
modify the various descriptions of policy commitment made in the General Plan.

                          Action will be taken to compel others to take action or to perform in
 Action                   a manner so as to prevent the occurrence of a particular event or
                          result.
                          Action will be undertaken to formulate policy, guidelines, or
                          ordinances or revisions thereto. The expectation is that resources
 Adopt                    would be devoted to creating the policy, guidelines, ordinances, or
                          revisions and that they will be formally enacted by appropriate City
                          decision makers.
                          Action will be taken to pay for and carry out a specific program,
                          study, or activity. The expectation is that City resources would be
 Conduct, Undertake
                          directly committed to implementation, and that the City will be the
                          primary or sole entity involved in the program, study, or activity.
                          Action will be taken to expend time and money in jointly pursuing an
                          implementing activity with other entities. The expectation is that
 Coordinate               implementation will definitely result, and that it will be accomplished
                          cooperatively with other organizations, possibly with the City in the
                          lead.
                          Action will be undertaken to formulate policy, guidelines, or
                          ordinances or revisions thereto. The expectation is that resources
 Develop, Prepare         would be devoted to creating the policy, guidelines, ordinances, or
                          revisions for public review and consideration by City decision
                          makers.

                    Avoidance of the action will receive positive treatment in written

                    resources to assist others to avoid the action or condition being
                    discouraged. The expectation is that, to the extent that the action or
                    condition meets both the objectives of the City and the other party,
 Discourage
                    that the action or condition will not occur. In cases where the City
                    cannot compel the actions of others, avoidance of the action will
                    receive no further action or commitment of resources other than
                    transmitting the policy, as appropriate, to influence others to avoid
                    specific actions. The expectation is that a specific position will be on
                    record as the official City position.
                    The action will receive positive treatment in written policy, and will
                    be transmitted as appropriate to influence others. In cases where
                    the City can compel action, such as in the
                    Development/Environmental Review process, the City will commit
                    resources to assist others to achieve the action or condition being
 Encourage
                    encouraged. The expectation is that, to the extent that the action or
                    condition meets both the objectives of the City and the other party,
                    that the action or condition will occur. In cases where the City
                    cannot compel the actions of others, encourage is synonymous with
                    support.
                    Action will be taken to improve existing conditions by increasing the
                    quantity or quality of beneficial uses or existing actions. The
 Enhance
                    expectation is that a desirable condition exists, and is to be
                    improved by the action.
                    Action will be taken to guarantee a certain outcome or result. The
                    expectation is that, in guaranteeing a particular result, the City will
 Ensure
                    commit resources, and has the legal right to compel other parties to
                    take a particular action or perform in a prescribed manner.
                    Action will be taken to implement the policy by making an
                    organizational commitment, initiate devoting resources, and
 Establish
                    instituting a process or program that does not now exist. The
                    expectation is that a new activity will be launched.
                    Action will be taken to investigate the subject to determine whether
                    or not some further commitment is in order. The expectation is that
 Explore
                    effort will be expended for research and evaluation, and that an
                    open mind will be maintained until the evidence is in.
                    Specific incentives, which may consist of monetary, time,
                    development intensity, and/or other benefits, will be created as an
 Facilitate         inducement for others to take action. The expectation is that the
                    incentives will be sufficient to influence behavior in ways beneficial
                    to the City's interests.

       Policy Term                                 Definition
                   expectation is that City resources would be directly committed to
                   implementation.
                   Action will be taken to continue ongoing City programs or services.
Maintain           The expectation is that active means may be employed to continue
                   such programs or services.
                   Action will be taken to direct activities in order to achieve specific
Manage
                   objectives.
                   Action will be taken to reduce or lessen, but not necessarily
                   eliminate, an existing condition or action to the greatest feasible
Minimize           extent. The expectation is that positive action will be undertaken to
                   improve existing conditions by reducing the negative consequences
                   of a particular situation.
                   Action will be taken to ameliorate, alleviate, or avoid to the extent
                   feasible, an undesirable situation or consequence of action. The
Mitigate
                   expectation is that negative consequences will be reduced to a level
                   of insignificance.
                   Action will occur along with other entities, and the City will carry its
Participate        share of the responsibility. The expectation is that the policy will be
                   carried out jointly, but that the City will not be in the lead.
                   The action will be allowed if initiated by someone other than the
                   City. The expectation is that the policy will be carried out if it is
                   important to someone other than the City. This definition of
Permit
                   "permit" as a verb is distinguished from "permit" when used as a
                   noun, which means an entitlement resulting from approval of a
                   development application.
                   Action will be taken to maintain beneficial uses or features in their
Preserve           present condition as nearly as possible. The expectation is that the
                   feature itself will endure over time as the result of that action.
                   Action will be taken to compel others not to take a particular action
                   or perform in a prescribed manner. The expectation is that the City
Prohibit, Prevent
                   will commit resources, and has the legal right to compel other
                   parties in this manner.
                   Action will be taken to actively communicate the idea, information,
                   or position. The audience may be the general public, specific
Promote            interest groups, or other entities. The expectation is that the City
                   would devote resources to advise others of its belief as a means of
                   convincing them to do so as well.
                   Action will be taken to keep a feature safe from destruction or decay,
                   or to keep that feature intact. The expectation is that the positive
Protect
                   qualities of that feature will endure over time as the result of the
                   action.

       Policy Term                                  Definition
                    Action will be taken to offer a product, service, or facility, though not
 Provide            necessarily without a fee. The expectation is that the City will take
                    direct responsibility for making the action happen.
                    Action will be taken to offer an opportunity for others to undertake
                    an activity or achieve some objective. The expectation is that the
 Provide for
                    City will take positive action to ensure that a specified opportunity is
                    available for parties wishing to take advantage of it.
                    Action will be taken to investigate the subject to determine whether
                    or not some further commitment is in order as a prelude to
 Pursue             undertaking implementing action. The expectation is that effort will
                    be expended for research and evaluation, and that, if the proposed
                    activity proves to be feasible and desirable, it will be undertaken.
                    A given situation will be perceived and allowed to continue without
 Recognize          interference and without determination of its positive or negative
                    nature. The expectation is that no other action is necessary.
                    Action will be taken to compel others to take a particular action or
                    perform in a prescribed manner. The expectation is that the City will
 Require
                    commit resources, and has the legal right to compel other parties in
                    this manner.
                    Action will be taken to check; provide boundaries or limits; or to
                    decrease the range, scope, or incidence or a particular condition.
 Restrict
                    The expectation is that the condition will be allowed to continue, but
                    only within the limited parameters set by policy.
                    There will be a commitment of resources to influence an action or
                    outcome of another entity. The expectation is that legislative,
 Seek
                    financing, policy, or other change would be achieved on the part of
                    one or more entities other than the City.
                    The action will receive positive treatment in written policy, but will
                    receive no further action or commitment of resources other than
 Support            transmitting the policy as appropriate to influence others to take
                    specific actions. The expectation is that a positive position will be
                    on record as the official City position.
                                                                          CITY of CALABASAS

Below-market-rate Housing Unit
    Any housing unit specifically priced to be sold or rented to low- or moderate-

    for providing public infrastructure. Bonds may be issued to finance the
    improvements, subject to repayment by assessments charged against the benefitting
    properties. Creation of a Benefit Assessment District enables property owners in a
    specific area to cause the construction of public facilities or to maintain them (for
    example, a downtown, or the grounds and landscaping of a specific area) by

  specified in the General Plan may be expressed in units per acre.
Density Bonus
  The allocation of development rights that allow a parcel to accommodate additional
  square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the
  parcel is zoned, usually in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity

  that provides 20% of its units for lower income households, or 10% of its units for
  very low-income households, or 50% of its units for seniors, is entitled to a density
  bonus. (See "Development Rights, Transfer of.")

  the following ways: use restrictions, minimum lot-size requirements, floor area
  ratios, land use-intensity ratios, setback and yard requirements, minimum house-
  size requirements, ratios comparing number and types of housing units to land area,
  limits on units per acre, and other means. Allowable density often serves as the
  major distinction between residential districts.

  things be done and that other things not be done. Design Control language is most
  often found within a zoning ordinance. "Design Review" usually refers to a system
  set up outside of the zoning ordinance, whereby projects are reviewed against
  certain standards and criteria by a specially established design review board or
  committee. (See "Architectural Control.")

 Detention Dam/Basin/Pond
    Dams may be classified according to the broad function they serve, such as storage,
    diversion, or detention. Detention dams are constructed to retard flood runoff and
    minimize the effect of sudden floods. Detention dams fall into two main types. In
    one type, the water is temporarily stored, and released through an outlet structure at
    a rate which will not exceed the carrying capacity of the channel downstream.
    Often, the basins are planted with grass and used for open space or recreation in
    periods of dry weather. In the other type, most often called a Retention Pond, the
    water is held as long as possible and may or may not allow for the controlled release
    of water. In some cases, the water is allowed to seep into the permeable banks or
    gravel strata in the foundation. This latter type is sometimes called a Water-
    Spreading Dam or Dike because its main purpose is to recharge the underground
    water supply. Detention dams are also constructed to trap sediment. These are
    often called Debris Dams.
Developable Land
    Land that is suitable as a location for structures and which can be developed free of
    hazards to, and without disruption of or significant impact to, natural resource
    areas.

 Floor Area Ratio (FAR)
    The gross floor area permitted on a site divided by the total net area of the site,
    expressed in decimals to one or two places. For example, on a site with 10,000 net
    sq. ft. of land area, a Floor Area Ratio of 1.0 will allow a maximum of 10,000 gross
    sq. ft. of building floor area to be built. On the same site, an FAR of 1.5 would allow
    15,000 sq. ft. of floor area; an FAR of 2.0 would allow 20,000 sq. ft.; and an FAR of
    0.5 would allow only 5,000 sq. ft. Also commonly used in zoning, FARs typically are
    applied on a parcel-by-parcel basis as opposed to an average FAR for an entire land
    use or zoning district.

Households, Number of
    The count of all year-round housing units occupied by one or more persons. The
    concept of household is important because the formation of new households
    generates the demand for housing. Each new household formed creates the need
    for one additional housing unit or requires that one existing housing unit be shared
    by two households. Thus, household formation can continue to take place even
    without an increase in population, thereby increasing the demand for housing.

    x    Level of Service C denotes a reasonably steady, high-volume flow of traffic, with
         some limitations on movement and speed, and occasional backups on critical
         approaches.
    x    Level of Service D denotes the level where traffic nears an unstable flow.
         Intersections still function, but short queues develop and cars may have to wait
         through one cycle during short peaks.
    x    Level of Service E describes traffic characterized by slow movement and frequent
         (although momentary) stoppages. This type of congestion is considered severe,
         but is not uncommon at peak traffic hours, with frequent stopping, long-
         standing queues, and blocked intersections.
    x    Level of Service F describes unsatisfactory stop-and-go traffic characterized by
         "traffic jams" and stoppages of long duration. Vehicles at signalized
         intersections usually have to wait through one or more signal changes, and
         "upstream" intersections may be blocked by the long queues.

11. Are there any additional comments you would like to provide the City for its 2013-2021 Housing
Element update?
Affordable Housing Comments
- Provide more affordable housing options.
- Need more apartments for seniors of modest income.
- Calabasas has enough higher priced homes, and needs homes for families with school age children of
   modest incomes.
- Very important to get some lower cost housing; maybe then the Schools would not rely on drawing in
   students from outside the community.
- Provide rent control to help protect tenants in Calabasas from predatory landlords and allow them to
   remain in their units.
- Need to address rapidly rising space rents in mobilehome park and preserve as relatively low cost
   housing option. (2 comments)
RHNA (Regional Housing Needs Allocation) and Development Comments
- Address RHNA (i.e. multi-family residential) in commercial and mixed use districts like many
 surrounding cities.
- Mixed Use housing should not be located adjacent to the freeway. The General Plan Land Use Planning
 Noise Levels identify these areas as unsuitable for residential use.
- Need shopping and services within walking distance of housing, especially senior housing. (2 comments)
- Residential development should be dovetailed with creation of jobs in the City.
- Stop concentrating RHNA (i.e. multi-family) zoning in Malibu Canyon.
- Don’t allow Calabasas to become overbuilt as this would ruin the character of the City.
- Think about traffic before building additional property.
- Prefer maintaining existing open spaces to any new development.
                                                    C1-3

Building Design Comments
- Encourage a mix of single and multi-level housing; too few units have no stairs either to the unit or
 within the unit.
- Require all new buildings to be energy efficient (LEED Gold standard).
- Provide homes with more architectural interest.
Home Improvement Comments

                                            I. DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE
Demographic changes can affect the type and amount of housing that is needed in a
community. This section presents the population, age, race/ethnicity, and employment
characteristics of Calabasas residents.
A.       POPULATION GROWTH AND TRENDS
Table 1 presents population growth trends in Calabasas, and compares this growth to
neighboring jurisdictions and the entire County of Los Angeles. Calabasas experienced
an eight percent increase in population during the 1990s, fairly comparable to the seven
percent growth evidenced Countywide, yet below the twelve percent growth level
experienced in nearby Westlake Village and Thousand Oaks.
During the most recent decade, Calabasas’ population increased by a robust fifteen
percent to 23,058 residents, representing a net increase in approximately 3,000 new
residents. This level of population growth was well above the three percent increase
experienced Countywide, and exceeded population growth levels in other Conejo Valley
jurisdictions.

                                                                     Percent Change

In terms of future trends, the Southern California Association of Governments’ (SCAG)
Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy Growth Forecast
projects a modest 3.5 percent increase in Calabasas’ population over the 2008-2020
period, for an estimated 2020 population of 23,800 residents.

B.       AGE CHARACTERISTICS
Housing need is often affected by the age characteristics of residents in the community.
Different age groups have different lifestyles, income levels, and family types that
influence housing needs.
Table 2 shows the age distribution of Calabasas residents in 2000 and 2010, and
compares this to the age distribution Countywide. As indicated in the table, in 2010, 24
percent of Calabasas’ residents were children under the age of 18, compared to 2000
when children comprised 28 percent of the City’s population. The decline in children is
further evidenced by decline in family households with children in Calabasas, which
dropped from 43 to 38 percent over the past decade (refer to Table 4 later in this
chapter).
The biggest changes to Calabasas’ age profile occurred in the young adult (25-44 years)
and middle age (45-64 years) groups. Both the proportion and number of young adults
declined significantly during the decade, decreasing from 29 to 22 percent of the
population, and declining by over 800 residents. This trend is a reflection of the aging in
place of young adults into middle age, and the limited number of new young adults
moving into the community. Conversely, the middle age population grew dramatically,
now comprising 32 percent of the City’s population, and well above the Countywide
average of 24 percent. This shift in growth from young adults to middle age is indicative
of the area’s high for-sale housing costs and limited rental opportunities.
Finally, the percentage of seniors (65 years and older) in Calabasas also increased
significantly from 8 to 13 percent during this time. The population of Calabasas, as a
whole, is aging. The City experienced the greatest numeric population increase in its two
oldest age categories (middle age and seniors). The 2010 Census puts the median age
of Calabasas at 41.6 years, nearly seven years older than the median age of 34.8 years
for the County. Calabasas has made significant progress in expanding housing options
for seniors in recent years, with development of the 75 unit Canyon Creek Apartments
and 60 unit Horizons 55 active senior housing communities.

C.      RACE AND ETHNICITY
Table 3 displays the racial/ethnic distribution of Calabasas’ population and compares it
to the Countywide distribution. The City experienced little change in ethnic composition
over the decade, with Whites continuing to make up the largest majority of the City’s
population (80% in 2010 compared to 84% in 2000). In contrast, Whites comprise only
28% of the population Countywide.
The percentage of Asians (9%), Hispanics (6%), African Americans (2%), and American
Indians (<1%) in Calabasas also remained relatively constant throughout from 2000 to
2010, showing relatively minor increases in number. The small size of the City’s minority
population stands in sharp contrast to the population of Los Angeles County as a whole.

D.     EMPLOYMENT
The Southern California Association of Governments’ (SCAG) Regional Transportation
Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy Growth Forecast estimates there were a total of
14,800 jobs in Calabasas in 2008, and projects a modest 4.0 percent increase in
Calabasas’ employment over the 2008-2020 period, for a total of 15,400 jobs in 2020.
The U.S. Census collects detailed information on primary jobs, defined as the highest
paying job for an individual worker for the year, but excluding self-employed or
“informally employed” workers. A total of 12,314 primary jobs were identified in 2010 in
Calabasas; while this is approximately 16 percent below the 14,800 total jobs identified
by SCAG, the data provides a greater level of detail on the City’s workforce. As depicted
in Table 4, finance/insurance (13.3%) and professional/scientific/technical services
(13.1%) are the most dominant employment sectors, followed by manufacturing (10.2%),
accommodation and food services (8.8%), and retail trade (7.7%).

Among the approximately 12,300 persons employed in primary jobs in Calabasas, over
90 percent commute in from outside the City limits, an indication of the shortage of local
affordable housing opportunities for the community’s workforce. Similarly, Calabasas
residents also face long commutes, with ¼ of the City’s 10,300 employed residents
commuting over 45 minutes to work (2010 census).

E.      HOUSEHOLD TYPE
A household is defined as all persons living in a housing unit. Families are a subset of
households. They include persons living together who are related by blood, marriage, or
adoption. A single person living alone is also a household. “Other” households are
unrelated people residing in the same dwelling unit. Group quarters, such as dormitories
or convalescent homes, are not considered households.
Table 5 illustrates household characteristics in Calabasas in 2000 and 2010, and
compares it to the Countywide distribution. In 2010, Calabasas was home to 8,543
households. The City had an average household size of 2.70 persons and an average
family size of 3.11 persons, indicating minimal change from 2000.
Families comprise the majority of households in Calabasas (75%), including families with
children (38%), and those without children (37%). Over the past decade, the proportion
of families with children has decreased from 43 to 38 percent of all households. In
contrast, the proportion of family households without children increased from 33 to 37
percent, and single-person households increased from 17 to 19. Nearly 60 percent of
the City’s household growth between 2000-2010 was due to an increase in childless
family households, with 30 percent of this growth attributable to single person
households. These trends reflect the aging in place of Calabasas’ existing households
and the limited number of new families with children moving into the community due in
part to high housing costs.

F.       HOUSEHOLD INCOME
Household income is one of the most important factors affecting housing opportunity. It
is also crucial in determining a household’s ability to balance housing costs with the
other basic necessities of life.
The State and Federal government classify household income into several groupings
based upon the relationship to the County adjusted median income (AMI), adjusted for
household size. The State of California utilizes the income groups presented in Table 6,
which are thus used throughout the Housing Element.

Table 7 presents the distribution of household income in Calabasas by income category
measured as a percentage of the County median. Above moderate income households
(>120% AMI) comprise the vast majority of households in Calabasas, at 75 percent.
Despite the City’s overall affluence, however, over 1,100 Calabasas households earn
lower incomes (<80% AMI). While relatively limited in number (6% of households),
extremely low income (ELI) households (<30% AMI) have significant housing needs.
According to CHAS Data compiled by HUD, 47 percent of the City’s ELI households are
renters (208 households), with 79 percent of these ELI renters spending more than half
their income towards housing. Since 2004, the City of Calabasas has funded a rental
assistance program to assist extremely low and very low income senior and disabled
renters to remain in the community, and provides ongoing monthly rental assistance to
50 households through this program.

                                    II. CALABASAS HOUSING NEEDS
Calabasas enjoys high quality residential neighborhoods, a strong local employment
base, a high level of public services and a scenic natural setting, all of which contribute
to the community’s attractiveness as a place to live and work.                           However, the
community’s desirability has continued to place upward pressure on the housing market,
making it increasingly difficult for key members of the community to live here –
workforce, seniors, grown children of current residents.
To help understand the nature and extent of housing needs in Calabasas, this section
provides an overview of these needs as they relate to:
                 Renter and Homeowner Affordability
                 Housing Adequacy
                 Seniors and Other Special Needs Groups
                 Workforce Housing Needs
                 Assisted Housing At-Risk of Conversion
                 Regional Housing Needs
By way of background, Calabasas contained 8,878 housing units in 2010. The range of
housing types reflects the City’s largely hillside topography and peripheral suburban
nature. Over three-quarters (76%) of the City’s housing is comprised of single-family
units, either attached or detached, while multi-family apartments and condominiums
account for one-fifth (21%) of the housing stock. The City’s one mobile home park -
Calabasas Village Mobile Estates with 210 units – comprises three percent of the
housing in Calabasas.

A.      RENTAL MARKET AND AFFORDABILITY
Calabasas is predominately an ownership community, with renters comprising just one-
quarter of the City’s households (2010 Census). Three market-rate apartment
complexes exist in the City – Malibu Canyon Apartments (698 units), Archstone
Calabasas (previously Malibu Meadows - 600 units), and Malibu Creek Apartments (44
units). While the recently developed Canyon Creek Apartments provides 75 rental units
for lower income seniors, this complex is not included in the rent survey as rents are
restricted to low income levels.
Rent levels in the three market-rate apartments are presented in Table 9, and generally
average $1,475 for a studio, $1,500 for a one-bedroom, $1,900 for a two-bedroom, and
$2,150 for a three-bedroom unit. By comparison, the City’s 2008 Housing Element
documents average rents approximately ten percent above these 2012 levels, reflecting
the impact of the prolonged economic recession.

Source: Rental Registration reports submitted to Planning staff by Malibu Canyon Apartments, Archstone
Calabasas, and Malibu Creek Apartments, August 2012.
Malibu Canyon and Archstone Calabasas were financed through Los Angeles County’s
Multi-family Mortgage Revenue Bond Program, requiring 20 percent of each project’s
units to be provided to low income (80% of Area Median Income, or “AMI”) households
at affordable rents. There is a lengthy waiting list for the 260 affordable units in these
projects. The rent differential between market and affordable units in these complexes
ranges from approximately $50 to $500, depending on the number of bedrooms. Based
on County bond requirements, affordable units are required to be dispersed amongst the
bedroom types. The affordability controls on Malibu Canyon Apartments expire in June
2016, whereas controls in Archstone Calabasas extend until April 2028.
Table 10 presents the maximum affordable rents in 2012 for very low, low and moderate
income households by household size, and compares with the 2012 average apartment
rents in Calabasas from Table 9. As indicated, average rents are well above the level of
affordability for very low, low and even moderate income households. However,
apartments at the low end of the rental ranges identified in Table 9 do fall within
moderate income levels of affordability.

Rental Vacancy
The vacancy rate measures the overall housing availability in a community and is often a
good indicator of how efficiently for-sale and rental housing units are meeting the current
demand for housing. A vacancy rate of five percent for rental housing suggests that
there is a balance between the supply and demand of housing, whereas vacancies well
below this level may indicate that households are having difficulty finding available
housing, which can lead to high competition for units and upward pressure on rents.
The 2010 Census measures a rental vacancy rate of 5.2 percent in Calabasas,
indicating a sufficient supply of vacant rental units for normal mobility.
Calabasas Village Mobile Estates
Calabasas Village Mobile Estates located on Mulholland Highway contains 210
mobilehome spaces. The park owner estimates that approximately one-third (60-70
households) of park occupants are senior citizens. While historically the park has
served as a source of relatively affordable housing, increases in space rents have
rendered it unaffordable to lower income tenants. Current (August 2012) rent levels
range from $928 to $1,580, with overall average rent level of $1,190. 1 Average rents the
prior year were approximately $1,167, reflecting a $23 increase. In addition to space
rents, some occupants may also have monthly mortgage payments on their mobilehome
coach.
In response to escalating rents, in January 2004, the City initiated a Rental Assistance
Program for lower income tenants in the park, providing for a monthly subsidy of up to
$100 for income-qualified tenants. The program has subsequently been expanded to
include lower income seniors and disabled residents in the City’s apartment complexes
also impacted by rent increases. In December 2010, the City Council made the Rental
Assistance Program permanent, expanding its capacity to 50 households and increasing
monthly subsidy levels to $175, plus a yearly increase based on the Consumer Price
Index. In 2013, the monthly rent subsidy is $186.

nearby communities of Agoura Hills, Malibu, Thousand Oaks, Topanga and Westlake
Village during calendar year 2012, by zip code. In 2012, 182 single-family homes were
sold in the Calabasas zip code of 91302 2, commanding a median sales price of
$1,127,000, well above other Conejo Valley communities, and only below that of Malibu.
The City’s median home price increased by 15 percent from 2011, in contrast to most
other Conejo Valley communities that were still experiencing price depreciation in the
single-family market.
With 188 condominiums sold in 2012, the level of condominium sales in Calabasas is
comparable to that of single-family homes. Condominium prices in Calabasas are
significantly above that of other nearby communities, and with a median of $900,000, are
$350,000 higher than even Malibu. In comparison to the previous year, condominium
sales prices appreciated 7.1 percent in Calabasas, double the level of appreciation
evidenced Countywide.

Calabasas Housing Sales
While the prior Table 11 provides an overview of the subregional housing market in 2012
and sales within the greater 91302 Calabasas zip code, the following Table 12 provides
detailed information on sales within the Calabasas city limits during calendar year 2012.
A total of 98 single-family home sales were recorded within the City during this period (in
contrast to 182 homes in the entire 91302 zip code). Four-bedroom units were the most
prevalent homes sold, characteristic of Calabasas’ relatively newer housing stock of
larger sized units. For example, the average unit size among the 41 four-bedroom units
sold was 3,050 square-feet, and the average year built was 1980. Median sales prices
ranged from $380,000 (for homes with two-bedrooms) to $750,000 (four-bedroom) to
$1,799,816 (six or more bedrooms). The overall median home price sales price within
the Calabasas city limits was $785,000 for a 3,450 square-foot home, well below the
$1.1 million median price documented within the greater 91302 zip code (refer to Table
10).
Approximately two-thirds of units sold in Calabasas were condominiums, totaling 169
units. The median priced condominium sold for $825,000, exceeding the median single-
family home price by $40,000. Two and three-bedroom units represented approximately
half of all units sold, and provide a relatively affordable homeownership option in
Calabasas, particularly in some of the older complexes in town.

Homeowner Affordability
The affordability of housing in Calabasas can be assessed by comparing market sales
prices with the amount that households of different income levels can afford to pay for
housing. Table 13 presents the maximum affordable purchase price for moderate
income households (120% AMI), and compares this with market sales prices for single-
family homes and condominiums in Calabasas as previously documented in Table 12.
As illustrated below, the maximum affordable purchase price ranges from $320,000 for a
three person household, $357,500 for a four person household, and $383,500 for a five
person household, rendering single-family home prices in Calabasas well beyond the
reach of moderate income households.
Condominiums, however, do provide an affordable homeownership option for smaller,
moderate income households in Calabasas. For example, a three person moderate
income household can afford a purchase price up to $320,000, and is thus able to afford
the $260,000 median priced two-bedroom condominium. Expanding the supply of
condominiums, combined with downpayment assistance programs and inclusionary
housing requirements, can be an effective way to extend affordable housing
opportunities to households earning moderate incomes.

A vacancy rate of two percent for ownership housing is generally considered healthy. A
low vacancy rate is an indicator of a particularly ‘tight’ housing market, which may lead to
high competition for homes, raising housing prices. According to the 2010 Census, the
homeowner vacancy rate in Calabasas was 1.2 percent, indicating less than ideal
vacancies and a pent-up demand for housing.

C. HOUSING PROBLEMS
A continuing priority of communities is enhancing or maintaining the quality of life for
residents. A key measure of the quality of life in Calabasas is the extent of “housing
problems,” including housing overpayment and overcrowding.
Overpayment
Overpayment remains a critical issue for low and moderate-income households, who are
disproportionately affected by this burden compared to other households. Affordability
problems occur when housing costs become so high in relation to income that
households have to pay an excessive proportion of their income for housing. Housing
overpayment, as defined by the State and Federal government, occurs when a
household spends more than 30 percent of its income on housing; severe overpayment
refers to spending greater than 50 percent of income on housing. Table 14 shows the
incidence of overpayment in Calabasas.

      Note: Severe overpayment is a subset of overpayment.
The 2005-09 American Community Survey identifies 46 percent (2,729) of homeowners
in Calabasas as spending more than 30 percent of their total income on housing, with
nearly one-quarter of homeowners spending more than half their income on housing.
These severely overpaying households are considered at risk of foreclosure.
Among renter households, 64 percent (1,074) were overpaying, a significant increase
from 2000 when 44 percent of Calabasas renter households overpaid. Approximately
one-third of these overpaying renters were lower income, and nearly half were spending
greater than half their incomes on rent (474 households). The high incidence of renter
overpayment represents a significant housing need in Calabasas, and is addressed

(Program #9); Inclusionary Housing (Program #11); and Affordable Housing
Development Assistance (Program #13).
Overcrowding
The State defines an overcrowded housing unit as one occupied by more than 1.01
persons per room (excluding kitchens, porches, and hallways). A unit with more than
1.51 occupants per room is considered severely overcrowded. The incidence of
overcrowded housing is a general measure of whether there is an available supply of
adequately sized housing units.
Table 15 shows the incidence of overcrowding in Calabasas and Los Angeles County as
measured by the 2007-2011 American Community Survey. As indicated, less than one
percent of owner and renter households in Calabasas have been identified as
overcrowded, in sharp contrast to the 6 percent of owners and 18 percent of renters
identified Countywide as living in overcrowded conditions. Less than two percent of
Calabasas households were identified as overcrowded in the 2000 Census, indicating
overcrowding is not a significant housing issue in the community.

 D.       HOUSING ADEQUACY
 The vast majority of housing in Calabasas is in excellent condition. Throughout the
 community, homes are well maintained and evidence continued investment and
 upgrading. Less than one percent of the housing in Calabasas is considered
 overcrowded, 3 compared to 12 percent overcrowding Countywide. The high rate of
 owner-occupied units and relatively high household incomes contribute to the high
 quality of the housing stock in Calabasas.
 The age of a community’s housing stock can also provide an indicator of overall housing
 conditions. Typically housing over 30 years in age is likely to have rehabilitation needs
 that may include new plumbing, roof repairs, foundation work and other repairs. Table
 16 displays the age of Calabasas’ occupied housing stock as of 2011. With 38 percent of
 Calabasas’ housing stock built prior to 1980, over 3,000 units have reached the 30-year
 benchmark. Homes in the City’s older neighborhoods were predominately built in the
 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, and are now approaching the age at which more significant
 improvements become necessary, such as new plumbing or roofing. The aging of such
 a large portion of the Calabasas’ housing stock indicates a need for code enforcement,
 property maintenance and housing rehabilitation programs. While no units have been
 identified as needing replacement, an estimated 20 percent of the pre-1970 housing
 stock (approximately 275 units) may be in need of some level of rehabilitation.

 The City’s Residential Rehabilitation Program provides loan and grant assistance to
 lower income households to make needed repairs, with the majority of households
 taking advantage of this program mobilehome park residents and/or senior citizens. In
 2012, the City initiated an additional program to assist low and moderate income
 property owners of severely dilapidated properties cited for code violations to make
 needed repairs to make the units safe and habitable.

E.      SENIOR HOUSING NEEDS
As illustrated in Table 17, the 2010 Census identifies eleven percent of Calabasas’
population as age 65 and above, with another fourteen percent (“pre-seniors”) turning
this age over the coming decade. Twenty percent of the City’s households are headed
by a senior, with more than 40 percent of these householders over the age of 75. One-
quarter of elderly residents in Calabasas have some type of disability, which may limit
their ability to live independently.

Of Calabasas’ approximately 1,500 senior homeowners, 28 percent live alone. Figure 1
depicts the location of senior homeowners residing alone, and identifies several census
tracts where approximately 10-20 percent of owner-occupied units consist of a single
senior occupant. As these homeowners age, many may be unable to maintain their
homes or perform minor repairs.
Given Calabasas’ growing senior population, the City will continue to experience
increases in the need for senior housing and services. Particularly those seniors age 75
and above begin to require housing with a supportive services component. Rising
apartment and mobilehome park rents, as well as ongoing homeowner maintenance
costs are a particular concern for seniors, as many are on fixed incomes.
Calabasas has several specialized residential facilities for seniors, including:
     Silverado Senior Living is a 110-bed facility for persons with Alzheimer’s Disease
        and related dementias
     Horizons 55 Senior Housing (under construction) will provide 60 luxury
        condominium units for seniors.
     Canyon Creek in Old Town, completed in
        2011, provides 75 apartment units
        affordable to very low and low income
        seniors. The City provided financial support
        to this project through its Affordable Housing
        Fund, and allowed for modified development
        standards.

F.      WORKFORCE HOUSING NEEDS
Calabasas is considered “jobs rich”, with approximately 1.5 jobs for every housing unit.
As presented in the earlier section on Employment (refer to page 4), over 90 percent of
persons employed in primary jobs in Calabasas commute in from outside the City,
indicative of the shortage of local affordable housing opportunities for the community’s
workforce. Recognizing this need, in 1998 the City commissioned a
Commercial/Industrial Development and Affordable Housing Nexus Study, and
subsequently established an affordable housing impact fee on commercial and industrial
development. While somewhat dated, the 1998 study provides valuable insight on the
housing needs generated by the community’s workforce. For example, the study
estimated that 40 percent of recent workers in Calabasas were low-to-moderate income,
and over half these workers commute over 30 miles daily. Furthermore, the study
indicated that 17 percent of recent employees attempted to find housing in Calabasas,
and that less than a quarter of these were successful, citing high housing costs and lack
of residential vacancies as major deterrents.
The limited supply of rentals in Calabasas, combined with escalating rents averaging
$1,900 for a two-bedroom unit, has pushed rental housing out of reach for even
moderate (120% AMI) income occupations. 4 And with for-sale housing prices averaging
around $800,000, homeownership within the City is unattainable for most of Calabasas’
working professionals, including:
                Teachers
                Civic Employees
                Police Officers
                Firefighters
                Engineers
Employers are increasingly recognizing that recruitment and retention of employees is
dependant upon the availability of local affordable housing options. With the majority of
the local workforce commuting long distances, affordable housing opportunities near
jobs are not only needed to assist the City in addressing workforce housing needs, but
also to achieve General Plan goals for reduced vehicle trips and improved air quality.
The Calabasas 2030 General Plan establishes a new mixed use land use category and
designates three areas for transition to mixed use, providing expanded opportunities for
multi-family, workforce housing.

  Based on an income-to-housing cost ratio of 30%, a household needs to earn at least $76,000
per year to afford a monthly rent of $1,900. The 2013 moderate-income (120% AMI) threshold for
Los Angeles County for a single-person household is $54,450 and $62,200 for a two-person
household.

G.       OTHER SPECIAL NEEDS GROUPS
State law recognizes that certain households have more difficulty in finding decent and
affordable housing due to special circumstances including, but not limited to the
following: economic status, age, disability, household size and household type. In
addition to seniors described in the earlier section, other groups with special housing
needs include persons with disabilities, female-headed households, large households
and the homeless.

         Note: Numbers in ( ) reflect the % of the special needs group, and not the % of the total
         City population/households. For example, of the City’s large households, 18% are renters
         and 82% are owners.
Persons with Disabilities
A disability is defined as a long lasting condition (more than six months) that impairs an
individual’s mobility, ability to work, or ability to care for themselves. Persons with
disabilities include those with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities. Disabled
persons have special housing needs because of their fixed income, shortage of
affordable and accessible housing, and higher health costs associated with their
disability.
The 2008-2010 American Community Survey (ACS) identifies 1,257 Calabasas
residents over the age of five as having one or more disabilities, representing six percent
of the City’s population. One-quarter of these residents are unable to live independently.
The ACS documents the presence of following types of disabilities among Calabasas’
disabled residents:
                       • Cognitive – 46%
                       • Ambulatory – 32%
                       • Hearing – 23%
                       • Vision – 11%
Of the City’s senior population, 1/4 suffer from a disability. As Calabasas’ population
continues to age, the number of residents with disabilities will also increase.
Efforts to support the disabled in Calabasas include a Meals-on-Wheels program that
delivers meals to individuals who are temporarily or permanently disabled. The City’s
Dial-a-Ride service also provides transportation around the Calabasas area to seniors
over 55 years and to the disabled. Silverado Senior Living provides housing for 110

seniors with Alzheimer’s and other dementias, and also includes an adult day care
facility with capacity for 30 persons.
The living arrangements for persons with disabilities depends on the severity of the
disability. Many persons live at home in an independent environment with the help of
other family members. To maintain independent living, disabled persons may require
assistance. This can include special housing design features for the physically disabled,
income support for those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services for
persons with medical conditions.
Developmental Disabilities: Due to the dramatic rise in autism spectrum disorders
(ASD), in 2010 the California legislature passed SB 812 which requires the housing
element to specifically analyze the housing needs of persons with developmental
disabilities, and to identify resources available to serve this population.    The State
Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides community-based
services to 6,000 adults diagnosed with ASD; over 4,000 California teenagers diagnosed
with ASD will reach adulthood over the next five years, many of whom will want to live
independently and need appropriate housing.
The North Los Angeles County Regional Center (NLACRC), which serves the San
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope Valleys, is among 21 regional centers operated by
the State DDS to serve the developmentally disabled population. The goal of these
centers is to: 1) prevent/minimize institutionalization of developmentally disabled
persons and their dislocation from family and community; and 2) enable this population
to lead more independent and productive lives.
The NLACRC serves over 18,000 individuals with developmental disabilities and their
families. Within zip code 91302, which encompasses greater Calabasas, the Regional
Center currently provides services to 146 residents with developmental disabilities.
The regional centers have identified a number of community-based housing types
appropriate for persons living with a developmental disability: licensed community care
facilities and group homes; supervised apartment settings with support services; SB 962
homes (for persons with special health care and intensive support needs); and for
persons able to live more independently, rent subsidized homes; inclusionary housing,
and Section 8 rental vouchers.
Calabasas supports the provision of housing for persons with disabilities, and has
adopted provisions in its Zoning Code to enable community care facilities and supportive
housing and ensure reasonable accommodation. Housing Element programs to
facilitate affordable housing - including Inclusionary Zoning, Affordable Housing Fund,
Affordable Housing Development Assistance, and Density Bonus Incentives – can also
assist residents with developmental disabilities.

Female-Headed Family Households
The 2008-2010 American Community Survey identifies 942 female-headed family
households (no husband present) in Calabasas, comprising eleven percent of total
households. Of these female-headed households, over half (55%) have children. Many
of these households need assistance with housing subsidies, as well as accessible and
affordable day care.
The Calabasas Community Services Center offers a variety of youth programs that can
help supplement day care. Children and teens can participate in a variety of fitness
activities and intramural sports leagues, arts and dance classes, after-school programs,
and special camps and excursions. The Agoura Hills/Calabasas Community Center is
also available for use by the City’s young residents. This state-of-the-art recreational
facility offers discounted memberships for students as well as a unique Child Watch
Program that provides daycare for parents using the Community Center’s facilities
Large Households
In Calabasas, large households with five or more members comprise ten percent of the
City’s total households. Of the City’s 814 large households, less than 20 percent (143
households) are renters. The American Community Survey documents 525 rental units
in Calabasas with 3 or more bedrooms, in general, the appropriate size for households
with 5-6 members, indicating a more than adequate supply of units for the City’s large
renter households. In contrast to many communities where large households consist
primarily of lower income ethnic minorities and renters, the majority of Calabasas’ large
households are families who own their own homes and have relatively high incomes.
Homeless
Due to the relative inaccessibility and distance from urban centers, Calabasas does not
attract many transitional homeless individuals or families, and the 2010 Census identifies
no homeless in the City. A small day laborer population exists within the City. These
individuals are often perceived as homeless by residents but are, in fact, typically living
in overcrowded conditions.
Lutheran Social Services in nearby Thousand Oaks provides a number of programs and
services to assist both the temporary and chronic homeless. The agency offers financial
assistance to the homeless for rent, utilities and transportation. They also provide
counseling services in eviction prevention and employment assistance. In addition,
Lutheran Social Services operates a full-time meal and shelter program.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary incomes are earned
through seasonal agricultural work. In many parts of southern California, agriculture
production is an important contribution to local economies. The City of Calabasas has
no agricultural land in active production nor do the adjacent cities of Westlake Village or
Agoura Hills. According to data compiled from the 2005-09 American Community
Survey by SCAG, none of the 10,218 workers in Calabasas are employed in farming
occupations.

H. ASSISTED HOUSING AT RISK OF CONVERSION
State Housing Element law requires an analysis of the potential for currently rent-
restricted low income housing units to convert to market rate housing, and to propose
programs to preserve or replace any units “at-risk” of conversion. This section presents
an analysis of Calabasas’ three assisted rental projects, and evaluates those units at risk
of conversion during the ten year, 2013-2023 planning period.
Calabasas contains two apartment complexes originally financed through the Los
Angeles County Multi-Family Mortgage Revenue Bond Program – the 698 unit Malibu
Canyon apartments and the 600 unit Archstone Calabasas (see Table 19). Under the
County bond program, 20 percent of each project’s units are required to be provided to
low income (80% of County Median Income) households at affordable rents, equating to
a total of 260 income and rent restricted units. City staff have been in contact with the
Los Angeles Community Development Commission (LACDC), the Agency responsible
for monitoring County bond-financed projects, and has learned that the owner of Malibu
Canyon paid off their bonds in December 2008, and that their regulatory agreement and
associated affordability controls expire in June 2016, placing the 140 low income units in
this project at-risk during the planning period. In contrast, LACDC has confirmed that
the regulatory period on Archstone Calabasas is the longer of April 2013 or the date the
bonds are no longer outstanding, which is April 2028, thus not placing this project at-risk
of conversion in the near future.
The third assisted rental project in Calabasas, Canyon Creek Apartments, carries a 55
year period of affordability extending through 2066. Any future affordable rental units
provided through the City’s inclusionary housing ordinance or subsidized through the
Affordable Housing Fund would similarly carry long term affordability controls.

Preservation or replacement of the one at-risk project in Calabasas can potentially be
achieved through: 1) provision of rent subsidies to maintain low-income rents; 2)
replacement or development of new assisted units; or 3) refinance mortgage revenue
bonds. Each of these options are described in the following section.
CITY of CALABASAS                                                   BACKGROUND REPORT
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                   C3-22

Option 1: Rental Assistance
One preservation option is the provision of rent subsidies for the assisted units. The
associated cost of the subsidy would represent the rent differential between market rents
and the maximum affordable housing cost for a low-income household. Comparing the
2012 maximum affordable low-income rents for Los Angeles County (1 bdrm: $1,248, 2
bdrm: $1,405, 3 bdrm: $1,553) with the average market rents in Malibu Canyon
Apartments (based on the project’s Rental Registration rent roll), the average monthly
rent differential is $125 for one-bedroom units and $335 for two-bedroom units.
Applying this rent differential to the project’s total 140 units equates to a monthly rent
subsidy of approximately $36,000, or $432,000 annually, translating to $8.6 million in
subsidies over a 20-year period.
An alternative way to structure rent subsidies is as a rent buy-down. This would involve
providing a one-time assistance loan to the property owner to cover the present value of
the decrease in rents associated with the extended affordability term compared with
market rents achievable on the units. This approach offers a benefit to the owner in that
they receive cash upfront from the loan.
Option 2: Construction or Purchase of Replacement Units
The construction or purchase of a replacement building is another option to replace at-
risk units should they convert to market rates. The cost of developing housing depends
on a variety of factors, including density, size of the units, location, land costs, and type
of construction. Based on discussions with a non-profit housing developer active in
greater southern California, current purchase prices for market rate apartment buildings
range anywhere from $180,000 - $200,000/unit. Therefore, the cost to replace the 140
at-risk units in Calabasas can generally be estimated to range from $46 to $52 million.
Option 3: Refinancing of Mortgage Revenue Bonds
The LACDC and City could negotiate with property owners to refinance the mortgage
revenue bonds and extend affordability controls. The cost to refinance the bonds
includes the difference in interest rates on the remaining debt between the previous and
re-negotiated bonds, an insurance cost, and administrative costs. Project owners may
not have an incentive to refinance unless bond interest rates are well below rates on the
initial bonds and are combined with other incentives.
As Malibu Canyon has already paid off its bond, bond refinancing would only be an
option for Archstone Calabasas.
Conclusion
City staff has been in contact with the Los Angeles Community Development
Commission (CDC), the monitoring agency for the affordable housing program in the
Malibu Canyon apartment community to discuss options for refinancing the project’s
bond to extend affordability controls. The CDC communicated to staff that the owner of
Malibu Canyon redeemed (paid off) the bond in December 2008; therefore, the
regulatory agreement will expire in June 2016. The CDC made it clear that this owner
has no further obligation to continue preservation of their 140 affordable units, and were
unable to offer further suggestions to the City in regards to preservation of those units.

City staff then contacted the California Housing Partnership Corporation (CHPC) seeking
ideas for preservation of the units at risk. Planning staff presented the predicament to
CHPC staff who then took a few weeks to brainstorm ideas that could help the City
accomplish its goal. CHPC responded to the City stating that, after thorough
consideration, they believe the City’s options are quite limited but could offer the
following two suggestions:
      Using monies from our Affordable Housing Fund, the City could purchase
        affordability from the owner of Malibu Canyon Apartments to preserve the
        affordable units, or a portion thereof. The difference between market rents and
        affordable rents at Malibu Canyon Apartments is not very significant, making the
        purchase of affordability a feasible option. The challenge with this option is that
        the City has a limited amount of funds that can be expended on the preservation
        of these units, and given the limited funds, preservation will be short lived. CHPC
        agreed that preservation of these units for a short amount of time may not be the
        best use of our resources (fund monies).
      The City could search for an affordable housing developer interested in buying
        the property, or a portion thereof, and operating it as an affordable housing
        project. The challenge with this option is that this is a 698-unit apartment
        community (the largest in the City), recently upgraded to serve as a resort-style
        facility. Such a property, or even a portion of such a property, is most likely
        financially out-of-reach for most affordable housing developers.

I. FUTURE HOUSING GROWTH NEEDS
The Regional Housing Allocation (RHNA) is a state-mandated process, which
determines the amount of future housing growth each city and county must plan for in
their housing elements. This “fair share” allocation concept seeks to ensure that each
jurisdiction accepts responsibility for the housing needs of not only its resident
population, but also for the jurisdiction’s projected share of regional housing growth
across all income categories. Regional growth needs are defined as the number of units
that would have to be added in each jurisdiction to accommodate the forecasted number
of households, as well as the number of units that need to be added to compensate for
anticipated demolitions and changes to achieve an “ideal” vacancy rate.
The RHNA process begins with the California Department of Housing and Community
Development’s (HCD) projection of future statewide housing growth need, and the
apportionment of this need to regional councils of government throughout the state. As
southern California’s designated Council of Government, the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) is the agency responsible for developing an
allocation methodology to allocate the region’s assigned share of statewide need to
cities and counties by income level. In allocating the region’s future housing needs to
jurisdictions, SCAG is required to take the following factors into consideration:
          Market demand for housing
          Employment opportunities
          Availability of suitable sites and public facilities
          Commuting patterns
          Type and tenure of housing
          Loss of units in assisted housing developments
          Over-concentration of lower income households
          Geological and topographical constraints
SCAG has adopted the RHNA for the 2014-2021 Housing Element cycle, and has
allocated Calabasas the following share of the region’s housing needs, as per Table 20:
                  Table 20: Regional Housing Needs Assessment 2014-2021

       This section assesses the various governmental, market, infrastructure and
       environmental factors that may serve as a potential constraint to housing development
       and improvement in Calabasas.

       The General Plan Land Use Element sets forth the City’s policies for guiding local
       development, and establishes the amount and distribution of land to be allocated for
       different uses within the City. The General Plan land use categories provide for the
       following range of residential land use types in Calabasas.

         Development Code
         The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development
         through the Development Code. Code regulations are designed to protect and promote
         the health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of
         the General Plan. In addition, the Development Code serves to ensure the continued
         quality of development in the community. The Code sets forth residential development
         standards for each zoning district, summarized in Table 22 and evaluated in the
         following section.

Parking requirements are provided in Table 23 by residential uses. Multi-family parking
requirements are fairly typical. To promote bicycle use and less reliance on the
automobile for shorter trips, the City also imposes a minimum bicycle space requirement
on multi-family units. This requirement is rather unique, but not overly burdensome to
development.

  Source: City of Calabasas, Development Code (Chapter 17.28), January 2010.
As part of the 2030 General Plan Update (adopted in December 2008), the City
prepared an update of the existing Calabasas Development Code to provide General
Plan consistency, improve readability, and provide refinement of certain code provisions.
The new Code, adopted in January 2010, includes a new Mixed-Use zone (CMU) to
implement the Mixed-Use General Plan land use district, and accommodates residential
densities of 20 units/acre.            While most areas designated for Mixed-Use are
characterized as underutilized and suitable for redevelopment, two vacant Mixed Use
sites have been identified in the Housing Element sites inventory, including a one-acre
vacant site in Old Town designated Mixed Use 1.0; the MU 1.0 designation on this site
requires residential uses to constitute a minimum of 50% of the project’s floor area (refer
to example site development plan in the Appendix).
The 2030 General Plan also established three distinct multi-family designations at 12, 16
and 20 units/acre, in contrast to the one prior 16 unit/acre multi-family designation. As a
means of establishing appropriate development standards for 20 unit/acre zoning in
Calabasas, the City’s urban design consultant produced a site plan for a multi-family
residential prototype utilizing the City’s RM16 development standards, including height,
setbacks, lot coverage, open space and parking. The outcome of this analysis
demonstrated that the City’s RM16 development standards could yield 20 units/acre.
CITY of CALABASAS                                                            BACKGROUND REPORT

Therefore, with the exception of density (lot area per unit), the City’s new RM20
development standards have been modeled after the current RM16 standards.
Recent approval of an affordable housing density bonus project offers insight into
development standards where flexibility was needed to achieve substantial increases in
density (approximately 75 units/acre). The Old Town Senior Housing project was able to
achieve 75 units on a one acre parcel in the Commercial Old Town District (CT), with the
following modifications to zoning: 35% increase in FAR to 1.35; reduction in parking to
one space per unit; reduction in the pervious surface requirement from 28 to 27%;
modification of the parking ramp slope from 8% to 20%; and reduction in per unit
common outdoor open space from 400 to 285 square feet and private outdoor open
space from 75 to 60 square feet. The project was able to achieve three stories within
the City’s 35 foot height limit, indicating the City’s height standards do not serve as a
constraint. The City will continue to offer modified standards in support of affordable
housing through its density bonus ordinance, described in the following section.
Zoning Provisions for Affordable Housing
Calabasas has adopted numerous provisions in its Development Code that facilitate a
range of residential development types and encourage the production of affordable
housing.
Density Bonus: Zoning Code Section 17.22 sets forth the City’s density bonus
incentives consistent with the most recent changes to State law (SB 1818). In summary,
applicants of residential projects of five or more units may apply for a density bonus and
additional incentive(s) if the project provides for one of the following:
             10% of the total units for lower income households; or
             5% of the total units for very low income households; or
             100% of units for senior citizens of any income level; or
             10% of the total dwelling units in a condominium for moderate income
                households.
The amount of density bonus varies according to the amount by which the percentage of
affordable housing units exceeds the established minimum percentage, but generally
ranges from 20-35% above the specified General Plan density. Table 24 summarizes
the amount of density bonus granted for different affordable housing types.
In addition to the density bonus, eligible projects may receive 1-3 additional development
incentives, depending on the proportion of affordable units and level of income targeting.
The City offers the following development incentives in conjunction with the density
bonus:
             A reduction in parcel development standards (coverage, setback, zero lot
                line and/or reduced parcel sizes).
             Approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with a housing project.
             Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or
                the City that would result in identifiable cost reductions.
Pursuant to State requirements and at the request of the developer, the City will also
permit a reduced parking ratio for density bonus projects. To the extent the density

Projects which comply with Calabasas’ inclusionary housing ordinance (and meet the
requirements of Code Sections 17.22.020(A) and 17.22.020(B)) are eligible for density
bonuses and incentives.
Inclusionary Housing: The City has established an inclusionary housing program
which requires new developments of five or more units to provide between 5 and 20
percent of the total number of units in a project at affordable rent/sales levels. Instead of
requiring a fixed percentage of all units to be allocated for affordable housing, the City’s
program allows for a varying range of affordable units depending on the targeted income
level:
     20% of units for households with incomes up to 110% of AMI
     15% of units for households with incomes up to 90% of AMI
     10% units for households with incomes up to 75% of AMI
     5% of units for households with incomes up to 50% of AMI
To meet the inclusionary requirements, developers have the option of:
     constructing the new affordable units on or off-site
     converting market rate housing to affordable housing through a “buy down”
        mechanism and restrictive covenants
     rehabilitating structures that currently do not comply with Uniform Building Code
        and/or Uniform Housing Code standards
     extending the lifetime of an existing restrictive covenant on affordable units that
        are “at risk” of conversion to market rate housing within 5 years
     pay an in-lieu fee that will be deposited into a designated fund to be used for the
        preservation and development of affordable housing
Prior to updating the inclusionary in-lieu fees in 2006, all residential development subject
to the City’s inclusionary housing ordinance had opted, and was permitted to pay the in-

lieu housing fee. In 2006, the City conducted a nexus study and adopted the following
updated in-lieu fees to more closely reflect the current affordability gap: $17,713 per
apartment unit, $44,947 per condominium/townhome unit, and $62,500 per single-family
home. According to City staff, the higher in-lieu fee has for the first time resulted in
developers providing the affordable units within their projects, including Paxton
Calabasas (formerly Entrada at Malibu Canyon) that will provide four very low income
rental units, and the Village at Calabasas (Calabasas Inn) that will provide eight very low
income units. Developers providing on-site inclusionary units also qualify for a State
density bonus of between 20-35 percent, along with 1 to 3 additional development
incentives. City staff work closely with development applicants to evaluate alternative
options for fulfillment of inclusionary requirements. Because of the City’s flexibility in
implementing its inclusionary ordinance, the City’s inclusionary provisions have not
served as a constraint to development.
Commercial Impact Fee: To mitigate the impact of new commercial development on
the need for affordable housing, the City has also established an employment-housing
linkage program. Under this program, the City requires new commercial developments to
provide housing that is affordable to employees within the project site or to pay an in-lieu
impact fee.
Impact fees are based on projected employment growth in Calabasas and the
associated employee-generated demand for affordable units. Current fee amounts are
$1.80 per square foot for retail and commercial developments and $3.00 per square foot
for office and research/development (R&D) uses. The impact fees collected are placed
in the Affordable Housing Fund to be used for affordable housing activities.
Condominium Conversions: As a means of maintaining the supply of rental units and
preserving the affordable housing stock, the City requires the approval of a tentative
map, and parcel or final map prior to any condominium conversion. The City also
mandates a Relocation Assistance Program that will assist displaced tenants in finding
equivalent or better housing. Under the Calabasas General Plan, the City will not
approve any condominium conversion when the vacancy rate within the City for
multifamily housing is less than four percent.
While the City has not received any condominium conversion requests, it may be
appropriate to strengthen the City’s current Ordinance to preserve the existing rental
housing stock and require affordable units in any future projects approved for
conversion.     Similar to many jurisdictions with inclusionary housing ordinances,
Calabasas may want to extend its inclusionary housing requirements to condominium
conversions to provide affordable homeownership opportunities.

2.        Provision for a Variety of Housing Types
Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites to be made
available through appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the
development of various types of housing for all economic segments of the population,
including multi-family rental housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, emergency
shelters, and transitional housing. Table 25 summarizes the housing types permitted in
Calabasas’ zone districts.

 Similar to hotels, SROs are also permitted in the CO and CB zones, subject to a CUP.
Multi-Family Rental Housing
Multi-family dwelling units make up one-fifth of the housing stock in Calabasas. The
majority of these units are in two large apartment communities: the 698-unit Malibu
Canyon and the 600-unit Archstone Calabasas. The updated Calabasas Development
Code now allows for multi-family housing in the RM (Multi-Family Residential) zone as a
permitted use, eliminating the prior Conditional Use Permit (CUP) requirement. The City
allows for densities of 2-16 units per acre in the RM zone, with additional densities
achievable through density bonuses. In addition, the following commercial zones
conditionally permit multi-family housing: CR (Retail Commercial); CT (Old Town

Commercial) and CMU (Mixed Use Commercial). Senior housing is permitted in two of
the City’s commercial zoning districts with a CUP. The City’s two recently approved
senior housing projects were both developed in commercial districts.
A major focus of the City’s 2010 Development Code was to establish clear, well-defined
development standards, allowing for a greater range of uses “by right” without the
requirement for a CUP. For example, multi-family development no longer requires a
CUP in the RM or PD districts. Elimination of the CUP will serve to facilitate development
by providing greater certainty to developers.
Manufactured Housing/ Mobile Homes and Mobilehome Parks
The City’s Development Code considers mobile homes for permanent occupancy
(defined as manufactured housing by the National Manufactured Housing Construction
and Safety Standards Act of 1974) the same as single-family dwellings, and permits
mobile homes (Section 17.12.020) in all zoning districts that allow single-family housing.
Mobile homes are required to be placed on a foundation system in compliance with
Section 18551 of the Health and Safety Code, and are required to be designed and
constructed with roof eave and gable overhangs of not less than one foot.
Calabasas’ prior Development Code permitted mobile home park subdivisions within the
RM zone, subject to a Conditional Use Permit. As part of the 2030 General Plan Update,
the City identified preservation of its existing mobile home park as a high priority, and
developed a separate RMH mobile home park General Plan land use designation and
zoning district to aid in maintaining the park in long-term mobile home park use.
Second Units
Second units are attached or detached dwelling units which provide complete,
independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent provisions for
living, sleeping, cooking and sanitation, located on the same lot as the primary structure.
Calabasas permits, secondary housing units by right on properties with RS, RR, HM and
OS zoning, subject to the standards for such units specified in Section 17.32.180 of the
Development Code.
AB 1866 (effective 2003) which requires local governments to use a ministerial process
for second unit applications, allows cities to impose development standards on second
units addressing issues such as building size, parking, height, setbacks, and lot
coverage. The following summarizes Calabasas’ second unit standards:
      The design of the second unit must conform, in general, to the design of the
         primary dwelling.
      Lot area shall not be less than 10,000 sq.ft.
      The maximum size of the unit is 700 square feet, not including garage.
      Detached second units must be located on the rear half of the lot.
      Second units must have a side setback of at least 5 feet, and 12 feet total, a rear
         setback of at least 10 feet, and an interior setback of at least 10 feet from the
         primary dwelling unit.
      Second units have a height limit of one story and 15 feet maximum.
      Each second unit requires one parking space.
      Site coverage for detached rear yard unit may not exceed maximum 30% of the
         yard.
CITY of CALABASAS                                                    BACKGROUND REPORT
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                    C3-33

Calabasas amended its second unit ordinance in January 2010 as part of the City’s
Development Code update. Consistent with State requirements, the City codified its
practice of ministerial review, and in addition eliminated the prior requirement for parking
to be provided within a garage or carport. Second units were removed as a permitted
use within the RC zone due to grossly undersized lots (frequently less than 6,000 sq.ft.)
and lack of sanitary sewer for many lots, but were added as permitted within the HM and
OS zoning districts.
Calabasas has had only limited second unit applications, with just three during the 2008-
2012 period. Particularly in light of its aging population, the city is interested in facilitating
the provision of second units as a means of allowing seniors to remain in their homes. In
the City’s Senior Housing Needs Survey conducted in conjunction with the Housing
Element, approximately one-quarter of non-renter respondents indicated an interest in
having a second unit either for a caregiver, family member or to generate rental income.
Given this level of interest, the Housing Element includes a program to evaluate and
amend the City’s current second unit standards to provide greater flexibility, such as an
increased unit size subject to a CUP, to encourage the provision of both attached and
detached second units.
Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act
impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable accommodations
(i.e. modifications or exceptions) in their zoning and other land use regulations when
such accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal
opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. Furthermore, pursuant to SB 520, State
housing element statutes now require jurisdictions to evaluate constraints upon the
development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities,
and demonstrate local efforts to remove such governmental constraints. Housing for
persons with disabilities encompasses a wide range of housing types, including:
physically accessible housing for persons with mobility impairments; residential care
facilities for persons with disabilities or the elderly; group homes; housing for persons
with Alzheimer’s and HIV/AIDS; housing with support services; and transitional housing
that serves homeless with disabilities.
The City’s provisions for housing for persons with disabilities includes:
      The Development Code permits residential care facilities 5 (for six or fewer
         residents) in the RS, RM, RMH, RR, RC, OS and HM zoning districts.
      Residential care facilities for seven or more residents are conditionally permitted
         in the RM, CMU and CT districts. The CUP establishes conditions to ensure
         compatibility of the use within the neighborhood context, and does not regulate
         the user or establish undue conditions that serve as a constraint.
      Assisted living and congregate care facilities are permitted with a CUP in the RM
         zone, as well as in most commercial zoning districts.
5
  Residential care homes are defined as facilities providing residential social and personal care
for children, the elderly, and persons with some limits on their ability for self-care, but where
medical care is not a major element. Includes children’s homes, halfway houses, rehabilitation
centers, group homes and hospices.

      Extended care and convalescent care facilities providing nursing and health-
        related care (such as skilled nursing facilities, extended care facilities,
        convalescent and rest homes, board and care homes) are conditionally permitted
        in all commercial zones, with the exception of the Old Town Commercial (CT)
        zone.
      The City does not impose any spacing requirements between residential care
        facilities or other special needs housing. The City has not adopted any
        occupancy standards that apply to unrelated adults or families.
      The Community Development Director maintains the authority, without a public
        hearing, to grant setback and other minor modifications to the Zoning Code to
        provide reasonable accommodation to persons with disabilities. For example,
        handicapped ramps or guardrails (up to 30” in height) are permitted to intrude
        into the standard setbacks required under zoning to allow first floor access for
        physically disabled residents.
      The City provides housing rehabilitation funds to income-qualified households for
        accessibility improvements.
The City adopted Development Code Chapter 17.38, Reasonable Accommodation
consistent with federal and state laws regarding providing reasonable accommodations.
The Ordinance creates a procedure for an individual with a disability to request a
reasonable accommodation from land use or zoning regulations, policies, and practices
to provide that individual with an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. A
decision on whether to grant a reasonable accommodation is made by the Director of
Community Development. If the request for an accommodation is related to another
discretionary permit, then the request is processed with the project as a whole. However,
no special permit is required for the granting of a reasonable accommodation and no fee
is required to apply.
Calabasas has conducted a review of zoning, permit processing and building code
requirements, and has not identified any barriers to the provision of accessible housing.
Supportive Housing, Transitional Housing and Emergency Shelters
Supportive housing is permanent, affordable housing with on-site services that help
residents transition into stable, more productive lives. Services may include childcare,
after-school tutoring, career counseling, etc. Supportive housing can come in many
different configurations, ranging from a small, service-intensive group home, to a multi-
family development where tenants with disabilities live alongside other ambulatory
tenants.
Transitional housing is a type of supportive housing used to help transition formerly
homeless individuals and families into permanent housing. Transitional housing is
temporary (often six months to two years) while tenants receive supportive services and
training to enable independent living. This housing can take several forms, including
group housing or multi-family units.
California Health and Safety Code (Section 50801) defines an emergency shelter as
“housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is limited to
occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or household may
be denied emergency shelter because of an inability to pay.”
CITY of CALABASAS                                                   BACKGROUND REPORT
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                   C3-35

There are currently no supportive housing, transitional housing or emergency shelters
within Calabasas, primarily because there are very few, if any, homeless in the City.
Pursuant to recent changes in State law (SB 2), jurisdictions are now required to treat
supportive and transitional housing the same as a residential use within their zoning
codes.      As part of the Development Code update, Calabasas added definitions of
supportive and transitional housing to the Code, and identify these housing types as
permitted uses within the R-SF and R-MF zone districts.
SB 2 also requires jurisdictions with an unmet need for emergency shelters to identify a
zone(s) where emergency shelters will be allowed as a permitted use without a
conditional use permit or other discretionary permit. The identified zone must have
sufficient capacity to accommodate the shelter need, and at a minimum provide capacity
for at least one year-round shelter.
As discussed previously in the homeless section of the Needs Assessment, the 2010
Census identifies no homeless in Calabasas. Nonetheless, homeless do on occasion
pass through the City, and there remains an unmet need for a shelter in the area.
Pursuant to SB 2, Calabasas conducted a review of its zoning districts and determined
the Business Limited Intensity land use district (Commercial Limited CL zoning) most
conducive for location of an emergency homeless shelter. The City’s Land Use Element
designates West Calabasas Road as Business Limited Intensity, and the current land
use survey identifies approximately 24 vacant acres. While much of this acreage is hilly,
staff has identified flat, buildable pads on several parcels, totaling approximately 12
acres. Parcels along Calabasas Road are accessible to transit, both from the City’s free
Shuttle Bus with routes throughout the City, and from the MTA busline that connects
Calabasas with the rest of the San Fernando Valley and Thousand Oaks to the west.
Services within a one mile radius include a Ralph’s grocery store, a gas station, the Civic
Center and library, and access to the Ventura Freeway.
The 2010 Development Code modified the Zoning Ordinance to permit shelters in the CL
zone subject to the same development and management standards as other permitted
uses in the zone. The City’s CL development standards are appropriate to facilitate
emergency shelters, and can be summarized as follows:
         Minimum lot size: 5,000 sq ft
         Minimum lot width: 50 ft
         Floor Area Ratio: 0.2
         Site coverage: maximum 72% of net site area
         Building height: 35 ft
         Front and rear yard setback: 20 ft
         Side yard setback: none, or 20 ft if adjacent residential zone
         Rear Yard Setback: none; 20’ if adjacent to residential zone
In addition to application of CL development standards, as permitted under SB 2, the
City has adopted the following standards to regulate emergency shelters to enhance
compatibility:
         Maximum number of occupants is 20;
         A minimum distance of 1,000 feet shall be maintained between shelters
         Maximum stay at the facility shall not exceed 180 consecutive days
         One off-street parking space shall be provided for every 250 square feet

          An interior waiting are shall be provided which contains a minimum of 200
           square feet
          Exterior lighting shall be provided for the entire outdoor area;
          Security personnel shall be provided during the hours the shelter is in
           operation
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) residences are small, one room units (generally 80-250
sq. ft.) occupied by a single individual, and may either have shared or private kitchen
and bathroom facilities. SROs are rented on a monthly basis, typically without rental
deposit, and can provide an entry point into the housing market for extremely low income
individuals, formerly homeless and disabled persons. Calabasas classifies SRO uses
the same as hotels and motels. SROs typically have individual bathrooms and thus
similar to hotels, are permitted in the CR, CMU, CMU and CO zone districts, subject to a
conditional use permit (refer to Table 25).

As a means of assessing the cost that City fees contribute to the cost of development in
Calabasas, the City has calculated the total Planning, Building, Public Works, and
Impact Fees associated with development of a hypothetical 60-unit condominium
project. 6 As indicated in Table 27, City development fees run approximately $14,500 per
unit, exclusive of School District, Water District and County Public Works fees, and
assuming on-site provision of required inclusionary housing units. The most significant
fee is that associated with parkland dedication, which pursuant to the Quimby Act, is
based on a standard of 3 acres of parkland per 1,000 population and derived from the
number of project units multiplied by the average household size. However, Quimby
Fees apply only to subdivision of land, resulting in lower overall fees for development of
apartment projects.

CITY of CALABASAS                                                         BACKGROUND REPORT

In comparison with the median two bedroom condominium sales price of $260,000
documented in Table 12, development fees constitute less than six percent of the unit
sales price. In summary, Calabasas’ planning and development fees do not serve as a
constraint to the production housing. Furthermore, as an incentive for the provision of
on-site affordable housing units, the City has updated its inclusionary in-lieu fees to
reflect full cost recovery, and offers fee reductions as an incentive through the density
bonus ordinance. And pursuant to AB 641, the City allows developers of affordable
housing projects with a minimum of 49 percent very low and low income units to defer
payment of development fees until issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
4.       Processing and Permit Procedures
Before development can occur, it is necessary to obtain certain permits and approvals.
These procedures, although necessary to ensure that the development is safe and in
compliance with local regulations and building code requirements, can sometimes lead
to delays in projects and subsequently increase costs. Moreover, excessive processing
time may act as a constraint on the production of affordable housing, because it
increases carrying costs to the developer for land, financing, and so forth.
Being a relatively new city and recognizing the complexity of the development process,
the City offers easy-to-read brochures to help developers and homeowners better
understand planning and development procedures in Calabasas. The City is also
committed to an efficient review process. In particular, the City offers expedited CEQA
(California Environmental Quality Act) review for residential developments with units
affordable to lower and moderate-income households.
The following describes the different levels of decision-making bodies in Calabasas, and
the responsibilities of each:
       The Development Review Committee (DRC) consists of a representative
           from relevant City Departments (Community Development, Public Works, etc)
           and other agencies involved with the physical development of the City. The
           DRC was created to review development/improvement proposals, provide
           applicants with design comments, and make recommendations to the
           Community Development Director and/or Planning Commission, as provided
           by the Development Code. The DRC serves as a recommending body on
           conditional use permits, variances, tentative maps, and planned developments.
       The City’s Architectural Review Panel (ARP) reviews projects for their
           aesthetic quality. The ARP makes advisory recommendations to the Planning
           Commission and the City Council in matters pertaining to site plan reviews, and
           evaluating the architectural designs of buildings, landscape plans and other
           site features. The ARP is made up of three members and two alternate
           members appointed by the Planning Commission, with at least one member
           required to be a licensed architect. The ARP reviews commercial and
           residential projects within scenic corridors, the Old Topanga/Highlands Overlay
           Areas, proposed subdivisions, hillside developments, and other projects as
           requested by the Community Development Director or Planning Commission.
       The Community Development Director has decision-making authority on
           administrative plan reviews, minor use permits, sign permits, minor scenic
           corridor permits, temporary use permits           and zoning clearances. For

          subdivisions, the Director has authority over lot line adjustments, lot mergers,
          conditional certificates, and certificates of compliance, and provides
          recommendations on tentative maps.
        For projects that require a conditional use permit, site plan review, scenic
          corridor permit, tentative map or variance, the Planning Commission serves
          as the decision-making body. Property owners within 500 feet of the proposed
          project are notified. A public hearing is scheduled at least 10 days and not
          more than 60 days after acceptance of the fully completed application.
The typical review process for a multi-family development application in Calabasas can
be described as follows. As a means of saving time and costs, applicants are
encouraged to request a pre-application conference with staff prior to completion of
project design. The purpose of this conference is to inform the applicant of relevant
Development Code requirements, explore possible modifications to the project, and to
identify any technical studies that may be necessary for the environmental review
process. The pre-application conference is conducted with the Development Review
Committee, providing the applicant with early input from all relevant departments and
external entities. The cost for the pre-application conference is currently $988, and is
credited towards future application costs.
Upon submittal of the formal development application, City staff conducts a
completeness review, and informs the applicant in writing within 30 days of any missing
information. Corrections and/or additions are made to the project application and
supporting documents, and resubmitted to staff. Review includes distribution of the
project to members of the Development Review Committee. If the DRC doesn’t have
any questions, staff maintains responsibility for review. To the extent members of the
DRC do have questions or concerns with the application, a DRC meeting is scheduled
with the applicant within 30 days. Once the application is revised and resubmitted to
address identified issues, if the project is within a scenic corridor, is a subdivision or
hillside development, requires Planning Commission approval and/or falls within the Old
Topanga/Highlands Overlay Areas, it is forwarded on to the Architectural Review Panel
for review of project aesthetics.
Upon completion of project review by the Development Review Committee, and as
necessary, the Architectural Review Panel, a staff report is prepared summarizing the
conclusions of the Department and each reviewing body. The staff report includes
recommendations on the approval, approval with conditions, or disapproval of the
application, and is provided to the applicant. In total, the average processing time for
multi-family development in Calabasas ranges from six to twelve months. For example,
the 60 unit Malibu Hills Road condominium project received project approval within five
months of submittal of a complete application, whereas the 75 unit Old Town senior
apartments required 13 months for project approval.
Average processing times in Calabasas to obtain a permit to construct a new single-
family residence on a legal lot is two to three months. Most remaining single-family
parcels are either within scenic corridors or are hillside parcels, and would therefore fall
within the parameters of the Architectural Review Panel and would require, at a
minimum, a public hearing with the Community Development Director, thereby adding to
the processing times.

New Technologies
In 2005, the City of Calabasas contracted with Digital Map Products to provide a web
based mapping system called CityGIS. CityGIS allows staff to view a variety of data
including: aerial photography, parcels, zoning, streets and other types of data. The
system also gives City staff the ability to draw graphics, measure distances and areas,
search parcels and addresses, and create list and labels for notification purposes. So
far, the CityGIS program has received a favorable response from City staff. CityGIS also
includes a Community View component, which gives the public access to the City of
Calabasas website for the purposes of viewing and searching for data.
The City’s Community Development Department adopted a new permit tracking system,
CLaMS (the Calabasas Land Management System), in January 2008. CLaMS is a
centralized, web-based land management system that links the City’s Building and
Safety, Planning, Code Enforcement, and Public Works Departments into one unified
system that can efficiently manage the various tasks of the different departments.
Activities such as permit issuance, inspections, and citizen inquiries are accessible to
City staff through CLaMS. The system also allows residents to request inspections, find
the status of their project, and achieve other simple tasks on-line. CLaMS is expected to
dramatically increase the efficiency of the development review and permitting process
and lessen internal administrative costs.
5.       Site Improvements
Residential developers are required to provide and/or fund infrastructure to serve their
projects. Developers are also required to provide all infrastructure necessary for utility
connections to the project, including water, electric and sewer, as well as funding their
portion of any off-site system expansions or upgrades that are necessary to serve the
project. The cost of off-site improvements varies depending on the nature of
development (i.e., hillside or flatland development).
Developers of projects that will include streets are required to install the streets, curbs,
gutters, sidewalks, utility systems and landscaping; these facilities are typically
dedicated to the City. Subdivisions are designed to provide rights-of-way for pedestrian
paths, bikeways and multiple use trails as identified in the General Plan Circulation
Element. Calabasas’ residential street standards are based upon the County of Los
Angeles Subdivision Ordinance, and include the following street right-of-way widths:
         Cul-de-sacs (up to 700 ft.)           58 ft.
         Cul-de-sacs (> 700 ft)                60 ft.
         Local streets (up to 1,400 ft)        58 ft
         Local streets (> 1,400 ft)            60 ft.
         Collector streets                     64 ft.
Since Calabasas is a built-out community, most residential projects are small infill
developments and not of a size that warrant a circulation system other than private
driveways. Most future development will necessitate few site improvement requirements,
and thus not add significant costs to development.

6.      Building Code
State law requires that all jurisdictions in California enforce the building codes as
mandated by the California Building Standards Commission. The State building codes
establish construction standards necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare,
and the local enforcement of these codes does not unnecessarily constrain the
development of housing. The City of Calabasas has adopted by ordinance the following
model codes, along with all required updates:
    •   California Residential Code (2010)
    •   California Building Code (2010)
    •   California Mechanical Code (2010)
    •   California Plumbing Code (2010)
    •   California Electrical Code (2010)
    •   County of Los Angeles Fire Code (2008)
    •   California Energy Code (2010)
    •   California Green Building Standards Code (2010)
In terms of the local enforcement of the Building code, while staff monitors housing
conditions, code enforcement in Calabasas is primarily complaint based. And as
described under Housing Element Program #2, the City has initiated a new Home Repair
Program to assist low and moderate income property owners of dilapidated units cited
for code violations to make needed repairs to make the units safe and habitable.

B.        MARKET CONSTRAINTS
Various factors not under the control of government also affect the cost, supply and
distribution of housing. These factors include: land cost, construction costs, financing
costs, speculation, availability of infrastructure, and physical constraints.
1.       Development Costs
A key component of the total cost of housing is the price of raw land and any necessary
improvements. The diminished supply of land available for residential construction
combined with a fairly high demand for such development has served to keep the cost of
land relatively high in cities across Southern California. In Calabasas, residential land
costs averaged approximately $69 per square foot in 2009, reflecting the scarcity of land
suitable for housing development. 7 The availability and price of land are potential
constraints to the development of housing for all income levels.
Site improvements also contribute to the cost of land. Most remaining vacant single-
family parcels in Calabasas have severe topographic constraints and necessitate
significant grading to accommodate development. Infill parcels identified by the 2030
General Plan Update for multi-family and mixed-use development for the most part don’t
face the same topographic constraints, and are thus less costly to develop than the
hillside areas.
In addition to land and site development costs, construction cost is the other major
component contributing to the cost of housing. A major cost associated with the
development of housing is the cost of building materials, which have risen dramatically in
recent years. According to the U.S. Department of Labor Construction Cost Trends for
2013,the overall cost of construction materials rose from approximately $178 to $205 per
square foot between 2006-2012, reflecting a 15 percent increase in materials costs. The
increase in construction costs is slowing, but was up 2-2.5% in the first half of 2012, with
labor cost increases above that of materials (2.5% labor compared to 1.5% material cost
increases). 8
As part of the City’s density bonus program, the City may allow affordable units to be
slightly smaller in size (maintaining the same number of bedrooms) and have different
interior finishes than market rate units, provided all project units are comparable in
construction quality and exterior design. Another factor that can reduce construction
costs is the economies of scale realized with a greater number of units built at one time;
this is of particular benefit when density bonuses are used for the provision of affordable
housing.

2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                     C3-44

     2.       Availability of Mortgage and Rehabilitation Financing
     The availability of financing in a community depends on a number of factors, including
     the type of lending institutions active in the community, lending practices, rates and fees
     charged, laws and regulations governing financial institutions, and equal access to those
     institutions. Through analysis of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data on the
     disposition of residential loan applications, an assessment can be made of the
     availability of residential financing within a community.
     As shown in Table 28 (Status of Home Purchase Loans and Home Improvement Loans
     in Calabasas and Los Angeles County, 2011), mortgage financing and improvement
     financing is generally available to homebuyers in Calabasas and is not considered a
     constraint. The annual HMDA report for 2011 indicates that 924 home purchase loan
     applications and 167 home improvement applications were submitted for homes in
     Calabasas, with 71 percent of home purchase and 63 percent of home improvement
     loans approved by the lenders. In comparison with Los Angeles County, mortgage loan
     denial rates were fairly comparable at 13 percent, versus 15 percent countywide. For
     home improvement loans, loan denial rates of 14 percent in Calabasas were well below
     the Countywide average of 28 percent. Review of mortgage loan denial rates by
     Calabasas’ census tracts does not identify any tract with denial rates ten points or above
     the 13 percent citywide average.

C.      ENVIRONMENTAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
1.       Environmental Constraints
Hillside and Ridgeline Areas
Many areas in Calabasas consist of slopes where the topography acts as a limitation to
various types of development. The slopes and hills present moderate limitations, such as
excavation and grading. Steeper slopes present severe limitations, requiring extensive
excavation and possibly some blasting during construction. In addition, these areas are
limited due to access and utilities needed to support growth.
The City established Hillside and Ridgeline development standards to protect the public
health and safety with regard to fire hazards and slope stability and to ensure that
buildings are located in the most accessible, least visually prominent, and most
geologically stable portions of the hillside or ridgeline. These standards apply to
proposed developments on sites with a natural slope greater than ten percent, or that
include a ridgeline. The City requires buildings to be sited where they will be screened
by existing vegetation, rock outcroppings, or depressions in topography. In wooded
areas, dispersed buildings are preferred because they save trees and minimize visual
impacts. The City also requires structures placed on or near ridgelines to be situated so
that they do not appear silhouetted against the sky when viewed from any roadways
designated as a scenic corridor. Ridgeline buildings are to be located in a way that
maintains the natural appearance of the ridge. Hillside and ridgeline developments are
required to provide two off-street parking spaces for guests in addition to the parking
normally required for a residence.
Consistent with Calabasas’ commitment to foster environmentally responsible
development, the City’s 2030 General Plan Safety Element establishes the following
policy:
        Policy VII-4 Discourage development within potential landslide areas with
        severe soil limitations as the City’s preferred management strategy, and a higher
        priority than attempting to implement engineering solutions.
Significant Ecological Areas
Other constraints to development include Los Angeles County Significant Ecological
Areas (SEAs) within the City and surrounding areas. SEAs, as identified by the County
of Los Angeles Technical Advisory Committee, contain unique or unusual plant and/or
species assemblages, or areas or habitat that are rapidly declining in the Los Angeles
area. Usually, these Los Angeles County SEAs may not be feasibly developed, or may
require extensive mitigation to ensure that these plant and animal species are
preserved. Currently, there are three Los Angeles County SEAs in and around
Calabasas (Los Angeles County SEA Nos. 5, 9, and 12). For additional information, see
section V-D (Biological Resources), of the Community Issues Report.
CITY of CALABASAS                                                   BACKGROUND REPORT
2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                    C3-46

Earthquakes
The City’s geology and close proximity to the Malibu Coast fault and the Simi fault, as
well as other active regional faults, such as the San Andreas fault, may pose some
concern to development. These faults could produce strong earthquakes which would
generate substantial earthshaking, and trigger landslides, mud, and debris flow during a
period of heavy rain.
Floodplains
The City principally falls into an area of minimum flooding, as defined by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. However, areas found along canyon bottoms along
the alignments of the primary drainage courses are designated within 100-year flood
potential zones. These canyon areas would have severe limitations on development.
However, to protect existing development in these areas, the City participates in the
Federal Flood Insurance Program.
The City of Calabasas requires a development permit for any structure being built within
a designated special flood hazard area. The Calabasas Municipal Code calls for all new
buildings in the flood hazard area to be constructed with materials resistant to flood
damage. New construction is required to be adequately anchored in order to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. Equipment and other service
facilities must also be designed to prevent water from entering or accumulating within its
components during a flood.
Expansive Soils and Liquefaction
Soils with a high clay content found in portions of the City may present limitations to
urban development due to their shrink-swell potential. Areas with expansive soils can
cause problems such as damage to building foundations if not properly mitigated prior
to construction. However, the City requires geologic studies prior to development to
evaluate the potential for geologic and soil hazards, and requires these conditions to be
corrected during construction. Typical measures to treat expansive soils involve
removal, proper fill selection, and compaction. The Calabasas 2030 General Plan EIR
concludes that expansion should not be a significant constraint to development of
individual sites provided that adequate soil and foundation studies are performed prior to
construction.
As identified in the General Plan Safety Element, potential liquefaction hazard zones are
located in portions of Calabasas. In particular, areas in the western portion of the City in
the vicinity of Las Virgenes Creek may be subject to seismically induced liquefaction.
Prior to approval of development projects within liquefaction or landslide hazard zones,
site specific engineering studies will be required to analyze the feasibility or most
appropriate design and construction techniques to mitigate potential problems. The
General Plan EIR concludes that liquefaction impacts are less than significant with
implementation of the Calabasas Building Code and policies contained in the Safety
Element.

2014-2021 HOUSING ELEMENT                  C3-47

2.        Infrastructure Constraints
Another factor adding to the cost of new construction is the cost of providing adequate
infrastructure, major and local streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, water and sewer lines,
street lighting, which is required to be built or installed in new development. In most
cases, these improvements are dedicated to the City, which is then responsible for their
maintenance. The cost of these facilities is borne by developers, adding to the cost of
new housing units, and eventually passed on to the homebuyer or property owner.
The Las Virgenes Municipal Water district (LVMWD) provides both water and
wastewater service in Calabasas. As part of the 2030 General Plan update, the City
worked with LVMWD to ensure coordination of the updated Land Use Plan with the
district’s water and sewer facilities master plans. The General Plan directs new
development to areas with adequate water and sewer facilities, or where facilities are
planned consistent with the LVMWD’s master plan. LVMWD indicates projected water
supply is adequate to serve the expected demand from incremental new development.

   IV. REVIEW OF PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS
State Housing Element law requires communities to assess the achievements under
their adopted housing programs as part of the update of the Housing Element. The
2008 Calabasas Housing Element contains a set of goals, policies and programs for the
six-year time frame of the housing element (2008-2014). The following section reviews
the programs of the 2008 Housing Element, including progress on the implementation of
programs, and the continued appropriateness of policies and programs for the updated
Housing Element. The results of this analysis will help to shape the comprehensive
housing program strategy developed for the 2014-2021 Housing Element.
1. Single-family Rehabilitation Program
Six-Year Program Objective: Assist 10 households annually. Evaluate extending to
moderate income households using Affordable Housing Fund resources.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: Between 2008-
        2012, the City processed a total of 25 Residential Rehabilitation grants.
        Currently, there is a waiting list of approximately 25 qualified applicants, with an
        average of 9 households assisted annually. Discussions with the Program
        Administrator indicate a great demand for the Program, but because CDBG
        funding has been reduced significantly in recent years, the City has not been
        able to fulfill the demand. In addition, Affordable Housing Fund resources have
        been directed towards affordable production rather than rehabilitation of existing
        housing. Given the strong demand for the Program and assuming continued
        funding via CDBG, the Residential Rehabilitation Program remains appropriate to
        the updated Housing Element.
2. Rental Assistance Program
Six-Year Program Objective:            Provide ongoing assistance to 40 households,
contingent on funding.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: In 2008, the City
        continued to provide monthly rent subsidies to 40 households. In 2009, the City
        Council expanded the Program from 40 to 45 households. In December 2010,
        the City Council made permanent the Rental Assistance Program; increased the
        monthly subsidy by $50 per month, plus a yearly CPI increase; and expanded the
        Program from 45 to 50 households. Since 2010, the City has been providing the
        rent subsidy to 50 households. The Program will continue as such in the updated
        Housing Element.

3. Rental Registration Program
Six-Year Program Objective: Continue to maintain the rental database.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness:                   Annual rent
        information provided by apartment owners is entered into the City's rental
        database in July of every year, and reported to the City Council. Staff will
        continue this program, unless otherwise directed by City Council.
4. Mobile Home Park Preservation
Six-Year Program Objective: Adopt permanent mobile home park zoning. Should
tenants of the Park indicate interest in purchasing the park as a means maintaining
control over space rent increases, provide information on MPROP funding.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: The permanent
        mobile home park zoning district was adopted in January 2010 as part of the
        City's Development Code update.          To date, the Park’s tenants have not
        expressed to the City a collective desire to purchase the Park property; if tenants
        indicate interest in the future, the City will play an information sharing and
        facilitator role between the tenants and HCD in regards to MPROP. Accordingly,
        the information sharing objective of this Program remains appropriate to the
        updated Housing Element.
5. Preservation of Assisted Housing
Six-Year Program Objective: Preserve 260 at-risk units. Contact property owners.
Explore outside funding; offer incentives; provide technical assistance to tenants.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: City staff has been
        in contact with the Los Angeles Community Development Commission (CDC),
        the monitoring agency for the affordable housing program in the Malibu Canyon
        and Archstone Calabasas apartment communities to discuss options for
        refinancing the projects’ bonds to extend affordability controls. The CDC
        communicated to staff that the owner of Malibu Canyon redeemed (paid off) the
        bonds in December 2008; therefore, the regulatory agreement will expire in June
        2016. This owner has no further obligation to continue preservation of their 140
        affordable units.
        The CDC also communicated to staff that Archstone’s regulatory period is the
        longer of April 9, 2013 or the date the bonds are no longer outstanding. With
        their current bond maturity date set at April 15, 2028, preservation efforts for this
        community will be delayed to future planning periods.
        Staff will therefore focus preservation efforts, including pursuit of funding,
        negotiation with property owners, and tenant education, on the 2016 expiration of
        affordability controls of Malibu Canyon. Staff has initiated discussions with the
        California Housing Partnership regarding preservation options.

6. Condominium Conversion Ordinance
Six-Year Objective: Implement the City’s current ordinance. Evaluate strengthening to
require inclusionary units in projects approved for conversion.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: The City continues
        to implement the current ordinance. No work has been initiated yet on enhancing
        the ordinance to apply inclusionary housing requirements to projects involving
        the conversion of rental apartments to owner condominiums, and the City has not
        received any requests for conversions. The Program remains appropriate to the
        updated Housing Element, including evaluation of enhancing the ordinance to
        require inclusionary units in projects approved for conversion.
7. Modification of RM Zoning Standards
Six-Year Objective: Revise RM zoning standards to permit 20 du/acre, and eliminate
requirement for CUP.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: The RM zoning
        standards were modified to permit 20 du/acre and the CUP requirement
        eliminated in January 2010 as part of the City's Development Code update. This
        objective will no longer be appropriate to the 2014-2021 Housing Element
        because the objective has been fully accomplished.
8. Residential Rezoning Program
Six-Year Objective: In conjunction with the General Plan update, re-designate sites for
at least 140 units at 20 du/acre, and 130 units at 12-20 du/acre.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: The Calabasas
        2030 General Plan provided the following expanded areas for multi-family
        housing, providing adequate sites to address the RHNA: Las Virgenes planned
        development, Old Town Mixed Use, and Rancho Pet Kennel. Three additional
        mixed use areas were also designated for longer term development. Sites were
        rezoned consistent with the General Plan as part of the City's Development Code
        update in January 2010. This Program will no longer be appropriate to the 2014-
        2021 Housing Element because the objective has been fully accomplished.
9. Annexation of Unincorporated Areas
Six-Year Objective: Pursue phased annexation of adjacent unincorporated areas.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: On July 13, 2011,
        the Local Agency Formation Commission for Los Angeles County (LAFCO)
        approved the Mont Calabasas annexation into the City of Calabasas. The
        annexation application for the adjacent "Mountain View Estates" was prepared
        and submitted to LAFCO and remains pending.                The Program remains
        appropriate to the updated Housing Element because the Mountain View Estates
        annexation remains pending and because the Craftsman Corner area is also

        identified as a potential annexation area in the City’s current Land Use Element
        (Policy II-4).
10. Second Units
Six-Year Objective: Amend the second unit ordinance to provide greater consistency
with State statutes, and educate public on availability.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: The second unit
        ordinance was amended in January 2010 as part of the City's Development Code
        update to provide ministerial review consist with State statutes. Three second
        units were developed during the 2008-2012 period. The Program remains
        appropriate to the updated Housing Element and the City will continue to educate
        the public on availability. Additionally, staff will pursue further amending the
        ordinance to allow a greater maximum unit size to facilitate permitting and
        production of second units.
11. Inclusionary Housing Ordinance
Six-Year Objective: Provide developers with information on available options and
incentives to fulfill inclusionary requirements. Identify specific projects and programs for
expenditure of in-lieu fee revenues.
        Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: The Inclusionary
        Housing ordinance is available to the public on the City's website via the link to
        our updated Municipal Code. Additionally, planning staff has been working
        directly with the applicants of three sizeable pending projects that are
        incorporating new affordable units into their respective developments. Staff
        identified new programs for expenditure of the in-lieu fees (which have
        contributed to the Affordable Housing Fund), including the newly approved Home
        Repair Loan Program (which assists certain single-family homeowners with
        serious and costly repairs so that distressed and code-deficient properties can be
        made safe) and efforts to preserve at-risk affordable units. The Program remains
        appropriate to the updated Housing Element.
12. Commercial/Industrial Development Impact Fee Program
Six-Year Objective: Provide affordable housing opportunities to Calabasas’ workforce.
Identify specific projects and programs for expenditure of impact fee revenues.
      Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: On January 16,
      2008, City Council committed to providing affordable housing developer Thomas
      Safran Associates with $1,000,000 of funding from the City’s Affordable Housing
      Fund (in which Commercial/Industrial Impact fees are deposited) for a senior
      affordable housing project in Old Town. In February 2010, the City loaned the
      funds to the developer. In Fall 2011, the development opened its doors and the
      project is now 100% occupied by low-income seniors.
      In September 2012, $126,180 in commercial impact fees were deposited into the
      Fund by the developer of a 70,000 square-foot shopping center on the west side of

     the City. The City currently has $1,367,900 remaining in the Fund, has committed
     $500,000 of this to the new Home Repair Loan Program, and is exploring various
     other options for spending the remaining funds. The Program remains appropriate
     to the updated Housing Element.
13. Affordable Housing Development Assistance
Six-Year Objective: Provide financial, regulatory, and site identification assistance in
support of affordable housing production consistent with the General Plan.
     Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: On January 16,
     2008, City Council committed to providing affordable housing developer Thomas
     Safran Associates with $1,000,000 of funding from the City’s Affordable Housing
     Fund contingent upon the applicant securing his other sources of funding within
     two years for a senior affordable housing project in Old Town. In February 2010,
     the City loaned the funds to the developer. In Fall 2011, the development opened
     its doors and the project is now 100% occupied. The City currently has
     $1,367,901 remaining in the Fund, has committed $500,000 of this to the new
     Home Repair Loan Program, and is exploring various other options for spending
     the remaining funds. The Program remains appropriate to the updated Housing
     Element.
14. Workforce Housing Program
Six-Year Objective: Research homeownership programs in other jurisdictions to
develop local program. Assist a minimum of five households.
       Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness:                    The City
       conducted research on the development of a Workforce Housing Program and
       evaluated associated costs. The research indicated that very few units could be
       created and/or households assisted for the amount of money that would have to
       be expended. Affordable Housing funds are limited, and with $1,000,000 of the
       funds dollars being committed to the 75-unit affordable housing project, the
       Workforce Housing program would not be financially viable. The City is quite
       pleased with the “value” provided by the Canyon Creek project and would prefer
       that affordable housing funds be appropriated in a similar manner. Therefore,
       this Program is no longer appropriate to the updated housing Element.
15. Green Building
Six-Year Objective: Implement Green Initiative; promote the City’s Green Building
Program, and evaluate expansion to residential use.
       Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: On September 23,
       2009, City Council adopted the California Green Building Standards Code, which
       now applies to all projects within the City, including residential. The City has
       adopted a comprehensive green initiative aimed at promoting environmentally
       responsible development, upgrading existing city facilities, and educational
       outreach, described in Section V which follows on Energy Conservation

         Opportunities. Green building and sustainability remain important to the updated
         Housing Element.
16. Density Bonus Program
Six-Year Objective: Promote density bonus incentives via dissemination of Affordable
Housing brochure.
         Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: The City’s density
         bonus ordinance is available to the public on the City’s website via the link to our
         updated Municipal Code. The Density Bonus Program was implemented as part
         of a multi-family condominium project entitled in 2008, where the developer
         provided 5% of the total project units as off-site very low-income units in
         exchange for a concession on the City’s height requirement. The Program
         remains appropriate to the updated Housing Element, including development and
         dissemination of an affordable housing brochure.
17. Zoning Ordinance Revision
Six-Year Objective: Amend the Zoning Ordinance to: 1) define supportive and
transitional housing as a residential use; and 2) allow emergency shelters in the CL
zone.
         Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness:                    The zoning
         ordinance was amended in January 2010, as part of the City's Development
         Code update, and: (1) supportive & transitional housing were defined as
         residential uses; and (2) emergency shelters in the CL zone were listed as
         permitted uses. This Program will no longer be necessary in the 2014-2021
         Housing Element as it has been fully implemented.
18. Fair Housing Program
Six-Year Objective: Contract with the Fair Housing Council (FHC) to promote open and
fair housing practices, and to facilitate communication between tenants and landlords.
Assist in program outreach through referrals and distribution of educational information.
         Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness: City housing staff
         have referred numerous renters concerned about unfair rent increases to the Fair
         Housing Council, and provides Fair Housing Council handouts at the Planning
         Kiosk near the public counter. Staff is also in the process of developing a
         housing brochure which encompasses all the City’s programs, which will be
         made available on the City’s website. The Housing Rights Center recently
         assumed responsibility for the fair housing program through its contract with Los
         Angeles County, and the City will reflect the updated agency contact information
         in its housing brochure. This Program remains appropriate to the updated
         Housing Element.

19. Accessible Housing
Six-Year Objective: Adopt Reasonable Accommodation procedures and regular
accessibility updates to codes; offer grants for accessibility improvements.
       Program Accomplishments/ Continued Appropriateness:                   Reasonable
       accommodation procedures were adopted in January 2010, as part of the City's
       Development Code update. The Program remains appropriate to the updated
       Housing Element, including making regular updates to codes and offering grants
       to qualified low-income households for accessibility improvements.

Summary of Progress and Continued Appropriateness of 2008-2014 Goals,
Polices and Programs
The goals and policies of the 2008-2014 Calabasas Housing Element remain
appropriate to the updated element, and most of the Element’s housing programs
remain appropriate for continuation. However, the following programs have either been
completed or are otherwise no longer applicable for the reasons explained in the above
review:
         Modification of RM Zoning Standards
         Residential Rezoning Program
         Zoning Ordinance Revision
         Workforce Housing Program

New construction goal reflects RHNA; progress includes 54 very low and 20 low income units in Canyon
Creek Apartments, 4 second units (moderate income), 79 single-family units and the 60 unit Malibu Hills
senior condominiums under construction with occupancy to occur in 2013 within this planning period.
Rehabilitation goal and progress reflects the Residential Rehabilitation Program.
Conservation goal and progress reflects the City’s Rent Subsidy Program, and Preservation of low income
at-risk housing.
New Construction: The City’s 2008-2014 Housing Element was adopted in December
2008 in conjunction with the Calabasas’ 2030 General Plan. A major focus of the
General Plan was to provide expanded sites for multi-family and mixed use development
at appropriate densities to address the City’s regional housing needs (RHNA) update,
which as indicated by Table 29, the City was successful in accomplishing. However, the
number of units actually constructed during this period (217) represents just under half of
the City’s RHNA (521). Like much of California, the collapse of the residential real
estate market, combined with severe constraints on the availability of financing for
development, significantly dampened the level of residential development activity in
Calabasas during the prior planning period. Nonetheless, the City was able to achieve
construction of the 75-unit Senior Affordable Housing community in Old Town (the
Canyon Creek Apartments) through provision of regulatory incentives and contribution of
$1 million in Affordable Housing Fund resources.

Rehabilitation: In terms of rehabilitation, the City’s goal was to assist ten households
per year, for a total of 60 households. While the City was successful in assisting 25
lower income households rehabilitate their homes using CDBG funds, it fell short of its
goal due to decreases in CDBG funding and continued allocation of Affordable Housing
Fund resources towards affordable production.
Conservation: The City’s conservation goal included continued provision of monthly
rental subsidies to 40 households via the Rental Assistance Program, which the City
exceeded, increasing the number of households assisted to 50 as well as increasing the
subsidy amount. The second component of the conservation goal was for preservation
of the 260 at-risk bond units in Malibu Canyon and Archstone Apartments. While the
affordability period on the Archstone property has been extended to the year 2028, the
City continues to work with the County CDC and California Housing Partnership to
develop a strategy to extend the affordability controls on Malibu Canyon Apartments
beyond the current 2016 expiration date.

       V. ENERGY CONSERVATION OPPORTUNITIES
“Green buildings” are structures that are designed, renovated, re-used or operated in a
manner that enhances resource efficiency and sustainability. These structures reduce
water consumption, improve energy efficiency and lessen a building’s overall
environmental impact. The City of Calabasas is committed to securing its long-term
sustainability by implementing a green initiative to improve the quality of the
environment, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and use finite natural resources
efficiently. The City’s green initiative is aimed at promoting environmentally responsible
development, upgrading existing city facilities, and educational outreach.
Calabasas adopted its first green building ordinance in January 2004, requiring all new
and substantially renovated non-residential buildings greater than 500 square feet in size
to utilize environmentally efficient site and building design, sustainable construction
practices, and rapidly renewable or recycled building materials. On September 23, 2009,
City Council adopted the California Green Building Standards Code, which now applies
to all projects within the City, including residential. This Code was updated in November
2010 and again in January 2011.
Calabasas’ green initiative encompasses numerous activities summarized on the City’s
Green City webpage, with numerous links to outside resources. The following highlights
some of the City’s green projects and programs:
          Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Program - City of Calabasas is
             working with Los Angeles County to provide energy efficient retrofits to its
             residents. The County is investing approximately $11 million in federal grant
             funds to develop a PACE program to serve the county's 88 cities. The
             program is designed to encourage private property owners to invest in energy
             efficiency retrofits and is key part of a broader home retrofit program for LA
             County. The LA County PACE program is authorized under California’s AB
             811, which enables municipalities to provide private property owners with the
             ability to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements
             through a voluntary property tax assessment that is paid back over 20 years.
          Calabasas Civic Center -In July 2008, the City of Calabasas completed
             construction of a high performance, resource-friendly Civic Center consisting
             of a City Hall and Public Library. Both buildings were designed to meet a
             “Gold” standard from the United States Green Building Council’s (USGBC)
             Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building
             Rating System for new construction. Sustainable design features include the
             use of energy and water efficient HVAC and plumbing systems, recycled and
             locally manufactured materials, use of a “cool” energy star rated roof, drought
             tolerant landscaping, low flow irrigation system, use of recycled water for
             landscape, use of natural daylight, increased views, systems to monitor and
             provide healthy indoor air quality and much more. Both the City Hall and
             Public Library were awarded a LEED Gold Certification by the United States
             Green Building Council (USGBC) on January 20, 2010.

          Recycling Program – With the passage of AB 939,
            Calabasas has set up a number of recycling programs to
            ensure it meets and exceeds the State’s goal of a 50 percent
            diversion rate including programs for curbside recycling,
            construction waste recycling, electronic waste recycling, and
            household hazardous waste round-ups. In addition, staff
            provides outreach and technical assistance to residents, businesses and the
            schools to maximize waste prevention and recycling.
          Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet – The City’s
            vehicle fleet consists of automobiles, trucks,
            and vans for City employees and public
            transit shuttles and old fashioned trolley cars
            to serve the public.        Recognizing that
            standard gasoline using automobiles
            consume        considerable     energy     and
            contribute significantly to air pollution, the
            City continues to build a vehicle fleet
            consisting of alternative fuel vehicles that run off of compressed natural gas
            (CNG) or involve hybrid gas/electric engines to improve fuel efficiency.
            Recently, the City added nine hybrid vehicles to the City's fleet for use by
            inspectors, saving gallons of gas from being consumed each year.
          Green Rebates and Incentives – The City’s Green City webpage includes a
            comprehensive listing of available financial incentives for use of green
            appliances and utilities in single-family homes, multi-family structures, and
            commercial properties. The webpage also provides detailed information for
            residents on how to retrofit their homes to make them greener.
          Polystyrene Ban – In 2007, the City Council adopted an ordinance banning
            the use of Polystyrene (Styrofoam) by retail food establishments, nonprofit
            food providers and City facilities. The ordinance requires food establishments
            to use environmentally acceptable packaging.
          Second-Hand Smoke Ordinance – The City enacted a
            comprehensive second-hand smoke ordinance in 2006
            which restricts smoking in all public places, including
            parks, sidewalks, parking lots, patios and outdoor
            balconies.
The Calabasas 2030 General Plan is predicated on creating a more sustainable
community for existing and future residents. The Land Use Element establishes a new
Mixed Use designation where people can live, work and shop without getting in their
cars, and continues to permit the integration of residential uses in most commercial
districts. The Conservation Element establishes numerous policies in support of
sustainable development, including:
     Promote neighborhood designs that minimize energy use – e.g. mixed-use
         development to allow residents to live where they work and shop

    Promote site design to minimize energy use – e.g. maximize solar access by
       use of non-reflective glass on south facing walls
    Promote building designs that minimize energy use – e.g. design buildings to
       maximize internal lighting
    Promote incorporation of energy conservation measures in existing and new
