I.            INTRODUCTION
A.         Purpose and Content of Housing Element
           The intent of the Housing Element of the General Plan is to provide the City with a
           coordinated and comprehensive strategy for promoting the production of safe, decent,
           and affordable housing within the community. A priority of both State and local
           governments, Government Code Section 65580 states the intent of creating housing
           elements:
                The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early
                attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every
                California family is a priority of the highest order.
           According to state law, the Housing Element has two main purposes:
           (1) To provide an assessment of both current and future housing needs and
                constraints in meeting these needs; and
           (2) To provide a strategy that establishes housing goals, policies, and programs.
           Beyond State law requirements, Grass Valley has areas of special priority that provide
           additional purpose to the Housing Element. The unique conditions and market forces in
           play in the local housing market require that the Housing Element focus on additional
           concerns. Some examples include the high proportion of rental homes in the City versus
           the rest of the County, the lower average income of households versus other cities in the
           area, and environmental constraints that affect the ability to accommodate additional
           housing at higher densities. Both the State-mandated concerns and the local concerns
           combine to set the foundation for the content of this Housing Element.
           The Housing Element is a five-year plan for the 2014-2019 periods, which differs from
           other General Plan elements, which cover the period of 1999-2020. The Housing
           Element serves as an integrated part of the General Plan, but the City is required to
           update it more frequently to ensure its relevancy and accuracy. The Housing Element
           identifies strategies and programs that focus on:
                      Matching housing supply with need;
                      Maximizing housing choice throughout the community;
                      Assisting in the provision of affordable housing;
                      Removing governmental and other constraints to housing investment; and
                      Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities.
Adopted September 2014                                I-1                                      I. INTRODUCTION
                                                                         GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
                 A profile and analysis of the City's demographics, housing characteristics, and
                  existing and future housing needs (Chapter 2).
                 A review of the resources and constraints to housing production and maintenance.
                  Resources include land available for new construction, as well as financial and
                  administrative resources available for housing. Constraints include potential
                  market, governmental, and environmental limitations to meeting the City's identified
                  housing needs (Chapter 3).
                 A statement of the Housing Plan to address the City's identified housing needs,
                  including an assessment of past accomplishments, and a formulation of housing
                  goals, policies and programs (Chapter 4).
B. Community Context
           The City of Grass Valley continues to face a need to plan for and provide sufficient
           housing units, resources, and programs for our residents. Local housing costs, the
           anticipated population growth, and changing demographics all illustrate the need to
           develop an approach and strategy to producing housing that matches the needs of the
           existing and future population of the community. Based on the most up-to-date data,
           resources, and knowledge available, the City has undertaken the task of planning to
           meet housing needs for the period from 2014 to 2019. The result of this effort is the
           updated Housing Element of the General Plan.
           Many unique circumstances face our community. The provision of adequate housing for
           all residents is dependent upon creating programs that adequately addresses these
           issues. Since the late 1990s, Grass Valley has experienced a substantial rise in housing
           costs, however, median household income in the City continues to fall well short of that
           in the rest of the County, including in Nevada City and Truckee. The community also
           has a much higher percentage of rental housing than the County, and must ensure that
           new programs meet the needs of both future homeowners and renters alike. By far the
           greatest challenge facing the City this Housing Element Cycle is the loss of the
           Redevelopment Agency.                The City’s previously approved Housing Elements
          demonstrate tremendous success with the City’s use of redevelopment funds to promote,
           preserve, and create affordable housing in the Community.
           Within this broad context, the City must address key housing challenges over the 2014-
           2019 planning period. These challenges include:
                      Providing sufficient sites for additional housing;
                      Providing for a range in types and prices of housing, particularly workforce
                       housing;
                      Providing assistance in the cleanup of contaminated sites;
                      Improving the opportunities for mixed-use housing; and
                      Maintaining and improving the local environment and quality of life in Grass
                       Valley.
Adopted September 2014                                I-2                                       I. INTRODUCTION
                                                                          GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           The 2014-2019 Housing Element addresses these issues through a comprehensive
           housing strategy. Creating a suitable and effective housing strategy is a complex
           process, but one defined by the needs of those living and working within the community.
           The diverse population of Grass Valley requires an approach that can produce an
           equally diverse range of housing choices, including single-family homes, apartments,
           housing for special needs groups (including the homeless), and many others. The
           content of the Housing Element begins with an assessment of the major issues facing
           housing production and maintenance within the community, and then develops
           strategies for ensuring that the City has an approach and structure capable of facilitating
           the housing necessary to meet projected community needs.
C.         State Requirements
           One of the California Legislature’s main housing goals is to attain a decent home and
           suitable living environment for every resident. Recognizing the important role of local
           planning programs in pursuing this goal, the Legislature requires all cities and counties
           prepare a housing element as part of their comprehensive general plan. Section 65583
           of the Government Code sets forth the specific contents to be contained in a
           community’s housing element.
           State law requires housing elements to be updated at least every five years to reflect a
           community’s changing housing needs. The City’s existing Housing Element covered the
           five-year period spanning 2009 through 2014. This Housing Element covers the
           planning period of 2014 to 2019.
           A critical measure of compliance with the State Housing Element law is the ability of a
           jurisdiction to accommodate its share of the regional housing needs – Regional Housing
           Needs Allocation (RHNA). For Nevada County, the regional growth projected by the
           State was for the period between January 2014 and June 2019.
D.         Data Sources and Methodology
           In preparing the Housing Element, the City used various sources of information.
           Wherever possible, Census 2000 and 2010 data provided the baseline for all
           demographic information. Another key source was the 5th Cycle Housing Element Data
           Package provided by HCD. Other sources included employment data from the
           Employment Development Department, lending data from financial institutions provided
           under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), and the most recent data available
           from service agencies and other governmental agencies. In addition, the City’s 2014-
           2019 Housing Element implements the most recent changes to State Housing Element
           law, including those affecting the development, maintenance, and improvement of
           housing for persons with disabilities.
E.         Summary of Findings and Policies
           To address the community conditions and housing needs identified within this Housing
           Element, the City adopted actions to facilitate the development of the regional housing
Adopted September 2014                           I-3                                      I. INTRODUCTION
                                                                    GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           needs allocation, programs to assist in the production and rehabilitation of a wide range
           of housing and shelter, as well as programs that establish supportive services for all
           income levels and special interest groups. Housing Element programs include some of
           the following provisions in order to achieve the intended goals of the planning effort:
                 Provide adequate sites for housing through planning studies, mixed-use
                  development opportunities, and an analysis of appropriate zoning designations;
                 Pursue state and federal funding opportunities;
                 Monitor the progress of Housing Element goals that have been achieved on an
                  annual basis; and
                 Monitor the Development Code to determine if the City needs to takes additional
                  steps to reduce regulatory barriers to the development of affordable housing.
F.         Public Participation
           The City encouraged all segments of the community to participate in the preparation of
           the Housing Element. This included a combination of general public notices and direct
           contacts with organizations serving low-income and special needs groups and inviting
           them to attend a public workshop on the Housing Element. To provide opportunities for
           public participation in the preparation of the Housing Element, the City conducted two
           workshops (one directed towards organizations and one for the public) on January 21,
           2014. The intent of the workshops was to obtain input on local housing issues, and to
           explain the purpose and contents of the Housing Element, state requirements, and the
           update process.
           The City conducted public hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council
           on June 17 and June 24, 2014, respectively, on the draft Housing Element to accept
           public comments prior to submittal of the draft to the California Department of Housing
           and Community Development for mandated state review.
           Written invitations were sent to community-based organizations, nonprofit housing
           organizations, building industry representatives, and public agencies; public notices in
           The Union, and posted notices in City buildings. The City notified interested parties of
           the availability of the Housing Element and noted its location on the City’s website.
           The City contacted the following key organizations during the preparation of the Housing
           Element:

                                                                      GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           The City also conducted public hearings before the Planning Commission and City
           Council on the Housing Element to solicit public comments prior to adoption. .
           Previous comments made by the public related to the Housing Element over the years
           include the following:
                 Need to provide more home ownership opportunities.
                 Continue to seek coordination between private profit and non-profit organizations.
                 Assist in site cleanup of contaminated sites.
                 Seek ways to improve first time homebuyers program.
                 Continue to support mixed-use developments.
                 Consider more over the counter permit approvals.
           The City addressed these comments in Section IV of the Housing Element.
G. General Plan Consistency
           The Housing Element is a component of the General Plan, which provides guiding policy
           for all growth and development within the community. The General Plan consists of nine
           chapters (referred to as Elements) that address both the State-mandated planning
           issues plus optional subjects that are of particular concern within Grass Valley. These
           elements are:
                 Land Use,
                 Circulation,
                 Conservation/Open Space,
                 Noise,
                 Safety,
                 Recreation,
                 Historical Resources,
                 Community Design, and
                 Housing
           State law requires consistency among elements of the General Plan. As such, goals
           and policies contained within the Housing Element should be interpreted and
           implemented as being consistent with the goals and policies of the rest of the General
           Plan. The City conducted an analysis to ensure that the contents of the 2014-2019
           Housing Element maintain consistency with the other General Plan elements. Table I-1
           lists the General Plan policies from other elements associated with housing issues.
           The City will continue to ensure consistency between the Housing Element and other
           General Plan elements so that policies introduced in one element are consistent with
Adopted September 2014                            I-5                                        I. INTRODUCTION

           other elements. At this time, the Housing Element does not propose changes to any
           other element of the General Plan. However, if it becomes necessary to modify an
           element to maintain internal consistency, staff will present such changes to the Planning
           Commission and City Council.

II. COMMUNITY PROFILE
A.         Population and Household Characteristics
1.         Population Trends
           The California Department of Finance estimated Grass Valley’s population in January
           2013 at 12,657. Between 2000 and 2010, the population of Grass Valley increased by
           1,938 people, about 15 percent, or less than 1.5 percent per year. However, since
           January 2010, the estimated population decreased by 56 persons (Table II-1).
           Population projections show that by 2020 the City may have 23,395 residents, about
           double the current population and double the rate of population growth between 1990
           and 2009. The 2000 population for Grass Valley’s General Plan (GP) Planning Area in
           Table II-2 includes the existing incorporated city, sphere of influence, and areas likely to
           be annexed into the City. The 5,078 people included within the GP Planning Area but
           not in the City’s 2000 population currently live outside the City limits but within the City’s
           Sphere of Influence. By comparison, Nevada County’s population is expected to grow
           by approximately two percent per year.

   Note:       Difference is due in part to the Census allowing for Other Race category to include persons of multiple
               descents whereas, in the past, persons were only counted for their “dominant” ethnic or racial
               background.

4.         Household Type
           In 2010, 6,077 households resided in Grass Valley. About half (49 percent) were family
           households, two or more persons sharing a dwelling unit who were related in some way.
           Grass Valley has a lower percentage of family households than countywide (74 percent)
           largely due to large number of single adults and seniors. Between 2000 and 2010, the
           number of married-couple families with and without children decreased, while the
           number of non-family households increased about 5%. The number of female-headed
           households, including single women with children, had a slight decrease.
           There has been a steady decline in household size since 1990 and 2010. In 2010, the
           US Census estimated the average household size in Grass Valley at 2.04, down from
           2.12 in 1990. Table II-5 shows changes in types of households in Grass Valley from
           2000 to 2010.

5.         Household Income
           Grass Valley’s median income is significantly lower than incomes other communities in
           Nevada County (Nevada City, Truckee, and its unincorporated communities). In 2012,
           the median income in Grass Valley was $36,612, nearly $23,532 less than Nevada
           City’s median income and over $20,770 and $28,785 less than the median incomes for
           both Nevada County and Truckee, respectively. Lower incomes in Grass Valley are the
           result of several factors: 1) the high percentage of renter households (58 percent of all
           households), 2) the high proportion of government-assisted rental apartments (Grass
           Valley contains most of the subsidized rental housing in Nevada County), and 3) the
           high proportion of jobs that pay low- to moderate-wages. The median income of renter
           households ($27,865) was significantly lower than for homeowners ($49,183). Table II-
           6 compares median incomes for Nevada County and its cities in 2012. Table II-7 shows
           income in relation to tenure for 2010 in Grass Valley.

6.         Poverty Rate
           The poverty rate is another indicator of housing need. The poverty rate is the proportion
           of the population with incomes below a subsistence level of income. Originally used in
           the 1960s as an estimate of the minimum income needed to obtain a nutritious diet,
           clothing, shelter, and other basic necessities of life, the definition of “poverty” has

           undergone several revisions over the decades. The Census Bureau establishes the
           dollar amount, or threshold, that defines poverty each year. The threshold varies by
           household size and composition. For example, the 2012 U.S. Census poverty threshold
           for a single person under 65 years of age was $11,945 and $23,492 for a family of four.
           Because of lower incomes in Grass Valley, the poverty rate is higher than in other
           Nevada County communities. In 2012, 21.9 percent of the Grass Valley’s residents lived
           in poverty, compared to 15% in 2000. The population group with the highest poverty
           levels were families with children under 18 (31.4 percent), particularly female-headed
           families with children 18 (31.8 percent). Table II-8 compares the poverty status by
           population and family type between 2000 and 2012 in Grass Valley.

B.         Housing Stock Characteristics
1.         Housing Type
           Grass Valley’s housing stock increased by 20 percent (913 units) between 1990 and
           2000 and by 14% (728 units) between 2000 and 2012Between 1990 and 2000,
           approximately 40 percent of the housing units built in Grass Valley were single-family
           homes and approximately 40 percent were multi-family residences. Grass Valley had
           5,298 housing units in 2000, 2,722 single-family units, 2,073 multi-family units, the
           remainder consisting of mobile homes and other types of housing. Since 2000, the
           distribution of housing types in the City has fluctuated very little. In 2012, the City had
           6,026 housing units.
           Multi-family structures, particularly apartment complexes of five or more housing units,
           continue to represent a high proportion of the city’s housing stock. A contributing factor
           to this high percentage is the number of government subsidized rental housing units in
           Grass Valley, as documented in analysis of at-risk housing. Table II-9 shows changes in
           housing stock between 1990 and 2012.

2.         Tenure
           Grass Valley has the highest percentage of renter households in Nevada County, 58
           percent. Countywide, renters comprise 27 percent of households. In the United States
           and in California, 35 and 44 percent of households are renters, respectively. The higher
           proportion of renters in Grass Valley is the result of historic development patterns in the
           City (over half of Nevada County’s rental apartment housing stock is concentrated in
           Grass Valley) and significantly lower incomes that make home ownership difficult for
           many in Grass Valley. Table II-10 shows tenure in Nevada County and its jurisdictions
           in 2012.

           Between 1990 and 2000, homeownership in Grass Valley increased by 481 households
           (28 percent). The homeownership rate for this period increased from 41 to 43 percent of
           all households. Since 2000, homeownership increased by 336 households, but the
           ownership rate decreased to 42%. Many of the residential projects approved or
           proposed since 2000 are multi-family apartments or mixed-use projects containing rental
           apartments, condominiums, and/or town homes.                Since 2000, the City issued
           approximately 509 building permits for single-family homes and 359 building permits for
           multifamily homes; however, since 2009, the City has only issued permits for 26 single-
           family and 42 multifamily homes.

           As is true in most communities, the homeownership rate in Grass Valley tends to
           increase with the age of householder. The highest rate of homeownership is among
           householders age 65 and older. Homeownership amongst the 55 to 64 age group
           doubled (13 to 26 percent) from 2000 to 2011. This age group also experienced a

3.         Housing Vacancy
           During a period when the City’s housing stock increased, the effective vacancy rates for
           housing units available for sale or for rent increased. The effective vacancy rate
           indicates the actual percentage of units available for sale or rent at a given time,
           excluding seasonal housing, second homes, and other unoccupied units that are not on
           the market for sale or rent. According to U.S. Census and 2008-2012 American
           Community Survey 5-year Estimate data, the estimated vacancy rate of rental housing
           in Grass Valley increased from 2.5 percent in 2000 to 7.3 percent in 2012. The effective
           vacancy rate of homeowners increased from 1.9 percent to 2.6 percent over this 12-year
           period. The estimated rate for homeownership is below the level but rental are above
           the levels—typically five percent— considered to be adequate to ensure a balance
           between supply and demand. Table II-14 compares vacancy rates from the U.S.

4.         Overcrowding
           Overcrowding, usually defined as more than one person per room, more than tripled
           between 2000 and 2011. Overcrowding typically occurs when households cannot find
           housing of a suitable size that they can afford.
           In 2000, approximately eight percent (232) of renters lived in overcrowded conditions.
           By 2010, the number of renters living in overcrowded conditions increased to 1,423 and
           the proportion of such renters increased to twenty-one percent. Between 2000 and 2011,
           the number of homeowners living in overcrowded conditions went from 60 to 549,
           increasing the rate of overcrowding among homeowners from three percent to eleven
           percent. The percentage of the population living in overcrowded conditions is an
           indicator of the continued poor economic conditions in California as a whole, particularly
           in the more rural areas. Table II-15 compares overcrowding in 2000 and 2011.

5.         Housing Costs
           a.          Housing Prices
           In 1990, the median price for a single-family home in Grass Valley was $135,000,
           according to DataQuick. By 2003, the median price of a single-family home in Grass
           Valley rose to $235,000, a 74 percent increase in a twelve-year period. As experienced
           nation-wide, after a rapid increase in home prices since 2003, the 2010 median price for
           a single-family home fell dramatically to $222,500 Table II-16 shows changes in the
           median price for a single family home in Grass Valley.

           b.          Rents
           Between 2000 and 2012, the median contract rent increased from $572 to $925,
           according to the U. S. Census Bureau. Contract rent is the dollar amount a renter pays
           under a rental or lease agreement, excluding utility costs (unless these costs are
           included in the rental agreement). The Census reports do not provide an accurate
           measure of market rents. However, because a large proportion of rental housing units in
           Grass Valley is either income and rent restricted (government subsidized rental
           apartments), or because a large number of Grass Valley residents have housing
           vouchers under the federal Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) Program, they pay only
           30 percent of their incomes for rents.
Adopted September 2014                                 II-10                                    II. COMMUNITY PROFILE

           An indication of the difference between contract rents (the amount tenants pay) and
           market rents is the federal government’s estimate of fair market rents for Nevada County.
           The fair market rent is the dollar amount a property owner is entitled to receive, less
           utility costs, for a rental unit occupied by a low-income tenant with a federal housing
           voucher. The federal government pays the difference between the fair market rent and
           the tenant’s payment. The 2012 fair market rents in Nevada County range from $828 for
           a one-bedroom apartment to $1,575 for a three-bedroom rental unit.
           Information from rental property managers in Grass Valley indicates that the median rent
           for a market rate apartment of any size in Grass Valley is $970.

7.         Age and Condition of Housing
           In 2010, approximately 69 percent of the housing stock in Grass Valley was at least 40
           years old or older (Table II-20). Homes that are 30 years old and older are generally at
           the greatest risk of being substandard and/or subject to deterioration associated with
           improper maintenance and repair. The highest rehabilitation need usually occurs in
           communities with a combination of older housing, a high percentage of non-government
           subsidized rental housing, and a high percentage of low-income households. Each of
           these factors is characteristics of Grass Valley.

           In 2007, Grass Valley conducted a housing condition survey to evaluate the overall
           housing conditions. The survey evaluated the condition of the following items: roof,
           foundations, windows, siding, and electrical. The survey categorized 2,856 housing
           units and grouped them as either sound, minor, moderate, substantial, or dilapidated.
           The City utilized the CDBG Housing Conditions Survey form in this evaluation. Table II-
           21 illustrates the overall conditions of the surveyed homes. The survey shows that
           seventy-two (72) percent of the homes surveyed were in sound condition or needed
           minor repair. Homes classified as moderate, meaning in need of one or more major
           repairs, represents twenty-two (22) percent. Approximately six (6) percent of the homes
           surveyed fell into the substantial or dilapidated category. These homes require
           substantial repairs or appear to be potentially unfit for human habitation.

C.         Employment Trends
           Grass Valley’s employment base is largely in retail and service trades. Approximately
           19 percent of the jobs available in Grass Valley are associated with retail trades.
           Approximately 18 percent of jobs available in Grass Valley are in education, health care
           and social assistance organizations. The City experienced a significant reduction in
           manufacturing jobs since 2000.
           Significant differences exist between the types of jobs available in Grass Valley and the
           occupations of employed Grass Valley residents. Even though there has been a
           significant change in commuting patterns since 2000, a large percentage of residents
           (41 percent) still commute to jobs outside Grass Valley. Although most jobs in Grass
           Valley are in retail and service industries, many Grass Valley residents hold jobs outside
           the City in manufacturing, education, government, and construction trades.
           The difference between jobs in Grass Valley and jobs held by Grass Valley residents
           creates a kind of “reverse commute.” Many low- to moderate-wage workers employed in
           Grass Valley commute from homes outside the city, while many Grass Valley residents
           commute from their homes in the City to higher paying jobs outside Grass Valley.
           Table II-22 compares employment in Grass Valley in 2000 and 2012. Table II-23 shows
           the number and percent of Grass Valley residents who work inside and outside the city.

D.         Special Housing Needs
           Certain groups in the City of Grass Valley encounter greater difficulty finding decent,
           affordable housing due to their special needs and/or circumstances.                    Special
           circumstances may relate to one’s employment and income, family characteristics,

                                                                      GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           medical condition or disability, and/or household characteristics. A focus of the Housing
           Element is to ensure that all persons have the opportunity to find suitable housing in
           Grass Valley.
           State Housing Element law identifies “special needs” groups as follows: elderly, persons
           with disabilities, female-headed households, large households, farmworkers, and
           homeless persons and families. This section provides a discussion of housing needs for
           each group, and identifies the programs and services available to address their housing
           and supportive service needs. The information in this section comes from the US
           Census (2000, 2010, or 2008-2012 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimate) and
           the HUD’s 5th Cycle Housing Element Data Package for Nevada County.
1.      Elderly/Senior Households
           Senior households typically have special housing needs due to three primary concerns:
           1) fixed, often low, incomes, 2) high health care costs, and 3) self-care or independent
           living limitations (such as health-related disabilities). In 2012, approximately 2,038
           households in Grass Valley were headed by persons age 65 years and older with over
           50% living alone.
           A growing trend among retirees, most of whom are 65 years of age or more, is to
           relocate to Sierra Nevada foothill and mountain communities, either part-time or year
           round. Many retirees move to small communities in the region that lack a full
           complement of health care, transportation, and other services that seniors increasingly
           need as they age. Commercial and service centers in the Sierra region, such as Grass
           Valley, can expect to experience a growing demand for public and private services
           oriented to seniors throughout the regions they serve. As seniors in the region become
           less able to care for themselves and live independently, increasing numbers of senior
           housing, assisted care, and supportive service providers may choose to locate facilities
           in Grass Valley. Grass Valley has experienced this trend since the 1980s with a growing
           number of senior housing and assisting living facilities.
           About eight percent of individuals over 65 in Grass Valley had poverty-level incomes in
           2012, which is significantly less than the poverty rate for the population as a whole.
           Approximately 43 percent of households headed by seniors, 882 households, had low-
           incomes (less than 80 percent of median).              The percentage of senior-headed
           households with lower incomes is slightly higher than the overall population. These
           figures suggest that seniors may have limited capacity to absorb increases in housing-
           related expenses.
           In 2012, 1,219elderly households in Grass Valley were homeowners and 819 were
           renters. Because of physical and/or other limitations, senior homeowners may have
           difficulty in performing regular home maintenance or repairs. In addition, because many
           seniors have fixed and/or limited incomes, they may experience difficulty meeting
           monthly housing costs. Elderly women are especially in need of financial assistance
           because so many of them live alone and they tend to have lower incomes than seniors
           as a group. In 2012, 80 percent of senior households living alone were women (1,128
           households).
Adopted September 2014                              II-16                             II. COMMUNITY PROFILE
                                                                      GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           Various programs can help meet the needs of seniors, including congregate care,
           supportive services, rental subsidies, shared housing, and housing rehabilitation
           assistance. For the frail elderly or those with disabilities, housing with features that
           accommodate disabilities can help ensure continued independent living. Elderly people
           with mobility/self-care limitations also benefit from transportation alternatives.
           Transportation assistance is especially important in foothills communities such as Grass
           Valley because so much of the area is sloped and difficult for pedestrians with mobility
           limitations to traverse.
           The City has adopted an Elder Care Ordinance, which includes provisions for affordable
           housing units for lower income elderly persons, affordable housing units for elderly
           persons with income lower than the median for Nevada County, and provisions to enable
           elderly people access to public transportation.
           According to the California Department of Social Services (2014), Grass Valley has eight
           licensed care facilities, including residential, assisted-living, and independent living for
           seniors. These facilities have a combined capacity of over 455 beds available to senior
           residents of Grass Valley. Additionally, twelve (12) subsidized apartment complexes
           accept seniors.
2. Persons with Disabilities, including Persons with Developmental
Disabilities
           Persons with disabilities typically have special housing needs because of their fixed or
           limited incomes, a lack of accessible and affordable housing that meets their physical
           and/or developmental capabilities, and higher health costs associated with their
           disabilities. A disability is defined broadly by state and federal agencies as a physical,
           mental, or emotional condition that lasts over a long period of time, makes it difficult to
           live independently, and affects one or more major life activities. A “developmental
           disability” is defined as a disability that originates before an individual becomes 18 years
           old, continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
           disability for that individual. This includes Mental Retardation, Cerebral Palsy, Epilepsy,
           and Autism. The 2000 Census defines six disabilities: sensory, physical, mental, self-
           care, “go-outside-home,” and employment disability. According to the 2000 Census,
           4,570 Grass Valley residents had some type of disability. Of these persons, 1,858 are
           age 65 years or older. Many individuals who reported disabilities did not necessarily
           have conditions requiring special housing features or supportive services to facilitate
           independent living. However, the large number people reporting some type of disability
           during the 2000 Census indicates the potential for such a need. The 2000 Census
           shows there were approximately 852 persons employed with a physical disability. 95945
           is the predominant zip code for Grass Valley. The State Department of Development
           Services identifies 197 persons with development disabilities in this zip code. Of those,
           117 reside with a parent or guardian, 65 reside in independent living facilities, and 10 in
           a community care facility.

           To meet the unique housing needs of the disabled, the City offers and participates in
           various programs and allows for a variety of group home alternatives for persons with
           disabilities who cannot live independently. Through the Nevada County Housing and
           Community Services Department, disabled households may receive rental assistance to
           help them afford housing in the community. In addition, the City offers home
           improvement grants, which can be used to make upgrades/modifications to ensure
           accessibility. In addition, the City requires new residential construction to comply with
           state building standards (Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations) for handicapped
           accessibility.   State standards require a minimum percentage of units in new
           developments to be fully accessible to the physically disabled.
           Living arrangements for persons with disabilities depend on the severity of the disability.
           Many persons live independently with other family members. To maintain independent
           living, persons with disabilities may need special housing design features, income
           support, and in-home supportive services for persons with medical conditions.

           Severely mentally ill persons are especially in need of assistance. Mentally disabled
           individuals are those with psychiatric disabilities that impair their ability to function in the
           community to varying degrees. The National Institute of Mental Health (2009) estimates
           that 6 percent of the adult population (age 18+) suffers from serious mental illness. If
           this percentage is applied to Grass Valley, approximately 600 persons may suffer from
           some form of mental illness.
           Many persons with disabilities can live and work independently within a conventional
           living environment. However, more severely disabled individuals require a group living
           environment in which trained personnel provide partial or constant supervision. The
           most severely affected individuals may require an institutional environment that provides
           medical attention and therapy within the living environment. According to the California
           Department of Social Services, Grass Valley is home to two adult day care facilities with
           a combined capacity to serve 100 clients. (Adult day care facilities are facilities of any
           capacity that provide programs for frail elderly and developmentally disabled and/or
           mentally disabled adults in a day care setting.) The Grass valley area has a multitude of
           resources for persons with disabilities. The following is a list of some of, but not limited
           to, community-wide agencies and programs that provide housing, employment, and
           other services to persons with disabilities:
           New Step – A continuation of High School, up to age 22, that offers life skills and
            workability training.
           Alta Regional Center – Provides a full range of long-term services to those in the
            program prior to age 18.
           FREED – Provides independent living skills, transit services, and counseling services.

3.      Farmworkers
           Farmworkers are persons whose primary incomes come from permanent or seasonal
           agricultural labor. Permanent farmworkers work in the fields, processing plants, or
           support activities on a year-round basis. When workloads increase during harvest
           periods, seasonal or migrant labor supplements the labor force.
           According to the Nevada County Agricultural Commissioner, agricultural products within
           the county include timber, livestock, nursery and field crops, fruit and vegetable crops,
           wool, and apiary by-products (such as honey and bees’ wax). In11, the farming, natural
           resources, and mining industries employed 58 people residing within Grass Valley.
           According to the 2012 Agricultural Census, Nevada County has an estimated 511
           farmworkers, which includes143 that work over 150 days/year and 368 that work less
           than 150 days/year.
           According to the 2011 Census, there were 58 Grass Valley residents employed in
           farming, forestry, and fishing occupations. It is likely that the majority of these residents
           worked in forestry or fisheries industries rather than agriculture. The City’s planning
Adopted September 2014                               II-19                               II. COMMUNITY PROFILE
                                                                        GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           area does not include any significant areas of agricultural activity that would employ
           farmworkers. There is a relatively small, active agricultural industry in Nevada County,
           which might employ a small number of Grass Valley residents. The small number of
           farmworkers that reside in the Grass Valley area are likely to be year-round residents.
           For this reason, the City believes there is no need for seasonal shelter to house migrant
           farm labor. The housing needs of any farmworkers that do reside in Grass Valley can be
           addressed primarily through the provision of permanent affordable housing, rather than
           migrant farm labor camps. Their housing need would be the same as other lower-
           income households.
4.      Female-Headed, Single-Parent Households
           Single-parent households with children often require special consideration and
           assistance because of their greater need for affordable housing, accessible day care,
           health care, and a variety of other supportive services. Single-parent households often
           receive unequal treatment in the rental housing market due to their family status.
           Female-headed single-parent households, in particular, face challenges in finding
           affordable housing that is accessible to employment and services due to their relatively
           lower household incomes and childcare needs.
           In 2012, Grass Valley had572 single-parent households headed by females, of which, 32
           percent of the City’s female-headed families with children lived in poverty, compared to
           19 percent of all families with children. The median income for female-headed
           households with children was $20,144, compared to $41,741 for married-couple families.
           Battered women with children comprise a sub-group of female-headed households that
           are especially in need. In the Grass Valley area, there are a number of social service
           providers and emergency housing facilities serving women in need, including Battered
           Woman’s Alliance, Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Coalition, and the Salvation
           Army.
5.      Large Households
           Large households are those with five or more members. These households constitute a
           special needs group because of an often-limited supply of adequately sized, affordable
           housing units. Rising housing costs sometimes force families and/or extended families
           to live together under one roof. The HCD Data Package reported 324 large households
           in Grass Valley, 91 percent of which were renter households. Large households
           represent six percent of the City’s households.
           Larger units with more bedrooms could meet the housing needs of large households.
           Because larger units typically cost more, lower-income large households may reside in
           smaller units, likely resulting in overcrowding. To help address overcrowding, Grass
           Valley and Nevada County are working to develop housing opportunities for larger
           households to relieve overcrowding and are promoting affordable ownership housing
           opportunities (such as first-time homebuyer and self-help housing programs) to help
           renters achieve homeownership.

6.      Homeless
           Most individuals and families become homeless because they are unable to afford
           housing in a particular community and/or unable to care for themselves. Beyond the
           need for housing, homeless individuals are likely to have other needs, such as support
           services, life skills training, medical care, and education or job skills training. Nationwide,
           about half of those experiencing homelessness over the course of a year are single
           adults. Most enter and exit the system quickly. The remainder of homeless individuals
           lives in the homeless assistance system, or in a combination of shelters, hospitals, the
           streets, jails, and prisons. There are also single homeless people who are not adults,
           including runaway and “throwaway” youth (children whose parents will not allow them to
           live at home or are unable to care for them).
           In 2006, Hospitality House established a seasonal welcome center and shelter program
           for the homeless. The welcome center acts as a receiving center for the homeless.
           Guests check into the center, and then receive bus transportation to local churches for
           meals and overnight accommodations.              During the 2007-2008 season, Hospitality
           House provided shelter to an average of 25 guests per day. In 2012, Hospitality House
           opened a 54-bed permanent shelter in Grass Valley.
           Through donations from various private sources, the Emergency Assistance Coalition
           (EAC) operates a program that provides lodging, food, and gas on an emergency basis.
           Local offices of the United Way and the Salvation Army operate in Grass Valley and
           work in conjunction with the EAC. The homeless population in Grass Valley that
           frequents the EAC program is generally either local or transient single people and/or
           families. The EAC reports approximately 14 people contact them each week with
           various housing, food, or other needs. Once EAC provides the client’s immediate needs
           of food and shelter, it refers individuals to the Nevada County Human Services Agency
           in Nevada City.
           There are several other programs operating in Grass Valley that assist women who are
           victims of domestic violence. An example is the Manzanita Family Center, a facility that
           provides assistance for homeless women with children. Clients of this facility are placed
           through the Nevada County Human Services Agency and are not necessarily victims of
           domestic violence.
           The Food Bank of Nevada County makes monthly food deliveries to four locations
           throughout the county, including Penn Valley, North San Juan, Washington, and Grass
           Valley. Clients of the Food Bank program are generally scheduled on a monthly basis,
           but can receive food donations in the event of an emergency need as well. The program
           serves over 1,500 clients each month from throughout Nevada County. The United
           States Department of Agriculture funds this program, therefore; clients are required to
           meet the federal poverty standards in order to receive food donations.
           In January 2009, Hospitality House conducted a survey for homeless population for the
           County. The survey identified approximately 270 homeless persons in Western Nevada
           County. Based on HUD standards, Hospitality House believes there are approximately
           500 homeless people in the County. Based on an incentive-based survey (which
           included a homeless court, food, clothing, haircuts, flu shots) conducted by Hospitality

           House at the United Methodist Church and the field counts, they estimate there are
           approximately 100 homeless persons in the City limits of Grass Valley. The HCD Data
           Package notes that there were 508 homeless individuals and 234 persons in families in
           2012 covering both Placer and Nevada Counties. This report also notes there were 107
           chronically homeless people, of which 76 were chronically unsheltered, in both counties.
           In January 2013, Hospitality House conducted another survey and identified
           approximately 314 homeless persons in Nevada County, with most concentrated in the
           western portion of the county. Based on previous estimates, the City believes there are
           up to 120 homeless persons in City limits.
E.         Analysis of Assisted Housing Projects At-Risk
           Existing rental housing that receives governmental assistance is a significant source of
           affordable housing. The potential loss of such rental units reduces the availability of
           housing affordable to very low- and low-income households. Unless housing has
           reached a substantial level of deterioration, it is far more cost-effective to preserve
           existing affordable housing than to replace it with newly constructed units. “At-risk”
           status is determined through identification of funding programs that support the
           affordable units and the potential likelihood that the funding will be discontinued allowing
           the units to convert to market rate rents.
Loss of Assisted Housing
           Table II-28 lists assisted rental housing projects in Grass Valley. This table also
           identifies the funding source and the start of funding. In 2008, the Springhill Garden
           Apartments, Valley Commons/Commons East Apartments, Valley View Apartments, and
           Grass Valley Terrace all extended their affordability times with the sources listed in
           Table II-28. Based on the most current data from HCD and property management firms,
           there are no subsidized units listed at high risk of converting to market rate rents in
           Grass Valley over the next ten years.

    F.         Opportunities for Energy Conservation
               Energy-related housing costs can directly affect the affordability of housing.
               Homebuilders must comply with mandatory energy efficiency requirements, while
               localities are responsible for enforcing the energy conservation regulations. Some
               alternative energy standards include:
                     Use of passive solar construction techniques that require proper solar orientation,
                      appropriate levels of thermal mass, and south facing windows,
                     Use of higher insulation levels in place of thermal mass or energy conserving
                      window orientation, and
    Adopted September 2014                                   II-23                                II. COMMUNITY PROFILE

                 Use of active solar water heating and/or on-demand water heating system in
                  exchange for less insulation and/or energy conserving window treatments
           Other energy saving construction techniques include: 1) locating high use indoor areas
           along the south face of the building and placing corridors, closets, laundry rooms, power
           core, and garages along the north face; 2) incorporating high efficiency lighting with
           dimmer and motion lighting systems: 3) higher efficiency heating and cooling systems;
           and 4) orienting the entrance away from winds or using a windbreak to reduce the wind
           velocity against the entrance.
           Pacific Gas & Electric provides a variety of energy conservation services for residents
           and participates in several other energy assistance programs for lower income
           households, which help qualified homeowners and renters conserve energy and control
           electricity costs. These programs include the California Alternate Rates for Energy
           (CARE) Program, Family Electrical Rate Assistance (FERA) Program, and the Relief for
           Energy Assistance through Community Help (REACH) Program.
           The CARE program provides a 15 percent monthly discount on gas and electric rates to
           income-qualified households, certain non-profits, facilities housing agricultural
           employees, homeless shelters, hospices and other qualified non-profit group living
           facilities. The FERA program provides a rate reduction program for lower and middle
           income households as identified in the Federal Poverty Guidelines. It requires a
           minimum of three individuals per household and provides a rate reduction on electric
           rates. The REACH program provides one-time energy assistance to customers who
           have no other way to pay their energy bill. The intent of REACH is to assist low-income
           customers, particularly the elderly, disabled, sick, working poor, and the unemployed,
           who experience severe hardships and are unable to pay for their energy needs.
           The State of California provides the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program
           (LIHEAP). This program provides assistance with energy bills for eligible low-income
           households. The program includes, Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP), which
           provides direct payment of eligible client’s utility bills and free energy efficiency upgrades
           for weatherization of households of low-income families. The Energy Crisis Intervention
           Program (ECIP) provides assistance to low-income households that have received a 24-
           or 48-hour disconnect notices or service termination, or when an energy-related crisis of
           life-threatening emergency exists in the applicant’s household.
           Grass Valley’s General Plan contains policies in the Conservation/Open Space Element
           and the Recreation Element to implement circulation/transportation measures designed
           to reduce reliance on the automobile and to provide non-motorized linkages between
           parks and open spaces. By encouraging an emphasis on pedestrian uses in all
           development within Grass Valley, reduction of the reliance on motorized vehicles will
           occur, which will also result in reduced energy consumption.
           The City’s Development Code includes the following examples of energy conservation
           measures: energy efficient exterior lights, irrigation efficiency for water and energy
           savings, solar access and landscaping, and energy conservation in the layout of
           subdivisions. The Design Guidelines include provisions that require new developments
           to incorporate energy conservation measures where possible. In 2013, the City Council
           adopted new Housing Rehabilitation Guidelines. One new provision is a weatherization

G. Future Housing Needs
           The Sierra Planning Organization, based on information provided by the state,
           determines the amount of affordable housing assigned to Nevada County for the
           planning period. It then divides the total number of housing among its participating
           jurisdictions. The 2014-2019 Regional Housing Need Plan adopted by the Sierra
           Planning Organization allocates 530 housing units to the City of Grass Valley. This
           represents the number of housing units the City is responsible for accommodating during
           this planning period. Table II-29 shows the number and percentage of housing units
           identified in the Regional Housing Needs Allocation Plan for Grass Valley for the
           planning period of 2014 through 2019 by income category. The plan identifies 210 units,
           approximately 40 percent, to be affordable to very low- and low-income households.
           The above-moderate income category represents the greatest need for Grass Valley’s
           total share of regional housing (220 units, 41.7%).
           Grass Valley is not responsible for actual construction of these units. However, Grass
           Valley is responsible for creating a regulatory environment that can accommodate these
           housing units. This includes the creation, adoption, and implementation of general plan
           policies, zoning code policies, and/or economic incentives to encourage the construction
           of these kinds of units.

Housing Needs For Extremely Low Income Households
           In 2011, approximately 1,733 extremely low-income households (ELI), defined as
           households with income less than 30 percent of the area median income, resided in
           Grass Valley. This represents approximately 28 percent of the total households.
           Approximately 70 percent of these households are renters with 86 percent of those
           experiencing housing problems (defined as cost burden greater than 30 percent of
           income and/or overcrowding and/or without complete kitchen or plumbing). Over 80% of
           the total ELI households paid more than 30% of their income toward housing costs. See
           Table II-30. As noted in Table II-30, the City assumed 50 percent, or 61, of its very-low
           income regional housing need are ELI households.
Adopted September 2014                                      II-25                                 II. COMMUNITY PROFILE

           As it relates to potential opportunities for ELI housing in the City, the new Development
           Code includes provisions for live-work units, second units, carriage houses, and mixed-
           use projects. More importantly, the City has no regulations limiting the number of
           bedrooms in any of its residential zones. Therefore, the City allows single-room
           occupancy units. Several high-density projects in the City include one-bedroom units.
           Though not set aside for the ELI, the Wolf Creek Village project includes three studio
           units and eight, one-bedroom, one-bath units, with shared cooking facilities. Additionally,
           the Cedar Park and Glenbrook Apartments include one-bedroom units. To provide
           additional support for the housing needs for ELI households, this element includes a
           program to continue to collaborate with nonprofit builders who specialize in building
           housing for extremely low-income households.             Finally, most of the City’s zoning
           districts allow transitional and supportive housing which can be used to accommodate
           ELI households.

III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
A.         Available Land to Accommodate Housing
           As a part of the Housing Element update process, City staff inventoried all lands within
           the City limits suitable for future residential development. State law requires that the
           community provide an adequate number of sites to allow for and facilitate production of
           the City’s regional share of housing. To determine whether the City has sufficient land to
           accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income groups, the City must
           identify “adequate sites.” Under state law (California Government Code section
           65583[c][1]), adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and development
           standards, with services and facilities, needed to facilitate and encourage the
           development of a variety of housing for all income levels. The California Department of
           Housing and Community Development’s website includes information on inventory and
           analysis of lands suitable for residential development. Specifically, the Building Blocks
           for Effective Housing Elements page states that:
               The land inventory must identify specific sites suitable for the development of
               housing within the planning period and that are sufficient to accommodate the
               jurisdictions share of the regional housing need for all income levels. Land
               suitable for residential development includes vacant sites zoned for residential
               use, vacant sites zoned for nonresidential use that allow residential
               development, underutilized residential sites capable of being developed at a
               higher density, and sites zoned for nonresidential use that can be redeveloped
               for, and as necessary, rezoned for, residential use.
               To analyze the suitability of identified sites, the element must include an
               estimate of realistic capacity, demonstrate zoning and densities, which
               encourage and facilitate the development of housing for lower-income
               households, and demonstrate non-vacant sites identified to accommodate the
               jurisdictions’ regional housing need can be realistically developed within the
               planning period. The analysis must also analyze the suitability of the sites
               relative to environmental conditions or issues, and include a general description
               of the public infrastructure necessary to serve housing development.
           Residential sites identified in this chapter meet the criteria listed above, and are within
           the definition of “adequate sites,” as provided under State law. The sites identified in
           Table III-1 are adjacent to public facilities, or have access to them over the next five
           years. As Table III-1 indicates, there are more than 1928 acres of residentially zoned
           vacant land within the existing City limits, with a maximum potential yield of 1,384
           dwelling units. Additionally, there are 583 acres of non-residentially zoned land, or for
           mixed-use (Loma Rica Specific Plan) that could accommodate as many as 2,410
           dwelling units. Based on the following analysis, there is adequate capacity to

                                                                       GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           accommodate over 1,883 dwelling units in the City. Appendix A includes a detailed
           inventory, by parcel number, of each of the vacant parcels. As described in the following
           analysis, the City believes there is adequately zoned land to accommodate the City’s
           housing needs to 2019. Overall, the City used conservative capacity assumptions, and
           with the anticipated annexations, which demonstrates there is ample vacant sites
           available to meet the City’s housing needs.
           Residential Zones: The R-3 and NG-3 properties have the greatest potential to
           accommodate housing affordable to extremely low-, very low-, and low-income
           households. Of the properties zoned for residential, nearly 34 acres are zoned R-3 or
           NG-3. Fourteen of these properties are more than one acre in size and can realistically
           (developed at the mid-range of 14 d.u./acre) accommodate 475 dwelling units. Housing
           Element Implementation Program 1.f, which requires developers to achieve at least the
           mid-range density on R-3 lots, supports this assumption. The City believes the mid-
           range assumption is reasonable because it has achieved high-density residential
           development on both smaller and larger lots. Specifically, the Pleasant Street Village
           project included seven apartment units on a 0.36 acre infill lot (19 d.u./acre). The City
           approved the Gold Country Village project for 120 affordable senior units on 5.4 acres
           (22.2 d.u./acre with 12 density bonus units). Both of these projects complied with the
           City’s land use controls; therefore, this demonstrates developers can achieve the
           maximum housing unit capacity. Another recent example of an infill project zoned R-3
           constructed on a small lot is at 305 North Church Street. In 2008, the applicant
           constructed four units on this 0.25 acre parcel (16 d.u./acre), which contained significant
           topography and access constraints.
           Besides the actual examples noted above, the City’s General Plan Policies, listed in
           Table I-1, provide further support in the City’s confidence in the housing unit potential
           listed in Table III-1. Land Use Policies 5-LUP, 6-LUP, 7-LUP, 8-LUP, 9-LUP, and 23-
           LUP all support infill development. All the NG-3 and R-3 parcels listed in Appendix A
           that are less than 1 acre in size are infill lots. Additionally, public water, sewer, and other
           infrastructure are adjacent to each of these smaller lots. Since the City’s density range
           allows up to 20 dwelling units per acre, the City is consistent with AB 2348’s default
           density standard of 15 d.u./acre for lower-income households. Based on the above, the
           City believes 14 units per acre is a conservative and realistic assumption for unit
           capacity in the R-3 and NG-3 zones. Therefore, the existing inventory of vacant land
           zoned NG-2 and R-3 provides adequate capacity to meet the housing needs for lower
           incomes.
           The City has approximately 136 acres of vacant land zoned as R-1 and NG-2. Table III-
           1 assumes a unit capacity of 2.5 d.u./acre; therefore establishing a realistic
           accommodation of 340 units. Based on approved projects over the past Housing
           Element cycle, the City expects these zones to provide housing for the moderate to
           above-moderate income levels. It is important to note the City has approved three
           projects in the R-1 zone under the density bonus program. Ridge Village, Ridge
           Meadows, and Iris Lane projects included density bonuses, which resulted in densities of
           5.7, 4.9, and 4.56 respectively. All of these projects exceed the maximum density range
           of 4 d.u./acre. The only other recently approved project in these zones is the Marshall
           Street project. This project had steep slopes and included four units on 1.79 acres,
           resulting in a density of 2.23 d.u./acre.              Table III-1 includes several larger
Adopted September 2014                                III-2                       III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                          GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           underdeveloped parcels. These parcels contain one single family home and are
           expected to be developed at higher densities based on pending applications and/or
           property owner discussions with the City. Based on the above, the City believes 2.5
           units per acre is a conservative and realistic assumption for unit capacity in the R-1 and
           NG-2 zones.
           There are 19 acres of vacant R-2 or R-2A zoned land in the City. The City assumes a
           capacity of 6 d.u./acre in these zones which results in 114 likely units. The only example
           of an approved project in the R-2 zone is Makiah Woods which included 55 dwelling
           units on 9.25 acres (5.95 d.u./acre). This parcel contains some topographical and
           biological constraints which somewhat limited the density, but still allowed for density at
           mid-range. Based on the above, the City believes six (6) units per acre is a conservative
           and realistic assumption for unit capacity in the R-2 and R-2A zones.
           The potential density in the R-1-X and SP4-G & I zones is based on remaining vacant,
           but approved, subdivision parcels. The City included two of the Special Development
           Areas, which are not in the City because we anticipate the annexation of these projects
           within the next five years. The City is currently processing these projects and preparing
           the Environmental Impact Reports.
           Underdeveloped Residential Parcels: Table III-1 includes 10 residential underdeveloped
           (non-vacant) lots that range in size from 1.58 to 7.56 acres (see Appendix A for the
           specific parcels). These lots have only one existing dwelling unit and the City expects
           these lots to develop to their full potential. The City bases this assumption on actual
           approved residential development projects on some of the parcels, or based on
           discussions with the property owners. All of these sites have available infrastructure.
           Therefore, all of these lots have a realistic potential for development within the planning
           period.
           Non-Residential Zones: Of the non-residentially zoned properties, the City estimated a
           realistic residential capacity based on recent mixed-use projects constructed or
           approved by the City. This is particularly true in the NC-Flex and C-2 zones where the
           City has approved several purely residential or mixed-use projects. Overall, the City has
           approved 229 dwelling units on 37 acres of non-residentially zoned land since 2003.
           Examples are (see pages III-23 and 24 for more details):
                 Village at South Auburn: a 10.87-acre mixed-use project containing 57 dwelling
                  units, zoned NC-Flex.
                 Renaissance Project: a 0.21-acre mixed-use project containing 4 dwelling units,
                  zoned NC-Flex.

                 WCS Mullins, a 0.67-acre mixed-use project containing 12 dwelling units, zoned TC.
                 Habitat for Humanity off Joyce Drive, a 1.68-acre project containing 16 dwelling
                  units, zoned NC-Flex.
           Mixed-use projects approved by the City include some reduced development standards
           (setbacks, open space requirements, parking reduction). The City approved most of
           these projects with a Planned Unit Development (PUD) or Use Permit to allow flexible
           project design. Since the NC-Flex zone is located in areas of existing mixed-use
           environments (predominately residential), plus some of the corresponding General Plan
           designations include Urban Medium and High Density properties, there is a higher
           probability that housing will be developed on these properties. The above list showing
           the projects in the NC-Flex zone attests to this fact. Therefore, it is reasonable to
           achieve a capacity of 6 dwelling units per acre on the NC-Flex zone. Even, though the
           City has a history of permitting residential projects in the non-residentially zoned
           properties, the City applied the lowest potential residential density to these remaining
           non-residentially zoned lands.
           The City did not include properties within the Whispering Pines Specific Plan, zoned
           SP1-A, SP-1B, or SP-1C, because this is an established business park. Even though
           the specific plan allows medium density residential development, the City did not assign
           any residential capacity to this area because there are no established examples in this
           plan area.
           Recent and Potential Annexations: In 2012, the City approved a large annexation
           application within its sphere of influence. This plan was approved by LAFCo and
           became part of the City in 2013. The Loma Rica Ranch Specific Plan allows up to 700
           residential units, which includes a full range of housing types and sizes; such as,
           live/work units, multi-family units, second units, workforce housing, and affordable senior
           units. In 2014, the City also approved the Southern Sphere of Influence Planning and
           Annexation project. This plan amended the General Plan and prezoned about 60 acres
           of land for medium density residential in the southern sphere of influence. The City’s
           sphere of influence plan includes an additional several hundred acres that are eligible for
           annexation during this housing element’s planning period (see Figure III-2). Much of this
           land is designated for residential development. Even though the City expects
           annexation of some of this land, the City does not assume this in its analysis since there
           are no other pending applications as of the writing of this element.

B. Funding and Administrative Resources
           The Grass Valley area has a variety of resources available to landowners and
           developers seeking to provide housing within the community. This chapter provides the
           programs and resources available within the City for use with residential developments.
           Resources are grouped under local providers, private nonprofit agencies, and state or
           federal programs. Table III-2 includes a full listing of financial resources available to
           assist in the production, preservation, and maintenance of housing.
1.         Local
           Nevada County Housing Authority
           The Nevada County Housing Authority administers various affordable housing programs,
           including the Section 8 rental assistance program for the entire County. As of May 2014,
           298 Nevada County households were receiving tenant-based Section 8 assistance from
           the Housing Authority. Approximately another 800 additional households were on the
           waiting list to receive vouchers. 1 Housing Authority records do not indicate how many
           of these vouchers are used by households residing in the City, and there are no other
           means available to determine the exact number of Section 8 vouchers used in Grass
           Valley. In addition, the Housing Authority manages the Mortgage Credit Certificate
           Program and CDBG funds, which may be used to assist housing in both the
           unincorporated county and in Grass Valley.
           Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside Funds
           In early 2012, the State of California required all Redevelopment Agencies in the state to
           dissolve. Though used very effectively by the City of Grass Valley to assist with
           affordable housing, the state removed this valuable tool.
           Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Compliance
           Federal law requires that lending institutions reinvest in their communities. Such
           reinvestment is often done in the form of low-income loans for housing construction or
           rehabilitation, participation in activities of the Redevelopment Agency, or other
           investment in housing. The City may seek to establish programs for financing of
           construction or lending for home purchase to help lending institutions to meet their
           requirements under CRA.
2.         Private Nonprofit
           Habitat for Humanity
           Habitat for Humanity is a non-profit, ecumenical, grassroots organization dedicated to
           providing affordable homeownership opportunities lower and very low income families.

           community, volunteers, and partner families to fund, build, repair, and rehabilitate homes.
           Habitat sells homes to qualified partner families at no profit with affordable, no-interest
           loans. Volunteers provide most of the labor and land and infrastructure costs have been
           manageable through assistance from state (HCD, CalHOME), and local (RDA) funding.
           Since 2007, Habitat for Humanity provided 15 affordable homeownership opportunities
           (14 new and 1 rehabilitated) in Grass Valley.
           Mercy Housing California (MHC)
           MHC is a non-profit developer that develops affordable housing for families, seniors,
           formerly homeless persons, individuals with HIV/AIDS and persons with chronic mental
           illnesses and physical impairments. With the assistance of public and private funding,
           MHC builds or rehabilitates housing to meet community needs. The types of housing
           developed include multi-unit rental apartments and single-family homes, single room
           occupancy apartments for formerly homeless adults, and handicap-accessible units for
           individuals with physical impairments. Since merging with the Rural California Housing
           Corporation (RCHC) in 2000, the activities of this group have expanded to include
           preservation of at-risk units, coordination of self-help housing development, and
           redevelopment of substandard housing.
           Foundation of Resources for Equality and Employment for Disabled
           (FREED)
           FREED is a non-profit resource agency that provides referrals to the elderly for various
           housing assistance programs. In addition to referrals, FREED offers loans for small

           increased knowledge of housing issues for the disabled.
           Nevada County Housing Development Corporation
           The Nevada County Housing Development Corporation is a non-profit developer of self-
           help housing, transitional living facilities, and emergency shelters. The State of
           California certifies this group as a Community Housing Development Organization
           (CHDO). This group is active in production of housing and shelter services in the Grass
           Valley area. This non-profit facilitated the construction of 30 self-help homes in the City
           in the 1980s, and operates an emergency shelter within the Sphere of Influence.
3.         State/Federal
           Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Funds
           The CDBG program provides funds for a range of community development activities.
           The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) administers
           CDBG funds through a variety of competitive and non-competitive programs. These
           programs can provide funding for a range of activities. The eligible activities include, but
           are not limited to acquisition and/or disposition of real estate or property, public facilities
           and improvements, relocation, rehabilitation and construction of housing,

           homeownership assistance, and also clearance activities. Funding levels for individual
           programs can vary by year, and decisions to pursue funding for each program are made
           by staff based on potential projects and perceived competitive advantages.
           HOME Investment Partnership Program Funds (HOME)
           Federal HOME funds can be used for activities that promote affordable rental housing
           and homeownership for lower-income households. HCD administers HOME funds
           through a variety of competitive and non-competitive programs. Activities eligible to
           receive HOME funds include building acquisition, new construction, reconstruction,
           moderate or substantial rehabilitation, first-time homebuyer assistance, and tenant-
           based assistance. A federal priority for the use of HOME funds is preservation of the at-
           risk housing stock. As with CDBG funds, funding levels for individual programs can vary
           by year, and the City makes decisions to pursue funding for each program based on
           potential projects and perceived competitive advantages.

C.         Constraints
1.         Governmental Constraints
A.         Overview
           Local policies and regulations can affect the price and availability of housing and, in
           particular, the provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement
           requirements, fees and exactions, permit processing procedures, and other factors may
           constrain the maintenance, development, and improvement of housing. This chapter
           discusses potential governmental constraints as well as policies that encourage housing
           development in Grass Valley.
           State and federal regulations also affect the availability of land for housing and the cost
           of producing housing. Regulations related to environmental protection, prevailing wages
           for publicly assisted construction projects, construction defect liability, building codes,
           and other topics have significant, often adverse impacts on housing cost and availability.
           Perhaps one of the greatest constraints to the production of housing affordable to lower-
           income households is the chronic shortage of state and federal financial assistance for
           such housing.
           While Grass Valley recognizes that constraints exist at other levels of government, the
           City has little or no control over these regulations and no ability to mitigate them directly.
           Since 2009, the state legislature has adopted many regulations that have significantly
           affected the costs of housing. The City is concerned that the state does not recognize
           the cumulative costs of these regulations to the cost of affordable housing. Furthermore,
           and based on the City’s past historical success, the state’s dissolution of Redevelopment
           represents on of the City’s biggest government constraints to affordable housing. This
           chapter of the Housing Element therefore, focuses only on adopted City policies and
           regulations that the City can mitigate.
B.         Land Use Policies
           In 1999, the City of Grass Valley completed an update of its General Plan, which
           contains goals, policies, and programs that will guide development throughout the Grass
           Valley planning area until the year 2020. The Land Use Element contains the primary
           policies that guide residential development. Implementation of these policies occurs
           through the City’s Development Code, which includes zoning and subdivision standards.
           Zoning regulations establish the amount and distribution of different land uses within the
           City, while subdivision regulations establish requirements for the division and
           improvement of land.
           The Land Use Element of the Grass Valley General Plan contains four residential land
           use categories: urban estate density, urban low density, urban medium density, and
           urban high density. Each land use designation permits a variety of housing types and
           densities for residential development. Two additional land use designations provide for
           development that would include a mixture of residential and commercial land uses of
Adopted September 2014                               III-13                     III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                       GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

                   varying densities. These land use designations are the Corporate Business Park (CBP)
                   overlay and the Special Development Area (SDA).
                   In 2007, the City adopted a Development Code for these general plan categories that
                   include seven primary residential zones and nine non-residential zones that allow
                   residences or residential related uses. Table III-3 summarizes the General Plan land
                   use categories and corresponding residential zones.

                                                                           GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019
           i.          Special Development Areas
           The City of Grass Valley’s General Plan includes four areas that are designated Special
           Development areas, as seen in Figure III-3. Three of the SDAs include residential
           components, while the third does not specify a land use mix. The SDAs are:
                      Loma Rica Ranch (Annexed to City in 2013, 700 dwelling units)
                      North Star (363 housing units)
                      Kenny Ranch (100 housing units)
                      Bear River Mill Site (no specific land use mix established)
           Development within the Special Development Areas (SDA) is encouraged to be clustered or
           grouped to assist in the reduction of infrastructure development costs, which is further
           addressed by several policies in the City’s 1999 General Plan. The Loma Rica Ranch project
           was annexed to the City in 2013 and is approved for 700 dwelling units of varying density and
           sizes.
           ii.         Town Center Overlay
           The Town Center (TC) Overlay only applies to a designated area within the City, comprising
           the downtown and the surrounding areas.                 The TC overlay district encourages the
           development of mixed land uses. The Town Center overlay is not a zoning district with
           separate development standards. The TC district accommodates a variety of land uses.
           Street-level commercial, specialty shops, restaurants, upper level residential, and offices are
           encouraged in the Town Center area. The City is implementing the General Policies of the
           Town Center through the Downtown Strategic Plan and incentives for mixed-use (see Chapter
           IV, Goal A, Program 2).

           iii.        Historic Preservation
           The City’s General Plan includes a Historic Element to ensure preservation of historically
           significant structures.      This Element includes the designation of a historical district,
           encompassing the downtown area of the City, as well as goals, policies, and objectives
           addressing conservation measures for historical properties. In January 2008, the City adopted
           a Historic Building Demolition Ordinance. This ordinance applies to all buildings constructed
           prior to 1945 within the 1872 Township. It creates a procedure to monitor and potentially
           regulate all buildings proposed for demolition. In later 2008, the City adopted a Historical
           Context Report. This report addressed the City’s historical development patterns and
           architectural history. In 2009, the City completed a Historic Resources Inventory, which
           ranked the historic value of buildings. In 2011, the City adopted Design Review Guidelines for
           the 1872 Historic Townsite. In 2012, the City approved a Historic Preservation Ordinance.
           This ordinance established a review process related to changes to a historic structure. The
           City’s Historical Commission maintains a historic building inventory and promotes historic
           preservation through programs such as the Heritage Home awards.
           Alterations to buildings within the downtown Historic District are subject to review by the
           Development Review Committee (see section “F” below, Development Review Procedures).
           The time required for Development Review does not impose an additional constraint on the re-
           use or modification of existing buildings or sites because the Development Review Committee
           meets twice monthly. Projects are subject to Development Review regardless of the presence
           of historical resources. Most exterior building remodeling and new building construction within
           Grass Valley requires development review approval with the exception of single-family homes.
           The City’s review of development projects with historic significance has the potential to
           increase costs for the rehabilitation or conversion of historic buildings because of the added
           cost of maintaining the historic character of a structure in the use of materials and construction
           techniques. The City has mitigated the cost impact by confining the review process to building
           exteriors. This leaves property owners with the flexibility to make necessary modifications and
           use cost-effective construction techniques in the interior of the buildings. Furthermore,
           buildings identified as historic can take advantage of the Historic Building Code, which may
           reduce the overall costs of rehabilitation and open up grant opportunities. Additionally, historic
           preservation policies have no impact on an overwhelming majority of the City’s housing
           development since such development occurs largely outside the historic downtown.
           In order to accommodate improvements required for accessibility by persons with disabilities,
           the City allows exterior modifications of non-historic structures. Exterior improvements have
           been made to the Bret Harte Retirement Inn, Chamber of Commerce building, and City Hall
           building.
           iv.         Community Design Element
           The Community Design Element of the General Plan includes goals for project design and site
           planning. The goals are to preserve and enhance the existing community, conserve
           community attributes that provide a sense of the natural setting and continuity with the past,
           assure that new development is sensitive to and strengthens the existing built and natural
           environment, and create, maintain, and enhance civic places. New development is to respect
           the scale and intensity of adjacent older development and provide physical connections
           through streets, lanes and/or trails wherever possible so that pedestrians, bicycles,
           automobiles can safely move easily between local destinations and between work and home.
Adopted September 2014                                 III-17                        III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                             GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           Infill and reuse opportunities are important because they maximize efficient use of land and
           avoid urban intrusion on natural environment. Infill uses are to respect the pre-existing uses,
           patterns, and community aesthetics.
           As discussed above, the Development Review Committee reviews nearly all exterior building
           remodeling projects and new development projects to ensure consistency with established
           design standards. The Committee meets twice monthly and does not cause a significant
           constraint to development within the City. Sub section F, Development Permit Procedures,
           includes a discussion on design review and how the City mitigates the potential impact on
           affordable housing.
C.         Analysis of Residential Zoning Standards
           The City regulates the type, location, density, and scale of residential development primarily
           through its Development Code. Zoning regulations are designed to protect and promote the
           health, safety, and general welfare of residents as well as implement the policies of the Grass
           Valley General Plan. The Development Code, particularly with the use of the Traditional
           Community Development ones, also helps preserve the character and integrity of existing
           neighborhoods.
           Grass Valley has seven primary residential zones:
                      RE - Residential Estate
                      R-1 - Single-Family Residence District
                      R-2 – Two Family Residence District
                      R-2A – Medium Density Residential District
                      R-3 – Multiple Family District
                      NG-2 – Neighborhood General-2
                      NG-3 – Neighborhood General -3
           The City also permits residential-related land uses and residential mixed-use projects in
           several other zoning districts. These include the following:
                      TC – Town Core
                      NC – Neighborhood Center
                      NC-Flex – Neighborhood Center Flex
                      OP - Office and Professional District
                      C-1 - Community Business District
                      C-2 - Central Business District
                      C-3 - Heavy Commercial District
                      CBP - Corporate Business Park District
                      M-1 - Light Industrial District
           Even though not listed in Table III-5, the Specific Plan (SP) zone also allows any residential
           land use as specified with an adopted specific plan. Both of the City’s adopted specific plans
           allow residential uses. The Morgan Ranch Specific Plan is allows single-family detached
           homes. The Whispering Pines Specific Plan is a business park area, which allows medium
           density residential land uses. The Loma Rica Ranch Specific Plan allows for a wide of
           housing types and sizes along with mixed-use provisions.

           Table III-4 summarizes the relevant development standards in residential zones in Grass
           Valley. This table also identifies the other types of housing allowed within the different zoning
           districts. Table III-5 lists the different housing types allowed within the non-residential zones.

                                                                                                                                           GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           i.          Standards Affecting Residential Density
           The City of Grass Valley has extensive history related to the California gold rush in 1849. This
           resulted in a large percentage of the City being planned and/or developed prior to the advent
           of regulatory standards and procedures that city residents now take for granted. There are
           several residential neighborhoods containing small miner’s cottages, large Victorian homes,
           Tudor and Craftsman style bungalows, and small Victorian cottages.
           Residential Density
           As shown in Table III-5, the City’s residential densities range from one to 20 dwelling units per
           acre. The lowest density zoning is Residential Estate. The higher density residential zoning
           designations are not specifically for multi-family uses but can include single-family dwelling
           units as well. The City encourages multi-family developments to be scattered throughout the
           community, with decreasing intensity as distance from commercial core increases. The City
           requires all new development within city boundaries to respect the existing design and pattern
           of development.
           Historically, the City has accommodated the development of affordable housing within the R-3
           residential zoning district, which allows for the development of the maximum 20 units per acre.
           With density bonuses, R-2A and R-3 densities are adequate to facilitate the production of
           affordable housing. In cases where project density may be constrained by environmental or
           other factors, the City has allowed developers to cluster dwelling units on the unconstrained
           portion of a site and/or exceed the height limit to achieve a feasible project density. An
           example of the City’s flexibility in implementing zoning standards is the Glenbrook Apartments,
           in which the City permitted three-story buildings to achieve a project feasible density as a
           portion of the site was constrained by slope, power lines, and other factors.
           The following are examples of residential projects that include affordable housing units or
           mixed-use housing developments either approved, under construction, or completed since
           2003:

                       senior apartment project and the project will receive Tax Credits for construction.
           Density Bonus Program
           A density bonus program is also available to developers who wish to provide affordable
           housing to the City’s residents. Chapter 17.32 of the Development Code establishes the basic
           provisions of the density bonus program. This chapter specifies the range of allowed density
           bonuses allowed based on the number of affordable housing units provided by the developer.
           It also identifies the number and types of incentives or concessions the City shall grant as part
           of this program. This chapter also includes sections on the continued availability and resale of
           affordable housing units. The intent of these sections is to maintain the continued affordability
           of the housing units.
           The program requires an agreement between the developer and the City pursuant to
           Government Code Section 65915. A developer can initiate a request for a density bonus and
           incentives though a Use Permit. The City Council, upon a recommendation from the Planning
           Commission, approves the agreement and the type of incentives. Since 2007, the City has
           approved three projects with density bonuses (Ridge Meadows and Ridge Village subdivisions,
           and the Iris Lane subdivision project).
           Yards and Setbacks
           Table III-5 shows yard and setback requirements established in the Development Code. They
           vary by zoning district and density of residential development. Front yard setbacks in
           residential zoning districts are required to be 15 feet with the exception of the RE zone, which
           requires a larger 50-foot setback. In 2007, the City reduced the front- and rear-yard setback
           standards in most of the residential zones. The Development Code does not regulate front
           yard setbacks in commercial zones, except in the O-P and NC-Flex zoning districts, which has
           15 and 12-foot front yard setbacks, respectively. Side yard setbacks are five feet within
           residential zones. Side and rear yard setbacks are generally dependent on adjacent land uses
           within the non-residential zones.
           The previous Housing Element noted the required front yard setback could present a
           constraint to housing development on sites with odd configurations, such a shallow, but wide
           property. Since the 2003-2009 Housing Element cycle, the City has taken steps to reduce
           front and rear yard setbacks in most zoning districts. To protect the residential character of
           Grass Valley, the Development Code expressly prohibits garages and or parking spaces within
Adopted September 2014                                   III-24                         III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                                GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           a required setback area. The Code allows the projection of structures such as eaves, cornices,
           fireplaces, uncovered porches, and stairways into the required yard area. Additionally, the
           new Development Code created a Minor Variance procedure to allow minor reductions in
           development standards though a staff approval process.
           Lot Size
           The previous Zoning Code established a minimum lot size for all residential zones at 10,000
           square feet. As demonstrated in Table III-5, the minimum lot sizes in the R-1 and R-2 districts
           are now 6,000 square feet and 5,000 square feet respectively. Smaller lots of record that do
           not meet minimum lot area or width requirements may be developed if created before the
           present zoning standards for lot size were adopted by the City. The City’s Planned
           Development (PD) permit process (see section v below) is available in areas in which smaller
           lots and other alternative lot configurations are appropriate to mitigate the potential cost
           constraint posed by the City’s minimum lot requirements. The PD permit process allows
           smaller minimum lot sizes. Additionally, the new Development Code created a Minor Variance
           procedure to allow minor reductions in development standards though a staff approval process.
           Building Coverage
           The City imposes reasonable limits on building coverage. In the R-1, R-2 and R-3 zones,
           structures and pavement may cover 50 percent of the lot. The City increased the lot coverage
           maximum in the R-1 zone from 35% from the previous code. The City is not aware of
           constraints created on residential development from past or current lot coverage requirements.
           It is unlikely that additional building coverage would be necessary to achieve a density of eight
           to 20 dwelling units per acre, plus a 25 percent density bonus for affordable housing, in the R-
           2 and R-3 zones. Additionally, the new Development Code created a Minor Variance
           procedure to allow minor reductions in development standards though a staff approval process.
           Building Height
           The City’s height limits do not constrain a property owner’s ability to achieve maximum
           densities allowed under the City’s General Plan because the zoning standards for most of the
           residential districts allow building heights up to 35 feet, or two stories. Two story buildings are
           sufficient, in combination with the maximum permitted building coverage, to achieve between 8
           and 20 dwelling units per acre, plus density bonuses for affordable housing. When site
           conditions constrain development on a portion of a lot, the City may provide an exception to
           the height limit to allow for three-story development, as was the case with the Glenbrook
           Apartment project.
           Occupancy Standards
           Grass Valley does not regulate occupancy of residential units or distinguish between related
           and unrelated individuals as a permitted residential use. Permitted uses in residential zones
           include single-family, two-family, and multiple families. The City’s does not define or limit the
           amount of persons that can live within a given dwelling unit. Occupancy standards do not
           constrain the development of housing in Grass Valley.
           Cumulative Zoning
           All the residential districts allow lower density residential development. This means that
           property owners within R-2, R2A, and R-3 zones are not required to develop multi-family
Adopted September 2014                                   III-25                       III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                              GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           housing. While the allowance of single-family residential units on smaller, infill parcels is ideal,
           it presents a potentially cumulative constraint upon high-density housing development. Since
           2003, the City has not experienced any significant examples where this scenario has taken
           place. Habitat for Humanity developed small single-family lot subdivision on an R-3 zoned
           property on Ivy Street and 16 small homes off Joyce Drive. All of these units are available for
           very-low income residents, which meets the goals of the Housing Element.
           ii.         Parking Standards
           Parking Ratios
           Off-street parking requirements vary by housing type and the zone in which a property is
           located. Two spaces per dwelling unit are required within the RE, R-1, and R-2 zones. The
           NC-Flex, NG-2 and NG-3 zones require one parking space per units. Multi-family housing,
           generally found in the R-2-A and R-3 zones, requires 1.5 off-street parking spaces for a single
           bedroom apartment and 2.5 spaces for each 2 bedroom of larger (both of these numbers
           include guest parking). Required parking for residential care facilities is one space for two
           units, plus one space for each four units for guests. Parking for senior housing projects is one
           space for each unit plus one space for each ten units for guests. These parking ratios are
           reasonable in relation to the likely demand resulting from different residential uses. For most
           types of housing, these ratios do not act as a constraint to achieving residential densities
           otherwise permitted by the City’s parking standards, except, potentially on some small, infill
           lots. The City has not received any indication from housing developers that the parking
           standards create constraints for their projects.
           The City modified parking ratios prior to the 2009-2014 last Housing Element update process.
           Many of the ratios have been reduced, particularly in the form-based districts where the
           previous standards may have constrained infill development opportunities. Section 17.36.080
           provides a process to reduce parking standards with a minor use permit or use permit.
           Location of Parking
           The City requires all parking be located on the same lot as the main building or structure. A
           minor use permit may be obtained for off-street parking on a separate lot as long as the lot is
           within 300 feet of the main building or structure. In addition to the above requirements,
           adjacent landowners can enter into a reciprocal parking easement, which provides for all of the
           required off-street parking to be located on one or the other lot.
           Parking Improvement Standards
           Parking may be uncovered or covered. The carport or garage associated with covered
           parking is required to compliment the main structure and conform to all applicable building
           codes. The Development Code includes parking standards for landscaping, parking space
           dimensions, drive aisle, pavement and drainage, and access. These standards are the
           minimum necessary to provide safe access and maneuverability. The landscape standards
           provide for buffering from adjacent land uses that may affect a residential use, and shade
           requirements to provide heat reduction and additional aesthetic value. Therefore, these
           standards are not considered a constraint to housing production.
Adopted September 2014                                 III-26                         III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                              GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           Parking Reductions
           Developers may substitute automobile parking with motorcycle parking at a rate of one
           motorcycle space for each 25 auto spaces. Additionally, eight bicycle parking spaces equate
           to on auto space. Section 17.36.080 provides a process to reduce parking standards with a
           minor use permit or use permit.
           iii.        Housing Types and Shelter Alternatives
           Housing Element law specifies that jurisdictions must identify adequate sites through
           appropriate zoning and development standards to encourage the development of various
           types of housing for all economic segments of the population. This includes single-family
           housing, multiple family housing, manufactured housing, mobile homes, emergency shelters,
           and transitional housing, among others.
           Secondary Living Units
           A secondary living unit (or second unit) is a separate dwelling unit that provides complete,
           independent living facilities for one or more persons. Grass Valley permits both attached
           and/or detached secondary living units in all of the residential zoning districts. Most of the
           non-residential zones allow second units with a use permit. The Development Code includes
           the development standards for second units. Some of the standards include:
                      Detached units must be separated from the main residence by at least ten feet,
                      Lots must be a minimum of 8,000 square feet (previous code required 10,000 sq. ft.
                       minimum),
                      Second unit cannot exceed 800 square feet or 25% of the floor area of the primary unit,
                      Separate kitchen and restroom facilities must be located within the unit, and
                      One off-street parking space is required per unit, unless the secondary unit contains
                       more than one bedroom, then two parking spaces are required
           The parking requirement for secondary units with two bedrooms could pose a constraint to the
           development of secondary units with two bedrooms on small lots. In general, the City’s
           parking requirement for a two-bedroom unit does not pose a significant constraint to the
           development of second units because secondary units are not intended to be a source of
           family housing. The City does not anticipate that many property owners would propose to
           construct two-bedroom second units. Additionally, the new Development Code created a
           Minor Variance procedure to allow minor reductions in development standards though a staff
           approval process.
           Group Care Homes
           Grass Valley permits residential care facilities such as convalescent and rest homes (defined
           in the Development Code as a Medical Services – Extended Care) within all of its residential
           zoning districts pending the issuance of a use permit. These facilities are also allowable uses,
           subject to use permit requirements, within most of the non-residential zones.                         The
           Development Code defines a residential care use as a single dwelling or multi-unit facility that
           provides 24-hour non-medical care of unrelated persons. Residential care facilities for six or
           fewer persons are permitted within all the residential zones, and in most of the non-residential
           zones. Residential care facilities for seven or more persons are allowed within all of the
           residential zoning districts and most of the non-residential zones, subject to compliance with a
Adopted September 2014                                   III-27                        III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                               GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           use permit. The City permits day care centers for adults or children in the T-C, OP, and C-3
           zoning districts, and allows with a use permit in most of residential and other non-residential
           zones.
           The City permits accessory uses such as wheelchair ramps within all residential zones as
           incidental structures related to the residence. Building procedures within the City are also
           required to conform to the California Building Code, as adopted by Title 15 of the City’s
           municipal code. Standards within the Code include provisions to ensure accessibility for
           persons with disabilities.
           Elder Care Facilities, Group Homes, and Other Group Care Housing
           Grass Valley permits elder care facilities, defined by the Development Code as a Residential
           Care use, with six or fewer persons in all the residential zones. For facilities with seven or
           more persons, the use is subject to a use permit in the residential zones, with the exception in
           the NG-2 and NG-3 zones, which require a minor use permit. Most of the non-residential
           zones also allow these uses by either a permitted use or use subject to a use permit. Specific
           residential care housing also includes assisted living facilities, independent living
           centers/senior apartments, and life care facilities in the definition.
           Mobile Homes/Factory-Built Housing and Mobile Home Parks
           The City’s Development Code classifies mobile homes/factory-built housing as a single-family
           dwelling. Therefore, all the residential zones allow for this type of housing. The Development
           Code includes design and development standards for exterior materials, roof design and
           materials, foundations, and landscaping to assure visual compatibility with the neighborhood.
           Grass Valley’s Development Code includes a Mobile Home and Mobile Home Park Combining
           District (MH). The City uses combining zones in conjunction with base zones to address
           special concerns and afford special protections not otherwise applicable to the base district.
           The MH district allows for the development of mobile home parks within the R-1, R-2., R-2A,
           and R-3 zoning districts, subject to approval of a use permit. Density of mobile home parks
           are determined by the base-zoning district. Development standards include a fifteen-foot
           building setback from the exterior property lines and a twenty-foot setback from any right-of-
           way adjoining the park. These perimeter setbacks must be landscaped and maintained. The
           standards also include two covered parking spaces per home, plus one guest space for each
           four units, one RV parking space for each five units. Utilities must be placed underground and
           each home is required to have one 75 cubic foot storage cabinet. Additional standards include
           compliance with the City’s landscaping standards and the provision of skirting along the mobile
           homes.
           Emergency Shelters
           An emergency shelter is a facility that provides shelter to families and/or individuals on a short-
           term basis.     The City allows emergency shelters as of right in the C-3 district and by use
           permit in the C-2 and M-1 districts. Up until 2013, Hospitality House ran a seasonal
           emergency shelter program for the homeless in coordination with local churches. The
           program’s “Welcome Center” is in Grass Valley and used as the check-in center for homeless
           individuals. Each evening, a bus transports the guests to a local host church where they are
           provided with food and overnight accommodations. The following morning buses transport
           guests back to the Welcome Center and if needed provided with additional services. As part
Adopted September 2014                                 III-28                          III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                               GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           of the approval process for the Welcome Center, the City determined the overnight
           accommodations for the homeless in the local churches was an accessory use, and therefore
           permitted by right.
           In 2010, the City approved an emergency shelter for Hospitality House within an existing
           building on Golden Gate Terrace. However, this facility did not open as Hospitality House
           found a new site on Sutton Way, which the City approved in 2011. In 2014, “Utah’s Place”
           opened on Sutton Way and included 54 beds. As it pertains to available capacity to
           accommodate additional emergency shelters, there are several vacant lots as noted in the site
           inventory and underutilized lots (e.g. 690 Whiting Street) in the C-3 zone. Additionally, there
           are vacant buildings in the C-3 zone (800 and 821 South Auburn Street), which could
           accommodate an emergency shelter. There are also over twenty vacant lots and many vacant
           buildings in the C-2 and M-1 zones. Based on the City’s coordination efforts with Hospitality
           House, there appears to be adequate capacity in the City to accommodate an emergency
           shelter.
           Transitional and Supportive Housing
           Transitional housing provides shelter for people who are trying to establish residence in a
           permanent home. The Development Code was amended in 2009 to show specifically which
           zones allowed transitional and supportive housing (See Tables II-4 and III-5).
           Rooming or Boarding Houses
           Grass Valley defines rooming or boarding houses as a dwelling where lodging is furnished for
           compensation to five or more persons living independently from each other. These uses are
           allowed with a use permit in the R-1, R-2, and R-2A, and with a minor use permit in the R-3
           zone. The OP, C-1, C-2 and C-3 zones also allow the use with approval of a use permit.
           Historical District
           Figure III-4 shows the City’s Historical Combining District (H). The City uses combining zones
           in conjunction with base zones to address special concerns and afford special protections not
           otherwise applicable to the base district. The area primarily applies to the City’s historic
           commercial core. The City did expand the boundaries of the H district in 2007, but there are
           less than six primary residential units in this district. The purpose of the H district is to identify
           important cultural resource sites and structures and apply careful review to proposed changes.
           New development, or the alteration or modification to existing structures, within this combining
           zone is subject to review by the City’s Development Review Committee. In addition to the
           regular requirements of development review that are discussed later on in this document, the
           Committee considers all specifications for exterior improvements including building material,
           paint color, relationship of the development to nearby buildings, the general character of the
           Historical District, and the proposed development’s conformity with design standards
           established for the Historical District. This level of review is limited to only those properties
           within identified Historical District zoning. Given the boundaries of the area to which this
           Zoning District applies, predominately commercial properties, and that review is focused solely
           on exterior improvements, development of residential uses are not significantly constrained in
           this area.
Adopted September 2014                                  III-29                        III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                              GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           iv.         Allowances for Persons with Disabilities
           The City conducted a comprehensive review of its policies and regulations as part of the
           Housing Element update. The purpose was to determine whether zoning standards, permit
           processes, or other governmental regulations create significant constraints to reasonable
           accommodations for persons with disabilities. The City has noted the results of its analysis in
           this Chapter through the description of zoning, building, and other code standards. This
           review was part of the broader analysis of zoning standards and permit processes conducted
           for, and described in, this Housing Element. In addition, the City adopted the 2013 California
Adopted September 2014                                III-30                      III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                          GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019
           Building Standards Code, which addresses minimum standards for persons with disabilities.
           Furthermore, the City complies with Fair Housing Law.
           Grass Valley’s Development Code permits various projections into yards and setbacks. While
           the Code does not specifically identify facilities for access by persons with disabilities,
           structures such as ramps or lifts for handicapped accessibility are similar to those permitted
           projections and therefore allowed. The City approves such requests administratively unless
           the nature of the request triggers a variance or minor variance, which is unlikely. The City also
           permits accessory uses and structures that are a part of, or incidental to, the primary use on
           the property. If it were part of a residence, this would include any necessary structures that
           provide reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities. As part of the revision of the
           City’s Development Code, the City added definitions for residential care facilities and
           residential accessory uses or structures. Group homes for disabled persons can locate in all
           residential zones and most non-residential zones. The City’s Development Code does not
           contain any siting or separation requirements for residential care facilities.
           Grass Valley’s parking standards include the provision that handicapped parking is required in
           accordance with State requirements and any other applicable standards.
           As described above, Grass Valley provides a wide range of options for the location of elder
           care facilities, group homes, and institutional care facilities. The City permits residential care
           facilities and specified group care facilities in all residential zones, and within most of the non-
           residential zones. Finally, the City included FREED in all correspondences related to this
           update. FREED is actively involved in identifying constraints related to persons with
           disabilities. This organization has not noted any issues with the City’s ordinances or policies,
           which create constraints on housing for persons with disabilities.
           v.          Flexibility in Development Standards
           Grass Valley’s Development Code includes two other approaches that allow for development
           of all land use types and flexibility in development standards. These are the Planned
           Development Permit and Specific Plans.
           Planned Development Permits
           A Planned Development (PD) consists of a process that allows flexibility in the development of
           a property. The intent is to address unique property circumstances and allow innovative site
           planning. Property owners can use this tool to respond to site features, adjoining properties
           and environmental impacts. It allows the property owner to cluster residential development to
           avoid identified on-site issues while maintaining the same residential density. The Planning
           Commission is the reviewing authority for all PD applications. The previous Zoning Ordinance
           included a Planned Unit Development (PUD) process, which required a rezone. The new PD
           process removes a potential constraint by eliminating the need to rezone a parcel.
           Specific Plan Zoning
           The Specific Plan (SP) zoning provides for the preparation, adoption, and administration of
           specific plans as a means of systematically implementing the General Plan. Specific plans
           include land use designations, residential density standards, and design guidelines that direct
           development throughout the identified specific plan area. Development standards in a specific
Adopted September 2014                                   III-31                         III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                                GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           plan are not subject underlying zoning requirements but to the requirements of the adopted
           specific plan. State law establishes the basic requirements of a specific plan.
           vi.         Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels
           Grass Valley’s Development Code now includes specific regulations to address
           nonconforming uses, structures and parcels. These regulations allow residential property
           owners to continue non-conforming residential uses and to make needed repairs or alterations
           to maintain the nonconforming uses if they existed prior to the implementation of the current
           zoning standards. If the non-conforming use discontinues for a period of 12 months or more,
           all rights to legal nonconforming status shall terminate. However, the Code now allows the
           City to grant 12-month extension with a Minor Use Permit if the City finds there are unusual
           circumstances that may prevent the timely reestablishment of the use.
           The code specifically allows normal repairs or maintenance and minor expansions, including
           modifications needed for accessibility by persons with disabilities. Any substantial change to a
           nonconforming structure or use is subject to the Minor Use Permit process. Modifications to
           buildings or construction of structures, such as access ramps for accessibility by persons with
           disabilities, are not considered by the City to be an increase in nonconformity or the creation of
           a new nonconformity.
           vii.        Exceptions and Variances
           Grass Valley’s Development Code allows for the issuance of variances or minor variances for
           properties subject to special conditions related to size, topography, location, or surroundings.
           State law notes variances may be granted only when, because special circumstances apply to
           a property, that the strict application of the zoning may deprive a property owner from enjoying
           the same privileges as surrounding properties within the same zone. In 2007, the City added
           a provision in the Development Code to allow for a Minor Use Permit process. This process
           allows the City to expedite minor modifications to a development standard. This provision
           allows staff to approve a 10 to 15% deviation from the standards.
           viii.       Other Zoning Issues
           The City allows several non-residential uses in all of its residential zoning districts, subject to
           the requirements of a use permit. The Development Code allows meeting facilities, public
           facilities, parks and recreation uses, and schools within residential zones. The development of
           non-residential uses within residential zoning district could constrain the City’s ability to
           accommodate its low- and moderate-income housing needs. However, these uses are
           common in residential areas and generally considered as critical components of a sustainable
           neighborhood. Furthermore, the City has not experienced this to be an actual issue over the
           past nine years, particularly prior to 2007, when the previous zoning ordinance allowed for a
           greater range of non-residential uses.
D.         Site Improvement Standards
           Site improvements, such as streets and utilities, are necessary to serve new development.
           The City regulates improvement requirements through the subdivision or site development
           process. The City can mitigate the cost of these improvement requirements by assisting
           affordable housing developers in obtaining state and federal financing for their projects,
Adopted September 2014                                   III-32                      III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                             GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           providing density bonuses, and deferring or reducing development impact fees in exchange for
           long-term affordability of the assisted housing units.
           i.          Street Improvements
           Of all improvement standards, street improvement standards typically have the greatest
           impact on housing costs. The cost of providing streets for new residential developments, in
           turn, is primarily influenced by the required right-of-way width, pavement width, pavement
           improvement, and landscaping standards. Grass Valley’s street improvements requirements
           are shown in Table III-6.
           The City’s Circulation Element identifies three types of streets, of varying widths and levels of
           service. Grass Valley’s arterial streets typically have a right-of-way of 72 to 82 feet and
           provide service to large traffic volumes within two and sometimes four lane configurations.
           Collector streets serve a smaller traffic volume, within a two-lane configuration, and a right-of-
           way of 48, 54 or 84 feet. Local streets function as neighborhood roads, providing direct
           access to lots that are adjacent to the paved section of road. These roads have a typical right-
           of-way of 40 or 50 feet and a pavement width of 35 feet, curb to curb. The pavement width
           required by the City is the generally accepted minimum necessary to provide for one lane of
           vehicular traffic in each direction and on-street parking on each side. Since 2003, several
           developers utilized the City’s PD process to provide narrower rights-of-way and/or pavement
           widths.

           Required street improvements include curbs, gutters, and sidewalks of at least five feet in
           width.        The minimum sidewalk improvement standard is consistent with accessibility
           requirements for persons with disabilities and is not excessive in light of the need for ensuring
           minimum pedestrian access in residential areas.
           ii.         Drainage Requirements
           Grass Valley requires developers to construct all on-site storm drainage facilities including
           underground storm drain pipelines, catch basins, detention basins, and other facilities. The
           City also requires developers to pay their pro-rata share of the cost of area-wide drainage
           facilities through the collection of a drainage impact fee (see Table III-6).
           iii.        Sanitary Sewer
           The City requires developers to install sanitary sewer lines that connect to the City’s sewer
           system, except when a property is too far from an existing sewer main. Under such
           circumstances, septic systems and leach lines are allowed when conditions related to lot size
           and underlying geology are met.                   Developers providing supplemental improvements
Adopted September 2014                                        III-33                       III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                                   GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           (oversized) connections to the City’s sewer system provided by initial developers that result in
           excess capacity are eligible for reimbursement by subsequent developers.
           iv.         Water Lines
           Developers are required to install water lines that connect to either the City’s water system or
           the Nevada Irrigation District’s water system, unless site conditions and the proposed project
           permit the use of a private well. Although the City’s water system is sufficient to serve the
           projected buildout of Grass Valley, in some locations, requiring connections to the City’s water
           system may result in an undue burden to development. The costs of supplemental (oversized)
           improvements that result in excess capacity provided by initial developers are reimbursable by
           subsequent developers.
E.         Permit and Impact Fees
           Requiring developers to construct on-site improvements and/or pay pro rata shares toward the
           provision of infrastructure, public services, and school facilities will increase the cost of
           developing homes. This in is generally reflected in the price or rent that consumers must pay
           for housing. However, payment of fees is necessary to maintain an adequate level of services
           and facilities, and more importantly, to protect public health and safety.
           Grass Valley allows residential additions less than or equal to 500 square feet, without
           payment of impact fees. However, the City prorates residential additions over 500 square feet
           up to the total per unit shown in Table III-7, based on a 1,400 square foot equivalent dwelling
           unit size.
           Fees levied upon development by the City of Grass Valley include impact fees, review fees,
           and a regional transit fee. These fees represent approximately eight percent of the total cost
           of building one dwelling unit in the City.

F.         Development Permit Procedures
           i.          Project Approval Timeframes
           Development review and permit processing are necessary steps to ensure that residential
           construction proceeds in an orderly manner. However, the time and cost of permit processing
           and review can be a constraint to housing development if they place an undue burden on the
           developer. The permitting and review process for residential projects in Grass Valley can
           include conceptual development review and final development review. This process provides
           the opportunity for review and correction of the application by planning staff, the Development
           Review Committee, and other appropriate City agencies. The time necessary to complete the
           review process is generally dependent on several factors, including the complexity of the
           proposed project, the various land use applications required, and the environmental review
           process. For projects with multiple components and/or applications, the City reviews them
           concurrently to reduce permit processing time.
           Projects that are exempt from the review process take very little time for approval and
           generally just need to obtain building permits. Small, in-fill projects that are generally less
           complex than large developments take a shorter time to approve, about 2-4 months.
           Residential development within the current city limits not creating substantial environmental
           impacts also experience a shorter review time. Some projects the City approved in a timely
           manner have experienced significant delays in starting construction because of the need to
           obtain permits from state agencies for site cleanup. Larger residential subdivisions, which
           typically have several components, may require the preparation of an environmental impact
Adopted September 2014                                 III-35                            III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS

           report and can take 12 to 18 months to approve. The City’s General Plan provides guidelines
           for development and provides applicants with current information regarding environmental,
           infrastructure, air quality, and circulation conditions in the City. This information can help
           reduce the time needed to conduct environmental studies for development proposals.
           Table III-8 provides examples of the typical time from submittal of a complete application to
           final planning approvals. This is based on several residential developments approved by the
           City since the last Housing Element update. These projects represent the typical range of
           zoning, subdivision, development review, public works, and other approvals necessary for
           projects within Grass Valley.

             * Dependent on the level of environmental review required by the California Environmental Quality Act.
           Given the environmental issues and review that apply to most undeveloped areas in Grass
           Valley, the City believes that three to six months for small projects and 12 to 18 months for
           large projects are reasonable timeframes to assure compliance with local, state and federal
           environmental standards. The City can reduce these timeframes when working closely with
           applicants during the pre-application stage to identify and mitigate potential regulatory and
           environmental issues. The City strongly encourages, and many applicant’s request, pre-
           application meetings on all larger projects.
           The City estimates that the development review process for a smaller residential project takes
           approximately two months for approval. If the Planning Commission is the decision-making
           authority, it can add another one or two months to the process. If a project is subject to review
           by the Development Review Committee, Planning Commission, and City Council, as well as
           being subject to environmental review, it may require eight to 12 months to receive all City
           entitlements. This process can affect the development of affordable housing by increasing the
           amount of time to get project approvals, which in turn can increase the cost of providing
           affordable housing. The City could reduce the costs associated with the permit processing
           time by “fast tracking” affordable housing proposals—prioritizing the processing of affordable
           housing projects and assigning a staff person to shepherd such projects through required
           development reviews. In 2012, the City utilized fast-tracking for the Gold Country Village
           project.
           ii.         Development Review Procedures
           The City of Grass Valley reviews and approves residential development in one of three ways:
           1) Building Permits, 2) Development Review Permits, or 3) Subdivisions. The residential
           project may be associated with other applications (e.g. General Plan Amendment, Rezone,
Adopted September 2014                                         III-36                            III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                                         GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           Planned Development Permit), but the following three procedures represent the primary
           entitlements:
           Building Permits
           A building permit is a ministerial action taken by the City. It is the final review step prior to
           construction. Planning staff reviews a building permit to ensure compatibility with the City’s
           development standards, or previously approved plans related to a specific project. If the plans
           comply with the City’s standards and previously approved plans, planning staff signs a plan
           check routing sheet before the Building Department issues a building permit. In some cases,
           an applicant requests minor changes to a previously approved project as part of the building
           permit process. Staff has authority to approve minor changes; so unless a requested change
           is significant, staff approves these changes administratively. As it relates to residential
           development, a building permit is the only required permit needed for a single-family home.
           The City does not require any discretionary review process for single-family homes on legal
           lots. As noted below, all other residential development must receive some form of design
           review approval prior to submitting for building permits.
           Development Review Permits
           The intent of the City’s development review process is to promote a visually attractive
           community. It is to ensure each building is compatible and harmonious with surrounding
           properties and to achieve the goals and policies of the General Plan. The City focuses on the
           building design and site plan issues as part of this permit. It is not intended to address
           residential density issues nor is it used to apply more restrictive development standards, such
           as those related to permitted height, required parking, yard and setback requirements,
           permitted density, and building coverage. As it pertains to residential development,
           development review applies to all multi-family residential projects and any mixed-use projects.
           The Development Review Committee (DRC) is the review authority for duplexes or multi-family
           units with less than four units. For five or more units, the final review authority is the Planning
           Commission. If the residential project includes a legislative action (General Plan Amendment,
           Rezone), the City Council is the review authority. As noted above, the development review
           process does not apply to single-family homes.
           Conceptual Development Review is an optional stage of the review process during which an
           applicant can obtain the City’s general reaction to the design concept of the proposed project.
           This step does not include a formal decision regarding the subject project; however, the City
           encourages this for projects that may not conform to Grass Valley’s design standards or for
           larger, more complex projects. This affords the applicant with an opportunity to obtain the
           City’s general reaction and decide whether to proceed through the remainder of the
           development review process with the current proposal or submit modifications. The DRC
           provides the applicant with specific comments regarding the building design, site plan, and
           other aspects of the project, prior to final development review. Projects are reviewed in light of
           building and construction standards, onsite and offsite improvement requirements, and
           compatibility with developed property near the proposed project and Grass Valley as a whole.
           The City has found this process to be beneficial since it allows an applicant to address
           potentially significant issues prior to a formal application. This stage of the process may result
           in a slightly longer process, but it can also reduce the potential for costly project modifications
           at later stages in project review. To promote this step, the City schedules all Conceptual
           Development Review applications for a DRC meeting within three weeks of receipt of an
Adopted September 2014                                   III-37                       III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                              GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           application. Because the Conceptual Development Review process is optional, it is not
           considered a constraint to housing development.
           Final Development Review constitutes a review by the final decision making authority, the
           Development Review Committee, Planning Commission, or City Council, depending on the
           size and type of the project. If the review authority is the Planning Commission or City Council,
           the City requires a public hearing prior to the final decision. No hearings are required for DRC
           actions.
           The City also has adopted Community Design Guidelines, which apply to multi-family
           residential development, residential development in the downtown area, and other special
           areas within the city limits. Multi-family projects are required to comply with design guidelines
           that include site planning, building placement, grading and hillside development standards,
           retaining wall height and construction materials, landscaping, and fencing and screening
           standards that consider adjacent land uses, security, and privacy issues. Design guidelines
           also establish architectural standards that address building form, roofs, and building materials
           which include stone, brick, block, wood, and other various standard materials. Multi-family
           projects are also required to provide sufficient pedestrian access and a safe internal circulation
           system. Design guidelines established for residential development in the downtown residential
           area and other special areas focus on the existing community of historical structures and
           further developing the existing character of the community. Historic street widths are retained
           and architectural details consistent with the historic community are required for new
           development. Since the intent of the development review process is to address design and
           site planning, it has not been identified as a constraint to housing development.
           Subdivisions
           This review process applies to all residential land divisions within the City. Article 8 of the
           City’s Development Code includes the standards and process for subdivisions. It is based
           primarily on the state Subdivision Map Act. As it relates to residential development, the
           regulations apply to all land divisions that create lots for single-family homes and lots, or
           condominiums, for multi-family development. As part of the review process for subdivisions,
           the City reviews applications for compliance with lot size and shape standards, infrastructure
           requirements, and the general layout of the subdivision. If the project complies with the
           subdivision standards and General Plan density, the project can proceed though the approval
           process. As noted previously, an applicant can request a Planned Development Permit to
           address site constraints that may affect lot sizes and shapes or other requirements.
           iii.        Use Permits
           Article 7 of the Grass Valley Development Code regulates issuance of use permits and minor
           use permits. The City has an application process and set of standards for projects requiring
           use permits. Some residential projects that are subject to the requirements of a use permit
           include residential care with seven or more persons, boarding homes, day care centers, and
           transitional housing. Staff approves minor use permits after a public notice of intent to
           approve a project. The Planning Commission approves use permits, which may be revocable,
           conditional, or valid for a specified period. The Planning Commission holds a public hearing
           prior to making a decision on a use permit application. The criteria for approving use permits
           are non-specific and require the finding that the proposed use will not be detrimental to the
           health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, and general welfare of persons residing or working in

           the neighborhood of such proposed use or be detrimental or injurious to property and
           improvements in the neighborhood or general welfare of the City.
           The City’s use permit process does not specify the conditions under which a particular use
           may be permitted. Generally, conditions imposed on developments relate to compliance with
           zoning standards, hours of operation, creation of noise or other off-site impacts, site access,
           signage, transportation of clients, and other off-site issues. These standards do not generally
           impose significant barriers to the production of affordable or special needs housing.
           iv.         Process for Requesting Reasonable Accommodations
           The City’s process for providing reasonable accommodations allows individuals, or their
           representatives, to make requests for reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities
           as part of the permit process. No additional permits are required or additional fees charged by
           the City.       Requests for reasonable accommodations to meet the needs of persons with
           disabilities are generally approved administratively, and a use permit is not required. An
           exception would be a use (in contrast to an accessory structure or appurtenance) that requires
           a discretionary (use) permit, such as a residential care facility of seven or more persons. City
           staff is available to provide assistance regarding the processing of requests for the
           construction of accessory structures. Information regarding the approval of these structures is
           included within all public notices and agendas, as applicable.
G.         Building Code and Enforcement
           The City implements Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, in which California has
           adopted the California Building Standards Code and other model codes (electrical, plumbing,
           mechanical, etc.), with revisions. Although building standards and the time required for
           inspections increase housing production costs and may impact the viability of rehabilitation of
           older properties that are required to be brought up to current code standards, the intent of the
           codes is to provide structurally sound, safe, and energy-efficient housing. The Grass Valley
           Building Department is responsible for enforcing both state and city regulations governing
           maintenance of all buildings and property. Most code enforcement complaints relate to the
           need for housing rehabilitation. The City provides property owners subject to code
           enforcement complaints regarding housing conditions with information regarding the City’s
           Residential Rehabilitation Loan Program.
           Property owners are allowed sufficient latitude in making interior modifications to buildings to
           increase their accessibility and utility for persons with disabilities. Provisions during
           development review are also made in order to allow exterior improvements to increase
           accessibility of a structure for persons with disabilities.
H.         Environmental, Infrastructure, and Public Service Constraints
           Environmental factors and a lack of necessary infrastructure or public services can constrain
           residential development in a community by increasing costs and reducing the amount of land
           suitable for housing construction. This chapter summarizes and analyzes the most pertinent
           constraints to housing in Grass Valley. Future residential development will be faced with
           challenges regarding supportive public infrastructure extensions and expansions.
Adopted September 2014                                  III-39                       III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                             GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           i.          Water Service
           Both the City and Nevada Irrigation District provide treated water to city residents. The City
           projects the local water supply to support build out under the Grass Valley General Plan and to
           accommodate the City’s regional housing needs through 2019. The storage and distribution of
           potable water suffers from inefficiency due to the age of most of the City’s storage and
           distribution facilities. The system was first constructed in the late 19th century. It is in need of
           significant repair and replacement of older water lines to maintain and enhance existing levels
           of water service and to accommodate the increased water service needs of new development.
           The City administers a Capital Improvement Program (CIP), funded through the payment of
           water bills, for its water service facilities. The CIP identifies required projects, target year of
           completion, and the estimated costs of improvements. Each budget year the City allocates
           funds for annual water system improvements and allocates additional funds for specific
           projects as needed. Other than the CIP, the costs of necessary water system improvements
           are passed on to developers, on an as needed basis, creating an additional financial constraint
           to the development of housing.
           Grass Valley maintains the policy to extend water distribution facilities to new development
           and newly annexed areas when the extension is feasible and cost effective. However, the
           physical arrangements for water service for future developments are currently uncertain. For
           example, all of the SDAs will require the developers pay for the necessary extensions required
           to serve the properties. In some cases, the requirement to pay for extensive water line
           extensions could result in a cost constraint upon the development of housing. Topographical
           conditions also present a constraint upon the expansion of the City’s water service system due
           to the added cost of pump stations and other distribution facilities required in some parts of the
           City.
           ii.         Sewer Service
           Grass Valley currently operates a wastewater treatment plant that provides a capacity of 2.78
           million gallons per day (MGD), or approximately 21,000 people. Properties identified in Table
           III-1 have access to the City’s sewer system but the property owners need to pay their pro-rata
           share of the cost of extending collection lines through the sewer impact fee charged by the
           City.
           iii.        Storm Drain
           Grass Valley presently administers a variety of regulations designed to prevent flooding and
           address stormwater management. These include a flood ordinance, various provisions of the
           zoning and subdivision ordinance, and construction codes for residential developments.
           Grass Valley’s Capital Improvement Program (CIP) contains a local stormwater drainage
           program and a regional stormwater drainage program, which is funded through the drainage
           impact fee identified in Table III-6.
           Grass Valley will need to expand the existing storm drain system and construct new systems
           to accommodate development within the City. Specifically, the Special Development Areas,
           such as Loma Rica Ranch, North Star, and Kenny Ranch, include lands that are subject to
           flooding during a 100-year storm event. This will require new or expanded storm water
           storage and drainage facilities to provide proper flood protection. The developers of those
           properties are responsible for the cost of facilities needed to serve individual developments.
Adopted September 2014                                   III-40                       III. RESOURCES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                                                              GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           iv.         Biological Resources
           Grass Valley is located within the transition zone between the lower foothill elevations and the
           higher Sierra Nevada Mountains. This results in a greater variety of species of plants and
           animals within and around the City. The City also contains various locally important natural
           communities, including vernal pools, riparian corridors, creeks, tributaries, and specially
           adapted plant communities related to the presence of serpentine and gabbro geologic
           resources. Both state and federal legislation regulates and protects these resources through
           the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and/or the California Department of Fish and
           Game.         Although the City does not have control over these regulations, residential
           development in areas not previously disturbed by urban development, may be constrained by
           the presence of biological resources.
           The City has addressed this constraint in its General Plan policies and implementation. Based
           on past biological resource surveys conducted by the City or developers, the City does not
           anticipate biological resources will affect the development of medium or high-density housing.
           The City’s PD and specific plan process has been, and can be, used to mitigate biological
           resource constraints. On sites that may contain biological resources, ultimately controlled by
           state or federal regulations, the City allows development to occur on the non-constrained
           portion of a property to allow the same residential density and number of units. Some specific
           examples of approved projects that used this technique include the Village at South Auburn
           and South Wolf Creek Village. In some cases, off-site mitigation is acceptable and used to
           allow the full development of a property.
           The Development Code includes a chapter on creek and riparian resource protection. This
           chapter establishes watercourse setback standards (from 30 to 100 feet based on the average
           depth of a lot) on properties adjacent to specific watercourses in the City. This regulation
           could affect the ability to provide affordable housing. However, the chapter also includes
           provisions to reduce the setbacks if the project incorporates resource management steps.
           Such steps include restoration of riparian habitat, removal of non-native vegetation,
           decompaction of soils, and other measures to filter and improve water runoff.
           v.          Geology
           Serpentine rock found within the Sierra foothills contains asbestos, from less than one percent
           up to approximately 25 percent. Serpentine rock releases asbestos when it is crushed or
           broken. Grass Valley is located within the proximity of substantial serpentine deposits. This
           can result in a constraint for construction activities and road surfacing activities. The City has
           addressed this potential constraint in cooperation with the Northern Sierra Air Quality Control
           District through the implementation of standard construction practices that minimize the
           creation of dust that could create airborne asbestos particles.
           Topography issues can constrain development given the City’s location in the foothills of the
           Sierra Nevada Mountains. Some land within the City limits is considered unbuildable and is
           therefore, required to be preserved in its natural state. The City has addressed this potential
           constraint by identifying land for medium and high-density housing that has fewer topographic
           constraints and permitting the “transfer” of housing units within a property onto a less sloped
           portion of a site. The City’s PD, specific plan, and variance processes are tools available to
           focus development on the less sloped portions of a property. The General Plan also includes
           land use policies allowing for the maximization of the developable portions of residentially
           designated property while avoiding slope and other environmental resources constraints.

                                                                             GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

2.         Non-Governmental Constraints
A.         Availability of Financing
           Availability of financing affects a person’s ability to purchase or improve a home. Under the
           Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions must disclose information on the
           disposition of loan applications by the income, gender, and race/ethnicity of the applicants.
           This applies to all loan applications for home purchases and improvements, whether financed
           at market rate or with government assistance.
           i.          Home Purchase and Improvement Loans
           In 2012, 844 households in Grass Valley applied for conventional loans to purchase homes in
           the City. Actual loan origination occurred in approximately half, 426 , of those applications. Of
           these, 257 loans were approved, 245 for home purchase and 12 for home improvements. As
           shown in Tables III 9 and III 10, a majority of the loans occurred with those applicants that had
           AMI of 80 % or greater.
                                                             Table III-9

                                                                                   GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           To address potential private market lending constraints and expand homeownership and home
           improvement opportunities, Grass Valley offers and/or participates in a variety of home buyer
           and rehabilitation assistance programs. Such programs assist lower- and moderate-income
           residents by increasing access to favorable loan terms to purchase or improve their homes.
           The Housing Strategy chapter of this Housing Element contains detailed information on the
           available programs.
           iii.        Home Loan Interest Rates
           The cost of borrowing money to buy a home is another factor affecting the cost of housing and
           overall housing affordability. The higher the interest rate and other financing costs charged for
           borrowing money to purchase a home, the higher the total cost of the home and the higher the
           household income required to pay that cost.
           The effect of financing costs on housing costs is demonstrated by showing how monthly
           mortgage payments (principal and interest) on a 30-year $270,000 loan, increase with higher
           interest rates. The household income required to make those payments also increases with
           higher interest rates. Table III-11 provides an example of the impact of financing costs on
           housing cost.
                                                           Table III-11

                            30% Principal and Interest only
           As shown in Table III-11, monthly payments increase by about $127 for every one-point
           increase in interest rates, in the range of four percent to seven percent. As monthly payments
           increase, the income required to cover those payments also increases from about $51,561 to
           $71,852 (assuming 30 percent of income allocated for housing P & I only). If, instead,
           household income were held constant, the share of income spent on housing would have to
           increase from 30 percent to 45 percent, as the interest rate increases from four percent to
           seven percent.
           From the perspective of a buyer with a given household income, the higher the financing
           costs, the lower the mortgage amount that the household income can support and, thus, the
           lower the housing price that the household can afford. The effect of financing costs on
           housing affordability can be demonstrated by showing how the mortgage amount (and housing
           price) that a household can afford based on its household income declines with higher interest

           The mortgage amount that a household with income at the current median level for Nevada
           County can afford declines from $240,300 to $187,200 as the interest rate increases from four
           percent to seven percent. That change makes a substantial difference in the price of housing
           that the household can afford to buy. It also increases the amount of public subsidy required
           to provide affordable homeownership opportunities to median-income households.
           Currently, and in recent years, interest rates have been at relatively low levels. Nevertheless,
           financing costs are still significant, and many households have difficulty purchasing a home.
           To address these costs, Grass Valley has a first-time homebuyer program. The Grass Valley
           Down Payment Assistance Program provides deferred interest loans of up to $75,000 to
           income qualified, first time home buyers.
B.         Land Costs
           A key factor determining housing cost is the price of raw land and any necessary
           improvements. A review of property listings for land in Grass Valley indicates that the cost of
           residential land varies by location and degree of improvement. According to current residential
           land listings, the cost of vacant land in Grass Valley for several projects recently approved by
           the City range from approximately $15,000 to $80,000 per lot. Other vacant residential lots
           less than 0.25 acres range from $79,000 to $150,000.
C.         Construction Cost
           i.          Single-Family Homes
           Many factors can affect the cost of building a single-family house, including the type of
           construction, custom versus tract development, materials, site conditions, finishing details,
           amenities, square footage, and structural configuration. These factors create a wide variation
           in construction costs, from as little as $110 per square foot for basic construction to well over
           $200 a square foot for high-quality custom construction. Table III-13 provides an estimate of
           all housing development costs in Grass Valley, including construction costs.

IV. STRATEGY
A.         Introduction
           This chapter contains the City’s strategy for meeting housing needs identified in Chapter
           II. It also identifies the use of resources available to the City, and the reduction of
           barriers to the availability of housing for all residents as described in Chapter III. As
           required by state law, this chapter contains quantified (numerical) objectives for housing
           construction, housing rehabilitation, and the preservation of affordable housing, with a
           five-year action program that:
                 Provides regulatory concessions and incentives and uses local, federal, and state
                  financing and subsidy programs to support the development of affordable housing;
                 Identifies adequate sites with appropriate zoning, development standards, services
                  and facilities to encourage the development of a variety of types of housing for all
                  income levels;
                 Assists in the development of adequate housing to meet the needs of low- and
                  moderate-income households;
                 Addresses and, where appropriate and legally possible, removes governmental
                  constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and development of housing,
                  including housing for all income levels and housing for persons with disabilities;
                 Conserves and improves the condition of the existing affordable housing stock,
                  which may include addressing ways to mitigate the loss of dwelling units
                  demolished by public or private action;
                 Promotes housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion, sex,
                  marital status, ancestry, national origin, color, familial status, or disability; and
                 Preserves assisted housing developments for lower-income households.
           Since Grass Valley is the center of commerce and industry for the Sierra Foothills region
           of the County, it has traditionally provided the bulk of Nevada County’s affordable
           housing. About 35 percent of the City’s housing stock was constructed prior to 1950 and
           consists primarily of homes on small parcels. The income of Grass Valley residents is
           significantly lower than the countywide average, and rising housing prices have
           significantly increased the number and percent of homeowners paying more than 30
           percent of their incomes for housing. In the past, the City has accommodated residential
           development for all population segments through annexation and infill development. As
           the City builds out, the ability to meet future housing needs could be affected by
           environmental conditions noted in Chapter III.
           For these reasons, Grass Valley’s housing strategy, while including additional
           annexations and development of land within the City’s Sphere of Influence, also relies on
           infill development, re-use of underutilized properties, and mixed-use development to
           meet future housing needs. The City continues to take steps to achieve a greater
           balance in housing development. Some of those steps provide greater opportunities for

           residential developments.
B.         Evaluation of Achievements (2009-2014 Housing
           Element)
           State law (California Government Code section 65588 (a)) requires each jurisdiction
           review its housing element as frequently as appropriate to evaluate:
                 The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to
                  the attainment of the state housing goal;
                 The effectiveness of the housing element in attainment of the community's housing
                  goals and objectives; and
                 The progress of the city, county, or city and county in implementation of the housing
                  element.
           State Housing Element law also requires an evaluation of the previous element,
           including:
                 Effectiveness of the element: A review of the actual results of the previous
                  element’s goals, objectives, policies, and programs. The results should be
                  quantified where possible (e.g., the number of units rehabilitated)
                 Progress in Implementation: An analysis of the significant differences between what
                  was planned in the previous element and what was actually achieved.
                 Appropriateness of goals, objectives and policies: A description of how the goals,
                  objectives, policies and programs of the updated element incorporate what has
                  been learned from the results of the previous element.
           This chapter documents the City’s achievements under the 2009-2014 Housing Element.
           It identifies the actions contained in the Element and describes the relative success of
           the City’s efforts to implement the 2009-2014 programs.                      It also contains
           recommendations for program changes to address current and projected needs and
           state requirements between 2014 and 2019.
           Summary of Achievements
           During the planning period covered by the current Housing Element (2009-2014), the
           City of Grass Valley implemented a number of actions to plan for, accommodate, and
           facilitate the construction, rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable housing. Among
           these actions were:
                 Annexation of nearly 450 acres to provide additional land for residential
                  development within the City’s Sphere of Influence;
                 Approval and assistance for the construction of 136 housing units affordable to very
                  low- and low-income households (16 – Habitat for Humanity, 120 –Gold Country
                  Village- Bennett Street);
                 Receipt of $500,000 in HOME funds for the City’s First Time Homebuyers program;

                 Approval of a variety of housing alternatives for all segments of the community,
                  including market-rate single-family homes, affordable rental housing for low- income
                  families, senior housing, and mobile homes;
                 Completion of water, sewer, and street improvements for upgrading older
                  neighborhoods;
                 Directed interested members of the public to how to obtain fair housing information
                  at its public counter;
                 Approved two Housing Rehabilitation Loans for lower income residents;
                 Applied Redevelopment Agency monies to rehabilitate 56 affordable rentals (Valley
                  Commons) in the form of a long term loan;
                 Amended the Development Code to extend the permit entitlements to add 5 years
                  to all residential projects in response to the continued poor economic recovery;
                 Applied Redevelopment Agency monies to assist with the construction costs of 16
                  very low income owner occupant units constructed by Habitat for Humanity; and,
                 Receipt of a CDBG planning grant in 2013 to assist in the upgrade of sewer line
                  infrastructure in the older parts of the town.

the adoption of the 1993 Housing Element.
b)        The City shall concentrate annexation efforts on unincorporated sites adjacent
to the City containing reasonable access to the City’s sewer system and that have the
capacity to accommodate a mix of low- and moderate-income housing. The City
believes there is adequately zoned land within the existing City limits; however, the
City shall continue to process the larger SDA annexation applications to meet the
City’s longer-term housing needs.
c)        The City shall prezone land at the time of annexation based on the General
Plan Land Use designation. This will ensure a subsequent rezone is not necessary
for sites that can accommodate higher density residential uses and/or mixed
residential-commercial development. This will permit needed multifamily housing at
densities that can support low- and moderate-income housing.
d)        For larger annexations, Grass Valley shall encourage applicants to use a
planned development or specific plan process to allow greater flexibility and variety in
housing types and densities. This will allow greater flexibility to land owners in the

e)        For properties designated R-3, the City shall require developers to achieve at
least a mid-range between the minimum and maximum densities (between eight and
20 units per acre). The City will consider requests by applicants to develop land at
densities below the mid-range on a case-by-case basis, taking into account design
considerations and site constraints. On properties with slopes or other environmental
constraints, the City will encourage developers to transfer housing units to the
unconstrained portion of a property.
f)        The City shall continue to promote infill development opportunities through
grants for assisting in the identification and remediation of contaminated or hazardous
sites. Work with the Redevelopment Agency to identify additional planning areas to
promote infill development and redevelopment opportunities and to utilize
redevelopment funds for affordable housing.
g)        The City will support and promote extremely low-income households (ELI)
using secondary units, carriage homes, live/work units, transitional and supportive
housing, and residential care facilities. The use of single-room occupancy units
(SRO) provides an additional opportunity to serve ELI households (Note: the NC-Flex
zone allows multi-family uses by right and includes several hotels; therefore, these
hotels could be converted to SROs by right). To provide additional support for ELI
households, the City will annually: 1) identify and contact nonprofit builders who
specialize in building extremely low-income housing, 2) identify local, state, and
federal funding sources that can be used to develop ELI units, and 3) promote
regulatory concessions available within the City’s Density Bonus Program. Additional
support for ELI households is found in Programs 2, 3, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19 and
20.

D.         Implementation Programs
GOAL A:                To Designate Sufficient Land at Appropriate Densities and Establish
                       Development Standards and Permit Procedures to Accommodate
                       the City's Share of Nevada County’s Housing Needs for All Income
                       Groups
PROGRAM 1: Adequate Sites for Housing
Action: Grass Valley shall work with owners of vacant and underutilized land to provide
sufficient sites with adequate zoning, public facilities, and services to meet the City's housing
needs for all income groups. This program will consist of the following actions:
     a. As land is annexed, the City shall utilize one or more of the following options: 1) apply an
           appropriate zoning category or categories that reflects environmental conditions and
           development needs; 2) encourage mixed-uses; 3) work with property owners to prepare
           a specific plan containing project-specific development standards, or; 4) apply a planned
           development to permit variation from the strict application of zoning standards. These
           options reflect historic City practices in annexing land since the adoption of the 1993
           Housing Element.
     b. The City shall concentrate annexation efforts on unincorporated sites adjacent to the
           City containing reasonable access to the City’s sewer system and that have the capacity
           to accommodate a mix of low- and moderate-income housing. The City believes there is
           adequately zoned land within the existing City limits; however, the City shall continue to
           process the larger SDA annexation applications to meet the City’s longer-term housing
           needs.
     c. The City shall prezone land at the time of annexation based on the General Plan Land
           Use designation. This will ensure a subsequent rezone is not necessary for sites that
           can accommodate higher density residential uses and/or mixed residential-commercial
           development. This will permit needed multifamily housing at densities that can support
           low- and moderate-income housing.
     d. For larger annexations, Grass Valley shall encourage applicants to use a planned
           development or specific plan process to allow greater flexibility and variety in housing
           types and densities.       This will allow greater flexibility to land owners in the design of
           their development proposals.            Planned development permits also facilitate the
           development of multifamily housing without the need for subsequent rezoning or
           conditional use permits by vesting the right to construct multifamily housing at the time a
           planned development permit is approved.
     e. For properties designated R-3, the City shall require developers to achieve at least a
           mid-range between the minimum and maximum densities (between eight and 20 units
           per acre). The City will consider requests by applicants to develop land at densities
           below the mid-range on a case-by-case basis, taking into account design considerations
           and site constraints. On properties with slopes or other environmental constraints, the
           City will encourage developers to transfer housing units to the unconstrained portion of a
           property.
     f. The City shall continue to promote infill development opportunities through grants for
           assisting in the identification and remediation of contaminated or hazardous sites.
Adopted September 2014                                IV-21                                         IV. STRATEGY
                                                                           GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

     g. The City will support and promote extremely low-income households (ELI) using
           secondary units, carriage homes, live/work units, transitional and supportive housing,
           and residential care facilities. The use of single-room occupancy units (SRO) provides
           an additional opportunity to serve ELI households (Note: the NC-Flex zone allows multi-
           family uses by right and includes several hotels; therefore, these hotels could be
           converted to SROs by right). To provide additional support for ELI households, the City
           will annually: 1) identify and contact nonprofit builders who specialize in building
           extremely low-income housing, 2) identify state and federal funding sources that can be
           used to develop ELI units, and 3) promote regulatory concessions available within the
           City’s Density Bonus Program. Additional support for ELI households is found in
           Programs 2, 3, 10, 12,13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.
Discussion: To correlate land use categories with income groups, the following assumptions
are made: 1) extremely low-income needs can be met with land zoned at least 20 units per acre
and with the use of density bonus provisions; 2) very low- and low-income housing needs can
be met with land zoned at 15 dwelling units per acre or more; 3) moderate-income housing
needs can be met with land zoned at four to 15 dwelling units per acre; 4) above moderate-
income housing needs can be met with any residentially-zoned land. Even though the City has
approved several projects with density bonuses, as noted in Chapter III, the City did not assume
the use of this program in the above assumptions, with the exception of extremely low-income
households. As part of its annexation process, the City should encourage residential
developers to include housing affordable to families with children to alleviate overcrowding
among large families and affordable ownership housing for moderate-income households. This
will increase the availability of rental housing to low- income households and reduce the
proportion of such households paying more than 30 of their income for housing expenses.

                          (see Tables II-29 and II-30)
PROGRAM 2: Flexible Development Standards and Mixed Use Developments
Action: The City shall encourage creative approaches to meeting housing needs. This
includes supporting planned development permits and mixed-use development. The City will
promote opportunities for creative development in pre-application and pre-annexation meetings
with applicants. The City will provide information at the Community Development Department
public counter and website.
The City will continue to work with lenders and insurance providers to promote the benefits of
mixed-use developments. The City shall also implement recommendations of the Downtown
Strategic Plan that provide for mixed-use development, including:
     a. Maintain and continue to promote the mixed-use character of neighborhoods which lie
           on the boundaries of the downtown district: and encourage additional density for both
           commercial and residential uses, while discouraging the conversion of residential

                                                                    GRASS VALLEY HOUSING ELEMENT 2014-2019

           structures that would result in displacement of lower-income residents (unless relocation
           assistance and/or replacement housing is provided);
     b. Implement the provisions of South Auburn Street Master Plan to ensure affordable
           housing opportunities are encouraged and incorporated to the redevelopment of parcels
           along or fronting S. Auburn Street, Neal Street and Tinloy Street.
Discussion: The Development Code, adopted in 2007, includes enhanced opportunities for
mixed-use projects within the City limits. The City’s planned development permit (PD) allows
flexibility and innovation within a plan area, including concepts such as cluster development, a
mixture of housing types and land uses, and common ownership of open space and community
facilities. Examples of the City’s approval of mixed-use development are Olympia Plaza (Phase
II), which included approximately 14 acres for mixed-use development, and the Village of South
Auburn. In both cases, housing was included on lands zoned for commercial use.
The TC overlay defines Downtown Grass Valley. Town Center designation recognizes that
design and architectural features are of greater concern than land use designations in
downtown. Protection and enhancement of Downtown’s historic character are the primary
intentions of the TC district. The TC district allows various land uses, while upholding the
historic character and design/architectural standards. “Underlying” land use designations are
maintained on parcels within the TC overlay, although TC standards override those of
comparable zoning districts in cases of conflict. Town Center encompasses properties
clustered along South Auburn, Mill, and Main Streets. Street-level commercial, specialty shops,
restaurants, upper level residential and offices, and cultural uses are encouraged.

                           applicants will occur each year as needed based on property owner
                           interest
Funding:                   Application fees, CDBG, general fund
Objective:                 Increase the options to provide for a variety of housing to meet the
                           needs of all income groups
PROGRAM 3: Reduce Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing
Action: In 2007, the City took substantial steps, by adopting the Development Code, to
address previously identified regulatory barriers to affordable housing. Since then, the City has
monitored and amended some of the new standards in the Development Code to address
potential issues with implementation. However, to date, none of the changes have affected
affordable housing. To ensure no barriers are created, the City will need to take the following
steps to assure this and compliance with state laws:
     a. Continue to promote and monitor the City’s Density Bonus Program as a means                      to
           achieving a broad range of affordable housing.
     b. Reduce the cost impact of permit processing time by “fast tracking” affordable housing
           proposals—prioritizing the processing of affordable housing projects and assignment of
           a staff person to shepherd such projects through required city development reviews.
           Expediting the approval of affordable housing includes the use of CEQA exemptions for

           affordable housing, as permitted by state law, early notification and coordination with
           local neighborhood groups by one applicant and use of the design review to address site
           design issues early in the process.
     c. The City shall take a more proactive role in lobbying the state on policy/legislative issues
           that affect housing, such as workers compensation, liability insurance, and prevailing
           wages, and code requirements (fire sprinklers) that add tremendous costs to the
           provision of affordable housing.

Funding:                   Application fees, general fund
Objective:                 Reduce regulatory barriers to facilitating the provision of a variety of
                           housing for all income groups. Request the state understand and address
                           the significant cumulative costs of implementing state housing regulations
                           adopted by the state that severely impact the costs to housing,
                           particularly those adopted after 2009.
PROGRAM 4: Implement General Plan Policies
Action: Through measures described in programs 1 – 3, the City shall continue to implement
General Plan policies that encourage efficient use of unconstrained land and a healthy
economic base, including but not limited to:
     a. Clustering of housing units in annexation areas (such as Kenny Ranch, and                    North
           Star);
     b. Promoting the use of infill properties;
     c. Avoiding slopes and environmental resource areas;
     d. Maximizing efficient use of unconstrained portions of residentially designated properties
           by allowing opportunities for higher densities on unconstrained land;
     e. Promoting new developments in annexation areas that include a combination of
           residential uses, commercial services, and employment opportunities for residents;
     f. Encourage mixed-use developments on larger parcels in newly developing areas,
           incorporating jobs, generating businesses, and industry housing; and
     g. Promote primary jobs and core employment opportunities; those that export goods while
           importing capital.
For implementation, see programs 1 – 3.
PROGRAM 5: Encourage the Use of Development Agreements
Action: The City shall encourage larger residential developers to enter into development
agreements. This tool vests the developer's right to proceed with a project under the
regulations in effect at the time of application in exchange for commitments from developers on
providing or establishing a financing mechanism for necessary public facilities that serve new
development. Grass Valley will promote this option during pre-annexation and pre-applications
meetings.
Adopted September 2014                              IV-24                                        IV. STRATEGY

Discussion: The primary inducement for a developer to enter into such an agreement is the
guarantee that subsequent changes in land use regulations will not affect the proposed project
during the period covered by the agreement.

PROGRAM 6: Annual Housing Element Monitoring Report
Action: The Planning Department shall provide an annual report to the City Council on the
City's progress in meeting its Housing Element objectives. The City shall continue to use the
state-approved form and submit the report to HCD after review by the City Council. The report
to the City Council may include recommendations for changes in Housing Element programs.
The report will also include the following information, only to the extent applicable and in as
much detail as appears warranted each year:
     a. Progress made toward achieving the City's fair-share housing allocation;
     b. A summary of efforts taken to improve the condition of the City's housing stock (e.g.,
           CDBG-supported rehabilitation loans);
     c. An inventory of remaining vacant sites in zones suitable for the development of housing
           for low-income households; and
     d. A progress report on actions taken to meet special housing needs.
The City Council will decide, based on this annual evaluation of the progress, whether or not to
adjust its program actions or to adopt new program actions.

                         and programs
PROGRAM 7: Promote Infill Development
In conjunction with Programs 1 and 4, the City shall continue to support policies and procedures
to promote infill development and development adjacent to the City. The City will promote infill
development in areas that contain adequate public facilities and services and to integrate small
projects with existing neighborhoods.
The City will continue to apply for CDBG and other grants that can help reduce infrastructure
costs of infill development. In 2013, the City received a CDBG grant. A majority of this grant is
intended for sewer collection system upgrades in the older parts of the City. These upgrades
can help reduce costs of developing infill, or redeveloping underutilized, parcels in the area.
The City will promote its infill policies and procedures through a link on the City’s web site,
Adopted September 2014                            IV-25                                      IV. STRATEGY

PROGRAM 8: Allow Alternative Housing Types to Meet Special Needs
Action: The City shall continue to allow secondary dwelling units, group homes (residential
care facilities), homeless and transitional housing facilities, and manufactured homes on
individual lots and in mobile home parks, and farmworker housing according to the requirements
of state law. To promote the City’s development standards for alternative housing, the City will
provide information at the Community Development Department public counter, provide a
website link, and offer pre-application meetings to explain the City’s policies and regulations.
The City will also promote its standards for alternative housing types through its ongoing
contacts with nonprofit housing organizations.

Developmental Disabilities
Action: The City shall continue to implement state standards for accessibility in new housing
by handicapped individuals. The City will require developers of affordable housing to
incorporate adaptability and accessibility features in their project designs. The City will also
continue to allow:
     a. Accessory structures in new housing developments and retrofitting of older homes to
           meet the needs of persons with disabilities, including persons with developmental
           disabilities;

                            developmental disabilities.
PROGRAM 10: Transitional and Supportive Housing
Action: The City shall review and revise if needed its Development Code to be consistent with
state law. Pursuant to state law, the City will allow transitional and supportive housing in all
zones that allow residential uses. Specifically, the City will need to review the NC-Flex zone
and amend if needed the Development Code to allow transitional and supportive housing
consistent with state laws.

                            families
PROGRAM 11: Housing Opportunities for Large Families
Action: Through its ongoing collaborations with nonprofit organizations and other public
agencies, the City shall seek to include housing units suitable for large families in new
developments containing affordable housing. The City shall continue to seek funding for
affordable housing projects and programs (see Program 13). Specific actions may include:
     a. Requiring that affordable family housing projects include three- and four-bedroom
           housing units, with the goal that the percentage of such units will match the percentage
           of large families in Grass Valley, unless the applicant can show it is financially infeasible
           to include such a percentage;
     b. Implementing and promoting requirements of state law for childcare facility density
           bonuses (see Program 12);
     c. Providing financial and regulatory incentives listed in Programs 13 and 14 to facilitate the
           production of affordable housing;
     d. Providing density bonuses for projects that include minimum percentages of housing
           units affordable to very low- and/or low-income households (see Program 12); and
Adopted September 2014                               IV-27                                         IV. STRATEGY

     e. Making the use of state and federal funds, including bond proceeds or tax credits, for
           large family housing one of the City’s priorities (see Programs 13 and 14).
The City will promote its efforts to encourage the production of large family housing through its
website, with links to the Nevada County Housing Authority and nonprofit organizations
providing affordable housing or operating programs in Grass Valley. The City shall continue to
provide pre-application meetings with affordable housing developers, and contact housing
providers as part of the City’s annual public workshops on the use of CDBG.
Discussion: The Community Profile (Chapter II) identified affordable family housing as a
priority. Low-income large families and single parents, in particular, face many challenges to
obtaining suitable housing. Such families typically need low-cost housing with three or more
bedrooms, often rental housing, and convenient access to childcare services.

PROGRAM 14: Pursue State and Federal Funding for Affordable Housing
Action: The City shall continue to pursue available and appropriate state and federal funding
sources in cooperation with private developers, nonprofit housing corporations, the Nevada
County Housing Authority, and other interested entities to support efforts to meet the housing
needs of low- and moderate-income households and to assist persons with rent payments
required for existing units. The City’s efforts to support affordable housing activities by others
will include expedited processing of permits (particularly when needed to meet funding
deadlines), the provision of information needed for an application, and requested letters of
support for proposals that have received approval (preliminary or final) by the City.
The City will promote the availability of housing assistance through its website, website links to
the Nevada County Housing Authority and nonprofit organizations providing affordable housing
or operating programs in Grass Valley, information at the Community Development Department
public counter and other public locations within the City.
Discussion: Grass Valley has applied for, and received, several state and federal grants for
the construction, rehabilitation, or purchase of affordable housing for low- or very low-income
households. Since 1993, the City has received CDBG and HOME program funding for the
construction of affordable housing units, the rehabilitation of substandard housing units, and
first-time homebuyer assistance. The City will continue this level of effort and support funding
requests by nonprofit and for profit housing providers that does not have direct involvement by
the City (such as for the sale of tax credits state or federal loan or insurance programs that
provide assistance directly to the developer).

Action: The City has entered into a joint exercise of powers agreement to allow the California
Statewide Communities Development Authority to issue tax exempt bonds or mortgage credit
certificates for financing the construction of affordable housing or providing financial assistance
to low- and moderate-income homebuyer assistance.
Discussion:            The City participates in a consortium of municipal governments to pool its
resources. Mortgage Revenue Bonds, a type of tax-exempt bond, can be used through various
California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) programs in which the City supports a developer's
application for multi-family or single-family housing for low- and moderate-income households.

locations in Grass Valley.
Discussion: Under the City’s current program, individuals who own homes or apartments
within Grass Valley are eligible to receive loans or grants to repair their properties if they, or
their tenants, meet income eligibility guidelines. For owner occupants, the maximum loan
amount is $85,000 amortized at one percent for 15 years. Very low-income owners may be
eligible for deferred loans. For rental property owners, the maximum loan amount is $60,000 for
a two-unit structure, plus $20,000 for each additional unit. Tenants must meet income
qualifications and a fair market rent agreement is required. Under the Emergency Repair
Program, the City offers grants of up to $7,500 for emergency repairs to owner-occupied
properties. Each property owner is eligible only once for the grant.

Timeframe:                   Current and ongoing, 2014 – 2019
Objective:                   Rehabilitation of 3 very low-income housing units and 5 low-income
                             housing units
PROGRAM 18: Preservation of At-Risk Housing
Action: Based on the most current available information and interviews with property
managers, the City does not have any units at risk of conversion to market uits untisl 2027.
The City can continue to assist owners in applying for state or federal assistance for refinancing,
acquisition, and/or rehabilitation, or provide "gap" financing to public agencies or nonprofit
housing organizations interested in purchasing "at-risk" rental housing developments. The City
will also provide educational materials related to tenant relocation assistance and rental
subsidies to tenants of the at-risk units, and post information on the web site and public
information counter.
Discussion: The City has identified 836 subsidized rental-housing units in Grass Valley, all
assisted by the programs listed in Table II-26. None of these units are not at risk of conversion
over the next ten years. The City will continue to monitor the status of these properties should
federal program restrictions change in a way that would increase the risk of conversion.

PROGRAM 19: Rental Assistance
Action: The City shall continue to cooperate with the Nevada County Housing Authority in its
administration of the federal Housing Choice Voucher (formerly called “Section 8”) rental
assistance program to maintain the availability of housing vouchers in Grass Valley. The City's
role will be to:
     a. Provide necessary documentation to the Housing Authority to apply for annual
           commitments from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development;
     b. Encourage rental property owners who have participated in the City’s housing
           rehabilitation program to participate in the Housing Choice Voucher program;
     c. Provide information on the rental assistance program in the City’s newsletter, and at the
           Community Development Department’s public counter; and

Objective:                 Maintain availability of rental assistance to Grass Valley residents
PROGRAM 20: Preservation of Mobile Home Parks
Action: Grass Valley shall continue to meet as needed with mobile home park owners to
discuss their long-term goals for their properties and the feasibility of preserving these parks.
The City will determine feasibility based on the condition of park infrastructure and buildings, the
condition of mobile homes located in the park, parcel size, accessibility to services, and
surrounding land uses. For those parks that are feasible to preserve, the City will:
     a. Assist property owners in accessing state and federal funds for park improvements by
           preparing funding requests, providing information to park owners on state and federal
           programs, and/or providing referrals to nonprofit organizations who can assist in
           preparing funding requests.
     b. Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65863.7, require, as a condition of
           approval for any change of use, that mobile home park owners who desire to close
           and/or convert their parks to another use provide relocation or other assistance to
           mitigate the displacement of park residents. The City shall also require the park owner
           to provide evidence of resident notification of intent to close and/or convert the mobile
           home park, as required by state law.
Discussion: Grass Valley contains four mobile home parks with 428 spaces. Two of these
parks contain fewer than 50 spaces each. The City has met with the owners of the larger parks
over the past few years. It may not be feasible to preserve all of the mobile home parks in
Grass Valley, particularly smaller parks without adequate infrastructure and amenities to provide
a suitable residential environment.

E.         Quantified Objectives
The City of Grass Valley has established quantified (numerical) objectives for several program
categories to provide measurable standards for monitoring and evaluating program
achievements. Quantified objectives have been established for accommodating the City’s share
of Nevada County’s future housing needs, new housing construction, housing rehabilitation, the
preservation of existing affordable housing, and homebuyer assistance. The quantified
objectives for the City’s share of Nevada County’s future housing needs and housing
construction differ because the housing construction objective is based on the City’s estimate of
the number homes that will actually be constructed and affordable to each income group. The
future housing needs objective addresses the City’s ability to accommodate housing based on
the availability of appropriately zoned vacant and underutilized land, with public services and
facilities. These homes may or may not be built depending on market trends and the availability
of funding assistance to developers of affordable housing.

  2. Quantified objectives cover 2014 – 2019, including housing units anticipated to be constructed between 2014
  and 2019, based on anticipated market rate housing production (for moderate-and above moderate-income),
  availability of financial resources to assist in the construction of very low- and low-income housing, and the City’s
  past track record of producing affordable housing.
  3. Based on historic level of performance under the housing rehabilitation program
  4. Based on the conservation of 836 existing subsidized rental housing units—the City does not have specific
       information on the number of extremely low-, very low-, or low-income units
  5. Based on the number of mobile homes in parks with 50 or more spaces; although the majority of mobile
  home park residents are likely to have very low- or low-incomes, the City does not have specific information on the
  income levels of mobile home park residents

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Role of the General Plan
The General Plan is a comprehensive plan for growth and development in the City of Grass Valley
and the surrounding unincorporated area. Together, the City and surrounding unincorporated area
are termed the Planning Area. Every county and city in California is required by State law to adopt
a general plan (Article 5, Section 65300 et seq. of the Government Code).
A General Plan is often compared to a “constitution” for local development, and serves as the policy
basis for all land use decisions.
Participants and Process
The Grass Valley General Plan Update commenced June 30, 1998 with a “kickoff” meeting at the
Grass Valley City Hall.
From the outset, Grass Valley General Plan Update was aided by the leadership of an appointed
Steering Committee. The Steering Committee had eight members, appointed by the City Council.
Two were Council members, two were members of the Planning Commission, and four were
Members-at-Large.
Members of the Steering Committee:
          !   Linda Stevens, Councilmember/Vice Mayor (Committee Chair)
          !   Patti Ingram, Councilmember
          !   Lisa Swarthout, Planning Commissioner
          !   Howard Levine, Planning Commissioner
          !   Paul Aguilar, Member-at-Large
          !   Sharon Boivin, Member-at-Large
          !   Mark Johnson, Member-at-Large (former Mayor)
          !   Paul Schwartz, Member-at-Large
The Steering Committee was appointed effective June 1, 1998, and participated in consultant
selection and pre-project activities. The Steering Committee has guided General Plan activities
through bi-monthly meetings with staff and consultants; sponsored Public Workshops designed to
afford members of the public opportunity to participate in General Plan development; and served as
the City’s decision-making body throughout General Plan formulation.
Staff support was provided by City Administrator Gene Haroldsen, Community Development
Department Director Kyle Kollar, City Planner Bill Roberts, Associate Planner Gary Price, and
Planning Commission Clerk Judy Roth.

City of Grass Valley, California

The lead consultant on the General Plan Update was Quad Knopf of Roseville, California, represented
by Gene Smith, Vice President and Director of Planning.
Sub-consultants are:
          !   Mogavero Notestine Associates (Community Design)
          !   Hausrath Economics Group (Economics, Market and Fiscal Analysis)
          !   kdAnderson Transportation Engineers (Circulation)
          !   Brown-Buntin Associates (Noise)
          !   Cultural Resources Unlimited (Historical/Cultural)
General Plan Elements
The 1998-99 Grass Valley General Plan Update includes revisions to the following General Plan
Elements:
          ! Land Use
          ! Circulation
          ! Conservation/Open Space (formerly separate elements being combined)
          ! Noise
          ! Safety (formerly Safety and Seismic Safety Elements, being combined)
          ! Community Design (formerly Urban Design)
          ! Historical
          ! Recreation
The consulting team assisting in General Plan preparation conducted the Environmental Impact
Report on the General Plan. “Issue Areas” addressed in the EIR were:
          !        Land Use and Planning
          !        Air Quality
          !        Biological Resources
          !        Cultural Resources
          !        Geology and Soils
          !        Hazards
          !        Hydrology and Water Quality
          !        Noise
          !        Parks and Recreation
          !        Public Services and Utilities
          !        Transportation and Traffic
Planning Area
Figure 1-1 shows the Planning Area for the Grass Valley General Plan Update. The Planning Area
comprises the city limits (also shown in Figure 1-1) plus unincorporated portions of Nevada County
2020 General Plan                                 1-2                                  November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

surrounding the City of Grass Valley. Figure 1-1 also shows the current Grass Valley Sphere of
Influence.
City General Plans typically embrace more than just the city limits, reaching out into peripheral
unincorporated areas. This practice allows General Plans, which are updated every 10 to 20 years,
to include areas outside the city which: 1) are likely to be candidates for annexation during the life
of the General Plan, 2) affect, and are affected by, city actions and 3) receive, or might reasonably
be expected to receive, city services.
All California cities have a sphere of influence, typically encompassing an area broader that the city
limits. The sphere of influence is useful for purposes of planning service and facility extensions, and
for establishing joint city/county land use planning and regulation prior to annexation.
Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Implementation Actions and Strategies
The General Plan is fundamentally a “policy document.” The goals, objectives, and policies contained
in the General Plan will be used to guide the city’s physical growth and development during the next
twenty years.
By definition, a “goal” is a general expression of community values which sets a direction or ideal
future end, condition, or state. An “objective” represents a specific end condition which is viewed
as an intermediate step toward attainment of a goal. A policy is a specific statement to be used in
guiding decision making, based on General Plan goals and objectives. Implementation actions and
strategies are directives which carry out General Plan policies.
Goals, objectives, policies, and implementation actions and strategies are divided into subject areas
based on the various General Plan Elements. The numbering system is based upon the subject area
and type of statement. The following abbreviations are used:
          !        Goal (G)
          !        Objective (O)
          !        Policy (P)
          !        Implementation Actions and Strategies (I)

CHAPTER TWO
VISION STATEMENT
The 2020 General Plan will serve as our guide and road map for the next twenty years. Extensive
analysis, study, and debate has taken place in order to assure our community’s thoughts, ideals, and
values would be embraced in the updated plan.
The General Plan’s goals, objectives, policies, and implementation measures are intended to facilitate
a climate of preserving, protecting, maintaining, and enhancing the quality of life we value in Grass
Valley. This includes our neighborhoods, commercial and public lands, and areas of future expansion.
Grass Valley plays a significant role in our community region. Our updated General Plan directs us
to reach out beyond our traditional functions and facilitate relationships with Nevada County, other
public entities, special districts, and agencies to actualize the intent of the General Plan. Ultimately,
the General Plan strives to create a congruence between our values and the reality of the times in
which we live.

                                                                                              July, 1999
Looking Toward the Next Millennium
The 2020 General Plan is Grass Valley’s fourth General Plan in more than 100 years of cityhood.
The first three General Plans (adopted in 1966, 1972, and 1982 respectively) were built around
central themes. All continue to be as important today as in past decades.
!         Preserve historical character and encourage restoration.
!         Expand public services to serve growing population.
!         Encourage variety in residential building types and environments.
!         Including high density housing areas in the town center.
!         Provide better regional connections.
!         Improve the circulation patterns within the City.
!         Protect and improve the downtown area.
!         Diversify the economy and locate industry to avoid undue traffic.
!         Preserve scenic beauty and character.
The General Plan update process has given the leaders and citizens of Grass Valley an opportunity
to re-affirm certain directions, reverse others, and introduce new issues and choices.
Many jurisdictions wrestle with conflicts between an expanding economy and environmental quality.
Such conflicts can cause lasting rifts unless properly addressed and resolved. Despite the potential
for controversy inherent in any change, the fundamental purpose of planning is to deal effectively with
change. The General Plan will serve as a vehicle for consensus rather than conflict.

Quality of Life
Quality of life factors have been given priority over quantitative measures of success and progress.
Quality of life means different things to different people. As used here, it refers to several abstract
concepts associated with the livability of a particular place. However intangible, several quality of
life factors are of the utmost importance to the people of Grass Valley. Through the General Plan
process the City has identified and planned based upon quality of life factors.
Grass Valley residents value highly the City’s small town, rural character and sense of community.
Grass Valley’s friendliness and community consciousness stand in sharp contrast to the perceived
alienation often associated with impersonal large cities and modern suburbs. Closely associated with
small town, rural character are convenience (nothing is far from anything else) and proximity to open
space. The 2020 General Plan strives to maintain Grass Valley’s small town character and sense
of community in a number of ways, including an emphasis on infill development, neighborhood
integrity, community design and creation of community and neighborhood gathering places.
Aesthetics contribute to Grass Valley’s quality of life. As interpreted from public workshops and
listening sessions, aesthetic values associated with the City include trees, various other natural
amenities, views, architectural features, and the historical look and feel of the downtown area. High
on the list of aesthetic priorities are the entryways to and highway corridors through town. Also of
prime concern aesthetically: development of now-outlying properties such as Loma Rica Ranch,
North Star, Kenny Ranch, and the Bear River Mill site.
History continues to live in Grass Valley. As well as any Sierra Nevada town, Grass Valley exhibits
the settlement and progression of western towns from the mid-19th century through the early 20th
century. A sense of history is pervasive, from ever-present reminders of gold mining heritage to fine
examples of architecturally interesting and significant buildings. Historic preservation and
enhancement figure prominently in the General Plan and supporting implementation measures.
The Role of Grass Valley in the Regional Context
Despite a relatively small resident population (approximately 10,000) the City of Grass Valley is the
regional economic and cultural center for perhaps seven times that population throughout parts of
four Counties. Planning for Grass Valley means planning to accommodate the needs of people who
use the City but are not necessarily City residents.
Substantial land area is presently devoted to commercial, industrial, and other business uses. The
medical community is large and expanding. Sierra College adds to a growing educational community
and employment base. Despite some concerns about becoming a bedroom community, Grass Valley
and the immediate vicinity have more jobs than employed residents. Any plan to establish a balance
between jobs and housing must consider the City’s regional function.
Residentially, Grass Valley provides approximately 55% of Nevada County’s multi-family housing
units, although the City has but 12% of the County’s total housing stock. Nearly 60% of City
2020 General Plan                                   2-2                                  November, 1999

residents rent. Thus, the City of Grass Valley is the regional focal point for rental and multi-family
housing, a market likely to expand considerably by the Year 2020.
Grass Valley’s role as a regional economic and cultural hub, combined with the ambience of
downtown, has given rise to a number of interesting civic improvement ideas: a hotel-conference
center, a performing arts center, a multi-theater cinema complex, and a large open plaza for various
gatherings. Hopefully, the 2020 General Plan will facilitate constructive change.
Future Development within the Present City Limits
The population of Grass Valley and its Planning Area, estimated at 16,000, is projected to grow to
23,395 by the Year 2020. Infill development on undeveloped land within the City of Grass Valley
is an important facet of the 2020 General Plan. Infill, and a compact development pattern will
facilitate efficient use of land with a minimum of public service extensions. About one-quarter of the
City remains undeveloped. Some of this land, however, is so constrained by natural factors that
development may never occur.
It is realistic to expect infill development to accommodate about one-third of new housing in the
Planning Area, including the City in the next 20 years. Depending on market factors, infill may be
able to provide a larger percentage of non-residential development, but by no means will it be able
to meet the total commercial and industrial land demand.
Although the basic development patterns within the city limits are already established, much can and
should be done over the 20-year life of the 2020 General Plan. Fine tuning, rather than wholesale
reconstruction, should be the watchword. Many outstanding, though subtle, land use concepts and
changes can enhance the City incrementally. Downtown may expand outward a bit, accompanied by
building “up rather than out”. Well-designed higher density housing can fit in if properly located, a
concept in keeping with Grass Valley’s most significant demographic characteristic -- a
disproportionately older-than-average population.
Renovation of individual homes and conservation of neighborhoods must keep up with further aging
of an already old housing stock. Existing commercial areas must renovate and intensify. Housing
code enforcement and effective use of re-development programs are essential “implementers” of the
2020 General Plan.
City Expansion
Expansion is nothing new to Grass Valley.
Since its early days as an unincorporated settlement, Grass Valley has often expanded its boundaries
to embrace and facilitate new development. From an original 361 acre Townsite in 1872, Grass
Valley has annexed 87 times to achieve its current, irregularly-shaped 3.9 square miles. All but two
expansions have occurred since 1940.
2020 General Plan                                   2-3                                  November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

The Planning Area comprises about 15.4 square miles, nearly four times the current area of the
incorporated City. A substantial portion of the region’s industrial and commercial development is
presently outside of the City but within the unincorporated Planning Area.
One of the Nevada County General Plan’s central themes is to direct urban growth into community
regions that can effectively and economically provide urban types of services. Grass Valley supports
a centralized growth concept. For many of the urban types of services required by future
development within the region, the City will be the logical service provider. These include both
relatively higher density residential land uses and non-residential uses.
Urban densities require urban services, and Grass Valley requires annexation prior to service
extension. The 2020 General Plan provides direction to future annexation, while stopping short of
dictating a rigid schedule.
Environmental Protection and Enhancement
Grass Valley’s environmental setting is both the object of affection and concern for the citizens of
Grass Valley. The area’s hills, trees, streams, and meadows draw and captivate residents. But these
same natural features are sensitive to alteration, and may be destroyed or seriously impaired in the
course of land development.
Environmental challenges and opportunities are many: setting aside environmentally sensitive areas;
preserving open space; park and nature trail development; and restoring or reclaiming abused areas.
All are addressed effectively in the 2020 General Plan, but all require a strong commitment to
implementation.
The 2020 General Plan introduces an innovative technique for continually identifying promising open
space opportunities without jeopardizing private property rights.
The 2020 General Plan envisions unprecedented support and assistance from private organizations.
The Nevada County Land Trust and similar organizations may be of considerable assistance in
protecting natural areas while achieving equitable arrangements for landowners willing to negotiate
development rights. Rare botanical species and their supporting environs in and near Grass Valley
have been identified and described by the California Native Plant Society.
A concept often mentioned in past General Plans but still awaiting implementation is the Wolf Creek
Riparian Corridor and linear trail. The Trails-Sidewalks Network connects outlying areas with
downtown Grass Valley, connects parks and recreation areas with one another, provides both
recreation and transportation, and assures the protection of a linear wildlife habitat. Wolf Creek, the
Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad right-of-way and Wolf Creek South Fork are key elements
in the Trails-Sidewalks Network.
Grass Valley’s existing park system consists of lands donated to the City over the years. While
attractive and pleasant, City parks are unevenly distributed, resulting in some areas being well served
while others are underserved. The 2020 General Plan contains a framework for a park and recreation
2020 General Plan                                  2-4                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

system, designed to meet current and future needs throughout the City and expanded in scope to
include natural areas, open space, and passive parks as well as active parks and play fields.
Transportation
Transportation policy evolved in tandem with land use policy during the course of the 2020 General
Plan The General Plan Update Steering Committee was determined to make the Circulation Element
of the General Plan responsive to land use and environmental directives.
Public meetings and workshops made clear the desire of citizens for transportation alternatives to the
automobile. At the same time, they expect solutions to present-day congestion. Citizens want to
avoid through traffic in residential neighborhoods, or at least want it “calmed”, resulting in traffic
which is slower, less disruptive, and less dangerous to pedestrians.
Alternatives to the automobile most desired are bicycle and pedestrian ways, including trails, paths,
sidewalks, bike lanes, and similar facilities. Alternative transportation systems need to connect
identified nodes, form real networks, and be made known to the general public.
Transit has captured the imagination of many Grass Valley residents, particularly in the form of
smaller, flexible vehicles circulating frequently within small geographic areas and serving carefully-
defined transportation needs.
Alternative transportation is not expected to render vehicular transportation obsolete. Rather,
alternatives should be viewed as supplemental, available in appropriate circumstances. To the extent
that alternative transportation can be provided economically, is able to meet the needs of those who
use it, and gets cars off the road, it will be a success.
Implementation of the comprehensive Trails-Sidewalks Network is a high priority. Previous General
Plans have included versions of a trail system. Certainly, planning and developing a comprehensive
pedestrian/bicycle system will be difficult and expensive. For that reason, multi-purpose
pathways/trails/sidewalks designed to meet the needs of (and be funded jointly by) both transportation
and recreation interests are planned.
Intergovernmental Coordination and Cooperation
The 2020 Grass Valley General Plan cannot be implemented in a vacuum. Other governmental units
and special districts will play a key role in the process and final decisions.
The Nevada County General Plan (adopted in 1995) was instrumental in helping establish the
boundaries of the Grass Valley Planning Area and to guide land use and other decisions made during
the plan update process. Coordination with the County will increase as implementation of specific
recommendations and concepts start to take shape. Likewise, the City of Grass Valley must
coordinate with Nevada City, Nevada Irrigation District, fire suppression agencies, forestry and land
conservation agencies, school districts, air and water quality regional agencies, and other public
service providers.

CHAPTER THREE
LAND USE ELEMENT
Introduction
The Land Use Element has the broadest scope of the mandatory General Plan elements. Government
Code Section 65302(a) describes the required contents of the Land Use Element as follows:
          “A land use element ... designates the proposed general distribution and general location and
          extent of the uses of the land for housing, business, industry, open space, including
          agriculture, natural resources, recreation, and enjoyment of scenic beauty, education, public
          buildings and grounds, solid and liquid waste disposal facilities, and other categories of public
          and private uses of land. The land use element shall include a statement of the standards of
          population density and building intensity recommended for the various districts and other
          territory covered by the plan”.
The State of California Office of Planning and Research publication General Plan Guidelines (1998
Edition) further explains the land use element:
          “The land use element functions as a guide to planners, the general public, and decision
          makers as to the ultimate pattern of development for the city or county. The land use element
          has perhaps the broadest scope of the seven mandatory elements ... it plays a central role in
          correlating all land use issues into a set of coherent development policies ... In practice, it is
          the most visible and often used elements in the local general plan. Although all elements carry
          equal weight, the land use element is often perceived as being the most representative of the
          general plan. The land use element has a pivotal role in zoning, subdivision, and public works
          decisions. The element’s objectives and policies provide a long-range context for those short
          term actions.”
Existing Land Use
Existing land use information is essential to an understanding of current development patterns and
acreages devoted to particular land uses. Existing land use information for the Grass Valley Planning
area was developed by the Grass Valley Community Development Department in early 1999. The
information was entered into the Quad Knopf/City of Grass Valley geographic information system
on a parcel basis, then used for statistical analysis and mapping. Figure 3-1 is the Existing Land Use
map.
2020 General Plan                                     3-1                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

General Plan Land Use Classification System
To translate the goals, objectives, and policies of the Land Use Element into diagram or map form,
a set of designations or classifications must be adopted to serve as a guide for general land use
distribution. Determining the land use designation for any area is generally based on multiple criteria,
which may include:
          !        Existing patterns of development when compatible with goals, objectives, and policies
                   of the General Plan
          !        Accessibility/circulation
          !        Availability of public services and facilities and potential for their expansion or
                   extension
          !        Geo-physical characteristics of the area such as slope, wetland or flood prone
                   designation, soils, geology, vegetative cover, and biological significance
          !        Existing parcel size
          !        Desire to protect or buffer certain uses from other, incompatible uses
The land use designations described below and used in this General Plan have been modified from the
Grass Valley General Plan adopted in 1982, with some notable changes. Following is a summary
outlining the new General Plan Land Use Classification System structure.
                   Residential Land Uses

City of Grass Valley, California
                             Open Space (OS)
The 2020 General Plan contains two concepts not found in previous Grass Valley General Plans.
They are the 1) Mixed Use and 2) Overlay Designations categories.
Within the Mixed Use category are Business Park (BP) and Special Development Area (SDA). For
SDA-designated areas, the City shall require petitioning owners to prepare additional plans (such as
a specific plan, master plan, or similar instrument) for subsequent submittal to and approval by the
City. This procedure may be required for BP-designated areas, at the discretion of the City. Mixed
Use allows, but does not require, a combination of residential, “job-generating” and other land uses.
Within a Business Park (BP) designation, for example, a typical “mix”includes light industrial and
office-professional land uses operating compatibly within the conditions imposed by the business
park, as well as the City. Individual land uses within any Mixed Use category are to be designated
according to their most generic characteristics (UMD, M-I, OP, etc.). Special Development Area
(SDA) is intended to be a temporary designation, pending adoption of a specific plan, master plan,
or similar instrument. Thereafter, the General Plan Land Use Classification System land use
designations (see page 3-2) or adopted specific plan provisions replace the SDA designation.
Overlay designations are 1) Town Center and 2) Open Space Opportunity. Overlay maps separate
from the Land Use Plan map are used to depict Town Center and Open Space Opportunity areas.
The Land Use Plan map, itself, depicts land use designations, but does not show the overlay maps.
Town Center (TC) is intended to pertain to and define downtown Grass Valley, the original 1872
Townsite, and areas near downtown which are considered to be “at the doorstep” of downtown. The
Town Center is intended to be the City’s central “neighborhood” for purposes of design standards,
architectural treatment, streetscape improvements, and historical preservation and enhancement.
Open Space Opportunity (OSO) has been a General Plan land use designation utilized by previous
General Plans. By making OSO an overlay over the General Plan Land Use map, the City
simultaneously expresses its intent to effectuate permanent open space while acknowledging the rights
of owners to utilize their properties in other ways if permanent open space status is not achieved.
Where OSO designation is implemented on a permanent basis, underlying land use are to be either
designated Open Space (OS) or, if appropriate Parks and Recreation (PR) on the Land Use Plan map.

City of Grass Valley, California

General Plan Land Use Designations Defined and Described
Urban Estate Density (UED)
The lowest density residential category in the General Plan, UED, requires one unit or less per gross
acre. For properties having access to both public water and sewer utilities, the density standard is
a maximum of one unit per gross acre. With one of the two utilities (public water or sewer), one-half
units per acre (two acres per unit) is the maximum density. With neither public water or sewer, the
maximum is one-third units per acre (three acres per unit). The designation is utilized on steeper
slopes, in areas already subdivided into estate-sized lots, and in other areas where location, availability
of public services, and public policy indicate lower overall residential densities. UED may,
alternatively, be used to encourage either low density large lots or higher density clusters, both
associated with lower overall population densities. Urban Estate Density is most compatible with the
Zoning Ordinance’s Residential Estate (RE) district.
Urban Low Density (ULD)
ULD requires between 1.01 and 4.0 residential units per gross acre. ULD is intended primarily for
single family detached houses, although higher density single family patio homes or town houses
could be accommodated, if offset with sufficient open space to maintain the gross density within the
indicated range. ULD is most compatible with the following Zoning districts: Single Family
Residential (R-1) and Two-Family Residence (R-2) districts.
Urban Medium Density (UMD)
UMD requires between 4.01 and 8.0 residential units per gross acre. UMD is intended to
accommodate single family detached and attached homes, single family patio homes, duplexes, and
town houses. Both single family and multi-family housing types are facilitated by UMD designation.
Urban Medium Density relates directly to the following Zoning categories: Single Family Residential
(R-1); Two-Family Residence (R-2) and Medium Density Residential (R2A).
Urban High Density (UHD)
UHD requires between 8.01 and 20.0 residential units per gross acre. UHD is intended to
accommodate town house or row house styles, higher density apartments and condominiums
(multiple family structural types), without distinction as to owner- or renter-occupancy. UHD relates
directly to the Zoning Ordinance’s Multiple Family (R-3) district.
Commercial (C)
Commercial is a broad category intended to encompass all types of retail commercial and commercial
service establishments in any one of a variety of locations. Locations include the Downtown Central
Business District, shopping centers, local or neighborhood locations, highway-oriented locations, or
concentrations along major streets. Commercial (C) relates to the following zoning classifications:
2020 General Plan                                    3-4                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Business (C-1); Central Business (C-2); Downtown Central Business (C-2-A); and Heavy
Commercial (C3).
Office and Professional (OP)
The OP classification provides for concentrations of free-standing offices and large office complexes.
The designation is intended to facilitate both offices and supporting activities and land uses.
Appropriate office uses include medical, dental, legal, architectural, engineering, contractors, and
banks. Offices within OP areas should be characterized by relatively low traffic volumes and the
absence of outdoor advertising and storage. Office and Professional (OP) designation relates most
directly to the Zoning Ordinance’s Office Professional (OP) and Corporate Business Park (CBP)
districts, and is also compatible with the several commercial districts, particularly Downtown Central
Business (C-2-A).
Manufacturing-Industrial (M-I)
M-I designation is intended to accommodate a variety of industrial and service commercial uses.
Although occupied by free-standing businesses without any overall internal plan or restrictions, M-I
districts benefit from some clustering of compatible industrial or service commercial uses. Typical
uses in M-I designated areas are: light manufacturing; automotive services, warehousing/ distribution;
and wholesale-retail outlets. The potential for adverse impacts from M-I activities heightens the
importance of proper location (relative to the surrounding community) and use of perimeter buffering.
Zoning districts compatible with General Plan M-I designation are Light Industrial (M-1), General
Industrial (M-2), and Industrial/Services (I/S).
Business Park (BP)
The Business Park designation replaces the Planned Employment Center (PEC) designation
introduced in the 1982 Grass Valley General Plan. Business Park is categorized as one of two mixed
use designations (Special Development Area, SDA, is the other). No changes are made in the
substance of the designation, but the Business Park title is both more descriptive and relates better
to zoning definitions. The intent of the BP designation is to accommodate a variety of employment-
generating land uses in a master-planned, campus-type setting, designed to preserve and enhance the
natural environment and to be fully integrated into the larger community. Employment types include
a full range of industrial and commercial land uses. BP designation relates directly to Office
Professional Zoning (OP), plus two additional Zoning districts added by Ordinance in 1997:
Corporate Business Park (CBP) and Industrial/Services (I/S). Both CBP and I/S allow mixed land
uses and contain specific performance and design standards.
2020 General Plan                                    3-5                                  November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Special Development Area (SDA)
SDA designation is reserved for areas to be master planned or subject to a specific plan. When
imposed, SDA designation replaces previous General Plan designations within the subject property
(ies), and serves as a temporary “holding” classification pending completion and approval of a specific
plan, master plan, or similar instrument. SDA is a mixed use designation: a variety of land uses might
be proposed and approved under the aegis of the specific plan, master plan, or similar instrument.
SDA relates directly to the Interim Development Reserve (IDR) and Specific Plan (SP) Zoning
classifications.
Town Center (TC) - Overlay map
Town Center is one of two new “overlay” designations (Open Space Opportunity is the other). The
TC overlay defines Downtown Grass Valley. Town Center designation recognizes that design and
architectural features are of greater concern than land use designations in downtown, where “mixed
use” is both accepted and encouraged. Protection and enhancement of Downtown’s historic
character are the primary intentions of the TC district. Various land uses may be accommodated in
the TC district, so long as historic character and design/architectural standards are upheld.
“Underlying” land use designations are to be maintained on parcels within the TC overlay, although
TC standards override those of comparable zoning districts in cases of conflict. Town Center
encompasses Downtown Grass Valley properties clustered along South Auburn, Mill, and Main
Streets. Street-level commercial, specialty shops, restaurants, upper level residential and offices, and
cultural uses are encouraged. As an overlay designation, Town Center does not relate directly to
specific zoning districts.
Open Space Opportunity (OSO) - Overlay map
Open Space Opportunity is one of two “overlay” categories. OSO designation may be used to
acknowledge, reserve, and protect open space for any of the purposes of open space defined by State
law: preservation of natural resources; managed production of natural resources; outdoor recreation;
public health and safety. OSO designation may be used to protect either linear features (such as
riparian corridors, flood zones, or recreational trail corridors) or non-linear features (parcels
comprising would-be nature parks or forest preserves, for example). Underlying OSO designation
may be any generic General Plan designation. OSO may be imposed to reflect a permanent
imposition of open space status based on regulations, easements, or setbacks. Conversely, it may be
used temporarily to show public intent to secure permanent open space status where such status does
not yet exist. The OSO designation may be removed if satisfactory arrangements to secure such status
from a property owner are not implemented. As an overlay designation, OSO does not necessarily
relate to specific zoning districts, although it is directly compatible with the Open Space (OS) Zoning
district.
2020 General Plan                                       3-6                                November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Open Space (OS) - depicted on the Land Use Plan map
Open Space (OS) designation indicates that permanent open space status has been secured. Examples
of Open Space designations on the Land Use Plan map are areas set aside through development
agreements or previous development project conditions of approval, areas subject to current
regulation which effectively precludes development (possibly unique natural areas, wetlands, or high
hazard zones), areas which have been dedicated to the City or other governmental entity, or areas
placed in permanent open space by virtue of appropriate easement acquisition, CC&Rs, or similar
legal provisions. OS designation may apply to lands owned by either private parties or public
agencies, although public open space land might alternatively be designated Public (P) or Park and
Recreation (PR).
Public (P)
Public designation is used to identify areas in public sector ownership/control, and used for the
purpose of providing non-commercial facilities and services to meet public needs. Ownership and
control may be that of general purpose governmental units (city, county, State) or quasi-governmental
entities (special districts, school districts, commissions, authorities). Purposes for which Public (P)
designated areas are to be used are activities typically undertaken by the owning or controlling
entities. Examples are: administrative and other public-sector facilities, public parks, natural areas,
community centers, fire stations, schools and school properties, hospitals, public senior or child care
facilities. P designation is most comparable to the Public (P) Zoning district.
Institutional, Non-governmental (ING)
Institutional, Non-governmental (ING) designation is a new designation in the 2020 General Plan.
ING is used to identify areas in non-governmental institutional ownership/control. It is intended to
accommodate facilities and services to meet community needs. Ownership and control may vary:
non-profit organizations, medical and related health care institutions, religious institutions, private
academic institutions, pubic service clubs, and the like. Purposes for which ING designated areas are
to be used are activities typically undertaken by the owning or controlling entities. Examples are:
religious institutions and related properties, administrative facilities, recreational areas, community
centers, meeting halls, private schools and school properties, hospitals, senior and child care facilities.
ING designation is roughly comparable to the Public (P) Zoning district, although it may relate to
various other classifications, depending upon the activities being undertaken.
Schools (S)
Schools (S) designation is used specifically to reserve sites to be limited to school facilities and
grounds. The directly related Zoning district is Public (P).
2020 General Plan                                   3-7                                     November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
Utilities (U)
The Utilities designation may be used to acknowledge or reserve sites for electric
generation/distribution, water storage/treatment/distribution, wastewater collection/treatment, or
natural gas/propane transmission/storage/distribution. Administrative and equipment storage and
repair facilities operated by public utilities may also be designated as Utilities. The primary intent of
the Utilities designation is to acknowledge the unique operating characteristics of utility operations,
and to assure the mutual protection of utilities and surrounding areas from adverse impacts. The
compatible Zoning district is Public (P). Conceivably, utility sites might be compatibly located within
any Zoning district, if properly conditioned to assure compatibility.
Parks and Recreation (PR)
PR designation may be used to acknowledge or reserve sites for parks and public recreation,
including: existing or anticipated parks, public outdoor recreation sites, campgrounds, and the like.
PR may also include natural areas intended for recreational use: open space lands, trails and
pathways, flood plains, and riparian zones. Parks and Recreation designation is compatible with the
Recreation (REC, adopted in 1997), Open Space (OS) and Public (P) Zoning districts.
Selected Zoning Districts and Concepts Pertinent to the General Plan
Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning. A floating zone allowing flexibility and innovation within
a plan for the development of an area, including concepts as cluster development, a mixture of
housing types and of land uses, and common ownership of open space and community facilities.
Specific Plan (SP) Zoning. Provides for the preparation, adoption, and administration of specific plans
as a means of systematically implementing the General Plan. Specific Plan enabling law: Government
Code Sections 65450-65554.
Interim Development Reserve (IDR) Zoning. Identifies the development potential of an area, but
postpones exact zoning boundary designations until after preparation of a master zoning plan or
specific plan. IDR Zoning may be used as a base zoning district or in combination with other zoning
district symbols expected to be included following master plan completion. IDR is typically used for
land to be annexed to the City, where City zoning is expected to be essentially the same as County
zoning.
Combining Zones. Combining zones are used in conjunction with basic zones, and are used to address
special concerns and afford special protections not otherwise applicable to the base district.
Combining districts are Historical (H), Design Review (DR), and Mobile home and Mobile home
Park (MMP).
Mixed Use Zoning. Allowance of two or more uses on a single parcel, or in a single structure or
development project.

City of Grass Valley, California
General Plan/Zoning Compatibility
Land uses associated with a particular General Plan designation may be permitted (either by right or
conditionally) in several Zoning districts. The following General Plan Designation/Zoning
Consistency Table (Table 3-1) identifies the Zoning categories most compatible with comparable
General Plan classifications.
Population Density and Building Intensity Standards
A General Plan must contain standards for population density and for building intensity, as established
by California case law. The courts further defined population density as “numbers of people per acre
and not dwelling units per acre.”
Table 3-2 shows standards related to population density and building intensity for the various General
Plan land use designations. The standards are:
          !        Minimum Parcel Size (in acres or square feet)
          !        Maximum Units per Acre (for residential designations)
          !        Maximum Population per Square Mile (for residential designations)
          !        Maximum Building Coverage
          !        Maximum Floor Area Ratio (for non-residential designations)
          !        Maximum Height (Residential)
          !        Maximum Height (Non-Residential)

Significant Trends
As with any long range plan, the 2020 Grass Valley General Plan is based in part upon certain
assumptions and expectations about prevailing social and economic trends. Identification and
interpretation of significant plan-affecting trends relied on several sources: City officials, the General
Plan Steering Committee, public opinion and advice at workshops and the public opinion survey, and
technical research, expertise, and observations of the consulting team.
Probable trends and tendencies, termed “dynamics and directions”, were developed for the following
major land use categories:
                   !         Commercial
                   !         Office/Professional
                   !         Manufacturing/Industrial
                   !         Residential
Commercial Dynamics
1.        Commercial “growth” (jobs, sales, tax contributions) occurs mainly in the form of turnover
          and upgrading within existing shopping centers and commercially-used buildings.
          Commercial growth is not solely dependent upon a continuing supply of vacant, readily
          developable, and commercially-zoned land.
2.        Commercial turnover and upgrading in Grass Valley will occur in response to several major
          stimuli, particularly Sierra College growth and development; growth in the medical/health
          care sector; a growing tourism/visitor-induced economy; and demographic changes,
          particularly the large and growing senior population.
3.        Since 1980, local commercial “infrastructure” has expanded faster than local population
          growth. With large, modern shopping centers, Grass Valley is capable of fulfilling its role as
          the regional commercial center for Western Nevada County. In the process, an “equilibrium”
          between demand (placed on the City as regional center) and supply (establishments, quality
          of goods, selection, etc.) has been established. Grass Valley is better able to serve the
          commercial needs of Western Nevada County than it was prior to 1980. In addition to the
          continued “pull” of Downtown, the Glenbrook area and Pine Creek Shopping Center area
          have contributed to Grass Valley’s regional preeminence.
4.        Downtown Grass Valley will remain a viable commercial node, as well as a cultural and
          historical focal point.
5.        Strong growth is anticipated for business-related support retail and services, medical-related
          goods and services, tourist-related services (lodging, restaurants), and enterprises geared to
          senior citizens and retirees.
2020 General Plan                                     3-12                                   November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Commercial Directions
1.        Intensified commercial activity, resulting from turnover, upgrading and re-development: in
          the Glenbrook area, Pine Creek Shopping Center vicinity, and along East Main Street from
          Highway 20/49 to Glenbrook.
2.        Commercial re-development, resulting in increased commercial activity in the following areas:
          East Main Street; Colfax Highway east of downtown; and South Auburn Street south of
          Highway 20/49.
3.        Limited new commercial clusters will develop. These will occur within annexation areas, as
          committed by annexation agreements and in the Highway 49/LaBarr Meadows Road (Bear
          River Mill site) vicinity. New clusters may help to fill “niches” not otherwise filled (large
          floor area establishments, specialized tourism functions, neighborhood service).
4.        Some conversions, primarily of residences to commercial uses.
5.        Mixed use within new residential developments and in some older neighborhoods.
6.        Commercial uses within business parks, as allowed by City regulations.
7.        Fringe commercial intensification, primarily at the immediate “edges” of the Glenbrook area
          and Downtown.
Office/Professional Dynamics
1.        Considerable future demand fueled by increases in medical services, professional services
          (engineering, legal) and business support services.
2.        Strong demand for small office-space leasing, to accommodate numerous small business
          operations. This demand will be somewhat tempered by in-home business boom.
3.        Less certainty concerning inclinations and tendencies of medium to large businesses, which
          have the options of building their own facilities, leasing within business parks, or leasing in
          existing for-lease office buildings. Business park office space occupants will be in the medium
          to large category — larger space leases but representing a small percentage of total
          office/professional occupying business community.
4.        Probable exponential increase in in-home business relying heavily on technology and
          telecommunications. Effects may be either modest or dramatic, in relation to the market for
          office space.
5.        Increased demand in office space for services requiring face-to-face client contact, with
          possible flat or declining demand for other types of services.
6.        Quality of office location, surroundings, will be of increasing importance.
Office/Professional Directions
1.        Business parks — supply of office/professional land in business parks to be substantial in early
          years, with Whispering Pines and Litton property available.
2.        Hospital vicinity and East Main strong contenders for new medical-related offices.
2020 General Plan                                    3-13                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

3.        Downtown office space increase, including street-level, upper stories of some downtown
          buildings, downtown fringe expansion, and some residential (or even commercial) conversion
          to offices.
4.        More modestly-priced small office complexes in Glenbrook and immediate vicinity, keeping
          with national trends of offices in or near busy shopping centers.
5.        Introduction of small or complexes and clusters, in contrast to larger business parks.
6.        Building up (2nd and 3rd stories) to facilitate offices in advantageous locations.
Manufacturing/Industrial Dynamics
1.        Difficult to predict, partly because relocations to and startup locations in Grass Valley are
          often 1) quality of life decisions of corporate decision-makers and 2) high tech firms, whose
          products and fortunes ebb and flow, defying precise long-term prognostication.
2.        Difficult to predict relocations and expansions of “basic” industries, whose products are
          almost exclusively exported from the Western Nevada County region, and whose fortunes are
          not tied to increases in local consumption, population, or wealth.
3.        For some high tech, research and development oriented firms, local linkages to other firms
          in the industry provide a rationale for a Grass Valley location.
4.        Small manufacturing, distribution, and industrial service companies are predominant in the
          local industrial community, and are likely to continue to predominate. This has implications
          for land and facility requirements.
5.        While Grass Valley has strong quality of life and high tech “think tank” advantages, it is
          comparatively disadvantaged in terms of transportation facilities (railroads, interstate
          highways, commercial air facilities) and large available water supply. Industries requiring
          those locational features will locate elsewhere.
Manufacturing/Industrial Directions
1.        Intensification of industrial land uses and overall upgrading possible at Loma Rica Industrial
          Park. County interest in enhancement, plus possible availability of Grass Valley City sewer
          service, point to industrial/employment expansion at Loma Rica Industrial Park.
2.        Existing business parks, including the both Whispering Pines and the new Litton Business
          Park, offer considerable potential for certain types and sizes of light industrial and research
          and development companies.
3.        Additional large quantities of land designated “Planned Employment Center” (allowing
          industrial and other land uses) exist within three of the Special Development Areas (Loma
          Rica Ranch, North Star, Kenny Ranch). The term “Planned Employment Center” is being
          replaced by “Business Park”, effective as of adoption of the 2020 General Plan.
2020 General Plan                                     3-14                                  November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Residential Dynamics
1.        Demographics continue to dictate a large proportion of single-member and small households
          (seniors and non-senior singles, empty nesters, young married couples without children,
          divorced persons).
2.        Affordability, long a factor in Grass Valley’s housing market, will remain a strong influence.
3.        Multi-family housing now accounts for over 40% of Grass Valley’s housing stock. Grass
          Valley’s multi-family housing constitutes 75% of the County total. The importance and
          influence of multi-family housing will grow during the 20-year planning period, and is
          projected to provide 45% of all new housing in the Planning Area.
4.        An older (on average) single family housing stock indicates a future need for widespread code
          enforcement, rehabilitation, and conservation.
5.        Neighborhood enhancement and preservation are considered essential “community builders”
          by city officials and citizens alike. As neighborhood strengthening improvements such as
          parks, trails, sidewalks, and other public amenities are provided, investment in and
          maintenance of older housing occurs.
6.        The General Plan projects the need for a net increase of 2,820 new housing units in the Grass
          Valley Planning area from 1999 to 2020. Of these, 55% (1,551) are projected to be single
          family units, 45% (1,269) multi-family units.
7.        It is assumed that 1,200 additional residential accommodations will be provided in the form
          of senior living/care facilities of various types during the 20-year planning period.
Residential Directions
1.        Just over one-half of the 20-year housing demand in the Planning area can be accommodated
          through a combination of infill (vacant residentially-designated land within the city) and
          annexation agreement commitments to Loma Rica Ranch, North Star, and Kenny Ranch.
2.        Optimally, 32% (900 units) of total housing demand (2,820) can be accommodated through
          infill. Only 23% (643) of the projected 20-year net new housing demand can be satisfied as
          allowed by annexation agreements, even if the three areas were to “build out” their full
          housing unit allocations within the 20-year time frame.
3.        Multi-family demand will likely be met by a medium and high density residential-designated
          areas in infill areas of the City and new neighborhoods following annexation. The East
          Bennett neighborhood has been designated medium density to fill this need at a relatively
          close-in location.
4.        Current annexation agreements with Loma Rica Ranch, North Star, and Kenny Ranch could
          be revised to specify the densities required for multi-family housing and/or numbers of multi-
          family units targeted.

Land Use Plan Map
Figure 3-2 is the 2020 General Plan Land Use Plan map, depicting land uses for the designations
described previously. The Land Use Plan map is the end result of:
          !        Existing (1982) General Plan designations, and a City policy to minimize changes in
                   order to maintain continuity with past regulations.
          !        Supply/Demand studies of various land uses, conducted by General Plan consultants
                   as part of the 2020 General Plan planning process.
          !        The goals, objectives, policies developed during the planning process and contained
                   within this General Plan.
          !        Provisions of General Plan Elements, particularly the Housing Element and Mineral
                   Resources Element, unaffected by the 2020 General Plan update.
          !        Examination of land use alternatives by the General Plan Steering Committee, and
                   selection of a preferred alternative. Alternatives examination and selection considered
                   major “direction setting” factors as public service extension and development within
                   identified watersheds.
          !        Criteria listed on page 3-2 of this Chapter.
          !        City Council decisions based on localized and site-specific considerations.
Twenty-Year Development Map
The General Plan Land Use Plan map assigns a land use designation to all properties within the
Planning Area. If the entire Planning Area were to be developed as depicted on the Land Use Plan
map, the Planning Area would be considered “built out”. The basic projections developed during the
General Plan process for the 20-year planning period (to the Year 2020) — population, housing units,
employment, and demand for land — clearly indicate that less than full “build out” will occur by the
Year 2020.
Figure 3-3, the Twenty Year Development map, divides the Planning Area into three geographic
areas: core, fringe, and periphery. For each area, percentages of remaining development capacity
is shown for 1) residential land uses and 2) employment generating land uses (commercial,
manufacturing, business park, etc.). Percentages are contained in a tabular form on Figure 3-3.
Using Figure 3-3 in combination with the Land Use Plan map (Figure 3-2) the “buildout capacity”of
various land uses can be determined (numbers of units for housing, acreage for employment
generating land uses). Thus, within the core area, 95% of the potential housing units and 50% of
commercial/industrial acreage is projected to be developed during the Planning period. In all three
geographic areas (core, fringe, and periphery) residential land use is projected to approach capacity,
or “build out”, to a greater extent than employment-generating land use by the Year 2020. Figure
3-3 and the percentage formula thereon is not intended to be used as a phasing or sequencing plan
for future annexations.
2020 General Plan                                      3-16                                   November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Special Development Areas (SDAs)
Four areas are designated Special Development Area (SDA) on the General Plan Land Use Plan map.
They are Loma Rica Ranch, North Star, Kenny Ranch, and the Bear River Mill Site. The first three
have been subjects of annexation agreements between the City of Grass Valley and the respective
owners. Annexation agreements have resulted in the allocation of acreage to various land uses, and
a fixed number of housing units to be allowed.
Figure 3-4 shows the locations of the four SDAs. Included in Figure 3-4 are small insets containing
the annexation agreement acreage allocations and housing unit commitments for the three SDAs with
existing annexation agreements.
The General Plan does not locate the land uses (as committed by annexation agreements) on the Land
Use Plan map. This will be accomplished during subsequent development planning. The General
Plan does, however, encourage the following regarding land use in the North Star SDA, in order to
assure the area’s neighborhood continuity with neighborhoods in southern Grass Valley:
          North Star is encouraged to locate all residential and neighborhood commercial land uses in
          the northern one-third of the North Star property, in order to provide a linkage to existing
          development within the City and facilitate efficient City service and infrastructure extensions.
Additional SDAs may be designated in the future.
Town Center Overlay
Figure 3-5 is the Town Center Overlay map. As described earlier, the Town Center concept is
intended to cover downtown and the surrounding areas. Town Center is intended to be used to
designate selected areas and properties for mixed uses, or to apply special development criteria or
guidelines separate and apart from those peculiar to their underlying (Land Use Plan map) land uses.
Downtown Grass Valley
The 2020 General Plan perceives Downtown Grass Valley as continuing its role as the cultural center
of the broader western Nevada County region, and recommends policies to assure that role.
Numerous individual projects are identified as appropriate for Downtown: a plaza, a conference
center, performing arts center; and even transit center.
Figure 3-6 is map of Downtown, using the boundaries of the Downtown Parking and Business
Improvement District as the definition of the Downtown area.

City of Grass Valley, California

Neighborhoods
Figure 3-7 shows Grass Valley’s “neighborhoods”, a combination of identifiable historic districts and
modern developments. The 2020 General Plan supports the concept of neighborhood identification,
preservation, and enhancement. Neighborhoods are to be the basis for appropriate types of planning,
facilities, and services. It is understood that, in establishing neighborhoods boundaries, the City of
Grass Valley must have considerable flexibility, and that the Neighborhoods map as shown in Figure
3-7 is only intended as a guide to establishing such boundaries.

CHAPTER FOUR
CIRCULATION ELEMENT
Introduction
State law requires that a Circulation Element include "the general location and extent of existing and
proposed major thoroughfares, transportation routes, terminals and other public utilities and
facilities". This element defines transportation facilities, and includes the goals, policies and
implementation measures for the City's circulation system. The Circulation Element's provisions are
mandated by State law to be correlated with, and thus support, the goals, objectives, and policies of
the Land Use Element.
It is the underlying goal of the entire Circulation Element that the City's circulation system 1) promote
the safe, efficient and reliable movement of the people and goods; 2) facilitate a level of transition
from the automobile to other modes of transportation; and 3) provide an adequate level of
transportation service for all persons traveling in and through Grass Valley.
As in most areas, to travel within or through the Grass Valley vicinity, one is very dependent on the
automobile. Until recently, this dependence was not viewed as a critical issue. That is no longer the
case. Traffic congestion is no longer confined to major urban centers. Some of the worst recurring
traffic conditions in the area occur along Highway 49. Some of the City's collectors and arterials,
particularly Main Street and in the unincorporated area of Nevada County, Brunswick Road, are now
experiencing regular peak hour congestion.
Travel demand is expected to increase as the City population increases to the levels forecasts for the
year 2020. This population increase, coupled with increases in employment, will challenge the City
to find solutions which will maintain roadway Level of Service standards.
For these reasons, the City is committed to actively pursuing policies and implementation measures
that will promote car-pooling, transit and non-vehicular modes of travel (bicycles and walking) as
alternatives to single-occupant automobile use. In this effort, the City will be making a long-term
commitment to alternative forms of transportation.
No City or County is an island in its regional setting. It is, therefore, important that the City
coordinate its Circulation Element provisions with neighboring jurisdictions, and with regional and
State plans.
The provisions of the Circulation Element affect the community's physical, social and economic
environment. The location, design and constituent modes of the City's circulation system affect air
quality, noise, energy use, community appearance, land use patterns and other factors. The
circulation system should be accessible to all segments of the population, including the disadvantaged,
the young, the poor, the elderly and the handicapped. In addition, the efficiency of a community's
circulation system can either contribute to or adversely affect the community's economy. All of these
factors must be considered in developing circulation policy.
2020 General Plan                                    4-1                                     November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
The Circulation Element discusses the following components of the circulation system.
          1.       Functional Classification
          2.       Level of Service
          3.       Transit
          4.       Non-vehicular Transportation
Functional Classification
The objective of functional classification is to group into connecting systems roads and streets having
similar functions, purposes and importance in the roadway network. In turn, the systems are
distinguished by their more general functions and levels of importance.
Careful long-range planning of the City's roadways is needed to meet Grass Valley's Circulation goals.
This includes the establishment of a comprehensive designation of all roadways throughout the City.
A sound functional classification is essential for:
          !        Long-range planning and coordination
          !        Determining right-of-way requirements and preserving right-of-way
          !        Defining design standards and operations of facilities in each class
          !        Developing budgets and funding programs according to priority
          !        Determining acceptable levels of traffic volumes, especially on the local and collector
                   street systems
Roadways have two functions, which are incompatible from a design standpoint: 1) to provide
mobility and 2) to provide land access. High and constant speeds are desirable for land access. A
functional classification system provides a functional specialization in meeting the access and mobility
requirements of the roadways. Local streets emphasize a high level of mobility for through
movement, and collectors offer a more balanced service for both functions.
The existing street network in the City of Grass Valley is a product of both roadways that have
provided access to the older portions of the City for decades, and roadways that were designed to
serve the areas of new development. As a result, in the older portions of the City, some roadways
function as arterial or collector roadways, but they have not previously been classified as such.
Freeways / Expressways. Freeways and Expressways are regionally important facilities which link the
community of Grass Valley with its Nevada County neighbors and with regional destinations. These
facilities are high speed, restricted access facilities providing little direct linkage to adjoining property
but providing access via interchanges or, in the interim, major signalized intersections. Freeways and
Expressways are designed to the standards of the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans)
and improvements to these facilities are planned and implemented through a cooperative effort of
Caltrans, the Nevada County Transportation Commission, Nevada County, the City of Grass Valley
and Nevada City. State Highways 20 and 49 are the Freeways and Expressways serving Grass
Valley.
2020 General Plan                                       4-2                                     November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
Arterial Streets. The primary function of arterial roadways is to move large volumes of traffic
through the community to other sections of the City and beyond. In more recently developed areas
the right-of-way for arterials is either 84 or 100 feet, and while most arterials are two lanes, four lane
arterials can be developed in response to traffic demands. Some roadways function as arterials due
to the current high traffic volumes and their key linkages between one section of the City and another.
For these roadways, current right-of-way widths vary, but most contain only two traffic lanes.
Collector Streets. Collector streets generally link local residential streets and commercial and office
parking areas to the arterials. In new areas, these streets are generally designed with a 54 or 60 foot
right-of-way and contain two traffic lanes with bike lanes. In older portions of the community, a
number of roadways function as collector roadways due to moderate traffic volumes and their linkage
to the arterial roadway system. Right-of-way widths vary, with most containing two traffic lanes.
Local Streets. Local streets provide direct access to abutting land and access to the collector street
system. The right-of-way for local streets is normally 54 feet which provides for two traffic lanes and
a narrow parking lane that doubles as a Class II bikeway on both sides. Actual pavement widths for
local streets vary throughout the City.
The Circulation Plan (existing and planned arterial and collector roadway system) is depicted in
Figure 4-1 and Table 4-1. All roadways not included as freeways, arterial, or collector roadways in
Figure 4-1 and Table 4-1 are local streets. Conceptual alignments through planned annexations areas
indicate potential ultimate connections of existing and planned arterials. The exact location and need
for each new roadway in the Special Development Areas will be evaluated during the preparation of
Specific Plans or similar detailed development plans.
New transportation facilities needs as shown on the Circulation Plan (Figure 4-1) are:
!         Construction of a new interchange on Highway 20/49 at Dorsey Drive.
!         Construction of a new intersection or interchange on Highway 49 in the area of Crestview
          Drive-Smith Road in southern Grass Valley.
!         Construction of a new arterial road through the North Star area linking the
          Brighton/McCourtney intersection near Highway 20 with the new Crestview-Smith
          intersection or interchange on Highway 49. This new road would be connected to a
          southward extension of Freeman Lane. It is the City’s policy, however, that Freeman Lane
          not be extended southward from its current termination north of Wolf Creek, until and unless
          the new Crestview-Smith arterial road is constructed.
!         Extension of Dorsey Drive easterly to Brunswick Road.
!         Reconstruction of the McKnight Way Interchange on Highway 49 to create modern
          roundabout intersections.
!         Reconstruction of the Highway 174/Highway 20/49 interchange as a modern roundabout.
!         Construction of a new road network in the northeastern quadrant of the Planning Area,
          linking existing and planned streets and roads.
!         Closure of Idaho-Maryland road at the Brunswick Road intersection.

All roadways not listed here are designated as local streets.
Another important component of the City's functional classification are truck routes. Currently the
City has no designated truck routes within the Grass Valley City limits, although trucks are prohibited
on East Maryland Drive.
Level of Service
For General Plan level analysis, the levels of service (LOS) on individual roadway segments is
determined based on general daily traffic volume thresholds which account for such factors as the
level of access control, terrain, traffic control, etc. The thresholds employed in the Nevada County
General Plan and by the Nevada County Transportation Commission (NCTC) in previous regional
studies were used. These daily traffic volume standards are presented in Table 4-2.

Currently there are four roadway segments in the Planning Area which fail to deliver LOS "D"
conditions. As shown in Table 4-3, these are:

The City intends to mitigate these roadway deficiencies through its Capital Improvement Program
which is described in the implementation section of this component.
Levels of Service are also determined for intersections using procedures outlined in the 1994
Highway Capacity Manual. Table 4-4 indicates the characteristics of Levels of Service at
intersections controlled by stop signs and by traffic signals.
Levels of Service are estimated for future travel conditions to ensure that a roadway will provide
acceptable operations for its "design life", which is commonly 20 years. For the General Plan, the
year 2020 will be used for estimating traffic demand and determining Levels of Service on the
roadway system. The City has established Level of Service "D" as the goal for both the General Plan
and for the development of Citywide and regional traffic impact fees.
2020 General Plan                                       4-5                                November, 1999

Existing and Future Traffic Conditions
An analysis of the roadway improvements needed to maintain a Level of Service "D" standard in the
year 2020 has been conducted using land use growth assumptions and the NCTPA sub-regional travel
demand model. Year 2020 roadway improvement needs are shown in Table 4-5. Figure 4-2 is an
index map showing numbered locations of traffic counts shown in Table 4-5. Numbered locations
correspond to road segments in the “Road” column. Figure 4-3 shows road segments requiring four
lanes by the Year 2020, based upon projected traffic volumes and an assumed LOS “D” or better.

!         The planned number of lanes for all new roadways in the annexation areas should be adequate
          to accommodate projected year 2020 P.M. peak hour traffic flows and provide a Level of
          Service "D". In these areas, feasible at-grade improvements were identified for all major
          intersections.
!         As shown in Figure 4-3, a number of existing roadways in the infill areas of the City will
          require widening to provide Level of Service "D" operating conditions in the year 2020.

          Some of these locations are already deficient, while others will experience increased traffic
          as a result of future growth. Also, a number of existing intersections will require
          improvements.
!         A number of existing intersections will require improvements to provide Level of Service “D”.
           As shown in Table 4-6, implementation of the General Plan Circulation Element and
          construction of the improvement projects included in the current General Plan, will result in
          satisfactory levels of Service at most locations.

          Although forecast traffic volumes suggest the need to widen a portion of Main Street to a
          four lane section, the City of Grass Valley recognizes that this level of improvement will likely
          prove to be impractical in the segment of Main from Alta Street east to Idaho-Maryland
          Road. While the resulting traffic conditions on this road may exceed the LOS “D” standard,
          the City is committed to maintaining adequate traffic flow in this area by increasing
          intersection capacity, developing parallel routes, improving pedestrian linkages, promoting
          alternative transportation modes.
Similarly, widening to four lanes may also be deemed impractical on some collector streets. Ideally,
the City will continue to strive to provide at least a Level of Service (LOS) "D" at all locations.
However, there may be locations where the City may decide that the impacts and/or costs of the
2020 General Plan                                    4-12                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

required improvements exceed the benefits of having LOS "D" for all hours of the day. Allowing
some flexibility enables the City to identify circumstances in which major improvements are not
desirable. While this could lead to some intersections operating at worse than LOS "D" conditions
for a limited amount of time per day, it would still maintain an overall high Level of Service standard
for the City's roadway system.
Public Transit
Public transportation will be of increasing importance during the planing period. Several trends
contribute to the need for a responsive transit system: a growing elderly population, already over 30-
percent of the City population; demand for tourist-oriented public transportation linking Downtown
and places of interest; commutation on Highway 49 south and, to a lesser extent, on Highways 20
and 174; clustering of business and commercial activity (as called for by this General Plan) so as to
facilitate public transportation routing and scheduling.
The Grass Valley area is currently served by three public transportation services:
          !        Gold Country Stage. A fixed route system serving populated centers in western
                   Nevada County plus Colfax.
          !        Dial-a-Ride. Demand-based para-transit service operated by a private, non-profit
                   organization.
          !        Gold Country Telecare. Private, non-profit system for handicapped and elderly
                   patrons, using vans and similar vehicles to transport passengers to shopping and
                   medical appointments.
Express bus commuter service is planned for a route serving Nevada City/Grass Valley/Sacramento.
The future outlook for transit depends upon some key factors and substantial commitment by the City
of Grass Valley:
          !        A sound plan for transit, based on realistic demand and financial projections.
          !        A commitment to sustained dependable service, and an understanding of the level of
                   subsidy necessary to support such service.
          !        Coordination and cooperation among service providers.
          !        Limiting the number of public transportation providers, so as to discourage
                   proliferation of small, ineffectual entities.
2020 General Plan                                     4-13                                November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
Trails-Sidewalks Network (including Bikeways)
In the past 25 years, numerous bicycle, pedestrian, and equestrian trails have been planned in Grass
Valley. Few have materialized. The only formal trails in Grass Valley are the Empire Mine State
Park and the Litton Trail. The 1996 Nevada County Master Bicycle Plan identifies bike lanes within
the City of Grass Valley. The City has not yet adopted this plan. Currently, the only designated bike
facilities with the City and immediate vicinity are on Ridge Road from Hughes Road to the Nevada
Union High School and on East Main from Hughes to the Nevada City Highway.
Both from the standpoints of transportation and recreation, demand for non-vehicular routes is large
and growing. In addition, safety concerns make pedestrian ways imperative, particularly along busy,
high speed streets. The General Plan Land Use Plan establishes a future land use pattern conducive
to non-vehicular circulation, if a non-vehicular infrastructure network can be provided. Aspects of
the Land Use Plan “friendly” to non-vehicular plans are: locations of traffic generating uses close
enough to residential areas to facilitate walking and bicycling; support for infill and higher density
residential areas “close in”; and measures to minimize sprawl.
This General Plan includes a Trails-Sidewalks Plan (see Recreation Element for description and map).
The system is intended to provide for multi-purpose use of off-road trails and, where trails are
impractical, sidewalks for pedestrian use. Trails and sidewalks link together to form a viable network
plan.
The Trails-Sidewalks Plan contemplates bicycle paths within trail easements to the extent possible.
Bike lanes along roadways are considered less desirable, but inevitable if no other alternative exists.
Selected existing streets and roads (not served by bike paths within the trail system) should be
retrofitted with bicycle lanes. Bicycle lanes should be provided on all new streets and roads, other
than freeways and expressways.

          incorporated aesthetic treatments, including landscaping, landscaped medians, setbacks for
          sidewalks, street lights, street furniture, signage restrictions, and other design elements.
Circulation Implementation Actions and Strategies
1-CI      Adopt the roadway classification system outlined in the Circulation Element. The City shall
          plan, design and regulate roadways in accordance with the functional classification system
          reflected in Figure 4-1 and Table 4-1.
2-CI      Regularly update Development Impact Fees.
3-CI      Ensure that proposed specific plans are consistent with the provisions of the functional
          classification component. This shall include incorporation of consistent design standards for
          roadways, associated bikeways and trails, and landscape areas. Require that large
          development proposals and specific plans include comprehensive financing plans for streets
          and highways.
4-CI      Work with neighboring jurisdictions and regional planning agencies to coordinate the
          classification of roadways that cross the City's boundaries. Strive to have compatible
          functional classifications for gateway roadways.
5-CI      Continue to refine and improve the design standards for the roadway system. The design
          standards shall reflect functional classification and include the following elements:
          !        Right-of-way requirements
          !        Roadway cross-sections including landscaping and bikeways
          !        Signalization and access control
          !        Land use compatibility, orientation and design standards
          !        Vehicle and pedestrian safety
          !        Variable local street widths based on traffic demands
2020 General Plan                                     4-16                                   November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

          Exceptions to the standards may be necessary but should be kept to a minimum and should
          be evaluated on a case by case basis.
6-CI Monitor truck traffic. As conditions warrant, develop, enforce, evaluate and update a truck
          route system to ensure safe and efficient routes through the City.
7-CI Continue to update the Capital Improvement Program to implement policy which strives to
          maintain LOS "D" at all locations during the weekday P.M. peak hour. Define "normally
          accepted maximum" improvements that are consistent with the character and terrain of Grass
          Valley. If forecast traffic volumes cannot maintain LOS "D", the City Council may consider
          additional "extraordinary" improvements. The City Council may determine, on a case by case
          basis, that "extraordinary" improvements are not feasible or desirable and may relax the LOS
          "D" standard for a particular intersection or roadway segment. In considering exceptions to
          the LOS "D" standard, the City shall consider the following factors:
          !        The number of hours per day that the intersection or roadway segment would operate
                   at conditions worse the LOS "D".
          !        The ability of the improvement to reduce peak hour delay and improve traffic
                   operations.
          !        The impact on accessibility to surrounding properties.
          !        The right-of-way needs and the physical impact on surrounding properties.
          !        The visual aesthetics of the required improvements and its impact on community
                   identity and character.
          !        Environmental impacts including air quality and noise impacts.
          !        Construction and right-of-way acquisition costs.
          !        Impacts on pedestrian and bicycle accessibility and safety.
          !        The impacts of the required construction phasing and traffic maintenance.
          In no case should the City plan for worse then LOS "E" at any intersection or roadway
          segment during the afternoon peak hour.
8-CI Base the Capital Improvement Program on a 20 year horizon and update the Program
          regularly. Update concurrently with the approval of any significant modification to the land
          use allocation assumed by the Citywide travel model.
9-CI Regularly monitor traffic volumes on City streets and prepare an annual report documenting
          recent trends and current Levels of Service.
10-CI Require that Specific Plans contain transportation improvements consistent with the standards
          of the Circulation Element, and that Specific Plans demonstrate what measures will be
          required to maintain the City's Level of Service standard and how these measures will be
          funded. Utilize development agreements to secure improvement, sequencing and funding
          provisions.
11-CI Prepare a Long-Range Transit Master Plan consistent with the provisions of the Circulation
          Element. Explore potential benefits of improved transit service on the City's Level of Service
          standard through the Long-Range Transit Master Plan.
12-CI Evaluate the feasibility of enacting a Transportation Systems Management Ordinance. If a
          TSM ordinance is enacted, the City shall assess the effectiveness of a TSM Ordinance in
          reducing vehicle trips, or in making street, parking facilities, public transit and bikeways more
          effective. Evaluate the TSM Ordinance's overall performance annually. If, after two to three
          years the trip reduction goals are not being achieved, revise the TSM Ordinance to include
          measures to achieve stated goals.
2020 General Plan                                     4-17                                      November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
13-CI Prepare a Bikeways Master Plan consistent with the Trails-Sidewalks Plan in this General
          Plan. Adopt the 1996 Nevada County Master Bicycle Plan and Trails Master Plan. The intent
          is to ensure the coordinated implementation of non-automotive circulation systems.
14-CI Coordinate with surrounding jurisdictions to provide acceptable and compatible levels of
          service on roadways connecting the City. Work with the Nevada County Transportation
          Commission to implement applicable Level of Service standards. Work with appropriate air
          pollution control agencies to implement transportation improvements and measures that help
          meet the established air goals and standards.
15-CI Ensure adequate funding to meet established Level of Service policies. Continue to
          implement and update traffic impact fees on new development and to obtain gas tax and
          other revenues to fund the Capital Improvement Program. Explore funding for transit and
          for non-motorized circulation improvements, to be identified in the Trails-Sidewalks-
          Bikeways Master Plan. Consider alternative funding sources, such as establishment of
          assessment district(s). Work with regional planning agencies to explore funding opportunities
          for all components of its transportation system that are required to meet Level of Service
          standards.
16-CI Monitor the status of regional planning efforts and Caltrans design work in order to be
          cognizant of future right of way requirements and local responsibilities. Maintain a current
          record of Caltrans and Nevada County Transportation Commission activity for major facilities
          so future right of way needs can be addressed when reviewing development proposals.
          Consider future Caltrans right of way needs when evaluating development proposals and shall
          incorporate measures to preserve rights of way into development agreements and conditions
          of approval.
17-CI Identify appropriate environmental traffic volume thresholds for residential streets and shall
          consider those thresholds in development review. Use traffic calming measures to ensure that
          these thresholds are maintained on existing streets and provided on local streets in new
          development.
18-CI Develop a plan for parking that identifies park and ride lots. Consider the need for park and
          ride facilities and for facilities serving alternative transportation modes when evaluating
          development proposals. Require construction of these facilities concurrent with development,
          or fair-share developer contributions in lieu of actual construction.

CHAPTER FIVE
CONSERVATION/OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
Introduction
The Conservation and Open Space Elements are being combined in the 2020 Grass Valley General
Plan Update. Both are mandatory General Plan Elements under State law.
The Conservation/Open Space Element addresses those aspects of conservation and open space
determined most important to Grass Valley. It supplements, but does not replace, the Mineral
Resources Element adopted by the City in 1993.
Government Code Section 65302(d) mandates that a Conservation Element address the conservation,
development, and utilization of natural resources including water and its hydraulic force, forests, soils,
rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals, and other natural resources. Other
issues may be addressed as deemed appropriate by the local jurisdiction including, but not limited to:
The reclamation of land and waters; prevention, control and correction of erosion; flood control;
prevention and control of the pollution of streams and other waters; and protection of watersheds.
The Conservation Element requirements overlap those of the Open Space and Land Use Elements
as well as the Safety and Circulation Elements. The Conservation Element is distinguished by being
primarily oriented toward natural resources.
Government Code Section 65560 et seq., outlines the relevant issues to be addressed in an Open
Space Element including, but not limited to, open space for the preservation of natural resources,
managed production of resources, recreational use, and public health and safety. The Open Space
Element overlaps with the Land Use, Conservation and Safety Elements. State law mandates an
ambitious and detailed planning effort for open space, comparable only to the requirements for the
Housing Element.
Open space can serve a variety of purposes. It can be used as the focal point of a community in the
form of local and regional parks or as a means of preserving significant features in the area. Open
space may be designated and set aside for natural resource protection, recreation, or aesthetics. It
may be incorporated into and complement development. Open space may be either private or public
land, and may or may not be suitable for public access. It may be productive economically, such as
agriculture or timber lands, or it may have no economic value other than the raw land itself .
Definitions
The following definitions are provided as background for the Conservation and Open Space Element:
Conservation: The management of natural resources to prevent waste, destruction, or neglect.
Open Space Land:
2020 General Plan                                   5-1                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
                             As defined in Section 65560(b) of the Government Code, “open space land”
                             is any parcel or area of land or water which is essentially unimproved and
                             devoted to an open-space use such as:
                             Open Space for the preservation of natural resources including, but not
                             limited to, areas required for the preservation of plant and animal life,
                             including habitat for fish and wildlife species; areas required for ecological and
                             other scientific study purposes; rivers, streams, bays and estuaries; and coastal
                             beaches, lake shores, banks or rivers and streams, and watershed lands.
                             Open space used for the managed production of resources, including but not
                             limited to, forest lands, rangeland, agricultural lands and areas of economic
                             importance for the production of food or fiber; areas required for recharge of
                             ground water basins; bays, estuaries, marshes, rivers and streams which are
                             important for the management of commercial fisheries; and areas containing
                             major mineral deposits, including those in short supply.
                             Open space for outdoor recreation, including but not limited to, areas which
                             require special management or regulation because of hazardous or special
                             conditions such as earthquake fault zones, unstable soil areas, flood plains,
                             watersheds, areas presenting high fire risks, areas required for the protection
                             of water quality and water reservoirs and areas required for the protection and
                             enhancement of air quality.
It is important to note that conservation means proper use of resources, and does not necessarily
connote 1) public ownership, 2) non-use or severely restricted use of land, or 3) guaranteed public
access. It is equally important to note that open space 1) may take many forms, 2) may serve a
variety of purposes, 3) may be relatively permanently or merely temporarily “open”, and 4) does not
necessarily connote either public ownership or public access. These caveats are fundamental to an
understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the City of Grass Valley in conservation and open
space related matters.

Conservation/Open Space Issues
Vacant Land
The availability of vacant land is a major consideration in identifying open space land designations.
California law requires the Open Space element to include an inventory of vacant land. The existing
land use survey and resulting Existing Land Use Map constitute the vacant land inventory for
purposes of the 2020 General Plan.
Vacant land is essentially open space as long as it remains undeveloped, though it may not be
considered “permanent” open space unless expressly designated, owned, and/or managed as such.
Vacant land within the Planning Area, including the City of Grass Valley, is shown in Figure 5-1.
The City of Grass Valley contains 476 acres of vacant land, approximately 19% of the City’s total
land area of 2,521 acres. According to recent City estimates, as much as 300 acres of the vacant land
inventory may be developmentally constrained due to difficult topography, limited access,
environmental constraints, or economic constraints (high cost of developing). Developmentally
2020 General Plan                                       5-3                                   November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

constrained parcels are better candidates for open space opportunity designation than are more readily
developed parcels.
The unincorporated portion of the Planning Area contains significant undeveloped (vacant) acreage,
presenting a potential for designating and protecting substantial open space outside of the City limits.
Of unincorporated Planning Area’s 7,373 acres, 2,787 acres (38%) is vacant.
Three of the four Special Development Areas (SDAs) designated on the Land Use Plan map have
annexation agreements with the City of Grass Valley. They are Loma Rica Ranch, North Star, and
Kenny Ranch. Combined, they contain nearly 57% of the unincorporated Planning Area’s vacant
land supply. Annexation agreement commitments to be implemented at the time of development
require of the SDAs a combined 436 acres of open space and 50 acres of “recreation” land.
Hydrologic Features
Permanent and intermittent streams and their surroundings comprise the Planning Area’s principal
hydrologic features. These include stream corridors, flood plains, riparian zones, wetlands, and
canals. Figure 5-2 shows creeks and canals.
Grass Valley and the balance of the Planning Area lie primarily within the Wolf Creek drainage basin.
 The South Fork of Wolf Creek and Little Wolf Creek drain the eastern and southeastern portion of
the Planning Area and discharge into Wolf Creek in the central Grass Valley area. Northwestern and
western areas are within the upper reaches of the Deer Creek drainage basin, but do not include Deer
Creek or substantial tributaries.
Stream corridors areas are high priorities for conservation efforts and open space designation. As
“riparian” zones, the natural attributes and habitat values of river and stream corridors are sensitive
to alteration. If such values are to be preserved, protection from alteration must be afforded the
riverine environment.
Flood prevention and protection of life and property similarly justify management of the flood prone
areas of stream corridors. Grass Valley’s location near the headwaters of Wolf Creek and its
tributaries minimizes the quantity and velocity of storm water flows through town. However, future
development upstream could increase downstream flooding unless appropriate mitigation measures
are employed. Keeping development out of flood prone areas is the most expeditious and effective
mitigation measure. Flooding during a “100-year event” is limited to relatively narrow areas along
Wolf Creek and tributaries (Wolf Creek South Fork and Little Wolf Creek) as they approach and
course through Grass Valley.
Grass Valley’s flood protection ordinance establishes a 100' building setback from streams and rivers
subject to flooding. For stretches of stream corridors not covered by the FEMA maps, the 100'
setback is used to define the OSO-designated zone. OSO designation will be reinforced by OS
designation on the General Plan Land Use Plan map when better information for corridor delineation
becomes available.
2020 General Plan                                   5-4                                   November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Wetlands in Grass Valley are generally small, isolated features dependent on riparian water, ditch
leaks or overflows, diversions, or natural seeps or springs. Man-made or naturally occurring wetlands
provide an important biological resource both through provisions of localized habitat and habitat for
migratory species and as a natural water filtration system. Wetlands are identified and defined by
plants, soils, and frequency of inundation.
The presence of wetlands is a consideration for any development. Conservation or mitigation
measures must be implemented in the course of any development project likely to have an impact,
direct or indirect, on identified wetlands. Figure 5-3 shows delineated wetlands in the Planning Area,
as identified on the U.S. Department of Interior’s National Wetlands Inventory Map. Delineated
wetlands are designated on the OSO overlay.
Trees and Forested Areas
The decline in recent years of the logging industry in western Nevada County has been paralleled by
support for maintenance of healthy forested areas throughout the foothills, including Grass Valley and
vicinity.
Forest management poses significant challenges on the western slope of the Sierra. The multiple-use
forest management concept requires balancing the demands of myriad, often competing, land uses
and management practices. These include timber growth and forest management, water quality and
watershed protection, recreation, wildland fire considerations, aesthetics, and wildlife
management/protection.
Perhaps even more difficult challenges arise in the realm of “urban forestry.” Here, too, competing
demands require balanced approaches. The generally wooded character of Grass Valley and its
environs is a large part of the area’s allure for residents and visitors, alike. In the absence of a single
owner or management entity, however, the future of the “forested character” is in the hands of
individual owners, land developers, and local government.
The City of Grass Valley has several planning/ordinance provisions addressing trees. They include:
          !        Heritage Tree Ordinance for protection of outstanding individual trees
          !        Environmental review of development projects
          !        General Plan provisions
The Land Use Element and other Elements of this General Plan provides for a future land use and
development pattern conducive to, but not necessarily guaranteeing, a healthy urban forest for the
Planning Area. Key provisions in this regard are designation of high intensity land uses for areas
presently sparsely-treed, low-intensity land uses in areas now heavily forested; a flexible Open Space
Opportunities land use overlay to the General Plan; and a trails network planned to develop in tandem
with natural resource protection. To meet the goals, objectives, and policies of this General Plan,
however, additional steps must be taken (see Implementation Actions and Strategies).
Entryways, Viewsheds, and Aesthetic Considerations
2020 General Plan                                     5-5                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Grass Valley and vicinity have a wide variety of landscapes and scenic resources which provide
passive recreational opportunities for residents and visitors alike. Chief among these scenic resources
are the views available from many roadways to surrounding open areas as well as to vistas of the
foothills and mountains.
The 1972 Grass Valley General Plan established State Highway 20 and Highway 49 as scenic
highways, and their routes near and through Grass Valley were designated scenic corridors. The
purpose of scenic route/corridor designation is to protect views from impacts which could impair
aesthetics along identified stretches of a highway corridor. The 1972 General Plan proposed scenic
highway policies prohibiting billboards and off-premise outdoor advertising structures along scenic
highways, and encouraged landscaping and tree planting along public rights-of-way within the scenic
corridor. Scenic highway standards were described within the General Plan which include land use
regulations, sign and outdoor advertising regulations, and grading and earth moving regulations.
The 1982 General Plan reinforced previous scenic highway efforts through new policies and actions
designed to enhance City “entryways”. Entryways are Highway 49 and Highway 20. 1982 General
Plan policies regarding entryways were: strengthen entryway identity through landscaping, preserve
and promote the scenic quality of City streets, preserve and promote visually pleasing arterials and
highways, and regulate signs and billboards.
The 1982 General Plan recognized the need to address the aesthetic qualities of steep terrain
“viewsheds” in and around Grass Valley with the following language : “Preserve the scenic resource
value of surrounding prominent hills and ridgelines (policy)” and “establish hillside development
standards which will preserve the scenic quality of surrounding hills (action)”.
Grass Valley has implemented some aspects of the scenic highway/entryway and hillside/ridgeline
General Plan provisions through a combination of zoning and design guidelines.
However, this General Plan renews the mandate to identify specific corridors and views and to
identify specific aesthetic considerations important to their protection (Conservation/Open Element
and Community Design Element).
Air and Water Quality
Air quality is subject to the regulatory provisions of the California Clean Air Act (CCAA) and the
Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA). The Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District is the
Responsible Agency for administering air quality laws and regulations in Nevada County, pursuant
to Section 40000 et seq. of the California Health and Safety Code.
This General Plan addresses air quality in several ways. Among the more prominent are: non-
motorized circulation modes (trails and sidewalk network; public transit support; urban forestry and
open space provisions; future land use patterns which discourage sprawl.
Protection of water quality in Grass Valley and western Nevada County is the responsibility of
several agencies, principally the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at the Federal level, State
2020 General Plan                                   5-6                                   November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) at the State level, the Central Valley Region of the
SWRCB at the sub-state regional level, and Nevada County and Grass Valley at the local level.
Primary sources of water pollution in and around Grass Valley are treated wastewater discharge and
“non-point” source pollution, particularly storm runoff and siltation from construction projects. Grass
Valley is currently engaged in a wastewater treatment facility expansion and storm water separation
project in compliance with all State and federal requirements.
Mineral Resources
Mineral resources, particularly gold, have played a major role in the history of Nevada County and
Grass Valley. Since 1849, when gold was first discovered in the area, to the years preceding World
War II, most of the County’s population was economically supported, directly or indirectly, by the
local gold mining industry. Metals produced in the Grass Valley area since 1850 include lode gold,
chromite, crushed stone, and placer gold.
In order to promote the conservation of the state’s mineral resources, and ensure adequate
reclamation of mined lands, the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA) was enacted.
Pursuant to SMARA, the City of Grass Valley adopted a Mineral Resources Element of the General
Plan in 1993. That Element remains current, and is not being revised or updated at this time.
SMARA requires that the State Geologist classify land in California for its mineral resource potential.
Local governments are required to incorporate the mineral and classification reports and maps into
their general plans and consider the information when making land use decisions.
Areas subject to mineral land classification studies are divided into various Mineral Resource Zone
(MRZ) categories that reflect varying degrees of mineral potential. Areas classified MRZ-2 are those
containing potentially significant mining deposits. The existence of deposits may be actually
measured or indicated by site data (MRZ-2a), or inferred from other sources (MRZ-2b). All areas
within Grass Valley and the Planning Area are classified by the State Division of Mines and Geology
as MRZ-2.
Mineral land classifications will be of continuing importance as Grass Valley prepares for annexation
of formerly productive mine properties. Also of importance will be the state of abandoned, un-
reclaimed mines and the dangers they pose to life and property (see Safety Element for discussion
of mine hazards).

Open Space Opportunity Overlay and Description
Figure 5-4 shows the Open Space Opportunity (OSO) overlay as previously described in the Land
Use Element. The Open Space Opportunity overlay is a flexible tool to be altered as needed. At all
2020 General Plan                                      5-8                                  November, 1999

times it will depict 1) areas already secured as permanent open space or related (parks and
recreation) General Plan designation and 2) areas which, for a variety of reasons, the City has
determined to place in permanent open space or related use.
An example of the OSO map being used effectively would be to identify a potential park sites in
advance of actual purchase. The Land Use Plan map would retain current designations for the time
being, enabling owners to use their properties as designated by the General Plan until properties are
secured by the City. Once the land is secured as open space (by virtue of public ownership or other
arrangement), the “underlying” designation on the Land Use Plan map is changed to an appropriate
category. The same approach applies to areas potentially subject to City non-development
restrictions. Designation on the OSO overlay indicates City intent, but only actual change on the
Land Use Plan map permanently changes the underlying designation.
The initial Open Space Opportunity (OSO) overlay map presented here contains the following:
!           Existing Parks (including City Parks, Empire Mine State Park)
!           The Nevada County Fairgrounds
!           Nevada County Country Club/Golf Course
!           Trail portions of proposed Trails-Sidewalk Network
!           Floodplains/Riparian Corridors along Wolf Creek and South Fork Wolf Creek
!           Possible Neighborhood Park site in the Glenbrook Basin
!           U.S. Department of Interior-delineated Wetlands
!           Proposed Union Hill Meadows Natural Area (East Bennett and South Fork Wolf Creek)
!           Open spaces reserved by past development conditions of approval and development
            agreements.
The initial OSO overlay does not at this time depict open space in the three SDA areas with
annexation agreements. When specific plans or other planning instruments are initiated, however,
the City shall identify open space opportunity areas equivalent to allocated acreage for that purpose,
and amend the OSO overlay accordingly.

CHAPTER SIX
NOISE ELEMENT
Introduction
The Noise Element is a mandatory General Plan element. The Noise Element identifies and appraises
noise problems and forms a basis for land use distribution. The State Office of Planning and Research
Noise Element Guidelines require that major noise sources be identified and quantified by preparing
generalized noise contours for current and projected conditions. Significant noise sources include
traffic on major roadways and highways, railroad operations, airports, and representative industrial
activities and fixed noise sources.
Noise is often defined simply as unwanted sound, and thus is a subjective reaction to characteristics
of a physical phenomenon. Researchers for many years have grappled with the problem of translating
objective measurements of sound into directly correlated measures of public reaction to noise. The
descriptors of community noise in current use are the results of these efforts, and represent simplified,
practical measurement tools to gauge community response.
Definitions
A-Weighted Sound Level (dB): The sound pressure level obtained by using the A-weighting filter of
a sound level meter, expressed in decibels (dB). All sound levels referred to in this policy document
are in A-weighted decibels. A-weighting de-emphasizes the very low and very high frequencies of
sound in a manner similar to the human ear. Most community noise standards utilize A-weighting,
as it provides a high degree of correlation with human annoyance and health effects.
Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL): The equivalent energy (or energy average) sound level
during a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of approximately five decibels to sound levels in the
evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and ten decibels to sound levels in the night before 7:00 a.m.
and after 10:00 p.m. The CNEL is generally computed for annual average conditions.
Day/Night Average Sound Level (Ldn): The equivalent energy (or energy average) sound level during
a 24-hour day, obtained after addition of ten decibels to sound levels in the night after 10:00 p.m. and
before 7:00 a.m. The Ldn is generally computed for annual average conditions.
Equivalent Sound Level (Leq): The sound level containing the same total energy as a time varying
signal over a given sample period. Thus, the Leq is a single value that expresses the time-averaged
total energy of a fluctuating sound level. The Leq is typically computed over 1, 8 and 24-hour sample
periods.

City of Grass Valley, California
Fixed Noise Source: Any fixed or mobile source not preempted from local control by federal or state
regulations. Fixed noise sources which are typically of concern include, but are not limited to, the
following:
          HVAC Systems                    Cooling Towers/Evaporative Condensers
          Pump Stations                   Lift Stations
          Emergency Generators            Boilers
          Steam Valves                    Steam Turbines
          Generators                      Fans
          Air Compressors                 Heavy Equipment
          Conveyor Systems                Transformers
          Pile Drivers                    Grinders
          Drill Rigs                      Gas or Diesel Motors
          Welders                         Cutting Equipment
          Outdoor Speakers                Blowers
          The types of uses which may typically operate the noise sources described above include, but
          are not limited to: industrial facilities, lumber mills, trucking operations, tire shops, auto
          maintenance shops, metal fabricating shops, shopping centers, drive-up restaurant windows,
          car washes, loading docks, batch plants, bottling and canning plants, recycling centers, electric
          generating stations, race tracks, landfills, sand and gravel operations, and athletic fields.
          Noise due to operation of powered equipment for real property maintenance or temporary
          construction activities is not subject to the Noise Element standards.
Noise-Sensitive Land Uses:
          !        Residential development, except temporary dwellings.
          !        Schools: preschool to secondary, college and university, and specialized education
                   and training.
          !        Hospitals, nursing and personal care.
          !        Churches.
          !        Hotels, motels, and bed and breakfast lodging.
Outdoor Activity Areas: Common outdoor activity areas of multi-family dwellings, back yards of
single-family dwellings, and designated outdoor recreation/activity areas for transient lodging,
hospitals, nursing and personal care facilities.
Transportation Noise Source: Traffic on public roadways, railroad line operations and aircraft in
flight. Control of noise from these sources is preempted by federal and state regulations.

City of Grass Valley, California
Roadways
Traffic data representing annual average traffic volumes for existing conditions were obtained from
Caltrans for the State highways within the City of Grass Valley, and from the General Plan traffic
consultant for local roadways. Day/evening/night traffic distribution for State Routes (SR) 49, 20,
and 174 were based upon 24-hour noise measurement data. Truck mix data for the State highways
were also based upon Caltrans data. Using these data and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
methodology, explained later in the Noise Element, traffic noise levels as defined by CNEL were
calculated for existing traffic volumes for the State highways and local roadways.
Distances from the center lines of each of the roadway segments to the 60 and 65 dB CNEL contours
are summarized in Table 6-1. Figure 6-1 is a map showing these contours. Figure 6-2 is a map of
future (Year 2020) noise contours, based upon projected traffic volumes and road width
specifications (see Circulation Element).
In some cases, the actual distances to noise level contours may vary from the distances predicted by
the FHWA model. Factors such as roadway curvature, roadway grade, shielding from local
topography or structures, elevated roadways, or elevated receivers may affect actual sound
propagation. Therefore the distances reported in Table 6-1 are generally considered to be
conservative estimates of noise exposure along roadways in the City of Grass Valley.
Significant variations in topography occur in the Grass Valley area. In many cases, the existing
topography which occurs adjacent to the major roadways affects sound propagation due to roadway
traffic. The effects of factors such as topography, roadway curvature, grade, etc. can be determined
from site-specific traffic noise measurements. The noise measurement results can be compared to the
FHWA model results by entering the observed traffic volumes, speed and distance as inputs to the
FHWA model. The differences between the measured and predicted noise levels can be used to
adjust the FHWA model and more precisely determine the locations of the traffic noise contours.
Table 6-2 has been prepared to serve as a guide when applying the traffic noise exposure contour
information presented in this section to areas with varying topography. The table is used by adding
the correction factor to the noise level predicted at a given distance. It should be noted that the
adjustment factors presented in this table are intended to provide conservative results, and that
complex situations should be evaluated by an acoustical consultant where the potential for significant
noise impact exists.

Traffic noise contours were not developed for all segments of local roadways in the City of Grass
Valley. For arterial traffic, the predicted distance to the 60 dB CNEL contour is determined by the
Average Daily Traffic Volume (ADT) and the posted speed limit. CNEL contours derived from
Table 6-1 are only indicators of potential noise conflicts, requiring more detailed analysis to determine
traffic noise levels at any given location.

Aircraft Noise Levels
The Nevada County Airpark is located east of Grass Valley. The facility is a base for local personal
and recreational flyers. The Airpark also serves as a transportation facility for business/corporate
aviation and aerial fire-fighting operations. Based upon the July, 1990 Nevada County Airpark
Master Plan prepared by Hodges and Shutt, there were 160 based aircraft with 75,000 operations per
year in 1989. Future upgrades of the facility are recommended in the Master Plan, and the 20-year
forecast projects an increase in operations to 116,000 per year.
Figure 6-3 shows the 1989 (considered existing for purposes of this Noise Element) CNEL contours
for the Nevada County Airpark, which are contained in the Airpark Master Plan.
Fixed Noise Sources
The production of noise is a result of many industrial processes, even when the best available noise
control technology is applied. Noise exposures within industrial facilities are controlled by Federal
and State employee health and safety regulations (OSHA and Cal-OSHA), but exterior noise levels
may exceed locally acceptable standards. Commercial, recreational and public service facility
activities can also produce noise which affects adjacent sensitive land uses. These noise sources can
be continuous and may contain tonal components which may be annoying to individuals who live in
the nearby vicinity. In addition, noise generation from fixed noise sources may vary based upon
climatic conditions, time of day and existing ambient noise levels.
From a land use planning perspective, fixed-source noise control issues focus upon two goals: to
prevent the introduction of new noise-producing uses in noise-sensitive areas, and to prevent
encroachment of noise sensitive uses upon existing noise-producing facilities. The first goal can be
achieved by applying noise level performance standards to proposed new noise-producing uses. The
second goal can be met by requiring that new noise-sensitive uses in near proximity to noise-
producing facilities include mitigation measures to ensure compliance with noise performance
standards.
The types of uses which may typically produce the noise sources described above include, but are not
limited to: wood processing facilities, pump stations, industrial facilities, trucking operations, tire
shops, auto maintenance shops, metal fabricating shops, shopping centers, drive-up windows, car
washes, loading docks, public works projects, batch plants, bottling and canning plants, recycling
centers, electric generating stations, race tracks, landfills, sand and gravel operations, and athletic
fields.
Discussions with the City of Grass Valley planning staff indicate that noise complaints within the City
of Grass Valley have generally been confined to four types of noise sources. The noise sources which
have generated noise complaints include car washes, quarry operations, delivery trucks and
construction activities.

Chevron Car Wash
The one specific noise source which the City staff identified as eliciting noise complaints included the
Chevron Station car wash which is located at East Main Street and Idaho Maryland Mine Road. The
car wash operates 24-hours per day, and has been a source of noise complaints from residences in
close proximity. Primarily during the nighttime period when noise due to roadway traffic along SR
49 is low, the noise levels due to car wash operations become more apparent and noticeable.
Noise level measurements were conducted of car wash operations on August 13, 1998. The noise
level measurements were conducted from a distance of 50 feet from the entrance to the car wash.
Major noise sources associated with the car wash included the automatic wash and dry cycles. The
blowers associated with the drying cycle of the car wash are the dominant noise source. Noise levels
associated with operation were approximately 78 dB Lmax and 89 dB SEL for each wash and dry
cycle. Assuming that a maximum of 8 operations (4 wash only cycles and 4 wash & dry cycles) occur
during a busy hour indicates that the distances to the 50 and 55 dB Leq noise level contours are
approximately 160 and 90 feet respectively from the entrance/exit of the car wash.
North Star Quarry
The North Star Quarry is located east of SR 49 on Idaho-Maryland Mine Road. The North Star
Quarry is a rock and gravel mining operation. Noise sources associated with the operation include
truck traffic to and from the site, excavation of resource material with a CAT D-8 dozer, loading of
aggregate material with CAT 966 & 988 wheel loaders, and processing equipment which include a
jaw crusher, roll crusher and deck screen.
Brown-Buntin Associates, Inc conducted an analysis of noise impacts associated with the operations
of the North Star Quarry in June 1992. The analysis indicated that the distance to the 50 and 55 dB
hourly Leq noise level contours is approximately 900 feet and 500 feet respectively from the center
of the excavation area. The distance to the 60 dB Ldn noise level contour is approximately 160 feet
from the center of the excavation area. Review of current operations at the quarry indicate that they
have not changed significantly from the operations used in the analysis which was conducted in 1992.
Truck Delivery and Loading Dock Noise
Loading dock and truck delivery operations generally occur at most commercial and industrial type
uses. The types of uses include, but are not limited to, supermarkets, hardware supply stores, large
warehouses and warehouse-size retail establishments, and post offices.
Studies of noise levels at loading docks indicate that typical busy loading docks with semi truck
arrivals and departures, unloading activities, semi truck passbys on the service roads, and step-side
type delivery trucks produce an average hourly noise level of 60 dB Leq, and a maximum noise level
of approximately 82 dB at a distance of 50 feet from the loading dock. Generally, the maximum noise
levels are due to heavy truck passbys on the service road and the sudden discharge of air from the air

City of Grass Valley, California
brakes. Overall hourly average noise levels are due to all activities including arrivals and departures
of trucks, revving of engines, and activities on the loading docks.
Residential uses located adjacent to loading docks can be exposed to noise levels which may be
considered annoying. Loading docks generally experience use between 3 and 4 hours out of a day.
When using a 60 dB Ldn noise level standard, the noise from loading docks would not be considered
to be a major noise source, with the 60 dB Ldn contour located approximately 20 feet from the
loading dock or service road. However, the 50 dB hourly Leq noise level contour is located
approximately 150 feet from the loading dock.
Construction Noise
During the construction phases of any large commercial, industrial or municipal project, noise from
construction activities can dominate the noise environment in the immediate area. Activities involved
in construction will generate noise levels, as indicated in Table 6-3, ranging from 70 to 90 dB at a
distance of 50 feet. Construction activities can be temporary in nature, but can also be long-term.
Construction typically occurs during normal working hours, although due to climatic conditions or
impending changes in the season, extended working hours from early morning to late in the evening
also can occur. Construction noise impacts could be significant, as nighttime operations or use of
unusually noisy equipment could result in annoyance or sleep disruption for nearby residences.

It is difficult to determine the location of a noise contour associated with construction activities due
to the variations in types of equipment, number of pieces of equipment and the hours of operation.
Therefore, the noise levels shown in Table 6-3 only indicate the maximum noise levels.

Community Noise Survey
A Community Noise Survey was conducted to document noise exposure in areas of the City
containing noise sensitive land uses. For that purpose, noise sensitive land uses in the City of Grass
Valley Planning Area were considered to include residential areas, parks and schools. Noise
monitoring sites were selected to be representative of typical residential conditions in the City.
Short-term noise monitoring was conducted at three sites on August 12, 1998. Each site was
monitored three different times during the day and night so that valid estimates of CNEL could be
prepared. Three continuous hourly noise monitoring sites were established in the City of Grass Valley
as part of the General Plan Update to record day-night statistical noise level trends. The noise level
measurements were conducted between August 13 and August 17, 1998. The data collected
included the Leq, the maximum level during the measurement period (Lmax) and other statistical
descriptors. Noise monitoring sites, measured noise levels, and the measured and estimated CNEL
values at each site are summarized in Table 6-1.
Community noise monitoring systems were calibrated with acoustical calibrators in the field prior
to use. The systems comply with all pertinent requirements of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) for Type I sound level meters.
The Community Noise Survey results indicate that typical noise levels in noise sensitive areas of the
City of Grass Valley Planning Area are in the range of 46.9 dB to 68.9 dB CNEL. Traffic on State
and local roadways, industrial activities, aircraft overflights and neighborhood activities are the
controlling factors for background noise levels in the majority of the Planning Area. In general, most
areas of the City of Grass Valley which contain noise sensitive uses are moderately quiet to noisy, and
are representative of an urban environment. Some residential areas have outdoor activity areas
directly exposed to major noise sources such as State Route 49 and existing industrial areas. Noise
exposure at some of those residences may be considered in excess of generally acceptable noise
exposure criteria.
The Leq values in Table 6-4 represent the average measured noise levels during the sample periods.
The Leq values were the basis of the estimated CNEL values. The Lmax values show the maximum
noise levels observed during the samples. The L50 and L90 values represent the noise levels exceeded
50 percent and 90 percent of the time during the sample period.

Noise Goal and Objectives
1-NG Protect Grass Valley’s relatively quiet environment from unnecessary, annoying and
          potentially damaging noise.
          1-NO Coordination of transportation and land use planning to assure acceptable noise levels.
          2-NO Determination of the existing noise environment and development of realistic noise
                   standards for different land uses.
          3-NO Establishment of a pattern of land uses that minimizes exposure of community
                   residents to excessive noise.
Noise Policies
1-NP Develop a policy framework to function as a guide to planning for appropriate land uses in
          relation to hazardous and annoying noise.
2-NP Perform adequate acoustical analyses prior to approval of new development projects or
          transportation facilities, if warranted.
3-NP Utilize noise contour data to determine land uses affected by transportation-related noise
          sources.
4-NP Adopt appropriate noise level standards for existing and future residential areas.
5-NP Utilize noise contour data to determine appropriate land use patterns in areas affected by
          stationary noise sources.
6-NP Locate sensitive land uses (residential neighborhoods, medical facilities, senior care facilities
          and schools) away from high noise areas.
Noise Implementation Actions and Strategies
1-NI      Prohibit development of new noise-sensitive land uses where the noise level due to fixed noise
          sources will exceed the noise level standards of Table 6-5 (as measured immediately within
          the property line or within a designated outdoor activity area of the new development) unless
          effective noise mitigation measures have been incorporated into the development design to
          achieve the standards specified in Table 6-5.
2-NI. Require that noise created by new development of fixed noise sources be mitigated so as not
          to exceed the noise level standards of Table 6-5 as measured immediately within the property
          line of lands designated for noise-sensitive land uses.
3-NI      Require that noise created by existing fixed noise sources which undergo modifications
          requiring City approval be mitigated so as not to exceed the noise level standards of Table 6-5
          (as measured immediately within the property line of lands designated for noise-sensitive land
          uses). If the existing noise level due to those sources exceeds the standards, require that the
          noise level after modifications be mitigated so as to not exceed the existing noise level.

City of Grass Valley, California

4-NI      Require that an acoustical analysis be performed where new development of fixed noise
          sources, or modification of existing fixed noise sources, is likely to produce noise levels
          exceeding the performance standards of Table 6-5, and that noise mitigation be included in
          the project design.
5-NI      Prohibit new development of noise-sensitive land uses in areas exposed to existing or
          projected future levels of noise from transportation noise sources which exceed the levels
          specified in Table 6-6, unless the project design includes effective mitigation measures to
          reduce exterior noise and noise levels in interior spaces to the levels specified in Table 6-6.

10-NI Apply the following standards and practices to acoustical analyses:
          Where the locations of outdoor activity areas are not known or designated, the exterior noise
          level standards shall be applied immediately inside the property line of the receiving land use.
          In rural areas with large residential lots, the exterior noise level standard shall be applied at
          a point 100 feet from the residence.
          Where it is not practical to mitigate exterior noise levels at patios or balconies of apartment
          complexes, a common area such as a pool or recreation area may be designated as the
          outdoor activity area.
          Where noise mitigation measures are required to achieve the standards of Tables 6-5 and 6-6,
          the emphasis of such measures shall be placed upon site planning and project design. The use
          of noise barriers shall be considered a means of achieving the noise standards only after all
          other practical design-related noise mitigation measures have been integrated into the project.
          When determining the effectiveness of noise mitigation measures, the noise standards shall
          be applied on the receptor side of noise barriers or other property line noise mitigation
          measures.
          If dwellings are located and constructed in accordance with the Noise Element, it may be
          assumed that the resulting exterior and interior noise levels will conform to the noise
          standards imposed by lending agencies such as HUD, FHA and CalVet. Construction of new
          single-family dwellings or modification of existing dwellings in developed areas may not be
          subject to City review with respect to satisfaction of the standards of the Noise Element. As
          a consequence, such dwellings may be constructed or modified in areas where noise levels
          exceed the standards of the Noise Element. It is not the responsibility of the City to ensure
          that such dwellings meet the noise standards of the Noise Element, or the HUD/FHA/CalVet
          noise standards.
Noise Methodologies and Modeling Techniques
A common statistical tool to measure the ambient noise level is the average, or equivalent, sound level
(L dn), which is the sound level corresponding to a steady-state A-weighted sound level in decibels
(dB) containing the same total energy as a time-varying signal over a given time period (usually one
hour). The Leq is the foundation of the composite noise descriptors such as Ldn and CNEL, and shows
very good correlation with community response to noise.

  TABLE 6-7
  REQUIREMENTS FOR AN ACOUSTICAL ANALYSIS
                   An acoustical analysis prepared pursuant to the Noise Element shall:
  !        Be the financial responsibility of the applicant.
  !        Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise
           assessment and architectural acoustics.
  !        Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and
           locations to adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources.
  !        Estimate existing and projected cumulative (20 years) noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL
           and the standards of Table 6-5, and compare those levels to the adopted policies and
           standards of the Noise Element.
  !        Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and
           standards of the Noise Element, giving preference to proper site planning and design over
           mitigation measures which require the construction of noise barriers or structural
           modifications to noise-sensitive buildings.
  !        Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have been implemented.
  !        Describe a post-project assessment program which could be used to evaluate the
           effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures.
Two composite noise descriptors are in common use today: Ldn and CNEL.
The Ldn (Day-Night Average Level) is based upon the average hourly Leq over a 24-hour day, with
a +10 decibel weighting applied to nighttime (10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) Leq values. The nighttime
penalty is based upon the assumption that people react to nighttime noise exposures as though they
were subjectively twice as loud as daytime exposures.
The CNEL (Community Noise Equivalent Level), like Ldn, is based upon the weighted average hourly
Leq over a 24-hour day, except that an additional +4.77 decibel penalty is applied to evening (7:00
p.m. to 10:00 p.m.) hourly Leq values. The Ldn descriptor is a simplification of the CNEL concept,
but the two will usually agree, for a given situation, within 1 dB. Like the Leq, these descriptors are
also averages and tend to disguise short-term variations in the noise environment. Because they
presume increased evening or nighttime sensitivity, these descriptors are best applied as criteria for
land uses where nighttime noise exposures are critical to the acceptability of the noise environment,
such as residential developments.
Noise modeling techniques use source-specific data including average levels of activity, hours of
operation, seasonal fluctuations, and average levels of noise from source operations. Modeling
methods have been developed for a number of environmental noise sources including roadways,
2020 General Plan                                   6-16                                   November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
railroad line operations and industrial plants. Such methods produce reliable results as long as data
inputs and assumptions are valid.
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-
RD-77-108) was used to develop CNEL contours for all highways and major roadways in the City
of Grass Valley Planning Area. The FHWA Model is the analytical method presently favored for
traffic noise prediction by most state and local agencies, including Caltrans. The current version of
the model is based upon the CALVENO noise emission factors for automobiles, medium trucks, and
heavy trucks, with consideration given to vehicle volume, speed, roadway configuration, distance to
the receiver and the acoustical characteristics of the site. The FHWA Model predicts hourly Leq
values for free-flowing traffic conditions, and is generally considered to be accurate within 1.5 dB.
To predict CNEL values, it is necessary to determine the hourly distribution of traffic for a typical
24-hour day and to adjust the traffic volume input data to yield an equivalent hourly traffic volume.
The modeling methods used in this chapter closely follow recommendations made by the State Office
of Noise Control, and were supplemented where appropriate by field-measured noise level data to
account for local conditions. The noise exposure contours are based upon annual average conditions.
Because local topography, vegetation or intervening structures may significantly affect noise exposure
at a particular location, the noise contours should not be considered site-specific.
Existing Regulatory Framework
The 1982 General Plan Noise Element is based upon recommendations by the California State Office
of Noise Control as contained in the Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of Noise Elements
of the General Plan.
The criteria in the Noise Element are established for determining potential noise conflicts between
various land uses and noise sources. The standards are based upon the CNEL/Ldn descriptor. Table
6-8 provides compatibility guidelines for land uses, in relation to noise levels.
As described above, the CNEL and Ldn are 24-hour average noise level descriptors, which apply
penalties to noise which occurs during the evening and nighttime hours. The CNEL and Ldn
descriptors have been found to provide good correlation to the potential for annoyance from
transportation-related noise sources. However, they do not provide a good correlation to the
potential for annoyance from non-transportation or stationary noise sources such as industrial and
commercial operations. This is due to the fact that many times stationary noise sources may operate
between 8 and 10 hours per day, or will have noise sources such as loading docks, pressure relief
valves or alarms which tend to be short duration noise events. When applying an Ldn or CNEL
criterion, the noise levels associated with these types of short term operations are averaged over a
24-hour period, thus underscoring the potential for annoyance.

CHAPTER SEVEN
SAFETY ELEMENT
Section 65302(g) of the California Government Code requires that general plans adopted by planning
agencies include "A safety element for the protection of the community from any unreasonable risks
associated with the effects of seismically induced surface rupture, ground shaking, ground failure,
tsunami, seiche, and dam failure; slope instability leading to mudslides and landslides; subsidence,
liquefaction and other seismic hazards identified pursuant to Chapter 7.8 (commencing with Section
2690) of the Public Resources Code, and other geologic hazards known to the legislative body;
flooding; and wild land and urban fires."
As required by Section 65302(g), the City of Grass Valley consulted with the Department of
Conservation, Division of Mines and Geology (DMG) and the Governor's Office of Emergency
Services (OES) prior to completing the Safety Element to obtain information known by and available
to these agencies.
The Safety Element identifies and describes germane safety-related issues, establishes a goal and
objectives related to identified hazards, and establishes policies and implementation measures
designed to reduce, eliminate, or avoid risk to persons and property.
Safety Goal and Objectives
1-SG Reduce the potential risk of death, injury, property damage, and economic and social
          dislocation resulting from hazards.
          1-SO Assurance of a high level of protection from geologic and seismic hazards for all
                   residents, structures and vital services.
          2-SO Reduction of risk from exposure to hazards related to past and present mining,
                   including shafts, tunnels, tailings and toxic materials.
          3-SO Reduction of risk from exposure to flood hazards.
          4-SO Reduction of risk from exposure to structural and wildlife fires.
          5-SO Reduction of risk from exposure to hazardous materials, including contaminated sites.
Safety Issues
Seismicity
Generally, the degree of earthquake hazard is based on the interrelationships between faults, weak
geologic materials, and human activity. Faults within California are divided into three categories;
prequaternary (older than two million years), quaternary (younger than two million years), and
historic (less than 200 years). Faults in the County's western half are prequaternary. Quaternary and
historic active faults are found in the eastern portion of the County near Truckee. The western half
of the County, in which Grass Valley is located, is in the low intensity zone for earthquake severity.
2020 General Plan                                      7-1                              November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
Grass Valley is not within an Alquist-Priolo zone as defined in DMG Special Report 42. The closest
active fault is the Cleveland Hill fault near Oroville. However, ground movement can be felt in Grass
Valley from earthquakes at intermediate distances (i.e., the Truckee quake of 1968) and from distant
earthquakes (i.e., the Winters-Vacaville 1892 event).
Subsidence
Subsidence consists of surface land sinking into subsurface holes or fissures. Subsidence may be
caused by a variety of natural conditions, some in combination with human activity. The primary
cause of actual and potential subsidence in the Grass Valley area is previous underground withdrawal
of material from mining. Less hazardous and generally better controlled is improper burial of organic
materials during land development.
Subsidence hazards in Grass Valley and vicinity are principally man-made, rather than natural
geologic phenomena, and are addressed under Mine-Related Hazards.
Mine-Related Hazards
The collapse of the Old Brunswick shaft of the Idaho-Maryland Mine Complex near Grass Valley
during the 1998 storm season dramatized the danger to persons and property presented by abandoned
mines. In that May, 1998, incident, the sudden subsidence of land above a long-hidden mine entrance
claimed property and undercut the foundation of a new home near Grass Valley.
Despite its colorful contribution to local history, mining had, and continues to have, a serious
“downside” in terms of safety. Unfortunately, the magnitude of potential mine-related problems in
the Sierra foothills is just starting to be recognized. That recognition includes an admission by State
Mining and Geology experts that little is known about the locations of mine-related hazards, a factor
inhibiting comprehensive solutions.
Mine-related hazards include the presence of open holes at ground surface; inadequately
covered/shored up shafts and tunnels below ground level; tailings, and other abandoned mining
features. Safety and hazard concerns resulting from old mine operations include the risk of falling
into open shafts, surface collapse/subsidence into old shafts, and the presence of residual toxic
materials generated in mining processes.
A substantial portion of the Planning Area is underlain by a deep, extensive labyrinth of abandoned
mine tunnels. The Empire Mine tunnels alone extend some 365 miles beneath the City of Grass
Valley. Literally dozens of mining claims were “worked” in the Grass Valley area during the heyday
of gold mining. Some were large, mechanized operations. Most were small and more labor-intensive.
Hard- rock mining, as historically practiced in western Nevada County, was also characterized by 1)
one or more angular shafts from surface to underground tunnels for transporting miners, equipment,
and ore and 2) vertical air shafts from tunnels up to the surface, whose functions were to admit fresh
air to the otherwise depleted atmosphere below. Tailings piles (ore storage) and tailings ponds (used
in ore processing) were also typical surface features of deep mines. Figure 7-1 shows locations of
2020 General Plan                                     7-2                                 November, 1999

mine tailings piles in the Planning Area (U.S. Geological Survey data). Figure 7-2 depicts old mining
claims in the Grass Valley area. These maps are potential indicators of mine-related hazards, but are
by no means definitive guides to where surface hazards do or do not exist.
Mines and mining, always dangerous while in operation, posed new dangers when abandoned. Air
shafts were left exposed or covered by a few boards. They are typically holes of 4 to 10 feet in
diameter on the surface, extending hundreds of feet down to the mine tunnels below. Access shafts
were often covered hurriedly by closing off the mine mouth (entrance) with logs, then backfilling with
rock and earth. In time, the forgotten-but-“reclaimed” site sprouted vegetation, hiding a large hole
lurking perhaps as little as 8 to 10 feet below the surface.
The susceptibility of mine shafts to subsidence or cave-ins depends on a number of factors,
particularly water content of the soil above and the depth and physical condition of the shaft. The
Division of Mines and Geology believes that septic systems contribute to subsidence by keeping
otherwise dry soil overburden wet and heavy, thus triggering collapses that might otherwise not
occur.
The greatest problem regarding mine-related surface hazards is the absence of information about the
locations and physical characteristics of abandoned tunnel entrances and shafts. Without such
information, it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the problem or to devise remedial programs.
Slope Instability
Unstable soils and geologic conditions have historically resulted from vegetation removal associated
with wildfires, timber harvesting, mining, and grading as part of road and building site development.
Depending on local topographic, geologic and hydrogeologic conditions, significant precipitation can
exacerbate unstable conditions, resulting in landslides and mudslides. Any area adjacent to a
hydraulically mined area is subject to landslide activity due to the removal of supporting rock and soil.
Under such conditions, earthquakes or heavy rains can initiate slide activity.
Landslides are events in which surface masses of slope-forming earth move outward and downward
from their underlying and stable floors in response to the force of gravity. Unstable or potentially
unstable slopes are susceptible to slide, falls, creeps, or mud flows. Although slope movements can
occur in any type of rock material, certain bedrock formations exhibit a high susceptibility to such
movement. This type is generally not found in the western portion of the County, but could occur
on a local basis.
Flooding
As indicated by Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), the
City of Grass Valley and the General Plan Planning Area are relatively well drained. The 100-year
flood designations are generally confined to narrow bands along local drainages. Few transportation
corridors are susceptible to flooding in a 100-year flood event. Idaho-Maryland Road east of SR
49/20 and South Auburn Street south of Whiting Street will be flooded during a 100-year flood. To
the extent culverts and storm drains are not maintained, other localized flooding could occur.
2020 General Plan                                    7-3                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Structures located in the flood hazard areas would be subject to flooding in a 100-year flood event
unless special mitigation is employed.
The current FEMA flood map for Grass Valley and vicinity is shown in Figure 7-3. Future
development will inevitably result in increased runoff, thus increasing the potential for flooding in
natural and man-made drainage ways.
Flooding as a result of dam failure can occur as a result of manmade or natural causes. Such causes
include improper siting, structural design flaws, erosion of the face of foundation, earthquakes,
massive landslides, and rapidly rising flood waters. The only dam capable of inundating a any portion
of the Grass Valley Planning Area in event of failure is the Scotts Flat Lake Dam operated by NID.
Inundation as a result of dam failure would most likely be the result of an earthquake. However, the
area of Nevada County in which these dams exist is not located within an historical seismic zone. In
fact, the western half of Nevada County is within the lowest earthquake intensity zone in California.
Structural and Wildland Fire
Fire protection agencies in the City of Grass Valley General Plan Planning Area include the City of
Grass Valley Fire Department, which provides service within the City, the Nevada County
Consolidated Fire District, which serves the area generally north, west and south of the City, and the
Ophir Hill Fire District, which serves lands east of the City. In 1998, an Automatic Aid agreement
was reached among these agencies, which provides for a response by a minimum of two pieces of
equipment anywhere in the City within four minutes, 24 hours/day. Otherwise, mutual aid from
agencies state-wide is provided pursuant to the California Fire Service and Rescue Emergency Mutual
Aid System via its Mutual Aid Plan.
The City of Grass Valley maintains the following four fire-fighting facilities, strategically sited
throughout the City. The City's current average response time is 4.0 minutes1 and an ISO rating of
4. The five-year plan is to consolidate the four fire facilities to two locations: Fire Station No. 1 at
its existing location to serve the west portion of the City and Fire Station No. 2, a new station located
near the Sierra College Campus, to serve the east portion of the City. A third station is tentatively
planned in the southern portion of the Planning Area near North Star Drive. A future station could
be located within the Loma Rica Industrial Park if and when that area is annexed to the City.
The Grass Valley region has a generally high potential for wildland fires of devastating intensity. This
is due to the presence, particularly in less urban settings, of heavier timber, woodland and brush, the
occurrence of steep slopes, dry weather conditions, and human activity. Generally, vegetative areas
of over 8% slope are considered as fire hazardous.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) provides fire protection for
wildland areas, and is legally responsible only for wildland fires, not structural fires, during the fire
season.

  Response time is defined as average response from notification to service provision at incident location.

City of Grass Valley, California
Existing standards for development that are expected to provide adequate access, fire flows, and
other facilities to maintain an appropriate level of fire protection will continue to derive from the
California Building Code, the California Fire Code, and the California Mechanical Code.
The City's municipal water system serves the majority of the City's incorporated boundaries, or
approximately 1,357 acres and approximately 60% of the current incorporated area. A few properties
outside the City are served, such as the Nevada County Fair Grounds.
Under a current agreement, the City purchases raw water from NID and then treats and distributes
the water. Of the 250,000 acre feet of water available to NID, about 170,000 acre feet are currently
used. The City's treatment facility has the capacity to treat five times the amount of water currently
processed. Limitations exist on expansion of the City's water service due to topographical constraints
and location of the treatment facility.
Due to the location of most reservoirs at 100-200 feet in elevation above the City, the City of Grass
Valley water system provides excellent pressure and flows for firefighting purposes. There are
isolated areas of inadequate piping and areas that have no hydrants. These areas are being upgraded
as the City develops. As the City has expanded its geographic limits, areas served by NID have been
incorporated.
Emergency Access and Evacuation Routes
The City currently maintains approximately 38 miles of roadways, excluding state highways.
As do most foothill towns, the City of Grass Valley has comparatively narrow streets in older
developed areas. Improvements to roadways, intersections, and off-street parking facilities cited
above help alleviate congestion and improve fire access in these areas. Hilly roads slow response
times, particularly in snow conditions, although the Grass Valley Fire Department is equipped to deal
with these conditions. Nationally recognized standards are used by the Fire Department in planning
for new development to prevent access constraints to fire equipment and improve emergency
evacuation capabilities.
The Safety Element is required by California law to address the subject of evacuation routes, in the
event of a catastrophe. Figure 7-4 shows evacuation routes out of Grass Valley and the Planning
Area. Primary evacuation routes are the two freeways serving Grass Valley: Highway 49 (toward
the north and toward the south) and Highway 20 (toward the west). Secondary evacuation routes
are Highway 174 (toward the east), Brunswick Road (toward the east/southeast), McCourtney Road
(toward the southwest), West Main/Rough and Ready Highway (toward the west from the northwest
portion of the City), Idaho-Maryland Road (toward the east, until and unless the road is closed),
Nevada City Highway (toward the north paralleling Highway 20/49 toward Nevada City), and LaBarr
Meadows Road (toward the south, paralleling Highway 49 south toward Auburn). In the case of
evacuation, officials will direct traffic to proper evacuation routes. Quite naturally, the selection of
evacuation routes depends upon the magnitude, type, location, and direction of movement of the
catastrophic event.

City of Grass Valley, California
Airports
The Nevada County Airpark lies to the east of Grass Valley. The Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) defines the most critical areas as those immediately beyond the runway ends — the initial
climb out and final approach sectors. It is within these approach/departure sectors that the
concentration of aircraft accidents occur. In addition, there are studies indicating that about half of
all airport accidents occur on airport property and an additional 15% of accidents occur within one
mile outside the airport property. This suggests that areas immediately off the ends of the runway
and under the airport traffic pattern be carefully evaluated for developed land use.
The Foothill Airport Land Use Commission designates airport safety areas. Safety areas for Nevada
County Airpark are bordered, but not encroached upon, on the north and south sides by residential
developments or industrial buildings. All other safety areas at the airport are surrounded by open
space.
Figure 7-5, Airport Safety Areas, depicts Airport Safety Area 1 (clear zone), Airport Safety Areas
2, 3, and 4 located adjacent to and extending east and west of the Nevada County Airpark runway,
and Airport Safety Area 5, a 5,000' radius from the runway surface. A table entitled Land Use
Compatibility Guidelines for Safety lists compatible and incompatible land uses within the various
Safety Areas. The Grass Valley City Council adopted the Nevada County Airpark Comprehensive
Land Use Plan (CLUP) as City Resolution 89-153 on August 8, 1989. That resolution and CLUP
provisions adopted by City Resolution 89-153 contain specific provisions regarding structure height,
land use, noise, and safety in the Airpark vicinity.
Hazardous Materials
The significance of environmental or human exposure to hazardous materials depends on the type,
location, and quantity of the material released. In the Grass Valley area, hazardous materials may be
transported via roadways, railways, and airways. Industrial facilities that use, store, or dispose of
hazardous materials present the greatest potential to toxic exposure due to accidental release.
However, most of the hazardous waste stream in Nevada County, including Grass Valley, is
generated by "small quantity generators." Hazardous materials and wastes are regulated by federal
and state laws and are required to be recycled or properly disposed. Transport of hazardous materials
is also heavily regulated. However, illegal storage and disposal and unintentional releases of
hazardous materials from leaks and accidents can still occur.
Where hazardous materials are found to be illegally stored or otherwise accidentally released, the
initial response is provided by the local fire agencies. Site assessment and cleanup is conducted by
the Marysville Fire Department, which is operated by CDF. When discovered, fuel storage tank
leaks, are cleaned up under the jurisdiction of the California Regional Water Quality Control Board,
Central Valley Region.
Ten sites are listed in the Solid Waste Facilities, Sites, and Operations Database for the Grass Valley
area. These sites include closed, as well as operating solid waste landfills according to an inventory
2020 General Plan                                    7-6                                   November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

compiled by the California Integrated Waste Management Board. These waste sites are regulated
by the State and Nevada County.
Naturally Occurring Asbestos
Asbestos is a term used for several types of naturally occurring fibrous minerals found in many parts
of California. The most common type of asbestos is chrysotile, but other types are also found in the
state. Serpentine rock, which has a grayish-green to bluish-black color and an often shiny
appearance, often contains chrysotile asbestos and is abundant in the Sierra foothills.
Asbestos is not found in all serpentine rock, but when it does occur, it is typically present in amounts
ranging from less than 1% up to about 25% or more. Asbestos is released from serpentine rock
when it is broken or crushed. This can happen when cars drive over unpaved roads or driveways
surfaced with serpentine rock, when land is graded for building purposes, or at quarrying operations.
It is also released naturally through weathering and erosion. Once released from the rock, asbestos
can become airborne and may stay in the air for long periods of time.
Given the proximity of Grass Valley to potential serpentine deposits, it is possible that construction
activities and road surfacing could involve asbestos-containing serpentine rock or soils.
All types of asbestos are hazardous and may cause lung disease and cancer. The longer a person is
exposed to asbestos and the greater the intensity of exposure, the greater the chances for a health
problem. The Air Resources Board (ARB) adopted a statewide control measure which prohibits use
of serpentine rock for surfacing applications if it has more than 5% asbestos, and requires testing of
serpentine material that is sold.

10-SP Adopt and implement appropriate standards for access roads, on-site driveway standards, fuel
          reduction and emergency water supply.
11-SP Maintain appropriate standards for water supply, pressure and distribution for fire suppression
          purposes.
12-SP Maintain a high level of inter-jurisdictional cooperation and coordination, including
          appropriate automatic aid agreements with fire protection/ suppression agencies automatic
          aid agreements with fire protection/suppression agencies in western Nevada County.
13-SP Continue to implement provisions of the Nevada County Airpark Comprehensive Land Use
          Plan, and to coordinate as appropriate with Nevada County, Airpark management, and the
          Foothill Airport Land Use Commission regarding Airpark plans and safety considerations.
Safety Implementation Actions and Strategies
This section contains implementation actions and strategies designed to carry out the safety goals,
objectives, and policies.
1-SI      Adhere to the Land Use Plan’s compact overall development pattern, including infill (Land
          Use Element). A compact development pattern reduces total land area needed to
          accommodate projected development (thus reducing exposure to potential hazards); facilitates
          quick response to emergencies from established locations, such as fire stations; and allows
          cost-effective extension of safety-related infrastructure, such as streets, water and storm-
          water drainage systems.
2-SI      Utilize open space/conservation reserves and easements to restrict development in high-risk
          areas, such as flood-prone areas, airport safety zones, and areas identified as subject to
          geologic risk.
3-SI      Amend land use regulations to allow clustering and density averaging in conjunction with
          restricted development of potentially hazardous areas.
4-SI      Encourage continuity and linkages within the circulation system. Require future
          developments to provide multiple ingress/egress points, to facilitate emergency vehicle access
          and mobility, and to facilitate emergency evacuation movements.
5-SI      Maintain high standards of fire preparedness, capacity, and response. Assure the City’s
          capability to maintain such standards as areas are annexed.
6-SI      Establish a mine-related hazards program, to include the following specific actions. Initiate
          and maintain a mine hazard data base, incorporating maps, technical studies, and other
          germane information. To the extent practical and possible, map and describe identified
          hazards. Coordinate with Nevada County and the State Division of Mines and Geology in
          mine hazard research and information collection and dissemination. Provide technical
          assistance and advice to property owners in identifying and mitigating mine-related hazards
          on their properties. Determine the appropriate extent of geo-technical field investigations and
          other research required to determine the presence or absence of potentially hazardous mine-
          related features. Require appropriate field investigations and other research as part of the
          approval process for new developments, including individual new structures.
7-SI      Continue to regulate development within flood prone areas to reduce the risks of flood
          hazards to life and property. Avoid stream channel modifications.
8-SI      Require new developments to utilize on-site storm water detention techniques.
2020 General Plan                                   7-8                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

9-SI      Establish site development standards designed to minimize the resulting area and percentage
          of impervious surface.
10-SI     Revise flood hazard maps at appropriate intervals, to reflect the effects of land use changes
          subsequent to previous flood hazard studies.
11-SI     Incorporate into City construction codes appropriate provisions and revisions of the Uniform
          Building Code regarding seismic safety.
12-SI     Maintain an active code enforcement program to assure the safety of residential and
          commercial structures.
13-SI     Require new developments located on officially identified hazardous waste sites to conduct
          appropriate investigations, submit results to the City, and prepare a mitigation plan as part of
          the project review process.
14-SI     Enforce provisions of the Nevada County Airpark Master Plan, Nevada County Airpark
          Comprehensive Land Use Plan, and City Council Resolution 89-153 (General Plan
          amendment GPA89-01) regarding development in designated Airport Safety Areas.
15-SI     Mark evacuation routes with visible signage.
16-SI     Establish and maintain public information and awareness programs regarding public safety and
          hazards, in cooperation with appropriate emergency agencies and organizations.
17-SI     Consider the location and characteristics of documented hazardous waste sites as part of the
          environmental assessment process for proposed developments.

CHAPTER EIGHT
RECREATION ELEMENT
Recreation is an optional General Plan element under California law.
The Recreation Element addresses parks and recreation facilities throughout the Grass Valley
Planning Area, including both those owned and maintained by the City of Grass Valley and those
under the purview of other agencies or, selectively, private entities. The Recreation Element is closely
linked both to the Land Use Element and to the Conservation/Open Space Element.
Figure 8-1 shows park and recreational facilities within the City of Grass Valley and the
unincorporated portion of the Grass Valley Planning Area.
Historically, land for park and recreation facilities has been donated to the City by public-spirited
individuals.
The Grass Valley Subdivision Ordinance provides for land dedication for parks and recreation, and
for in lieu fees through which residential developments might facilitate park land acquisition. The
standard for park and recreation dedications or in lieu fees, established under provisions of the
“Quimby Act” (Section 66477 of the State Government Code), is a maximum of 5 acres per 1,000
population.
The City owns and maintains eight park/recreation facilities. These include two parks currently
classified as “community parks”: Condon Park and Memorial Park.
Two of the eight parks, Morgan Ranch Park and Mulcahy Field, are in the process of being
developed. In addition, the City contracts with Nevada County to operate the Pelton Wheel
Museum/Glen Jones Park which, in turn, the City contracts for operation and maintenance with the
Nevada County Historical Society.
An inventory of City owned/operated park and recreation facilities follows:
          !        Memorial Park, 8.4 acres
          !        Condon Park, 80 acres
          !        Pelton Wheel Museum/Glen Jones Park, 1.7 acres
          !        Brighton Street Park (Minnie Street), 1.6 acres
          !        Elizabeth Daniels Park, 0.3 acres
          !        Dow Alexander Park, 0.5 acres
          !        Morgan Ranch Park, 4.08 acres (future development)
          !        Mulcahy Field, 12.5 acres (future development)
Additional park/recreational facilities within the City of Grass Valley, but owned and maintained by
entities other than the City, are as follows:

Per capita figures are based on the California Department of Finance January 1, 1998 population estimate of 9,475 for the City of Grass Valley.
The Nevada County Country Club on East Main Street is a 58 acre, 9-hole public golf course owned
and operated by a private company. It is the only public-access golf course located within the
Planning Area.
The Sierra College Park, developed in 1998-99, is a soccer and baseball facility slightly less than eight
acres, located on the Sierra College campus near Nevada Union High School. As part of the College
campus, the park remains under the auspices of the Sierra Community College District Board of
Trustees.
The Hennessy School, located just east of Highway 49 near downtown Grass Valley, is owned by the
Grass Valley Elementary School District. The school grounds and attendant facilities are classified
as a park as they are accessible to the public.
Existing park and recreation facilities outside the Grass Valley City limits, but within the Planning
Area, follow. The three listed facilities total 963+ acres.
            !           Nevada County Fairgrounds, 100 acres
            !           Nevada Union High School, 63+ acres (includes entire campus)
            !           Empire Mine State Park, 800 acres
            !           Scotton and Gilmore School properties
            !           Sierra Mountain
The Nevada County Fairgrounds is a 100 acre parcel owned and maintained by the State Fairgrounds
Authority. The facility is classified as a regional park. The Fairgrounds house several community
facilities, including the Senior Citizens Building. The annual Nevada County Fair and other
recreational activities take place at the Fairgrounds, which are used year-round.
2020 General Plan                                                       8-2                                                       November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
Nevada Union High School, operated by the Nevada Joint Union High School District, includes
substantial recreational and sports facilities on a 63+ acre campus located on Ridge Road. The
campus is adjacent to, though not currently within, the Grass Valley City limits.
It should be pointed out that inclusion of the entirety of acreage devoted to the Hennessy School and
Nevada Union High School tends to exaggerate the actual, usable recreation acreage in the inventory
of recreation lands. A more definitive identification of usable recreation space on these properties,
and other school properties in the unincorporated Planning Area is needed but currently unavailable.
Empire Mine State Park is part of the State of California Park system. The Park, over 800 acres,
includes the old mine, historic and interpretive buildings and exhibits, and over one square mile of
forested open space with trails and natural areas. The Park maintains over ten miles of hiking trails
open to the public.
The total acreage of existing park and recreation facilities in the entire Planning Area (City limits plus
unincorporated area) is 1,124. The Planning Area encompasses 9,894 acres. Thus, existing parks
and recreation areas, as defined to include school grounds with public-access recreational areas,
comprise 11.4 percent of the Planning Area.
Recreation Goals and Objectives
1-RG Allow for expanded and diverse recreational programs, areas and opportunities.
          1-RO Development and continuation of park and open space programs.
          2-RO Promote City-sponsored recreation programs.
          3-RO Establishment of a mechanism for inter-jurisdictional cooperation in the Grass Valley
                   area.
          4-RO Assurance that an adequate amount of parklands are set aside proportionate to needs
                   and growth.
2-RG Facilitate community cultural opportunities.
          5-RO Establishment of cultural venues and programs.
          6-RO Establishment of general-purpose community gathering places and facilities.
Recreation Issues
Park and Recreation Organization and Administration
Park and recreation organization and administration is critical to the provision of municipal recreation
facilities and services. The City of Grass Valley recognized this need when it created the Parks and
Recreation Commission in January, 1999 and authorized a Park and Recreation System Master Plan
to be completed during 1999 and early 2000. In a period of rising public expectations and expanding
definitions of the recreation function, professional management and administration is a prerequisite
to any public-sector recreation program.
Expanding Scope of the Park and Recreation Function
2020 General Plan                                    8-3                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California
In decades past, the park/recreation function consisted of little more than acquiring, developing, and
maintaining traditional parks. Little changed from year to year: park facilities stayed the same, new
parks were rarely added to the “system”. Public recreation today has changed dramatically, based
on public expectations, needs, and demands. Among the major changes, all pertinent to Grass Valley
and the recreation function are:
          !        Emphasis on recreation “programs”, organized activities, and events, with
                   implications for both recreation facilities and administration. Related is the utilization
                   of recreation programs/activities in conjunction with education, health, day care,
                   senior care, and other pursuits outside the realm of traditional park facilities
                   management.
          !        Demand for non-traditional recreational facilities. Public trails, pathways, linear
                   parkways (see Recreation Policies), and natural open space are very different from
                   conventional parks. Cultural facilities represent a further expansion of the
                   community’s perception of recreation. Effective assumption of new and different
                   recreational responsibilities represents a challenge to the City’s recreation providers.
          !        Community demographics and development patterns, whose shifts and changes
                   inevitably cause public demand for changes in facilities and services. Population
                   growth and changes in land use patterns are powerful contributing forces — an
                   existing park may pass through several generations of primary users in a short time,
                   from active tots to teens to senior citizens.
          !        Determining needs, standards, and levels of service. The dynamics of community
                   demographics and recreational preferences requires constant re-evaluation of pre-
                   conceived service standards.
          !        Private recreation opportunities and facilities may compete with or supplant those
                   offered by the public sector, raising questions of what to offer, to whom, where, and
                   in what quantities.
Inter-organizational Coordination
As Grass Valley enhances its park/recreation facilities and services over the next 20 years, substantial
coordination with outside organizations, governmental and private, is imperative. Involvement with
Nevada County is essential to assure that the needs of citizens in the entire Community Region
(Sphere of Influence, Planning Area) are addressed in a coordinated manner. Implementation of a
Trails Network will require close coordination with Nevada County, the Nevada Irrigation District,
the California Department of Parks and Recreation, Sierra College and other agencies, if for no other
reason than to assure access to public and quasi-public easements and rights-of-way. Similarly,
private organizations (Nevada County Land Trust, for example) have much to offer. Broader
responsibilities and an expanded “scope of services” will necessitate unprecedented coordination and
cooperation with outside entities.

City of Grass Valley, California

Recreation Policies
1-RP Provide parks and open spaces of different sizes and types to respond to the needs of a
          diverse population, including trails for pedestrian and equestrian use, bicycle pathways, linear
          parkways and park-like natural areas.
2-RP Increase the standard of park acreage to population.
3-RP Distinguish neighborhood park needs from community and regional park needs.
4-RP Establish a City-sponsored open space district to operate and manage existing and future open
          space resources.
5-RP Formalize and enhance walking trails in existing City parks.
6-RP Provide non-motorized linkages between parks and open spaces.
7-RP Include a map in the General Plan designating a trails network for the Planning Area.
8-RP Cooperate with other jurisdictions to address regional park and recreation needs.
9-RP Develop performing arts in various venues, including a performing arts center.
10-RP Expand the existing library as a cultural venue.
11-RP Create a public plaza in downtown for community events and activities.
12-RP Support efforts to establish a community center for mixed ages and a variety of uses.
Park and Recreation Planning
Grass Valley will prepare a Park and Recreation System Master Plan in 1999 and 2000. The Master
Plan will establish policy, set standards, identify and prioritize capital investments (land, facilities),
and address operational and fiscal matters. The Master Plan will be reviewed and updated
periodically.
The basic role of the General Plan, particularly the Recreation Element, is to provide an overall policy
framework within which more specific “functional” plans and actions may occur. This Recreation
Element, however, both establishes a policy framework and dictates some specifics (standards, park
needs, creation and description of the Trails Network). The Master Plan process must have
flexibility, but any departure from the General Plan shall require a General Plan amendment at the
time of Master Plan adoption.
2020 General Plan                                     8-5                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Park Classification and Standards

The following are identified as high priority park needs, subject to further analysis during the Parks
and Recreation System Master Plan process:
          !        Glenbrook Basin neighborhood park
          !        Infill areas neighborhood parks, as determined by radius standard
          !        Loma Rica Community Park
          !        Neighborhood parks in all Special Development Areas, when needed
          !        East Bennett Street neighborhood park, in conjunction with annexation and
                   development of residential area designated on Land Use Plan map.
          !        Downtown Plaza (special purpose park).
          !        Provision for existing and future parks to serve as “community gathering places.”
Recreation Trails Network Diagram and Description
Creation of a pedestrian network serving Grass Valley and the Planning Area is a high priority of this
General Plan. Figure 8-2, the Trails-Sidewalks Network Concept Plan map, shows the conceptual
“multi-purpose” trail-sidewalk system directed by policies in the Recreation Element, Circulation
Element, and Conservation/Open Space Element.
2020 General Plan                                     8-6                                November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Versions of the trails concept have been part of Grass Valley’s General Plans since the first General
Plan was adopted in August, 1966. Little progress has been made in thirty-three years.
The Trails-Sidewalks Network is multi-purpose in that it serves both the utilitarian and recreational
needs. It is for the use of pedestrians, bicyclists, and equestrians, though not all segments are
intended for use by all. The concept plan provides for a comprehensive system, not just isolated
segments, for non-motorized vehicular use.
Following is a summary of features of the trails portion of the Trails-Sidewalks Network:
          !        An integrated pedestrian/bicycle/equestrian “greenway” system for recreation and
                   non-motorized vehicular transportation uses.
          !        Combines natural trails, where appropriate, with sidewalks set back from roadways
                   in areas where trails are impractical.
          !        Utilizes public lands and rights-of-way to the maximum extent.
          !        Utilizes donations, easement dedications, development rights concessions, and
                   “friendly acquisition” of private land.
          !        Uses siting and design techniques to reduce public access intrusion and visual impacts
                   on private land.
          !        Courses through designated open space and natural areas, providing access to Grass
                   Valley’s natural amenities.
          !        Provides linkages between neighborhoods, recreation areas and parks, commercial,
                   employment, and cultural centers.
          !        Ties into external networks, including the Empire Mine State Park trails and the
                   Nevada County Trail System.
          !        Sidewalk segments: to be constructed along at least one side of all existing arterials
                   (principle and minor) and collectors; to be constructed on both sides of all new streets
                   and roads other than freeways and expressways; to be separated by a minimum of 8'
                   from the edge of paved roadway, except in prohibitive circumstances.
          !        Trails segments: to occupy easements of 10'-20', unless exceptional circumstances
                   dictate narrower widths; all segments available to pedestrians, wider segments provide
                   for separate bicycle routes, equestrian routes determined selectively.
          !        Trail segments as shown in Trails-Sidewalks Network Concept Plan include Litton
                   Trail, Sierra College, Wolf Creek corridor, South Fork Wolf Creek corridor, the
                   Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad right-of-way, and Nevada Irrigation District
                   canals.
          !        Network extensions and dedications to be required in future annexation areas.
                   Nevada County cooperation and co-development of the Network in unincorporated
                   areas prior to annexation is invited.

Recreation Implementation Actions and Strategies
1-RI      Prepare Parks and Recreation System Master Plan, incorporating appropriate provisions of
          this General Plan (including the Trails-Sidewalks Network Concept Plan) into the Master
          Plan. Establish clear priorities and phasing plans as part of the Master Plan process.
2-RI      Establish a formal mechanism for ongoing coordination with Nevada County, to include but
          not be limited to joint facility funding; agreement on plans, programs, services, and activities.
3-RI      Establish and utilize neighborhood planning and participation to determine localized needs and
          desires for facilities and services.
4-RI      Pursue alternatives to city acquisition and maintenance of recreation areas via homeowners
          associations, assessment districts, and private organizations.
4-RI      Provide a focal point and coordinating mechanism for the efforts of non-governmental entities
          involved in the acquisition of property or property rights related to City park and recreation
          facilities.

CHAPTER NINE
HISTORICAL ELEMENT
The Historical Element is an optional General Plan Element. Previous Grass Valley General Plans
have placed historic considerations into the Urban Design Element, thus emphasizing solely the
architectural and structural aspects of the City’s history. Creation of a separate Historical Element
in the General Plan acknowledges a broader role for historical appreciation in the life of Grass Valley,
a community highly conscious of its colorful past.
Historic appreciation is the key to historic preservation. The Historical Element first presents a brief
overview of historical resources, and community activities to preserve and protect those resources.
Following are historic goals and objectives adopted as part of this General Plan. Next are adopted
policies and implementation actions and strategies.
Preparation of this Historical Element included in-depth historical and cultural research and records
survey. Documented historical and cultural features, lore, and historical appearance all contribute
to the historical and cultural environment. Research methodology, text, and lists of historic features
are available in City files and in the General Plan Background Report (Quad Knopf , November,
1998), a copy of which is available for inspection at the Grass Valley Community Development
Department.
Grass Valley’s Historic Resources and Programs
Grass Valley has a rich historical heritage from the California gold rush of 1849, through the
tumultuous mining period which followed. The last active gold mine (until the 1990's) closed in
1956, ending 107 years of continuous production. Many valuable historical resources still remain as
a reminder of the City’s legacy.
Rather than setting aside historic structures and districts as quaint relics or museum pieces, Grass
Valley prides itself on the continued use and enjoyment of old homes, hotels, saloons, and other
structures as part of the community “fabric”.
Grass Valley’s historical mining town atmosphere is an important economic generator, luring tourists
and local residents. Improvements at the Empire Mine State Park will heighten Grass Valley’s
attractiveness to the growing historical tourism industry.
Above and beyond economic considerations, a strong sense of history is a true community attribute.
Many residents of Grass Valley and vicinity equate the town’s historic character with the area’s
quality of life. There exists growing interest within the community in protecting and restoring
continuity with early Grass Valley and its lore, through preservation of historical landmarks and
resources.
2020 General Plan                                   9-1                                    November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

Age and environment have taken their toll on the old buildings of Grass Valley. Many are maintained
in excellent condition, but others need major maintenance, restoration, or rehabilitation for protection
of their historical features, for health and safety, and to improve their convenience and function in a
modern economy.
A Facade Improvement Program and the Community Development Block Grant Program have been
implemented by the City to assist owners in structural restoration and rehabilitation. The City of
Grass Valley Historical Commission was established by the City Council in 1994, with a goal of
identifying and inventorying historical landmarks and resources. The Commission has initiated a
Heritage Home Awards Program, involving annual awards to owners who have restored or
rehabilitated historically and architecturally significant homes within the original 1872 Townsite.
The “Grass Valley Style” of architecture is distinctive. It is characterized by covered sidewalks or
porches, narrowly proportioned windows and doors, iron shutters, and materials of brick, wood,
natural stone, and cast iron. The style is characterized by a human scale relationship between the old
buildings and the narrow streets. Covered sidewalks in commercial areas and wide porches around
residences provide shade during summer and shelter from rain and snow in winter.
Buildings in Grass Valley today are an eclectic mix of architectural styles constructed over a period
of years from 1850 to the present. The old “Grass Valley style” may be replicated in new buildings
by using the old proportions and details of windows and doors, but using modern methods and
materials reproduced to resemble original materials. Examples of recent restorations are buildings
in the Downtown Historic District at 146 and 126 Mill Street (Figure 9-1).
Some residential neighborhoods in Grass Valley have retained their original character and reflect the
cultural backgrounds of the original residents. Included are:
          !        Mill Street in the area of Echo Hill and Gold Hill, where many miner’s cottages
                   remain.
          !        Between South Church Street and South School Street and the West Main area of
                   Nob Hill, occupied by stately Victorian homes once owned by mine owners, lawyers,
                   and doctors.
          !        South Auburn Street, between Winchester Hill and Kate Hayes Hill, a mixture of
                   Victorians, cottages, Tudor style homes and craftsman style bungalows once were
                   home to merchants, carpenters, and teamsters.
          !        Along Bennett Street in the Pike Flat area east of Highway 20/49, where there is a
                   mixture of homes from stately Victorians to miner’s cottages built in the 1870's and
                   1880's by or for miners and employees and teamsters (freight haulers and wagon
                   drivers) working on the Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad.
          !        Eureka Heights area north of Main Street between North Auburn, Eureka, and
                   Murphy Streets where the topography is quite steep and the lots are small with small
                   Victorian cottages formerly inhabited by miners, merchants, masons, and carpenters.
Figure 3-7 (in the Land Use Element) depicts Grass Valley’s neighborhoods, many of which have
historically significant origins. Figure 9-2 shows the original 1872 Townsite.

CHAPTER TEN
COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
The Purposes of Community Design and the Community Design Element
Community Design is about community building. It concerns the built character, order, and psyche
of the City. It is the interrelationship of various components (buildings, the transportation system,
open space, vistas, human interaction between each other and the natural environment, heritage, and
economics) that when put together make up a total community.
Community Design concerns range from how to build neighborhoods to planning pedestrian ways
safe for children to walk to school or for the elderly to cross the street. Design addresses key issues
as how to maintain the downtown area as a place where local people as well as visitors want to go.
Good Community Design respects the natural environment as well as economic gain, and strives to
create places for people to feel comfortable with each other and with the built environment.
The relationships between Grass Valley’s natural setting and community development are fragile. The
Community Design Element is concerned with the preservation of the City’s historical heritage while
accommodating growth and revitalization. It is a concerted effort to realize the positive attributes of
the City, to enhance those attributes, and to assure that they influence the new growth and infill areas
in a positive way.
Community Design Goals and Objectives

The Downtown area and adjoining residential and commercial areas have a unique urban feeling and
sense of history. As new development, redevelopment or rehabilitation occurs it is important to reflect
on and respect that heritage through sensitive design. Downtown needs to be the community’s
gathering place where people can mingle and where culture can be easily found.
Historic Areas
Historic areas and individual sites are scattered throughout Grass Valley. They provide a sense of
continuity with the past and are a valuable resource that attracts commerce to the community.
Interface Between Older and New Developments
New development must respect the scale and intensity of adjacent older development. New
developments should provide physical connections through streets, lanes and/or trails wherever
possible so that pedestrians, bicycles, automobiles and transit can move safely and easily between
local destinations, and between home and work.

Infill, Redevelopment, and Older Area Revitalization
Infill and reuse opportunities will become increasingly important as Grass Valley‘s new phase of
compact development begins. This compact development maximizes the efficient use of land and
infrastructure and avoids the intrusion of urban uses on the natural landscape. Infill and reuse
strategies must be major components of economic development and redevelopment planning.
Infill uses, by definition, are additions to the existing community and must respect the pre-existing
uses, patterns, and community aesthetics. Wherever possible infill strategies should create areas which
contain mixtures of complementary uses that are within safe, easy and convenient walking distance
of each other.

City of Grass Valley, California

Higher Density Residential Developments
An approach to achieving compact development is to provide for higher density residential
developments. This type of development pattern does not refer to multifamily housing, even single
family projects can be provided at higher density. Multi-family developments should be scattered
throughout the community, not concentrated in any one area, with decreasing intensity as distance
from commercial core areas increases. Multi-family projects should respect the development pattern,
scale, and design prevalent in neighborhoods in which they are located.
Mixed Use Projects and Areas
All neighborhoods should provide for a full complement of uses such as civic facilities, housing,
parks, schools, shops, and work places to support the daily lives of residents. Careful consideration
of potential conflicts between uses must be taken in the development of the zoning ordinance,
consolidation of the design guidelines and in the design of individual projects.
Streets, Sidewalks, Paths, and Trails
Active street environments promote positive behavior and safety. Residents and visitors alike should
be able to walk, ride a bicycle or drive a car in safety and comfort. Streets should be designed to
ensure appropriate behavior by drivers and to accommodate other modes of transportation. A finer
network of lanes and streets is preferred over collector and arterial streets. Sidewalks, trails and
paths should be frequent and well shaded and provide accommodations for the young and old alike.
Public Gathering Places
Many areas of the City have an identifiable and unique sense of place. These characteristics should
be preserved and enhanced in established areas and provided for in areas lacking them and in new
growth areas. In designing our streets, the community’s primary gathering places, the comfort of
people is the highest priority. This can be done by providing signs at eye level, human scaled street
lighting, creation of plazas and mini-parks, wide sidewalks protected from the flow of traffic, benches,
shade, pedestrian-controlled crosswalks, and buildings that do not dwarf the pedestrian.
Parks and Open Spaces
A full range of usable open space choices, from neighborhood and regional parks to trails and creeks,
should be available and easily accessible to every resident in the community. Existing natural features
should be maintained and enhanced, not only for aesthetic reasons, but also because they enhance
property values and encourage congregation outdoors. New development should include preservation
of the natural environment and the establishment of new outdoor spaces.

Community Design Issues
The following discussions of subareas describe areas in the community and their community design
issues.
The historic Downtown core is a combination of commercial, civic and residential uses. The
commercial district is abundant with buildings constructed over the past 150 years. The eastern
section of Downtown (bounded by South Auburn, East Main and Highway 20/49) is a mixture of the
old and the new, newer buildings and styles including City Hall, Police Station, Post Office, the Free
Flight building and Union 76 gas station. Brockington Manor is an example of more contemporary
architecture (quasi-southwestern) not compatible with the Downtown. One newer building that is
very sympathetic to the historic character of Downtown is the Wells Fargo Bank building.
The entrances to Downtown via South Auburn and Colfax Street are not at all compatible with the
historic nature of the remainder of Downtown. This area should be the subject of a major
beautification effort to lure the visitor into Downtown.
To the north, south and west of the commercial core are the historic residential neighborhoods. These
neighborhoods are best characterized by Victorian era homes on small lots along narrow streets. The
historic quality of these neighborhoods needs to be protected through the development of historic
districts and the establishment of design criteria.
East Main Street from Idaho – Maryland Road northeastward is a strip commercial area
developed since 1950. Other commercial areas were developed earlier along major transportation
corridors. The areas have a combination of older highway commercial developments and more
contemporary neighborhood shopping centers. Most developments have parking lots between the
building and the public right-of-way. The buildings do not reflect the historic character of the core
area. The roadway right-of-ways are only partially improved and not particularly “pedestrian
friendly”. Revised development standards and design criteria should be developed specifically
addressing such areas.
There are essentially two eras of residential neighborhoods, those built prior to 1950 and those built
after 1950. Older neighborhoods were built closer to the core. Those built after 1950 were
dispersed, some adjacent to the established areas and others with varying degrees of connection to
the historic core. The closer-in homes were built along streets that followed a terrain driven street
grid pattern, were smaller in size, and had porches and less dominant garages (if any). A few were
developed with alleys servicing the rear of the properties. Homes built further from the core are more
traditional suburban type housing on curvilinear streets, with two car garages. Design standards which
foster more traditional design and development patterns would make newer developments more
compatible with the historic quality of Grass Valley.
With the exception of mining, industrial areas and business parks are relatively new to Grass
Valley. They are located in three general locations: South Auburn Street, Idaho – Maryland Road
2020 General Plan                                  10-5                                   November, 1999
City of Grass Valley, California

(including Whispering Pines) and Sierra College Drive. All three areas are relatively unconnected to
the historic core.
Some of the business park and industrial areas have been developed as planned “park” subdivisions
with development guidelines. Others are independent individual projects.
The “park” subdivisions have large setbacks and off-street parking requirements. Because of setback
standards and sloping terrain, many buildings and parking areas are not evident from surrounding
                                                        th
streets. The buildings are generally typical of late 20 Century suburban commercial buildings except
there is more frequency of unpainted wood siding and metal roofing than is typical of the Sierra
Foothills.
These areas provide an excellent opportunity for infill development allowing for the accommodation
of new employment opportunities while conserving precious lands.
The 2020 General Plan designates four Special Development Areas (SDAs) for detailed planning and
annexation: North Star, Loma Rica Ranch, Kenny Ranch, and the Bear River Mill Site. Planning for
SDAs presents an opportunity to approach new growth in Grass Valley in a manner that
comprehensively addresses issues that result from new development.
If the SDAs are planned properly, there can be a substantial reduction in development costs, long-
term maintenance costs, and environmental impacts as well as a substantial enhancement in the quality
of life within the annexed areas and within Grass Valley as a whole.
For the three SDAs with current annexation agreements with the City of Grass Valley, the following
suggestions are made:
         Use of clustering and grouping: SDAs could be developed with the same quantity of
         proposed uses but in a substantially more compact form, perhaps allowing for more open
         space than presently contemplated.
          Reduced infrastructure development costs: Utilizing more compact development forms
          would result in a reduction in the amount of development infrastructure cost by thirty to sixty
          percent.
          Village Centers: With a more compact development form and greater open space buffers, the
          annexations could be developed as villages that would support a more pleasant community
          ambience, enhance quality of life, and a dramatic reduction in automobile trips (and other
          environmental impacts). A village form would greatly reduce the quantity of trips internal to
          the SDAs, and enhance the potential for transit links to other parts of the community.
         Building and infrastructure guidelines: Guidelines should be developed for the SDAs to
         promote higher quality building design and enhanced accessibility for pedestrians within the
         village.

The Community Design Environment in 2020
A magnificent environment, a proud history and a citizenry committed to providing the future with
a quality of life second to none – these are a few of the many assets Grass Valley possesses. These
same assets provide a strong foundation for the City to realize its vision for the future.
Grass Valley’s small town, rural character and its sense of community create an invisible bond
between its historic past and its vibrant future that is realized in the 2020 General Plan. The current
residents of Grass Valley are the caretakers of the future and are creating a bridge connecting the
dreams of their parent’s generation to the hopes they have for their children and their children’s
children.
Many changes can be anticipated in the next twenty years – an increase in population, changing
demographics and economics. It is the responsibility, as well as the privilege, of current residents to
launch Grass Valley into the 21st century by protecting the environment, strengthening the community
structure and nourishing the spirit of its citizens.
This will be accomplished, as stated in the goals of the 2020 General Plan, through infill development,
neighborhood integrity, sensitive community design, the creation of community and neighborhood
gathering places, and the fostering of economic development.
The hills, streams, trees and meadows of Grass Valley provide a perfect backdrop as well as the
foundation for the City’s vision of the future. This fragile environment is the basis of the superior
quality of life in the area and must be protected through wise land use planning.
To achieve this, one of the key elements in Grass Valley’s General Plan focuses on infill development
and increased residential densities in selected locations. By increasing density, open space will be
maximized and the cost of new infrastructure minimized.
To accommodate an increasing population, a variety of new housing types and designs will be
encouraged. Forty-five percent of new housing will be affordable, multi-family units. These multi-
family developments will be scattered throughout the city, not concentrated in areas or
neighborhoods. Infill development will respond to the higher percentage of seniors in the population.
Senior housing and care facilities will multiply.
Residential areas of historic character surrounding Downtown will have design standards to maintain
the integrity of the existing neighborhoods. On-going renovation and the implementation of code
enforcement will keep these residential areas vital and attractive.
New infill development within established areas will be consistent with historical patterns in terms of
scale, design and materials and follow a terrain-driven street grid pattern.
North Star, Loma Rica Ranch, Kenny Ranch, and the Bear River Mill site will be annexed. High

City of Grass Valley, California

density housing will create vibrant villages which foster a community ambiance and enhance quality
of life. Infill development and new planning principles will create a higher percentage of open space
which will be complemented by high quality streetscape and building design.
As part of the infill process, mixed-use development will become more common. This will allow
neighborhoods easier access to civic facilities, parks, schools, shopping and services. Neighborhoods
will not be isolated residential islands, but will be connected to commercial areas by a network of
streets, lanes, trails, sidewalks and paths.
Alternative transportation will increase in popularity. Travelways will conform to the terrain. Traffic
will be slower, calmer and less dangerous to pedestrians. Residents and visitors can walk, ride a bike
or drive a car in safety and comfort. Sidewalks, trails and paths are frequent, well shaded and provide
areas for rest and relaxation.
A primary destination for residents will be the Downtown. The heart of Grass Valley, the Downtown
continues to be the community’s principal gathering place where people can mingle and socialize.
Entertainment and new retail facilities as well as cultural attractions will be found here.
The entire area will be designated as a historic district giving the area a unique urban feeling and
sense of history. Interesting turn of the century buildings will provide the aesthetic foundation and
combine commercial, civic and residential uses. All city and public facilities will be located here.
The entrances to the Downtown via South Auburn and Colfax Streets will be attractive to visitors
as well as residents through façade improvement programs and design review and redevelopment.
Streetscapes will visually enhance the area and improve pedestrian access. The comfort of citizens
will be the highest priority and public gathering places will be accented by wide sidewalks, benches,
shaded areas, pedestrian controlled crosswalks, eye level signs and human scaled street lighting.
All public and private development projects will have areas for public gatherings and interaction.
There will be a full range of usable open spaces and recreational choices ranging from neighborhood
and regional parks to trails and creeks. The City parks will be expanded to include more natural
areas, open space and passive parks as well as active parks and playing fields.
Natural features will be maintained and enhanced for aesthetics and to protect property values. Views,
open spaces, hillsides, valleys, ridgelines, forested views, and notable buildings will have their views
protected. Land that is not buildable will be preserved in its natural state
The natural environment will be protected by setting aside environmentally sensitive areas, preserving
open spaces, developing parks and nature trails, and reclaiming abused areas. Public and private
support will assist in the creation of the protected riparian corridors. The Trails-Sidewalks Network
will connect outlying areas with Downtown Grass Valley providing both recreation and transportation
while assuring protection of wildlife habitats.

City of Grass Valley, California

Grass Valley’s beautiful natural environment and quality of life will be supported by its vibrant
economy. The City will continue to be a regional economic and cultural hub for Western Nevada
County, and its influence reach far beyond its physical boundaries. The growth of technology and
high-tech business will make Grass Valley a preferred choice for companies wanting a higher quality
of life for their employees. Small offices and in-home businesses have increased and provide important
services both locally and throughout the area. Sierra College, the medical/health care sector, tourism
and a growing senior population has sparked commercial growth in the area.
With the aging of the population the demand for medical and support services will be stimulated and
many new medical related offices will be developed in the vicinity of the hospital.
In addition to increased commercial activity in established commercial areas, older commercial areas
of the city will undergo redevelopment. Excellent opportunities for infill development will conserve
precious land.
By linking Grass Valley’s tradition-rich past with its vibrant future, the 2020 General Plan will
provide residents with an incomparable quality of life that maintains its small town rural character and
sense of community while also fulfilling its destiny as a the cultural and economic hub of western
Nevada County.

          benefit from the construction of a public facility. An assessment district has no legal life and
          cannot act on its own. It enables property owners in a specific area to cause the construction
          of public facilities or to maintain them by contributing their fair share of the construction
          and/or installation and operating costs.
!         Awning: AA fixed frame fabric shelter supported entirely from the exterior wall of a building

          parking lots for the exclusive use of store customers. Big Box establishments typically offer
          wide variety at low prices. However, they are criticized for their looks, relative size (scale),
          impacts on competitors, inability to “fit into” the fabric of nearby communities, and impacts
          on public facilities.
!         Buffer Zone: An area of land separating two distinct land uses which acts to soften or mitigate
          the effects of one land use on another.
!         Building: Any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or occupancy.
!         Business Park: The combination of a variety of businesses, from office to research and
          development to light industry to warehousing, located in structures built with open floor
          plans, so as to leave most interior improvements to the tenants to design to their needs.
!         California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA): A state law requiring state and local agencies to
          regulate activities with consideration for environmental protection. If a proposed activity has
          the potential for an adverse significant environmental impact, an Environmental Impact
          Report (EIR) must be prepared.
!         California Land Conservation Act (Williamson Act): Provides for the creation of agricultural
          preserves to protect agricultural lands. Includes procedures for preferential tax assessment

          quality of human life, health, welfare, safety or community character within an area will be
          impaired. Carrying capacity is usually used to determine the potential of an area to absorb
          development.
!         Circulation: Refers to the overall movement of automobiles, pedestrians, bicyclists,
          equestrians, etc.
!         Cluster Development: Development in which a number of dwelling units are placed in closer

          within specified criteria.
!         Community Park: Land with full public access intended to provide recreation opportunities
          beyond those supplied by neighborhood parks. Community parks are larger in scale than

!         Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP): Airport and environs plans prepared by Airport Land
          Use Commissions and adopted by local governments, pursuant to State law. Plans address
          airport expansion, noise/land use compatibility, and safety.
!         Comprehensive Plan: Counterpart of California’s General Plan in many states. Regardless of
          terminology, such Plans enjoy the highest position in the hierarchy of plans and land use
          regulations, are long term in nature, and must address full range of “functional” considerations
          (land use, transportation, etc.).
!         Conservation: The management of natural resources to prevent waste, destruction or neglect.
!         Conservation Easement: Instrument of land ownership in which the rights to property
          development are separated from property ownership. Typically purchased under contract to
          limit or prevent development.
!         Consistent: Free from variation or contradiction. Programs in a General Plan are to be

          plan and implementation measures such as the zoning ordinance.
!         Constraint: Something that restricts, limits or regulates a given course of action. It is used
          in a General Plan to describe “constraints” to development. Environmental constraints
          include, but are not limited to, steep slopes, poor soils and rare and endangered plant and
          animal species. Infrastructure constraints can include poor roads, antiquated water

          community sewer system.
!         Cut and Fill: The act of cutting into a slope and using the soil to backfill an area. A common
          example is the construction of a roadway on a slope where earth is removed from the upper
          side of the cut into the hill and used to fill the lower or outer edge of the cut to widen the
          road.
!         Dedication of Land: The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use,
          and the acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over
          the public function for which it will be used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites or
          other public uses are often made conditions for approval of a development.
!         Dedication, in lieu of: Cash payments which may be required of an owner or developer as a
          substitute for a dedication of land, usually calculated in dollars per lot or square foot of land
          or building area, and referred to as in lieu fees or in lieu contributions.
!         Density: The degree of grouping together of people or buildings. For housing, density is the
          number of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land. Density can be managed
          through zoning in the following ways: minimum lot size requirements, floor area ratio,
          building coverage limits, setback and yard requirements, minimum house size requirements,
          ratios comparing number and types of housing units to land area, limits on units per acre, and
          other means. Maximum allowable density often serves as the major distinction between
          residential districts.
!         Density Bonus: The allocation of development rights that allows a parcel to accommodate
          additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the
          parcel is zoned, usually in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity at the
          same site or at another location (See “Development Rights, Transfer of”).
!         Design Guidelines: Guidelines established by a local municipality intended to advise and direct
          the design of buildings, roads, parking facilities, etc.
!         Developable Acres, Net: The portion of a site remaining after removing or deducting public
          or private road rights-of-way and land not developable (see “Developable Land”), and which
          can then be built upon. Net acreage includes required yards or setback areas.
!         Developable Land: Land which is suitable as a location for structures and which can be
          developed free of or with minimal development constraints, and without disruption of, or
          significant impact on, natural resource areas.

!         Development: The physical extension and/or construction of urban land uses. Development
          activities include: subdivision of land; construction or alteration of structures, roads, utilities
          and other facilities; grading; deposit of refuse, debris or fill materials; and clearing of natural
          vegetation cover (with the exception of agricultural activities).
!         Development Rights: The selling of rights to develop land by a landowner who maintains fee-
          simple ownership of the land. The owner keeps title but agrees to continue using the land as
          it has been used, and the holder of the development rights maintains the right to develop.
          Such rights usually are expressed in terms of density allowed under existing zoning.
!         Development Rights, Transfer of (TDR): Also known as “Transfer of Development Credits,”
          a program which can relocate potential development from areas where proposed land use or
          environmental impacts are considered undesirable (the “donor” site) to another (“receiver”)
          site chosen on the basis of its ability to accommodate additional units of development beyond
          that for which it was zoned, with minimal environmental, social, and aesthetic impacts (See
          “Development Rights”).
!         Detention Dam or Basin: Dams may be classified according to the broad function they serve,
          such as storage, diversion or detention. Detention dams are constructed to retard flood
          runoff and minimize the effect of sudden floods. Detention dams fall into two main types: in
          one type, the water is temporarily stored and released through an outlet structure at a rate
          which will not exceed the carrying capacity of the channel downstream; in the other type, the
          water is held as long as possible and allowed to seep into the permeable banks of gravel strata
          in the foundation. This type is also called a “retention” dam or basin. The latter type is
          sometimes also called a water-spreading dam or dike when its main purpose is to recharge the
          underground water supply. Detention dams are also constructed to trap sediment.
!         Discourage: To advise or persuade to refrain from.
!         Diversion: The direction of water in a stream away from its natural course (i.e., as in a
          diversion that removes water from a stream for human use).
!         Dwelling Unit: A room or group of rooms (including sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation
          facilities, but not more than one kitchen) which constitutes an independent housekeeping unit,
          occupied or intended for occupancy by one family on a long-term basis.
!         Easement: Usually the right to use property owned by another for specific purposes.
          Easements are either for the benefit of land, such as the right to cross “A” to get to “B,” or
          “in gross,” such as a public utility easement. For example, “rear” lots without street frontage
          may be accessed via an easement over the “front” lots. Utility companies use easements over
          the private property of individuals to be able to install and maintain utility facilities.

          for scenic enhancement, such as roadside landscaping or vista preservation.
!         Economic Base: Economic base theory essentially holds that the structure of the economy is
          made up of two broad classes of productive effort--basic activities which produce and
          distribute goods and services for export to firms and individuals outside a defined localized
          economic area, and nonbasic activities whose goods and services are consumed within the
          boundaries of the local economic area. The theory holds that the reason for the growth of a
          particular region is its capacity to also support the nonbasic activities which are principally
          local in productive scope and market area.
!         Economic Development: The implementation of strategies to consciously and purposefully
          influence the local economy in order to provide jobs for residents, increase per capita income
          and strengthen the local tax base.

!         Entitlement: A permit or other instrument typically granted by local governments entitling the
          holder to develop or improve land and/or existing structures and facilities, consistent with the
          terms of the permit granted.
!         Environment: CEQA defines environment as “the physical conditions which exist within the
          area which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, mineral, flora,
          fauna, noise and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.”
!         Environmental Impact Report (EIR): A report that assesses all the environmental
          characteristics of an area and determines what significant effects or impacts will result if the
          area is altered or disturbed by a proposed action (See “California Environmental Quality
          Act”).
!         Erosion: The loosening and transportation of rock and soil debris by wind, rain or running
          water.

          purposes.
!         Fire Hazard: Any condition or action which increases or may cause an increase of the hazard
          or menace of fire or explosion to a degree greater than that customarily recognized as normal
          by persons in the public service of suppressing or extinguishing fires; or which may obstruct,
          delay or hinder, or may become the cause of an obstruction, delay or hindrance to the
          prevention suppression or extinguishment of the fire.
!         Fire Hazard Zone: An area where, due to slope, fuel, weather, or other fire-related conditions,
          the potential loss of life and property from a fire necessitates special fire protection measures
          and planning before development occurs.
!         Flood, 100-Year: The magnitude of a flood expected to occur on the average every 100 years,
          based on historical data. The 100-year flood has a one one-hundredth, or one percent, chance

!         Williamson Act: Known formally as the California Land Conservation Act of 1965, it was
          designed as an incentive to retain prime agricultural land and open space in agricultural use,
          thereby slowing its conversion to urban and suburban development. Landowners were
          offered reduced property tax assessments if they agreed not to develop their land for ten
          years. The lowered assessments were based on the agricultural use of their land--”use value,”
          instead of “market value.”
