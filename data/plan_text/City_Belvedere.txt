1. General Plan Elements
The Belvedere 2030 General Plan represents an update from the 1994 General Plan with new goals and
policies included in all the elements of the Plan. The policies are mainly refinements. The new chapters
and policies are briefly described below.

Housing
This required element provides an analysis of
the community’s housing needs for all income
levels, and strategies to respond to those needs.
The Housing Element identifies and analyzes
existing and projected housing needs for all
economic segments of the community, provides
goals, policies, quantified objectives and
scheduled programs to preserve, improve and
develop housing, and it identifies “adequate
sites” that are zoned and available within the
seven year housing cycle to meet the city’s fair
share of regional housing needs at all income
levels.
Parks, Recreation, and Open Space
The required Open Space Element is combined
with the optional Parks and Recreation Element
in this General Plan. The policies contained
within the Parks, Recreation, and Open Space
Element were written to meet the goals of
maintaining and improving Belvedere’s public
services, facilities, and capital improvement
projects to meet the needs of the community
and assure a high quality of life for Belvedere
residents. The element supports the continued
provision     of     neighborhood        parks and
recreational facilities to serve existing and new
residents, and coordination with the Town of
Tiburon to provide future facilities that can serve
both jurisdictions.
Sustainability and Resource Conservation
The required Conservation Element is combined
with the optional Sustainability Element in this
General Plan. This element provides a
comprehensive policy framework to guide the
City’s green efforts, and provides a foundation
upon which to build future programs and
practices through the life of the General Plan.
The Sustainability and Resource Conservation
Element contains policies intended to
coordinate multiple approaches to sustainability,
including reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
preparing for potential impacts of global climate
change, and protecting biological resources.

3. Land Use Categories
a. Residential Land Use
Belvedere is predominantly a residential
community, with well over 90 percent of its land
area either in residential use or zoned
residential. Nearly all employment needs, and
most residential service needs, are met outside
Belvedere. There are five distinct residential
areas of the community:
The Lagoon Neighborhood consists of about
275 small- to moderate-sized lots, ranging from
around 5,000 to 12,000 square feet in size.
They contain predominantly one- and two-story
homes, which were mainly built in the 1950’s
and 1960’s, with some new homes replacing
existing homes in recent years. Most of the lots
in this area front on the waters of the Belvedere
Lagoon, an artificial lagoon created by diking
portions of San Francisco Bay. Tide gates and
pumps control the flow of water between the
Lagoon and the Bay. Some of this area may be
subject to flooding during severe high intensity
storms.
Corinthian Island is a small natural island, about
half of which is within the City of Belvedere and
half within Tiburon. Lots on Corinthian Island are
in general very small, and the homes are
generally a mixture of both old and new. The
streets are very narrow and slopes are steep.
There are 55 developed parcels. There are two
undeveloped tide lots in the Corinthian Island
area which were not included in the available
land inventory of the Housing Element because
they have neither access to the roadway nor the
ability to provide off-street parking.

          Belvedere Island is the oldest historical section
          of Belvedere and contains about 510 lots. Most
          of the land was originally subdivided by the
          Belvedere Land Company during the late 1800’s
          and early 1900’s. Homes built from that time to
          the present have been constructed on lots
          ranging in size from less than 5,000 square feet
          to one acre in size. The island is characterized
          by a variety of architectural styles and sizes of
          homes, as well as by its dense, mature
          vegetation and narrow, winding streets.
          The West Shore Road area is a geographically
          distinct neighborhood situated at the western
          base of Belvedere Island. It contains
          predominantly one- and two-story homes lining
          West Shore Road, which were initially built in the
          1960’s, with some new homes replacing existing
          homes in recent years. Most of the homes are
          on the western side of the roadway, with direct
          frontage onto Richardson Bay. Many West Shore
          Road homes are built on or above leased land.
          In addition to the four main areas of single
          family housing listed above, the Lower Beach
          Road/San Rafael Avenue area has single family
          homes as well as multi-family housing. The
          neighborhood includes duplexes, apartments,
          and condominiums. There were 175 multi-family
          units in Belvedere in 2009, including 11 senior
          units.

second units and mixed-use properties was split, and the development of apartments and condominiums
was not supported. The development of new small-scale shops, restaurants, and services was supported
by nearly three-quarters of the respondents. The full survey responses are included in Volume 3 of the

Modifications to Setback Requirements
To mitigate potential fire hazards, the Tiburon
Fire Protection District has instituted Vegetation
Management Standards that emphasize the
provision of defined “defensible space”
surrounding buildings. The first 10 feet
surrounding a building would need to be entirely
free of pyrophytic (i.e. highly flammable)
landscaping in order to reduce the potential for
transfer of fire between the structure and the
adjacent vegetation, or from the adjacent
vegetation to the structure. While this is an
important safety practice, it could potentially
impact      the     lush,     park-like    vegetation
characteristic of Belvedere, as well as create
privacy impacts. This is particularly an issue on
Belvedere Island and Corinthian Island, which
are characterized by lush vegetation.

year flood level. Depending on the specific
location, this could require the first floor of a
residence to be as much as 5.78 feet above
existing grade at the lowest elevations. This
would impact allowable building sizes which
would be ‘sandwiched’ between the existing
building height limit and the floor levels required
by the flood map.
Because the ground elevation is not consistent
throughout the Lagoon area, the amount the
first floor would need to be raised above grade
would vary, so while at the lowest elevations the
height could be several feet, in other locations
the changes necessary would be relatively
minimal.

SUSTAINABILITY IN LAND USE
As noted in the Sustainability and Resource Conservation Element of the General Plan, greenhouse gas
emissions from vehicles play a big role in climate change. Vehicle emissions can be reduced by siting
land uses in a more compatible fashion. By intensifying residential densities adjacent to commercial
areas with services and closer to transportation corridors, it is easier for residents to walk to shopping or
to use alternative modes of transportation to get where they need to go. Alternative modes include
bicycling, and riding the bus or ferry.
                 Achieving sustainability in land use in Belvedere will require creative, integrated
                 approaches, considering that the largely built-out nature of the community limits the
                 potential for new development. However, in addition to the policies and actions contained
                 in the Sustainability and Resource Conservation Element of the General Plan, the Land Use
                 Element contains several policies and actions designed to support new development in and
                 adjacent to the City’s commercially-designated properties.

                            GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
The
     vision for land use in Belvedere is to “preserve the special and unique sense of place of Belvedere
while allowing changes that would enhance the community.” In order to further this mission, the following
Guiding Principles have been developed:
    |    Promote and continue sustainable land use patterns that offer a healthy balance and mix of
         land uses.
    |    Enhance community character through excellence in design standards.
    |    Ensure that development in existing neighborhoods is orderly and compatible with
         surroundings.
    |    Promote sustainable development practices that protect the natural environment and create
         quality neighborhoods.
    |    Promote a high quality of residential living through well-designed and walkable
         neighborhoods that have access to jobs, schools, shopping, transit, recreation and other
         community services.
The Land Use Element functions as a guide to the ultimate pattern of development for the city. It plays a
central role in correlating all land use issues into a set of coherent development policies, and its goals,
policies, and actions relate directly to the other elements. It has a pivotal role in zoning, subdivision, and
public works decisions, and its objectives and policies provide a long-range context for those short-term
actions.
The Goals, Policies, and Actions of the Land Use Element serve to define and implement the overall vision
and guiding principles, and to preserve the special and unique sense of place of Belvedere while allowing
changes that would enhance the community.
 
GOAL LU-1:        Ensure that development maintains the unique character of Belvedere.
Policy LU-1.1:    Building shall be permitted only on existing legal lots of record or new lots of legal size for
                  the residential zone in which they lie.
Policy LU-1.2:    Residential densities shall be controlled to preserve the character of Belvedere. The two
                  single family zones – R-15, requiring 15,000 sq. ft. of lot area per unit, and R-1, requiring
                  7,500 square feet of lot area per unit – are retained.

Policy LU-1.3: New construction is to be in harmony with existing development.
               Actions:
               LU-1.3.1: To ensure environmental quality and maintain the density and character of the
                         neighborhoods, the City shall apply design review standards in addition to
                         controls on height, bulk, floor areas, and setbacks.
               LU-1.3.2: Consider modifying R-15 development standards to increase side setbacks to
                         provide adequate area for planting beyond the 10-foot fire safety defensible
                         space zone.
Policy LU-1.4: Views from public spaces of the Bay, San Francisco, and the mountains are to be
               retained wherever possible.
               Actions:
               LU-1.4.1: The Zoning Ordinance includes provisions for the dedication of a view site or
                         easement.
Policy LU-1.5: Maintain privacy between neighbors.
               Actions:
               LU-1.5.1: Due to the close proximity of many homes in the Lagoon area, and the issues of
                         privacy which this raises, development and design standards for second story
                         building should include provisions to protect privacy of neighbors.
               LU-1.5.2: Where privacy is an issue, consider requiring increased side setbacks to
                         provide adequate area for privacy planting beyond the 10-foot fire safety
                         defensible space zone.
               LU-1.5.3: For properties in the Belvedere Lagoon area, where FEMA flood plain
                         management requirements would increase finished floor elevations by several
                         feet in some locations, consider the following zoning amendments to facilitate
                         design solutions to the challenge of meeting FEMA requirements:
                         |   Allow the height of a building to be measured from the street curb as
                             opposed to the grade of the property at the base of the house.
                         |   Allow the height of the building to be measured to the midpoint of the
                             slope of the roof instead of the highest point of the structure.
                         |   Allow the height of single-story buildings to be 18 feet instead of 15 with
                             50 percent allowable lot coverage.

Policy LU-1.6:     Development standards and design review standards shall support the vision and goals
                   of the General Plan.
                 Actions:
                 LU-1.6.1: The City should periodically review its Zoning and Design Review Ordinances to
                             determine whether revisions are warranted, and to provide the Planning
                             Commission and City Council more specific standards by which to review
                             proposed building projects.
Policy LU-1.7:     Make “housekeeping” amendments to the Municipal Code to resolve minor issues and
                   inconsistencies.
                 Actions:
                 LU-1.7.1: Revise the Subdivision Ordinance to remove the 60-day processing time unless
                             an Environmental Impact Report is required.
                 LU-1.7.2: Consider zoning amendments to clarify lot coverage requirements in the R-2
                             and R-3 zoning districts.
                 LU-1.7.3: For both conforming and nonconforming structures destroyed by fire or other
                             natural disaster, allow repair, restoration, or replacement (but not
                             enlargement) without Design Review.
Policy LU-1.8:   Create consistent development standards for waterfront maritime improvements.
                 Actions:
                 LU-1.8.1: Prepare a master plan for all shoreline properties for the installation of docks,
                             decks, boatlifts, and floats.
Policy LU-1.9:   Create a new zoning district for church and school uses to be in conformance with
                 Church/School General Plan Land Use designation.
                 Actions:
                 LU-1.9.1: Develop an “Assembly Zoning District” and create development standards for
                             the zoning district.

GOAL LU-2:     Maintain the character of Belvedere Island with refinement of development standards.
Policy LU-2.1: Belvedere Island is an identifiable geographical entity and its lots share similar
               topography, views, access and vegetation and constitute a coherent zone. It is the intent
               of the General Plan that City policies and regulations maintain Belvedere Island’s integrity
               as a single zone and accommodate the Island’s variety and distribution of lot sizes,
               shapes, and features.
Policy LU-2.2: The Belvedere Island R-15 0.33 FAR embodies an appropriate underlying standard for
               development on the Island and should not be increased.
Policy LU-2.3: The Zoning Ordinance should be modified to include specific guidelines or criteria for use
               in granting floor area exceptions.
               Actions:
               LU-2.3.1: The following considerations should be reflected in new criteria for permitting
                          floor area exceptions:
                          1) Designs that reduce grading and excavation
                          2) Maintaining natural site topography

SUSTAINABILITY IN TRANSPORTATION
As noted in the Sustainability and Resource
Conservation Element of the General Plan,
greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles play a
big role in climate change. Transportation Sector
emissions can be reduced by making it easier
for residents to use alternative modes of
transportation, including walking, bicycling, and
riding the ferry or other public transportation.
The State of California may also address
transportation emissions by increasing the fuel
efficiency standards of vehicles, and by
increasing the amount of renewable fuels (e.g.
biodiesel and ethanol) within mainstream fuel
sources.
Achieving sustainability in transportation in
Belvedere will require creative, integrated
approaches, considering that the propensity for
single-occupant       vehicles,    limited     transit
infrastructure, extreme topography, narrow right-
of-ways, and largely residential composition may
limit conventional approaches to reducing
transportation-related         greenhouse         gas
emissions.
In addition to the policies and actions contained
in the Sustainability and Resource Conservation
Element of the General Plan, the Transportation
and Circulation Element contains several
policies and actions designed to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
                City of Belvedere General Plan         Page | 73
                            GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
 The vision of the Transportation and Circulation Element, which was established early on in the General
 Plan community outreach process, is for Belvedere to have “a balanced and well integrated circulation
 system that is safe and efficient and connects neighborhoods to jobs, schools, local amenities and
 recreational areas.” In order to further this mission, the following Guiding Principles have been
 developed:
     |    Develop a strong multi-modal circulation system that provides a range of transportation choices;
     |    Promote alternatives to the automobile by providing safe streets, trails, sidewalks and bike paths;
     |    Plan for future growth at the City’s desired level of service by providing mobility and connectivity
          options to the City’s residential, commercial and office areas; and
     |    Promote accessible paths of travel.
 Goal TC-1:       Maintain the existing roadway network and encourage safety enhancements
 Policy TC-1.1:   Maintain the existing City policy to keep the present road network intact (as shown on
                  Exhibit 1, Circulation Map).
                  Actions:
                  TC-1.1.1: Maintain all roads within the existing roadway system in full service condition. If
                             roads are damaged by slides or other natural disasters, they should be
                             restored to full service as soon as it practical.
                  TC-1.1.2: Ensure that two means of ingress and egress are provided for every residence,
                             except for very short cul-de-sacs.
 Policy TC.1.2:   Improvements made to streets should focus on (1) Improving the roadway safety, (2)
                  Improving sight distance, (3) Improving pedestrian circulation and safety, and (4)
                  Improving parking conditions rather than increasing roadway capacity.
                  Actions:
                  TC-1.2.1: Conduct traffic studies as needed to address safety considerations
                  TC-1.2.2: Continue to maintain sight lines and maintain a 10-foot clearance minimum for
                             emergency vehicles. Allow parking only in certain areas, away from critical
                             sightlines; and have development projects subject to sight-line review by a
                             Public Works Engineer.
                  TC-1.2.3: Where feasible, create bicycle lanes that are directed at destination points.
                  TC-1.2.4: Install sidewalks where feasible, particularly on those streets and neighborhood
                             blocks where partial sidewalks currently exist.
 Page | 74                                  Section 3, Chapter 2: Transportation and Circulation Element

                TC-1.2.5: Investigate a range of creative traffic calming measures to control speeding
                             along San Rafael Avenue and Beach Road. Speed tables, traffic islands and
                             circles, and varied paving should all be considered, specific to location.
                TC-1.2.6: Promote “Share the Road” strategies in areas with high concentrations of
                             bicyclists. Post “share the road” signage that specifies bicyclists must ride
                             single-file and stop at stop signs, and that automobiles need to drive slowly
                             and allow ample clearance when passing bicyclists.
                TC-1.2.7: Implement "Complete Streets" policies that promote equal access by all users

                          design. Include safe and convenient bicycle and pedestrian access in all
                          transportation improvement projects, and avoid road improvements that will
                          impact the safety and convenience of walking or biking.
               TC-3.1.2: Due to the safety concerns at this intersection, work with the Town of Tiburon to
                          implement bicycle and pedestrian safety improvements at the San Rafael
                          Avenue/Tiburon Boulevard crosswalk. Improvements could include:
                          (1) Installation of Bicycle Loop Detectors (BLD) to help cyclists trip the traffic
                               signal;
                          (2) Installation of contrasting pavement texture and color to distinguish
                               between the crosswalk, bikeway, and roadway pavement;
                          (3) Provision of a raised intersection to help slow traffic;
                          (4) Installation of in-pavement lighting of crosswalk to preserve the visual
                               prominence of the crosswalk at night; or
                          (5) The installation of bollards to slow cyclists approaching the intersection.
Policy TC-3.2: Maintain availability of all public lanes and stairways in a manner consistent with other
               public streets.
               Actions:
               TC-3.2.1: Encourage pedestrian activity and reduction in auto use by further improving
                          the public lanes and stairways for safe pedestrian use. Protect and, when
                          possible, expand the locations of lanes and stairways.
               TC-3.2.2: Public lanes and stairways should be improved as part of the City’s capital
                          improvement projects and as a part of conditions of approval for development
                          applications, as appropriate. The lanes and stairways should receive regular
                          maintenance.
               TC-3.2.3: Investigate providing lighting for lanes and stairways at each end, as well as
                          pedestrian-level lighting such as bollards along lanes and stairways where
                          feasible. Lighting should be directed downwards to minimize impacts on
                          nighttime views, impacts to adjacent properties, and to preserve historical
                          character of the lanes and stairways.

fossil fuels, and foster development of local
green power generation and clean technologies.
MCE is responsible for sourcing the power and
purchases the energy supply, while PG&E

species. Although no salmonid spawning
grounds exist within the Richardson Bay or
Belvedere Cove, migrating adults and sub-adults
may utilize these waters for foraging. Sub-adults
use the protective habitat and rich food source
found within eelgrass beds for development and
growth on their way out to the open ocean.
Chinook Salmon and Steelhead Trout have been
documented to occur in the vicinity of Belvedere.
The Southern Distinct Population Segment of
North American Green Sturgeon (Acipenser
medirostris) is known to occupy coastal bays
and estuaries, including San Francisco and San
Pablo Bays. The waters within and surrounding
the Plan Area provide suitable rearing, feeding,
and migratory habitat for juvenile and adult
Green Sturgeon, though no spawning habitat
has been documented within the Plan Area or
vicinity. NMFS has proposed the designation of
Raccoon Straight and Belvedere Cove as Critical
Habitat for this population (NMFS 2008a). The
federal listing of Green Sturgeon and the
proposed designation of Critical Habitat have
occurred recently, and the LTMS work window
covering Green Sturgeon has not yet been
established.
San Francisco Bay provides breeding and
rearing habitat for Pacific herring (NOAA 2007,
CDFG 2008b). Breeding occurs between
December and March. Eggs are attached to
substrate such as eelgrass, rip rap, or other
similar material. Eelgrass within Richardson Bay
has been documented as important spawning
habitat for Pacific Herring (Watters et al. 2004).
Given the variety of biological resources present
in Belvedere, this Element contains goals,
policies, and actions designed to preserve and
enhance the animal and habitat resources for
future generations to enjoy.

                             GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
The
     community is already well on its way toward achieving the vision of the Sustainability and Resource
Conservation Element, which was established early on in the General Plan community outreach process
as “Be a leader in sustainable development and promote a culture of environmental stewardship.”
In order to further this mission, the following Guiding Principles have been developed:
    |    Conserve, enhance and protect existing natural resources and environments that contribute to
         the unique identity of Belvedere.
    |    Ensure that future growth is accommodated in a sustainable manner and does not compromise
         the City’s natural setting.
    |    Develop programs and initiatives that will distinguish the Belvedere community as a leader in
         sustainability efforts, while enhancing the comfort and quality of the built environment.
    |    Reduce Belvedere’s ecological footprint by consuming fewer natural resources, relying on locally
         produced goods and services, discouraging the use of non-renewable resources, and promoting
         environmentally friendly means to locally assimilate wastes.
    |    Protect air quality, climate and human health by actively reducing green house gas emissions
         associated with vehicular traffic, energy consumption, water usage, and construction activities.
    |    Maintain sensitivity to biological habitats with respect to shoreline development proposals.
The objective of this element is to make sustainability a central theme of Belvedere’s plan for the future.
The Goals, Policies, and Actions of the Sustainability and Resource Conservation Element serve to define
and implement the overall vision and guiding principles, allowing Belvedere to be a leader in sustainable
development and promote a culture of environmental stewardship.
Goal SUST-1:       Incorporate highest standards of green building in City facilities and encourage private
                  property owners to incorporate high standards of energy efficiency and green building.
Policy SUST-1.1: Encourage energy efficient retrofit of existing homes.
                  Actions:
                  SUST-1.1.1: Conduct water and energy audits on remodels and new houses. Energy
                                   audits required for all new or remodeled construction would both save
                                   money for property owners and improve the City’s ability to reduce its
                                   carbon footprint.
                  SUST-1.1.2: Encourage development of county-wide or regional-wide PACE financing
                                   under AB 811 for solar systems and energy-efficient furnaces and hot
                                   water heaters, and explore local, state and national incentives for
                                   installation of solar and renewable energy systems. Solar installations are
                                   an ideal way to make existing homes much more energy-efficient and
                                   provide long-term sustainability.
                City of Belvedere General Plan                                                       Page | 95

                SUST-1.1.3: Adopt an ordinance that will require the City to inform property owners of
                               needed energy upgrades at time of property sale, such as weather-
                               stripping doors and windows and stopping air leaks.
                SUST-1.1.4: Educate potential consumers of solar power systems, solar and tankless
                               hot water heaters, and energy-efficient heating ventilation and air
                               conditioning of existing incentives.
Policy SUST-1.2: Strengthen local building codes for new construction and renovation to require a higher
                level of energy efficiency. Require all new government buildings and all major renovations
                and additions to meet identified green building standards, and prioritize new public and
                private development that includes design and construction methods that minimize
                energy use and impacts on the environment.
                Actions:
                SUST-1.2.1: Require water and energy use audits as part of remodels, additions, and
                               major re-landscaping projects.
                SUST-1.2.2: Adopt a Green Building Ordinance.
                SUST-1.2.3: Provide permitting-related and other incentives for energy efficient building
                               projects.
                SUST-1.2.4: Encourage or require the highest level water saving devices to be installed
                               for remodels and new homes.
                SUST-1.2.5: Encourage new residential construction to have roofs that are strong
                               enough for a solar installation (“solar ready roof”).
Goal SUST-2:    Ensure that future City investments utilize energy and water conserving, efficient, and
                environmentally friendly technologies as much as possible.
Policy SUST-2.1: Consider new lighting technologies for street lights. Investigate the potential to convert
                existing high pressure sodium street lights to Light Emitting Diode lights to save energy
                and money.
                Actions:
                SUST-2.1.1: Monitor pilot programs in other municipalities that are installing LED lights
                               in streetlights. If successful, create a city policy to install new street lights
                               using only the most energy efficient LED lights. Over time, replace existing
                               street lights with LED technology.
Policy SUST-2.2: Limit the hours of operation of outdoor lighting.
Policy SUST-2.3: Explore the feasibility of installing solar panels at City facilities.
Page | 96                     Section 3, Chapter 4: Sustainability and Resource Conservation Element

Policy SUST-2.4: Explore the feasibility of using the energy generated by a future solar panel installation
                  at the City’s Corporation Yard to charge the City’s electric vehicles and to provide power
                  for the emergency communications equipment that is stored there.
Policy SUST-2.5: Require the use of technology such as cool roofs, cool pavements, and strategically
                  placed shade trees.
Policy SUST-2.6: Encourage cool roofs, green roofs, and use of cool paving for pathways, parking and
                  other roadway surfaces.
Policy SUST-2.7: Ensure new City vehicles are low or zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and the most fuel
                  efficient models possible, including construction vehicles.
Policy SUST-2.8: Give preference to government contractors that take action to minimize greenhouse gas
                  emissions.
Goal SUST-3:     Support renewable energy.
Policy SUST-3.1: Support efforts of the Marin Energy Authority to increase the proportion of renewable
                  power offered to residents and businesses.
Policy SUST-3.2: Provide information on available funding alternatives for renewable energy projects,
                  rates of return and other information to support community members interested in
                  pursuing renewable energy projects.
Policy SUST-3.3: Increase installation of solar facilities for power needs and provision of clean energy.
Policy SUST-3.4: Pursue partnerships with other governmental entities and private companies and utilities
                  to establish incentive programs for renewable energy.

Goal SUST-4:    Reduce greenhouse gas emissions from all activities within the City boundaries to support
                the State’s efforts and to mitigate the impact of climate change and sea level rise.
Policy SUST-4.1: Nurture a public dialogue on local sustainability efforts and policies and plan to reduce
                greenhouse gas emissions from four main areas: vehicular traffic, water usage, energy
                consumption, and construction activities. Develop measurable steps, track the efforts,
                and establish a means for assessing their effectiveness.
                Actions:
                SUST-4.1.1: Develop well-researched protocols and systems for measuring and
                                monitoring general sustainability efforts so that progress can be recorded
                                and celebrated, and to create a base of support for progress and

SUSTAINABILITY IN PARKS, RECREATION, and OPEN SPACE
As noted in the Sustainability and Resource Conservation Element of the General Plan, greenhouse gas
emissions from vehicles play a big role in climate change. Having adequate public spaces for use by the
community means that people will not have to drive far (or at all) to access recreational opportunities.
Belvedere has a unique setting that encourages outdoor activities and active recreation.
                In addition to the policies and actions contained in the Sustainability and Resource
                Conservation Element of the General Plan, the Parks, Recreation, and Open Space
                Element supports the maintenance and enhancement of the City’s public facilities,
                supports retaining the City’s natural landscapes (which provide carbon sequestration
                benefits), and promotes the City’s lanes and stairways, which can help facilitate
                pedestrian trips in lieu of vehicle travel.

                             GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
 
The   community envisions that “Belvedere should be a community with outstanding and unique public
facilities, recreational opportunities and open space features.” In order to further this mission, the
following Guiding Principles have been developed:
     |    Maintain and improve public services, facilities and capital improvement projects to meet the
          needs of the community and assure a high quality of life for Belvedere residents.
     |    Provide neighborhood parks and recreational facilities to serve existing and new residents.
     |    Plan for necessary infrastructure to support appropriate economic activity in Belvedere.
The following goals have been developed for the Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Element:
GOAL REC-1:        Support ongoing efforts to maintain Belvedere’s public parks and open spaces. Belvedere’s
                   existing public spaces, including Community Park, Tom Price Park, Centennial Park,
                   Belvedere Cove, Land Company Park, and the community’s many lanes and paths, are
                   appreciated and well-utilized by the community.
Policy REC-1.1: The City shall not sell or release its interest in any lane.
Policy REC-1.2: Support the ongoing maintenance of Belvedere’s historic lanes and steps.
                   Actions:
                   REC-1.2.1: Facilitate improvements to lanes that have fallen into disrepair or are no
                                 longer open. Consider the installation of low-impact lighting on some lanes to
                                 encourage their use and also to provide safer access down Belvedere Island
                                 in the event of necessary evacuation.
Policy REC-1.3: Maintain existing public access to the shoreline. Existing access is satisfactory and
                   should not be diminished. Existing access consists of the pathway along San Rafael
                   Avenue, sidewalk along Beach Road, open shoreline on tide lots in Belvedere Cove, and
                   the steps of the Harry B. Allen Lane to Belvedere Cove.
Policy REC-1.4: Maintain views from Belvedere’s scenic streets, especially San Rafael Avenue and Beach
                   Road.
Policy REC-1.5: Consider the designation of publicly-owned tide lots and open waters surrounding
                   Belvedere to “O – Open Space Zoning District” to protect these areas from further
                   development.

GOAL REC-2:     Improve public services and facilities and consider capital improvement projects to meet the
                needs of the community and assure a high quality of life for Belvedere residents.
Policy REC-2.1: Open space can be secured through a variety of means, including purchase, dedication of
                land, transfer of development rights, view easements, or view corridors. Any of these
                methods should be considered as appropriate.
Policy REC-2.2: The acquisition of new lanes should be considered by the City and the rehabilitation of
                existing lanes that currently are not passable should also be considered.
                Actions:
                REC-2.2.1: Consider the potential to open new lanes along utility easements or in other
                             areas where there is available land.
Policy REC-2.3: Establish procedures and guidelines for improvement of City roads, retaining walls,
                fences, sidewalks, landscaping, lighting and pavement.
Policy REC-2.4: Consider enhancements and the addition of facilities to Tom Price Park.
Policy REC-2.5: Continue to control private use of public property.
                Actions:
                REC-2.5.1: Control encroachment into public open waters.
                REC-2.5.2: Control encroachment of private facilities into public property (through
                               Revocable License Agreements) to encourage the provision of off-street
                               parking, pedestrian walkways, landscape plantings, and other public
                               benefits.
Page | 116                          Section 3, Chapter 5: Parks, Recreation and Open Space Element
GOAL REC-3:     Collaborate with the Town of Tiburon in creating new recreational facilities, expanding
                recreational programming opportunities, and preserving open space areas that can serve
                both communities
Policy REC-3.1: Coordinate with the Town of Tiburon on long-range planning for public spaces and the
                development of new facilities.
                Actions:
                REC-3.1.1: Support the creation of a Joint Recreation and Open Space Master Plan with
                                the Town of Tiburon.
                REC-3.1.2: Consider the development of additional facilities, such as a senior center,
                                teen recreation center, or other public facilities that could be located on
                                available land in Tiburon, but would serve the combined population of
                                Belvedere and Tiburon.
                REC-3.1.3: Coordinate with the Belvedere-Tiburon Joint Recreation Department to provide
                                space for existing recreation programs.
                REC-3.1.4: Explore opportunities for partnerships with other organizations to create more
                                indoor meeting/gathering spaces and a variety of activities.
Policy REC-3.2: Continue to coordinate with the Town of Tiburon in preserving open space in Tiburon that
                has a major visual impact on the scenic views of the residents of Belvedere. Efforts
                should be made to work with other neighboring communities in their efforts to preserve
                open space areas that are visible from Belvedere.
Policy REC-3.3: Support the continued operation of the Belvedere-Tiburon Library at its current location.

Belvedere’s Arks
Starting in the 1880’s, what is now known as
Belvedere Cove, was dubbed “Arktown” or “Ark
Cove” for the many houseboats that were
floated there during the warmer months. The
origin of the term ark is not known but it was
coined to describe the “California houseboat”,
which had a different shape than a typical East
Coast houseboat. The Arktown was an extension
of the Peninsula’s land dwelling community, as
local businesses made the rounds by boat each
morning to take orders for ordinary goods, such
as meat and bread, to be delivered later in the
day just as they would for homes on land.              “Arks along the Lagoon,” by Seldon Giles

1. Historic Resource Preservation
Belvedere’s history has had many periods of
significance, including the incorporation of the
City, the prosperity and social reforms of the turn
of the 20th century, and post World War II
growth. The time period of incorporation was
marked by the establishment of a City Council,
public services, school and churches,
commercial services and other necessities of
civic life. This period saw the resort community
of Belvedere develop into a self-sufficient
suburban-rural village. Somewhat concurrent
with incorporation, Belvedere experienced the
prosperity of the Gilded Age, the social reforms                    “Cows in Pasture near San Rafael” by William Keith
of the City Beautiful Movement, and the
appreciation of natural resources that lead to
the establishment of Yosemite National Park.
The patronage of Belvedere residents during
these times led to the development of distinctive
arts and architecture in the City. Examples
include the architecture of the Blanding Estate,
fanciful summer houses, decorative arts such as
tile mosaics and stained glass, and, later, the
paintings of William Keith, Seldon Giles and “The
Society of Six” artists.

                           GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
 
As an overarching objective, the City shall “Preserve the identity of Belvedere as a unique community on
the Tiburon Peninsula with a valuable inventory of historically, archaeologically, and culturally significant
resources.” Belvedere is a community with outstanding community resources.
In order to ensure the continued existence of those resources, the following goals, policies, and actions
were developed:
Goal Pres-1:     Demonstrate an appreciation of the historic and cultural landmarks that remind residents
                 and visitors of Belvedere’s unique culture and history through activities, materials and
                 procedures that recognize valuable historic resources and plan for their preservation.
Policy Pres-1.1. Promote awareness of historic resources in Belvedere and their exceptional style, design,
                 materials, craftsmanship, integrity, and rarity.
                 Actions:
                 Pres-1.1.1: Support the development of educational materials that highlight Belvedere’s
                                 history through its buildings and neighborhood context.
                 Pres-1.1.2: Provide known historical information about residences at time of resale
                                 through Residential Building Reports.
Policy Pres-1.2. Encourage owners of historic properties to pursue local, state or national designation of
                 their properties as historic resources. Promote the benefits of historic designation such
                 as the Mills Act tax credit, the use of alternate building codes for rehabilitation, and the
                 potential for zoning exceptions as noted in the policy above. Where feasible, mitigate the
                 costs associated to property owners with preservation of historic resources.
Policy Pres-1.3. Promote awareness of prehistoric resources in Belvedere. Support the development of
                 educational materials that highlight Belvedere’s history prior to urbanization. Provide
                 information about known prehistoric resources (both archaeological and FIGR cultural
                 resources) on properties at time of resale through Residential Building Reports.

Goal Pres-2:      Encourage development patterns and architecture in keeping with the City’s past by
                  preserving and enhancing buildings of special historic and/or architectural interest.
Policy Pres-2.1. Create and maintain tools to alert residents and City Staff of the potential existence of
                  historic resources, including a Historic Resource Sensitivity Map. This will ensure that
                  future development applications are reviewed for potential impacts to potential historic
                  resources.
                  Actions:
                  Pres 2.1.1: Maintain an up-to-date list of Buildings with Historic Designation in Belvedere
                                 (Belvedere Historic Resources Inventory).
                  Pres-2.1.2: Maintain an up-to-date Directory of Historic Properties from the State Office of
                                 Historic Preservation (State Historic Resources Inventory).
                  Pres-2.1.3: Maintain an up-to-date Historic Resource Sensitivity Map. Utilize the map to
                                 educate the community about existing and potential historic resources and
                                 to determine which properties should be examined for their potential to be
                                 eligible for listing on either the local or state Historic Resource Inventories
                                 when a development application is received on the parcel.
                                  |    High sensitivity parcels: Require that a formal historic resource
                                       assessment be completed to determine if the resource is eligible for
                                       listing. (DPR form 523A and B to be completed by an Architectural
                                       Historian)
                                  |    Medium sensitivity parcels: Require that an informal assessment be
                                       completed to determine if the resource appears to be eligible for
                                       listing. Informal assessment could include information gathered from
                                       property owner, City or County records, Landmarks Society, State Office
                                       of Historic Preservation, etc.
Policy Pres-2.2. Consider zoning variances and exceptions for properties on the Historic Resources
                  Inventory that can encourage the continued use (and appropriate expansion) of a historic
                  structure that may not meet the current zoning code standards in terms of required
                  setbacks, building height, etc.
Policy Pres-2.3. Develop standard mitigation measures that, when followed, can reduce the impacts to
                  historic resources to a less-than-significant level.

Goal Pres-3:     Demonstrate sensitivity to Belvedere’s prehistoric past by establishing formal procedures
                 for minimizing and mitigating impacts to archaeologically and culturally significant
                 resources.
Policy Pres-3.1. Continue to protect cultural, archaeological, and paleontological resources.

The vision for community design in Belvedere is
to “maintain the unique small-town character
and identity of Belvedere as a thriving
community in an unparalleled scenic setting.”
The purpose of the Community Design Element
is to provide additional direction, beyond that of
the land use element, to the planning area’s
development pattern, form, structure, and sense
of place. The community design element may
provide the basis for aesthetic regulation of
public and private land and structures. The
element consists of the following sections:

Corinthian Island is a small natural island,
about half of which is within the City of
Belvedere and half within Tiburon. Homes are
generally a mixture of old and new. The streets
are very narrow and slopes are very steep.
Corinthian Island homes overlook either
Belvedere Cove or historic Tiburon, and all have
a partial to full view of San Francisco Bay.
Homes are grouped close to each other, and the
steep topography gives a sense of a “hill town.”
Vegetation is less dense on Corinthian Island as
compared to Belvedere Island. Larger lots near

The Lagoon Area consists of small- to
moderate- sized lots with one and two-story
homes built in the 1950’s and 1960’s, with
numerous renovations and replacements since.
Most of the lots in this area front on the waters
of the Belvedere Lagoon. Homes tend to be
oriented to the Lagoon along the rear of the lot
rather than the street. Many front yards are
screened behind privacy fences, while rear yards
can be quite open and exposed.

ISSUES
1. Hillside Design Issues
Large portions of Belvedere have hilly terrain.
Developments in hillside areas have unique
design and engineering considerations such as                   NO
grading, drainage, and building design. Issues
include        both       safety     and      aesthetic
considerations.
Hillside development and grading standards
could be part of more general design guidelines
for residential development in Belvedere to
support the City’s Design Review Ordinance.
Design guidelines should address siting of                      YES
homes on hillsides, effective and efficient
grading practices, strategies for minimizing the
appearance of bulk, preservation of key
landscape features, and “good neighbor” design
strategies.                                              FIGURE CD-1: Hillside development should step
                                                         down with the slope with harmonious massing and
                                                         roof forms.
2. Lagoon Area Issues
Due to the close proximity of many homes in the
Lagoon area, and the issues of privacy which
this raises, there has been much consideration
given in the past to determining the design
                                                                                            NO
approach to second stories. Second stories are
required to be recessed.
More recently there has been a focus on
lighting, which is intensified by the presence of
the water. As light from outdoor fixtures and
brightly-lit interiors of homes is reflected on the
water, the effect on neighbors is a doubling of
light impacts. In recent years, new lighting                                                 YES
technologies have become available that allow

schemes. Given the continual advances in
lighting technology, together with the close
proximity of the homes and their orientation to
one other across the Lagoon, there is a need to
refine lighting policies and standards for the          FIGURE CD-2: Following contours with horizontal
Lagoon area.                                            elements can increase the integration of the

A new policy to strongly discourage sources of
light that create glare near the water would aid
in reducing impacts from light pollution for the
residents living closer to the water, and retain
the natural habitat for wildlife in the Lagoon.
Light pollution on the water includes both
outdoor lighting as well as light shining through
doors and windows from the inside of a home.
3. Colors and Materials
The City allows approval of new colors and
materials for new and existing structures to be
made, at the staff level. Exterior colors and
materials can be extremely controversial and
create neighborhood discord. As a result, staff
level approvals have been conservative. Colors
preferred by an applicant that are outside of the
authority of City staff remain solely within the
purview of the Planning Commission. Any
decision made by staff can be appealed to the
Planning Commission either by the applicant or
another interested party.
The Design Review Ordinance provides general
guidance for selecting colors and materials that
are appropriate for the building setting and
compatible with those of other buildings in the
vicinity. Additional guidelines could be
developed to provide direction for colors and
materials that are compatible with the
character-defining elements of Belvedere
neighborhoods.

                                                             and retaining walls.

4. Rights-of-Way Design Issues
Given that permits are required for
improvements involving the public right-of-way, it
would be desirable for any improvements to
enhance the character of Belvedere. Design
guidelines for rights-of-way could incorporate all
aspects of the streetscape, such as sidewalks,
retaining walls, paving, lights, planters, and
parking     areas,      so    that    improvements
contributed to the character and aesthetics of
the community.
Guidelines that are more descriptive of such
elements as scale, materials, and design
character could, over time, reinforce aspects of
the roadways and streetscapes that are
considered favorable, and prevent changes that
might detract. Low stone walls, natural
materials, fences with landscaping, hedges,
native trees, and vines have been identified as
being consistent with Belvedere’s character.
Belvedere also has large areas of public right-of-
way that have not and likely will not be improved
by the City due to the combination of steep
hillside lots and narrow streets. Residents
historically have been allowed to build parking
areas, paths, driveways, and other private
improvements in these areas. The City requires
a revocable license for such encroachments and     Improvements along the public rights-of-way are
                                                   important contributions to community design and
grants a revocable license to allow the
                                                   character.
improvements.
Design guidelines would be intended to
reinforce the character and aesthetics of the
community over time. Guidelines would apply to
permitted private encroachments into the right-
of-way, as well as new development projects
bordering public rights-of-way. Guidelines would
also apply to City projects such as retaining
walls, guard rails, street lights, utilities, and
other infrastructure projects.

SUSTAINABILITY IN COMMUNITY DESIGN
The orientation and design of new homes is an
important factor in determining the amount of
energy that will be needed to construct and
operate the structure.
A building’s orientation and the landscaping
surrounding the building can increase its energy
efficiency and minimize energy consumption.
Encouraging drought tolerant landscaping and
requiring water conserving irrigation will save
water. Minimizing site disturbance, minimizing
the amount of impervious surface, and
maintaining natural landforms, can all help
maximize water recharge and minimize water
runoff.
In addition to the policies and actions contained
in the Sustainability and Resource Conservation
Element of the General Plan, the Community
Design Element contains several policies and
actions    designed        to    encourage    water
conservation, enhance energy efficiency, and
improve water quality.

                          GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
The
     vision for land use in Belvedere is to “maintain the unique small-town character and identity of
Belvedere as a thriving community in an unparalleled scenic setting.” In order to further this mission, the
following Guiding Principles have been developed:
     |   Build and maintain a visually harmonious community.
     |   Preserve and enhance the beauty of the City's natural and manmade environment.
     |   Encourage the maintenance of a scale and character of individual buildings consistent with the
         overall scale and character of the community.
     |   Discourage development of individual buildings which will dominate the Cityscape or attract
         attention to themselves through color, mass, or incongruent architectural expression.
     |   Ensure that new development, and/or the alteration or enlargement of existing development,
         occurs in a manner which maintains the attractiveness and character of the City, especially when
         the project is viewed from the City's streets, lanes, paths, and from nearby properties,
         neighboring communities and the water.
     |   Maintain and improve the quality of, and relationship between, individual buildings, and between
         structures and their sites, so that they contribute to the attractiveness of the neighborhood and
         the community.
     |   Ensure that landscaping provides visually pleasing settings for structures on the site, and that the
         proposed landscaping blends harmoniously with the natural landscape, is appropriate to the
         design and function of the structures, and serves to soften or screen the structures when viewed
         from off-site.
     |   Encourage the highest quality of architectural design, the use of natural materials, and emphasis
         on construction methods which are least disruptive to the site and community.
     |   Balance private prerogatives and preferences with the public interest and welfare.
     |   Be a “good neighbor” by being sensitive to the privacy and scenic views of neighbors.
The goals, policies and actions of the Community Design Element provide specific guidance to enhance
the sense of place and quality of life in Belvedere. It brings together the principles of the other elements
into an overall set of qualitative policies. It may be used to establish principles to guide the form and
appearance of neighborhoods, streets, parks, public facilities, new development, and redevelopment.

GOAL CD-1:        Preserve the character of existing site conditions.
Policy CD-1.1:   The landscape and topography shall be preserved in a naturalistic state to the greatest
                 extent feasible and reasonable.
                 Actions:
                 CD-1.1.1: The removal of trees, vegetation, rock, and soil should be kept to a minimum.
                 CD-1.1.2: Projects should be designed to minimize cut and fill areas, and grade changes
                             should be minimized and kept in harmony with the general appearance of the
                             neighboring landscape.
                 CD-1.1.3: All disturbed areas should be finished to a natural appearing configuration and
                             planted or seeded to prevent erosion.
                 CD-1.1.4: Paved areas should be minimized to the extent feasible and reasonable and
                             permeable paving should be utilized when possible.
                 CD-1.1.5: Consider controls on the areas of a property that may be covered with
                             impermeable materials.
GOAL CD-2:       Establish a harmonious relationship between structures and the site.
Policy CD-2.1:   There should be a balanced and harmonious relationship among the structures on the
                 site, between the structures and the site itself, and between the structures and those on
                 adjoining properties.
                 Actions:
                 CD-2.2.1: All new buildings or additions constructed on sloping land should be designed
                             to relate to the natural land forms and step with the slope in order to minimize
                             the building mass and bulk and to integrate the structure with the site.
                 CD-2.2.2: The design of residences and landscapes that relate to the particular
                             geography, history, climate, and culture of Belvedere is encouraged. Strict
                             reproduction of exotic styles or of an existing house is discouraged.
                 CD-2.2.3: The siting of new construction and additions on a parcel should reflect the
                             character of the setbacks and landscape buffers on adjoining properties.

GOAL CD-3:     Ensure compatibility with neighborhood scale and proportion.
Policy CD-3.1: All buildings should be designed to relate to and fit in with others in the neighborhood
               and not designed to attract attention to themselves.
               Actions:
               CD-3.1.1: All new structures and additions should be designed to avoid monumental or
                            excessively-large dwellings which are out of character with their setting or with
                            other dwellings in the neighborhood.
               CD-3.1.2: To avoid monotony or an impression of bulk, large expanses of any one
                            material on a single plane should be avoided, and large single plane retaining
                            walls should be avoided. Vertical and horizontal elements should be used to
                            add architectural variety, to break up building planes, and to avoid monotony.
               CD-3.1.3: Consider design elements and qualities that contribute to harmonious
                            architecture.
               CD-3.1.4: All new structures and additions should be sensitive to the scale and
                            proportion of key architectural elements of nearby residences, such as roof
                            edges, windows, doors, cornices, eaves, floor levels, wall plates, buildings
                            walls, and entries.
GOAL CD-4:     Encourage materials and colors that reinforce community character.
Policy CD-4.1: Building designs should incorporate materials and colors that minimize the structures’
               visual impact, that blend with the existing land form and vegetative cover, that relate to
               and fit in with structures in the neighborhood, and that do not attract attention to the
               structures themselves.
               Actions:
               CD-4.1.1: Materials that blend easily with the landscape, such as natural wood shingles
                          and siding, are preferred.
               CD-4.1.2: Other materials, such as metals that develop an attractive, naturally-oxidized
                          finish, used brick, stone, stucco, and concrete should be used in moderation.
                          Use of concrete block, manufactured stone or brick, unpainted metal,
                          galvanized metal or metal subject to ordinary rusting is discouraged. Brushed
                          stainless steel metal is allowed in moderation.
               CD-4.1.3: Soft and muted colors in the earth tone and wood tone range are preferred and
                          generally should predominate. Other colors and materials shall be acceptable
                          only if the Planning Commission determines that they are appropriate for the
                          building setting, and are compatible with those of other buildings in the vicinity.
               CD-4.1.4: Trim and window colors should be compatible with and congruous with the
                          other building colors.
Page | 146                                         Section 3, Chapter 7: Community Design Element

                 CD-4.1.5: All roof materials and colors (including equipment, but excluding skylights)
                             should have non-glossy, earth tone or wood tone finishes that minimize glare
                             and are compatible with their environment and surroundings. All exposed
                             metals, such as roof vents, chimneys and spark arrestors, should be painted
                             flat black or painted a color that minimizes their visibility, or should be of
                             natural copper or bronze-finished aluminum.
                 CD-4.1.6: Retaining walls should be wood, stone, or concrete. Concrete walls and other
                             concrete surfaces should be textured, colored to match adjacent soil or plant
                             color, or faced with stone.
                 CD-4.1.7: New retaining walls and additions to existing retaining walls should be
                             consistent with those on nearby properties or consistent with typical Belvedere
                             serpentine stone walls.
GOAL CD-5:       Ensure fences and screenings are consistent with community character.
Policy CD-5.1:   Fences should be functional while being integrated with the overall setting and
                 compatible with the scale of the home and neighborhood
                 Actions:
                 CD-5.1.1: Fences and physical screening should be located so as to be compatible with
                             the design of the site and structures as a whole.
                 CD-5.1.2: Fences should conceal and screen garbage areas, mechanical equipment, and
                             structural elements from public view.
                 CD-5.1.3: Fences should preserve privacy between adjoining dwellings, where practical.
                 CD-5.1.4: Fences should be designed and located so that they are architecturally
                             compatible with the design of the building, are aesthetically attractive, and do
                             not significantly block views.
                 CD-5.1.5: Exposed wire or chain link fences are discouraged, except as temporary
                             barriers on construction sites.
                 CD-5.1.6: Design of fencing and screening should adhere to the general provisions of
                             bulk and mass that apply to buildings. Scale should be consistent with the

GOAL CD-10:     Promote landscaping that reinforces Belvedere’s park-like setting.
Policy CD-10.1: Landscape plans should be compatible with the character of the site and surrounding
                developed properties.
                Actions:
                CD-10.1.1: Native or natural-appearing vegetation, with generally rounded, natural forms,
                            should be placed to appear as loose, informal clusters.
                CD-10.1.2: Landscape plans shall include appropriate planting to soften or screen the
                            appearance of structures as seen from off-site locations and shall include
                            appropriate screening for architectural elements, such as building
                            foundations, deck supports and retaining walls, that cannot be mitigated
                            through architectural design.
                CD-10.1.3: Landscape plans should provide privacy between properties. Choice of
                            landscape materials should take into consideration the future impact that
                            new planting may have in significantly obstructing views from nearby
                            dwellings.
                CD-10.1.4: Landscape plans shall include appropriate planting to repair, reseed and/or
                            replant disturbed areas to prevent erosion.
Policy CD-10.2: Landscape materials should maintain the character of the neighborhood and be
                appropriate for the neighborhood climate.
                Actions:
                CD-10.2.1: Plant materials that are drought-tolerant, and preferably native to northern
                            California and Marin County, are encouraged.
                CD-10.2.2: Plant materials and plans should be suitable for the neighborhood
                            microclimate.
                CD-10.2.3: Evergreen species are encouraged for use in screen planting situations.
                            Because of high water usage, turf areas should be minimized and narrow turf
                            areas, such as in parking strips, should be avoided.
                CD-10.2.4: Landscape plans should include a mix of fast- and slow-growing plant
                            materials. Fast-growing trees that have a short life span should be used only
                            when planted with others which reach maturity at a later age.
                CD-10.2.5: Landscape plans should include water-conserving irrigation systems. While
                            irrigation will probably be required initially in order to establish the new
                            plants, the plant material should be selected so that once established, much
                            of the major site landscaping will survive solely on rainfall.
                CD-10.2.6: In creating landscape plans, designers should be versed in the requirements
                            to provide buffer areas of fire-resistant plantings surrounding buildings,
                            consistent with Tiburon Fire Protection District Standards.

The Belvedere Lagoon neighborhood is the most
extensively graded area within the City limits.
The elevated areas that now support the streets
and residential lots in the lagoon neighborhood
was created in the mid-to late 1940’s by
construction of dikes at Beach Road and San
Rafael Avenue and draining of the original
interior lagoon. Native soils were excavated from
the existing lagoon areas, and placed as fills to
form elevated streets and building pads. Thick
deposits of potentially compressible marine
clays, silts and loose sand remain below the

caused by loss of shear strength in soft silts

lurching can result in permanent displacement
and tilting of the ground and ground cracking.

  SUSTAINABILITY and ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS
  With climate change impacts expected to occur in the future, adaptation to changes in safety hazards,
  such as potential increase in drier vegetation and accompanying fire hazards or coastal flooding from
  sea level rise become increasingly important.
  This Element discusses the need to limit new construction in floodplains, consider sea walls along the
  Richardson Bay, and the need to take steps to minimize the potential for fire.
  In addition to the policies and actions contained in the Sustainability and Resource Conservation
  Element of the General Plan, the Environmental Hazards: Safety and Stability Element contains goals,
  policies, and actions to respond to the potential impacts of climate change.

                            GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
The
     community envisions that “Belvedere should be maintained as a safe place to live and work and the
City should create a high level of awareness of the unique hazards faced by the Belvedere residents.” In
order to further this mission, the following Guiding Principles have been developed:
     |   Promote safe neighborhoods by adopting sound development practices and environmental
         design standards.
     |   Strengthen and promote the City’s resources for improved security, safety and City’s emergency
         response capabilities.
     |   Minimize the impacts of natural and manmade disasters through sound planning practices and
         community outreach methods.
The following goals, policies, and actions serve to guide the development of Belvedere in a healthy and
balanced environment:
GOAL HAZ-1:       Strive to protect the community from injury and damage resulting from natural
                  catastrophes and other hazard conditions.
Policy HAZ-1.1: Construction shall be located and designed to avoid or minimize the hazards from
                  earthquake, erosion, landslides, floods, and fire.
                  Actions:
                  HAZ-1.1.1: Institutionalize the Environmental Hazards policies through review for possible
                                amendment of the grading, subdivision, zoning, building code, design review,
                                and other sections of the Belvedere Municipal Code. Particular attention
                                should be paid to the adequacy of building setbacks with respect to fire
                                safety concerns.
                  HAZ-1.1.2: All new construction in the City shall ensure that it follows current seismic
                                codes as set forth by the California Building Code (CBC).
                  HAZ-1.1.3: City staff review of existing structures undergoing renovations shall consider
                                seismic retrofits such as attachment of walls to foundations and roofs,
                                adding structural bracing and shear walls, and addition of shutoff systems
                                for electrical, water, and gas connections. These can be undertaken in order
                                to improve the performance and safety of these structures.
                  HAZ-1.1.4: New construction must not compromise public infrastructure which is key to
                                emergency access, egress, and flood prevention.

Policy HAZ-1.2: Require thorough field investigation of geologic hazards as a prerequisite to Design
                Review and construction approval and require site stabilization to minimize such risks.
                Actions:
                HAZ-1.2.1: Consult the hazard zones maps in the preparation of Initial Studies required
                            by the California Environmental Quality Act.
                HAZ -1.2.2: Address hazards in the preparation of declarations and Environmental
                            Impact Reports required by the California Environmental Quality Act.
                HAZ-1.2.3: Investigate potential landslide hazards associated with specific project
                            locations as part of Design Review for project applications.
Policy HAZ-1.3: Maintain adequate roadway clearances for emergency vehicles and evacuation and plan
                for safe pedestrian evacuation.
                Actions:
                HAZ-1.3.1: To assure emergency and public service vehicular access in places where 10
                            foot road width is critical, parked vehicles that violate those limits shall be
                            cited.
                HAZ-1.3.2: Belvedere’s Evacuation Map should be kept up to date with evacuation routes
                            for vehicles and pedestrians. Belvedere residents with special evacuation
                            needs should be inventoried and plans should be developed for them.
Policy HAZ-1.4: Ensure that the City is equipped for disaster, evacuation, and survival thereafter.
                Actions:
                HAZ-1.4.1: Develop detailed plans for community-wide disaster preparedness and
                            evacuation plans. Plans should focus on developing self sufficiency for a
                            minimum of 120 hours, exceeding FEMA guidelines of 72 hours due to the
                            City’s geographically isolated location.
                HAZ-1.4.2: Ensure that risk to public lifeline utilities, such as those along Beach Road
                            and San Rafael Avenue, be reduced by installing excess flow valves,
                            bracing, flexible materials, flexible joints and connections, joint restraint,
                            strengthening of support structures, or other means.
                HAZ-1.4.3: Ensure that lifeline utilities at risk of damage due to liquefaction be
                            designed for easy access and repair, and consideration should be given to
                            providing pre-designed replacement/repair fittings to allow rapid bridging of
                            breaks at crucial locations where damage is anticipated.
                HAZ-1.4.4: Periodically review and update the City evacuation plan and evacuation
                            map.

                 Actions:
                 HAZ 2.1.1: Discourage new critical facilities from being located in floodplains.
Policy HAZ-2.2: Any proposed new development along the shoreline and in the Belvedere Lagoon
                 area should be evaluated for its potential for adverse impacts from tsunamis and
                 sea level rise.
                 Actions:
                 HAZ-2.2.1: For areas identified as potential locations for adverse impacts from
                               tsunamis, mitigation measures should be identified such as the
                               utilization of early warning systems, as well as specific project design
                               options.
Policy HAZ-2.3: Maintain a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan (LHMP).
                 Actions:
                 HAZ-2.3.1: Update the LHMP every five years; the last was adopted in 2005.
                 HAZ-2.3.2: Coordinate with other cities in the document update through ABAG.
Policy HAZ-2.4: Incorporate FEMA guidelines and suggested activities into local government plans and
                 procedures for managing flood hazards.

                Actions:
                HAZ-3.1.1: Facilitate the efforts of the California Geological Survey to study the City to
                             locate hazardous zones.
Policy HAZ-3.2: In the areas identified as subject to ground-shaking, the development of structures for
                human habitation, including residential and commercial uses, shall incorporate
                engineering measures to mitigate against risk to life safety, at a minimum to the extent
                provided by the current California Building Code adopted by the City of Belvedere.
Policy HAZ-3.3: Comply with and enforce the State-mandated requirement that site-specific geologic or
                geotechnical reports be prepared for development proposals in areas subject to
                earthquake-induced landslides and in areas subject to liquefaction as mandated by the
                State Seismic Hazard Mapping Act.
                Actions:
                HAZ-3.3.1: Applications for developments or additions proposed to be sited on landslide
                             deposits, non-engineered fill, or bay mud shall be accompanied by a
                             geotechnical engineering investigation satisfactory to the Belvedere City
                             Engineer directed to the problem of ground shaking and ground failure. The
                             engineering geologist and civil engineer shall submit recommendations
                             regarding site development, structural engineering, and drainage.

                             measures related to site remediation, structure and foundation design,
                             and/or avoidance.
Policy HAZ-3.4: Known landslides and landslide-prone deposits on steep slopes (50% grade or more)
                should not be used for development except where engineering and geologic site
                investigations indicate such sites are stable or can be made stable providing appropriate
                mitigating measures are taken. In such cases, it must be shown to the satisfaction of the
                City that the risk to persons or property or public liability can be minimized to a degree
                acceptable to the City.
                Actions:
                HAZ-3.4.1: In projects where engineering and geologic site investigation evaluations
                             indicate that state-of-the-art measures can correct instability, the City should
                             require that the foundation and earth work be supervised and certified by a
                             geotechnical engineer, and, where deemed necessary, by an engineering
                             geologist.

                               qualified geotechnical professional. Residents shall be encouraged to
                               maintain surface drainage systems and avoid accidental ponding of storm
                               water on their properties.
Policy HAZ-3.5: Filled land that is underlain by compressible materials (bay mud, marsh, slough) should
                receive special attention during site planning.
                Actions:
                HAZ-3.5.1: Soils investigations should include borings and sufficient examination to
                               determine the location of former sloughs and other factors that would
                               accentuate differential settlement. The investigation should delineate those
                               areas where settlement will likely be greatest, subsidence will occur, etc.,
                               and should recommend the site preparation techniques that could be
                               employed to preclude hazard.
                HAZ 3.5.2: Any new construction in Bay margin areas shall carefully consider the
                               potential effects of settlement both on the project and on adjacent properties.

                HAZ 3.5.3: All new construction in Bay margin areas shall be designed with the guidance
                               of a qualified geotechnical engineer in accordance with the applicable CBC.
Policy HAZ-3.6: Potential for damage by erosion shall be minimized through preventative measures.
                Actions:
                HAZ-3.6.1: Proposed new construction projects should comply with applicable City,
                               Regional, and Federal storm water control regulations so as to reduce
                               erosion impacts.
                HAZ-3.6.2: Surface drainage facilities and vegetative cover on areas of exposed soil shall
                               be maintained appropriately in order to avoid blockage of inlets or uncontrolled
                               discharge to slopes.
                HAZ-3.6.3: Establish and enforce provisions under storm water management and
                               discharge control ordinances designed or to be designed to control erosion
                               and sedimentation.
Policy HAZ-3.7: Work with the ABAG to improve the risk assessment information being compiled.
                Actions:
                HAZ-3.7.1: Work with ABAG to develop specific information on the level of damage that
                               would result from environmental hazards on buildings, infrastructure, and
                               critical facilities.

GOAL HAZ-4:     Ensure protection of life and property from fire hazards.
Policy HAZ-4.1: The Fire Protection District and City's program of systematic lot and eucalyptus cleanup
                should be accelerated. The program works as follows: the owner is informed his property
                constitutes a fire hazard and is provided a time limit to eliminate the hazard. If he fails to
                do so, the City performs the necessary work and assesses the owner.
                Actions:
                HAZ-4.1.1: A public education program should be initiated that periodically informs
                             Belvedere residents about fire codes and encourages them to remove dead
                             vegetation and to prune plants located in close proximity to buildings.
                HAZ-4.1.2: The City shall be more proactive in initiating communication with the Fire
                             Marshal on potential fire hazards in the City and identifying measures to be
                             taken to diminish the hazard.
Policy HAZ-4.2: The Planning Commission, with input from the Building Official and Fire Marshal, should
                periodically review the Zoning Ordinance and Building Code to ensure maximum
                reasonable fire hazard protection. Particular attention should be paid to the adequacy of
                building setbacks with respect to fire safety concerns.
                Actions:
                HAZ-4.2.1: All plans for development of vacant sites and major remodeling shall be
                             referred to the Fire Marshal at the Tiburon Fire Protection District for review
                             and recommendations.
Policy HAZ-4.3: Road closures are prohibited unless approved by the City in advance and approved as
                part of a construction parking and staging plan.
Policy HAZ-4.4: Encourage construction work from the water side of a lot, when and where feasible.
Policy HAZ-4.5: Continue application of California Fire Code Requirements on new homes and major
                remodels including sprinklers and turnarounds for fire engines.

GOAL HAZ-5:     Create a high level of awareness of the unique hazards facing Belvedere’s residents.
Policy HAZ-5.1: Expand public awareness of environmental hazards by actively advising citizens of the
                availability of local area hazard studies, sources of hazard information, and existing
                public services.
                Actions:
                HAZ-5.1.1: Make available to the general public the hazard zone delineation maps;
                               including floodways, seismic zones, and areas of relative slope stability thus
                               enabling site plans to be designed according to the constraints of the site.
Policy HAZ-5.2: Community outreach and education shall be undertaken to describe changes in City
                policies and development regulations resulting from the expanding floodplain.
Policy HAZ-5.3: Support and/or facilitate efforts by the California Geological Survey to complete the
                earthquake-induced landslide and liquefaction mapping for the Bay Area.

Amplified Noise and Mechanical
Equipment
There also has been a need identified for
placement and design regulations for exterior
speakers in and around residential zones,
particularly in the Lagoon Area where noise
travels across the water. Other noise sources
that would affect noise levels in residential
areas would also include emergency generators,
multiple air conditioning units, roof-mounted
exhaust fans, pool and spa equipment, and
commercial-scale incline elevators. There are
also some infrequent and erratic loud noise
sources that related to construction, as
discussed in the previous section.

                            GOALS, POLICIES AND ACTIONS
 The community envisions that “The public health and welfare of its residents be protected by reducing or
 eliminating noise impacts to residents and visitors”. In order to further this mission, the following Guiding
 Principles have been developed:
     |    Establish standards for acceptable indoor and outdoor noise levels.
     |    Reduce noise impacts caused due to construction/remodeling activities.
     |    Incorporate noise consideration into land use planning by locating uses that generate noise away
          from residential land uses and other design guidelines.
     |    Minimize the noise impacts caused due to traffic on adjacent land uses.
 The following goals, policies and actions shall be implemented by the City of Belvedere in order to support
 the above Guiding Principles:
 Goal N-1:        Continue to maintain compatible noise levels within the city and to protect the public
                  health and welfare of its residents by reducing or eliminating unnecessary noise impacts.
 Policy N-1.1:    Utilize the Noise and Land Compatibility Standards shown in Figure N-1, and the noise
                  level performance standards in Tables N-1 and N-2, as a guide for future planning and
                  development decisions.
                  Actions:
                  N-1.1.1: Continue to apply the current Noise Ordinance to regulate construction noise,
