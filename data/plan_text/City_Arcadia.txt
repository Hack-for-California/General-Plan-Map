Introduction
From streets to storm drains to water and sewer lines, development
citywide requires well-developed and well-maintained circulation and
infrastructure systems to support daily activities. This element addresses
both the transportation network that allows people to move in and through
Arcadia, and the utilities infrastructure that provides necessary urban
services to residences, businesses, and institutions. This element sets forth
objectives for the following systems that support the land use plan:
           Circulation                            Infrastructure
       Street Network                     Water Storage and Distribution
       Transit                            Recycled Water Distribution
       Bikeways                           Sewage Collection and Disposal
       Pedestrian Ways                    Storm Drains/Flood Control
       Truck Routes                       Solid Waste Management

The circulation component addresses an integrated circulation system that
will meet the current and future needs of all Arcadia residents, businesses,
and visitors. That system will be multi-modal, efficient, and effective for all
users, and focused on achieving the following key goals:
        Providing and maintaining an efficient roadway system serving all
         parts of the City and all transportation modes, that also balances
         with planned land uses
        Maximizing the efficiency of the street system
        Improving local and regional transit service
        Providing a connected, balanced, and integrated transportation
         system of bicycle and pedestrian networks that enable residents to
         walk and bike
        Minimizing adverse traffic effects, and protecting residential
         neighborhoods from traffic intrusion
        Coordinating with other jurisdictions on regional transportation
         issues
Similarly, the infrastructure systems are planned to support the land use
types, intensities, and patterns citywide, and to allow Arcadia residents,
businesses, and institutions to continue to enjoy the high level of City
services that are a hallmark of Arcadia.
Achieving Our Vision
Arcadia’s vision is a City with mobility choices—choices for getting to work,
to school, to parks, to services, and to restaurants and shops. The City’s
transportation network will consist of a system of complete streets that
provide for a balanced integration of all transportation modes. Traffic
should flow smoothly and efficiently, and at safe speeds, and traffic
impacts on residential neighborhoods will be minimized. Alternative
modes―transit, bicycling, and walking―will be available and convenient
for all.
Arcadia also understands that local infrastructure systems support the
level of development appropriate for Arcadia. Arcadia envisions water,
sewer, and solid waste management and services to be sustainable,
environmentally sound, and capable of responding to modest growth.
Arcadia will also look to adapt to new technology, and develop a
telecommunications infrastructure can support the evolving needs of local
business to stay competitive and residents to be connected. In addition,
this plan strengthens the City’s commitment to ongoing assessment and
adjustments of existing infrastructure plans and services in order to
maintain a high-quality infrastructure system. The following Guiding
Principles promote this vision:
        Balanced Growth and Development
         The General Plan establishes a balance and mix of land uses that
         promotes economic growth and maintains a high quality of life for
         Arcadia residents. Our development decisions reflect Smart
         Growth principles and strategies that move us toward enhanced

          mobility, more efficient use of resources and infrastructure, and
          healthier lifestyles.
         Connectivity
          Arcadia has a balanced, integrated, multi-modal circulation system
          —which includes streets, sidewalks, bikeways, and trails—that is
          efficient and safe, and that connects neighborhoods to jobs,
          shopping, services, parks, and open space areas.
         City Services
          The high-quality services the City provides are a source of civic
          pride and bring us together as a community. We adjust service
          needs in response to demographic changes, and we take actions to
          provide funding to support these services.
Scope of this Element
State law (Government Code Section 65302[b]) requires that the General
Plan include “a circulation element consisting of the general location and
extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares, transportation
routes, terminals, any military airports and ports, and other local public
utilities and facilities, all correlated with the land use element of the plan.”
As of January 2011, circulation elements are also required
to include “a plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation
network that meets the needs of all users of streets, roads,
and highways for safe and convenient travel in a manner
that is suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of
the general plan. ‘Users of streets, roads, and highways’
means bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities,
motorists, movers of commercial goods, pedestrians, users
of public transportation, and seniors.” 1
This element address the complete streets concept by
identifying a hierarchy of travel corridors in the City,
defining a citywide transit plan, setting the framework for a
citywide bicycle network, and highlighting pedestrian
enhancement zones. These multiple transportation modes will connect all
                                                                                     A complete street can

employment centers, community and civic facilities, and retail and                   one travel mode.
commercial centers.

 As of 2010, State guidelines for complete streets approaches had not been
published. The City’s complete streets plan is based on best available information
and the principle that streets should support all transportation modes where
feasible and consistent with roadway type and surrounding land uses.
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                       Circulation and Infrastructure Element | 4-3

This element addresses infrastructure and services that support the day-to-
day operations of the City. Arcadia recognizes the importance of
infrastructure and its role as the backbone of the City and its ability to
meet the needs and demands of potential residential and commercial
growth. This element underscores the importance of many of the existing
infrastructure plans that are currently in place (Water Master Plan, Sewer
Master Plan, Capital Improvement and Equipment Plan, etc.) and identifies
the necessity to constantly update and evaluate these plans, as well as
current services, as to provide the highest quality water, sewer, storm
water, and waste services that will meet the needs of a dynamic Arcadia.
This element also explores the development of a telecommunications
network that meets the City’s requirements without aesthetic disturbance.
Circulation Plan
A Plan for Mobility
Arcadia had its modern beginnings as a railroad town, when City founder
Elias “Lucky” Baldwin convinced the Santa Fe Railroad to extend a line
through his rancho to connect the area to Los Angeles. The town of
Arcadia built up around the railroad station; the original rail alignment and
surrounding grid street pattern are evident in today’s Downtown.
Passenger rail via the Pacific Red Car, which ran within the wide median of
Huntington Drive, also connected early residents to Los Angeles and places
in between. As automobile ownership and use became more prevalent and
the desire to live in a quiet suburban environment grew, Pacific Red Car
usage declined and the company ultimately ceased operations. In response
to these changes, Arcadia’s neighborhoods and street system developed.
The City’s road network from its inception was well planned, with primary
north-south corridors such as Baldwin Avenue and Santa Anita Avenue,
and east-west routes such as Foothill Boulevard and Duarte Road,
developed to accommodate traffic to and through Arcadia without
intruding into the neighborhoods.
Regional access was improved with the opening of Interstate 210 in the
1970s, but the freeway also brought increased traffic into the San Gabriel
Valley, and I-210 now experiences chronic congested conditions during
commute hours. Traffic congestion continues to be the key complaint of
Arcadia residents, associated with both I-210 and arterial roadways. Other
circulation concerns include traffic conditions around local schools,
seasonal traffic from Santa Anita Park and the regional mall, lack of good
bike routes, pedestrian accommodation, and limited transit service. This
Circulation Plan looks to address these concerns by coordinated planning
of a multi-modal mobility system. This will be accomplished in part by
designating and using streets for per their primary functions (illustrated in
Figure CI-1), expanding transit access, and enhancing bicycle and
pedestrian mobility. Identified streets will function as:
4-4 | Circulation and Infrastructure Element                     Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

        Principal Travel Corridors, which have the capacity to carry the
         highest volumes of vehicles (in the range of 22,000 to 35,000
         daily), generally connect between adjacent cities, and are typically
         four-lane streets.
        Secondary Travel Corridors, which are more locally oriented, with
         the exception of Duarte Road, also are typically four-lane
         roadways, and experience daily vehicle volumes from 10,000 to
         18,000, with up to 24,000 in one or two locations in Arcadia.
    A system of local travel corridors supports and provides access to the
    Primary and Secondary Corridors. Local streets support local travel
    within the City and between neighborhoods, generally have two lanes,
    and carry less that 8,000 vehicles per day.
Street Network
The street system in Arcadia and its primary functions, as described above,
are well defined. Figure CI-2 shows the number of travel lanes on key City
roadways. The well-established grid network shown in Figure CI-2 allows
traffic to flow well in Arcadia, with few problems and only isolated
congestion at certain intersections, as described below.
Although not part of the City’s street network but a key regional travel
corridor, Interstate 210, also called the Foothill Freeway, runs east-west
through the northern part of the City, with local interchanges at Baldwin
Avenue and Santa Anita Avenue. Two interchanges just beyond Arcadia—
Michillinda Avenue/Rosemead Boulevard to the west and Huntington Drive
to the east—provide access to arterial roads serving the City.
The principal travel corridors—Foothill Boulevard, Huntington Drive, Las
Tunas Drive/Live Oak Avenue, Baldwin Avenue, and Santa Anita Avenue—
are typically four-lane streets (except for Huntington Drive, which has eight
lanes) and carry the highest traffic volumes.
The secondary travel corridors are Colorado Street/Place, Duarte Road,
Sunset Boulevard, parts of Baldwin Avenue, Santa Anita Avenue north of
Foothill Boulevard, and Second Avenue between Duarte Road and
Huntington Drive. With the exception of Duarte Road, these corridors are
more locally oriented. They typically have four lanes, although certain
locations may have two lanes.
The local travel corridors referenced above are Orange Grove Avenue,
Camino Real, Longden Avenue, Holly Avenue, El Monte Avenue, First
Avenue, Second Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Tenth Avenue, and Mayflower
Avenue.

These descriptions of the street hierarchy provide a general description
only in order to explain the movement of people within the City, and to
complement the transit and bicycle network diagrams. The actual
classification of City streets and associated street standards are described
in more detail in the Circulation Plan and Roadway Standards below.
Level of Service Objectives
To describe how a roadway functions in terms of moving traffic, traffic          LOS D is the established
conditions are typically rated using the concept of Level of Service, or LOS.    service level objective for
The LOS expresses the relationship between the capacity of a given street        most roadways in Arcadia.
and the amount of traffic that the street carries (Volume to Capacity
Ratio). Levels of service describe a range of roadway operating conditions
from LOS A (excellent conditions) to LOS F (very poor conditions). Table
CI-1 indicates the conditions associated with each service level.
Arcadia’s goal is to ensure mobility within and through the City by
maintaining LOS D or better along most roadways where feasible. LOS D
is commonly used by cities throughout the nation, and has been used in
project-level review by the City of Arcadia. Establishment of the LOS D
standard recognizes that some congestion will occur during peak hours, but
that roadways will function at much better levels of service during the
balance of the day.
Many cities also recognize that at certain locations, such as in major
commercial districts or near freeway interchanges, LOS D may not always
be practical because street widening would take too much land from the
urban fabric of the adjacent commercial areas, negatively impact the
pedestrian environment in commercial districts, and be cost prohibitive.
LOS E conditions will be accepted at specific locations set forth below due
to regional traffic loads and seasonal traffic associated with Santa Anita
Park and the regional mall (see Policy CI-1.3).
The LOS D performance standard will apply citywide, except at the
following locations, where LOS E is permitted:
        Intersections/roadways at or adjacent to freeway ramps
        Intersections/roadways adjacent to Santa Anita Park and all
         roadway links intended to carry race-related traffic during racing
         season
        Intersections/roadways at or adjacent to the Downtown, Baldwin
         Avenue, and Live Oak Avenue commercial and mixed-use districts
These performance standards may require, but are not intended to
mandate, the widening of roadways and/or intersections. They represent
goals used to monitor traffic conditions and to assess traffic impacts of
development projects. Because LOS standards apply only to vehicular
mobility and do not account for enhanced pedestrian movement or other
modes, the City will not use them as the sole criteria for judging
transportation system performance. Pedestrian convenience, neighborhood
and district character, transit access and operations, urban aesthetics, and
other factors will be considered.

Table cI-1: level of service descriptors
   Level of Service                    Description                  Volume to Capacity Ratio

                        All approaches to the intersection
                        appear quite open, turning movements
                        are easily made, and nearly all drivers
                        find freedom of operation.
          B             Very Good Operation                              0.601 - 0.700
                        Many drivers begin to feel somewhat
                        restricted within platoons of vehicles.
                        This represents stable flow. An
                        approach to an intersection may
                        occasionally be fully utilized, and traffic
                        queues start to form.
          C             Good Operation                                   0.701 – 0.800
                        Occasionally drivers may have to wait
                        more than 60 seconds, and backups
                        may develop behind turning vehicles.
                        Most drivers feel somewhat restricted.
          D             Fair Operation                                   0.801 - 0.900
                        Cars are sometimes required to wait
                        more than 60 seconds during short
                        peaks. There are no long-standing
                        traffic queues. This level is typically
                        associated with design practice for
                        peak periods.
          E             Poor Operation                                   0.901 – 1.000
                        Some long-standing vehicular queues
                        develop on critical approaches to
                        intersections. Delays may be up to
                        several minutes.
          F             Forced Flow                                        Over 1.001

                        cross street may restrict or prevent
                        movement of vehicles out of the
                        intersection approach lanes; therefore,
                        volumes carried are not predictable.

Where it is not feasible to achieve roadway cross sections that meet these
objectives, the City will consider other methods of improving roadway
operations such as implementing parking restrictions, driveway
consolidation, and other operational measures.
Key Traffic Concerns
Because of Arcadia’s location, the east-west streets of Foothill Boulevard,
Huntington Drive, Duarte Road, and Las Tunas Drive/Live Oak Avenue
carry regional traffic that passes through Arcadia generally without
stopping at local destinations. These flows can increase—particularly on
Foothill Boulevard and Huntington Drive—when traffic problems occur on I-
210 and drivers detour to local streets.
Two major local destinations—Santa Anita Park and the regional mall—
generate substantial traffic volumes. This traffic usually occurs on
weekends rather than during weekday peak hours. However, these two
destinations also generate significant traffic and backups during peak
shopping periods and/or during large-attendance events at the race track.
During racing season, manual control of intersections by City Police is used
on large race days to increase the effective carrying capacity of area
roadways, allowing race track traffic to both enter and leave the race track
in the most efficient manner possible. Although the amount of race track
traffic has decreased due to declining patronage, even with manual traffic
control, nuisance problems remain as race track-related traffic runs
adjacent to neighborhoods north of Santa Anita Park and along Holly
Avenue through residential neighborhoods south of the race track.
Residents along the primary routes to and from the race track experience
reduced mobility during the peak hours when track patrons enter and
leave. Although race track parking rates are nominal, some visitors choose
to park outside the race track and walk into the facility, impacting nearby
residential neighborhoods, the County Arboretum and Botanic Gardens,
and Arcadia County Park.
The proximity of the regional mall to the race track requires that mall and
race track traffic use the same access roads. Congestion occurs when
special promotional events occurring at Santa Anita Park coincide with
peak shopping days. In particular, congestion problems occur on December
26, which is one of the year’s primary shopping days, as well as opening
day at Santa Anita Park.
Of more general concern is traffic around schools and through residential
neighborhoods. With the curtailing of school bus service over the years,
parents have opted to drive their children to school, which creates
temporary congestion for short periods. With regard to cut-through traffic
concerns, neighborhoods near primary travel corridors sometimes
experience non-local traffic as drivers look to avoid congestion along the
primary routes. Strategies to address these issues are described below
under Addressing Neighborhood Traffic Issues.

Transportation Master Plan
The City prepared a Transportation Master Plan in 2005 that included
traffic traffic forecasts and identified potential roadway system
deficiencies for the year 2030. The plan also identified a comprehensive
set of transportation improvements at 20 intersections to address the
future deficiencies. These improvements include measures such as
restriping of roadway lanes, providing additional roadway lanes, and traffic
signal system improvements. The City intends to update this plan on a
regular basis.
Roadway Plan
The Roadway Plan, which sets the framework for long-term circulation
system enhancments, is shown in Figure CI-3 and includes the following
functional classification of streets:
        Major Arterial                         Secondary Arterial
        Modified Major Arterial                Enhanced Collector
        Primary Arterial                       Collector
Table CI-2 identifies the key features of each street classification with
respect to number of lanes, street curb-to-width width, and right-of-way
width. Characteristics for Local streets are not indicated, as they vary
substantially throughout the City. Varying standards are included in the
City’s street standards manual. Figure CI-4 shows the typical cross sections
of each street type.

To achieve desired circulation objectives over the long term, only minor
modifications to the established street system will be needed. The City’s
intent is to monitor traffic and circulation conditions and to move forward
with the modifications only when deemed necessary.
Colorado Boulevard, between Santa Anita Avenue and Fifth Avenue
This section of Colorado Boulevard will be restriped from two to four lanes.
No roadway widening will be needed. Mid-block on-street parking will be
retained on one side of the street. Left-turn lanes will be provided at
intersections. These improvements will provide additional east-west traffic
capacity through the downtown area to help alleviate traffic loads on
Huntington Drive.
Santa Clara Street, between Santa Anita Avenue and Fifth Avenue
This section of Santa Clara Street will be restriped from two to four lanes.
No roadway widening will be needed. On-street parking will be prohibited.
This will provide additional east-west traffic capacity through the
downtown area to help alleviate traffic loads on Huntington Drive.
Santa Anita Avenue, between Santa Clara Avenue and Colorado
Boulevard
This section of Santa Anita Avenue will be restriped from four to six lanes.
On-street parking will be prohibited in peak periods.
Enhanced Intersections
Certain intersections in the City are identified as enhanced intersections
(Figure CI-3). These are where the roadway width may exceed the regular
standards and additional right-of-way may be needed. Typically this would
allow for dual left-turn lanes. It could also allow for an exclusive right-turn
lane. The additional lanes may be installed on any approach but not
necessarily on all approaches. Again, these are not needed in the short
term but will eventually be necessary as land development approaches
General Plan capacity.
Future Study Areas
Three roadway segments have been identified for future monitoring and
study.
Foothill Boulevard, between Santa Anita Avenue and Fifth Avenue: The
traffic volumes on eastbound side of this segment of Foothill Boulevard are
currently higher than the General Plan standard for the capacity of a four-
lane roadway in the P.M. peak hour, and will increase in the future. This
stretch of roadway carries regional traffic passing through the Arcadia, as
well as local Arcadia traffic, so traffic conditions are not entirely under the
control of the City. A potential solution is to enhance the intersections at
Second Avenue and Fifth Avenue to provide additional turn lanes.
However, this would require street widening and possible narrowing of
sidewalks or requiring additional right-of-way, and would not be compatible
with other General Plan goals of enhancing the pedestrian environment
along this corridor. The traffic volumes and conditions on this portion of
Foothill Boulevard will therefore be monitored, and future studies will be
4-14 | Circulation and Infrastructure Element                     Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

conducted to identify the potential for feasible solutions. These could
include enhanced intersections, roadway restriping and/or widening, or
other measures to reduce vehicle trips, as appropriate.
Holly Avenue, between Duarte Road and Huntington Drive: As
development approaches the identified land use capacity, traffic volumes
on the northbound side of Holly Avenue will approach the General Plan
standard for the capacity of a two-lane roadway in the P.M. peak hour. The
roadway is not wide enough to provide four lanes without widening and
additional right-of-way. The traffic volumes and conditions on this portion
of Holly Avenue will therefore be monitored, and future studies will be
conducted to identify needed and feasible solutions. These could include
enhanced intersections at Huntington Drive and/or Duarte Road, providing
two northbound lanes and one southbound lane; potential roadway
widening; or other measures as feasible and appropriate.
First Avenue between California Street and Duarte Road: This section of
First Avenue between California Street and Duarte Road will be converted
from four to two lanes. The traffic volumes on this segment do not justify
four travel lanes, and the Land Use and Community Design Element calls
for mixed-use development with a pedestrian orientation. Narrowing the
travel path for cars, maintaining parallel on-street parking, and installing
Class II bike lanes will change the street character to be more appropriate
for pedestrian activity, consistent with character of First Avenue between
Huntington Drive and California Street. As part of the change, any impacts
to emergency vehicle response (Genoa Street and First Avenue
intersection along this section is a primary response intersection for the
Fire Department) will be thoroughly evaluated and mitigated.
Huntington Drive, between Santa Clara Street and Fifth Avenue: The
section of Huntington Drive between Santa Clara Street and Fifth Avenue
through downtown carries high volumes of traffic, and over the long term,
forecast volumes for morning and evening peak periods are expected to
approach the General Plan standard for capacity of a four-lane roadway,
without measures being taken to provide additional east-west roadway
capacity in the downtown. This section of Huntington Drive should
therefore be the subject of continuing traffic monitoring and future studies.
For the near term, the Roadway Plan and element policies and
implementation programs provide a number of measures to enhance the
east-west roadway capacity through downtown to relieve pressures on
Huntington Drive. These include:
        converting Santa Clara Street between Santa Anita Avenue and
         Fifth Avenue from a two-lane to a four-lane street to provide
         additional east-west capacity,
        installing directional approach signage to encourage use of Santa
         Clara Street,
        possible reconfiguration of certain intersections to facilitate use of
         Santa Clara Street,
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                  Circulation and Infrastructure Element | 4-15

        improving the connection between Santa Clara Street and
         Huntington Drive at the east end of downtown along Fifth Avenue.
         and
        adjusting signal timing.
All of these measures will encourage the use of Santa Clara Street as an
alternate route through downtown between Santa Anita Avenue and FIfth
Avenue.
Over the longer term, studies could address the concept of a one-way
couplet through downtown between Colorado Street and Fifth Avenue,
where Huntington Drive could be one-way eastbound and Santa Clara
Street could be one-way westbound. This would be a low-speed and traffic-
calmed couplet with extensive pedestrian-oriented urban design. It could
extend the existing urban design features of Huntington Drive to Santa
Clara Street, thereby better integrating Santa Clara Street and the Gold
Line Station into an expanded and walkable downtown. Vehicular turn
conflicts would be reduced with the one-way system, and vehicular-
pedestrian conflicts would be reduced with the fewer vehicular turning
movements. Transit circulation in the downtown would also be enhanced.
On-street parking could be retained on both sides of Huntington Drive and
at least one side of Santa Clara Street, and wider sidewalks could be
provided on Huntington Drive.
ITS Master Plan
One of the most effective means of improving traffic flow is to make traffic
signals more demand responsive and synchronized. The traffic signal
system citywide will be upgraded to provide state-of-the-art traffic control
strategies to enhance arterial street system operations through better
traffic management. The City’s Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
Master Plan includes installation of fiber optic communications cable on
several key arterials, video detection at intersections, closed circuit
television, changeable message signs, and a traffic management center
workstation. The system will include ITS elements at 59 intersections, with
communications and monitoring along the intervening streets.
Arcadia coordinates its signal system with two larger efforts: the Los
Angeles County Information Exchange Network (IEN) and the Regional
Integration of Intelligent Transportation Systems (RIITS). The IEN is a
coordinated network for sharing information and control of the various
traffic control systems along I-210 and is intended to improve coordination
between member agencies’ traffic control systems as well as improve
incident response and management activities. By sharing second-by-
second intersection data, there is improved coordination between systems
along the arterials, thus improving response management in the event of a
problem with special events or incidents along the freeway or surface
streets along I-210 corridor.
The RIITS network is composed of Caltrans, the City of Los Angeles
Department of Transportation, the California Highway Patrol, Long Beach
Transit, Foothill Transit, and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan
4-16 | Circulation and Infrastructure Element                  Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

Transportation Authority (Metro). RIITS is a communication network that
supports the real-time exchange of information to help manage the
regional transportation system. The RIITS network provides real-time,
multi-modal transportation information to system managers and travelers
to improve mobility, safety, and air quality in Los Angeles County.
Improvements Associated with Major
Developments
As noted above, Santa Anita Park and the regional mall generate
substantial traffic volumes during peak periods. The Land Use Plan
addresses future redevelopment to portions of the race track property that
would add traffic to the roadway system. To address long-term mobility
objectives surrounding these major users, the Transportation Master Plan
provides for the following physical enhancements:
       The ITS system described above
       Installation of new traffic signals
       Making turn and travel lanes modifications at up to 14 intersections
In addition, major development projects will be required to implement
measures such as provision of dedicated shuttle service to the Gold Line
Station, enhanced pedestrian and bicycle access and mobility, and
transportation demand management programs that reduce vehicle trips.
The combined pursuit of all circulation system improvements described
above, in combination with City strategies regarding transit, bicycle, and
pedestrian mobility, will allow the City to balance the circulation system
with the Land Use Plan.
Measures to Address Neighborhood Traffic
Issues
The most effective strategy for keeping through traffic out of residential
neighborhoods is appropriately managing traffic on the arterial roadway
system and limiting incentives for traffic to divert through neighborhoods.
The Roadway Plan shown in Figure CI-2 and the City’s initiative to use ITS
methods to manage traffic flow will help in this regard. The City can also
offer a menu of traffic-calming approaches, recognizing that solutions must
reflect specific local neighborhood circumstances, not generic measures.
Thus, policies call for developing a formalized process and procedures for
implementing neighborhood traffic management programs where
necessary and appropriate in residential neighborhoods and around
schools and parks.
With regard to school traffic in particular, concerns cited by parents
include congestion, questionable driving practices, and limited pedestrian
accommodation in some areas. The key contributor to these problems is the
fact that many parents drive their children to school, either due to public
safety concerns or for convenience. The City’s goal is to partner with the
Arcadia Unified School District to identify strategies to encourage more
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                   Circulation and Infrastructure Element | 4-17

children to walk or bike to school, to address congestion during pick-up and
drop-off hours (for example, staggered school schedules or improved
access/flow), and to improve drivers’ behavior with increased police
presence or other approaches.
Transit
Bus Service
Both Metro and Foothill Transit provide bus service to
and through Arcadia as part of their regional systems.
Metro operates five lines, with Foothill Transit
operating four lines, as shown in Figure CI-5. Buses
do not run along all arterial streets in Arcadia; the
routes are focused along travel ways with regional
links. The highest concentration of bus service occurs
on Huntington Drive, which has up to three routes.
The routes primarily serve commercial districts and
corridors in the City, and large portions of residential
neighborhoods are some distance from bus service.
The City operates Arcadia Transit, which provides a
curb-to-curb demand response service. The service is
open to the general public and operates to all destinations within the City
limits.
With an increased regional emphasis on improving public transit over the
long term, the City anticipates that the public will demand improvements in
transit service and local geographic coverage. This will necessitate
coordination with both Foothill Transit and Metro as the regional transit
operators, and will involve evaluation by these agencies for new service
routes or increases in service frequencies based on service standards and
other operational criteria.
Figure CI-6, Transit Corridors, identifies the City’s expectations and plans
for these enhancements. A Primary Transit Corridor is a street which is
expected to carry the highest levels of transit service, particularly regional
service, with the most bus routes and the highest frequency of service. A
Secondary Transit Corridor is a street that is expected to carry lower but
still significant levels of transit service, and probably with a greater
orientation to local rather regional bus routes. In both cases the design
and operation of the streets need to reflect and accommodate transit
vehicles. The City anticipates three major transit corridors in the City—an
east-west transit spine along Huntington Drive and a north-south transit
spine along Santa Anita Avenue—that will form the backbone of bus transit
service in the City, along with an east-west corridor along Las Tunas
Drive/Live Oak Avenue in the south of the City.

The provision of bus rapid transit (BRT) service on these key corridors may
be explored by Metro and Foothill Transit. BRT is a rapidly developing
form of enhanced bus transit that offers more frequent service, fewer stops,
and higher average speeds than traditional bus service. BRT uses higher-
capacity vehicles with low floors and specially designed station platforms
for quick boarding. In some areas, bus travel is provided in exclusive lanes
for greater mobility through high-demand areas. In other areas, buses
travel in mixed flow lanes but may receive signal priority treatment over
other vehicles. Metro continues to implement bus transit routes on key
corridors throughout Los Angeles County, most notably the popular
Orange Line through the San Fernando Valley with connections to
downtown Los Angeles. The City supports routes through Arcadia that may
be added as transit ridership and patterns dictate, provided that BRT
works in concert with the City’s efforts to smooth overall traffic flow.
To complement light rail service, a Bus Transit Center (where regional and
local routes may converge, transfers between bus routes are provided, and
bus passengers can transfer to/from the Gold Line light rail line) is
identified at Santa Clara Street and First Avenue, adjacent to the Gold
Line Station.
The Transit Plan also calls for localized internal circulator transit service
within Arcadia, connecting key population centers to schools, parks,
commercial centers, regional transit, and key destinations such as
Downtown, the medical center, the civic center, and the regional mall. Such
local service could be operated by the City, Foothill Transit, Metro, and/or
through a joint effort with surrounding jurisdictions. The feasibility and
funding sources for local service will continue to be explored, with emphasis
on fixed-route service with smaller vehicles and routes that follow collector
and/or local streets. The service will feed into and support regional fixed-
route service, thereby significantly enhancing transit access for Arcadians.
This community transit service could be implemented in stages based on
available funding and projected ridership levels.

the Gold Line light rail line east from Pasadena through
Arcadia to Montclair. In Arcadia, station plans are
underway in the Downtown at Santa Clara Street and
First Avenue. This will provide significant opportunities
for increased transit use, and will allow development in
Downtown to consist of more compact, mixed-use
patterns that encourage walking and use of the train.
The Arcadia station will be located at the northwest
corner of the Santa Clara Street and First Avenue intersection. The station    The Arcadia Gold Line
will be at grade, with the rail line passing diagonally through the            Station will consist of a

on the southwest corner of the Santa Clara Street and First Avenue
intersection. The structure will be designed to accommodate up to 800
spaces once the Gold Line reaches its projected capacity.
Both Santa Clara Street and First Avenue will function as Transit Access
Corridors to the Gold Line station. An on-street Transit Center can be
located at Santa Clara Street and First Avenue. The Transit Center will
accommodate Foothill Transit and Metro buses serving the station, and
would provide an excellent transfer point for local bus service as well.
Accommodating Bicycles
Arcadia has not previously prepared
or adopted a bikeway master plan,
nor has the City emphasized
construction or designation of bike
paths, bike lanes, or bike routes.
However, the City continues to
explore the coordination of better
bike routes and facilities by the
potential development of a Bicycle
Plan shown in Figure CI-7. This
Bicycle Plan, which will link to the
extensive Rio Hondo bike path
system that has a trailhead in the
south of the City, near the border
with El Monte, responds to desires for recreation routes and a
comprehensive system that links community destinations to residential Biking is a great way to
neighborhoods and transit access locations. The Bikeway Plan identifies a exercise and make local

The Bicycle Plan explores key components like the use of flood control www.peopleonbikes.com
channels along the east side of Arcadia, a Class I (see description below)
loop around the Santa Anita Golf Course and Arcadia County Park, Class
II access to the Gold Line station, and protected access across the regional
mall and Santa Anita Park properties. The next step is to adjust and
further develop the proposed Bicycle Plan to determine the class and
locations of routes that would best fit the City.
Although the routes primarily occur along City streets, implementation of
the Bicycle Plan will require coordination with regional agencies such as
the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works and Department of
Parks and Recreation, as well as private landowners.

Bicycle Facility Types
The Bicycle Plan is comprised of three different
classes of bicycle facilities:
Class I - Bike Path or Bike Trail                                                           Class I
Class I facilities are bicycle trails or paths that are
essentially off street and separated from motor
vehicles. They are a minimum of eight feet in width
                                                                            BIKE PATH
for two-way travel, and include bike lane signage and                         NO MOTOR
                                                                              VEHICLES
                                                                                 OR
                                                                             MOTORIZED
                                                                              BICYCLES
designated street crossings where needed. A Class I
bike path may parallel a roadway (within the
parkway) or may be a completely separate right-of-
way that meanders through a neighborhood or along                        2'             8' Minimum          2'
a flood control channel or utility right-of-way. The                                   Primary Surface

The path is the beginning of the extensive Rio Hondo
bike path system and is located in the south of the
City. It begins just inside the City’s border with El                                      Class II
Monte, and links into the Los Angeles River bike path.
Class II - Bike Lane
Class II bikeways are located next to the curb or edge
of paved roadways or adjacent to a travel lane, and
consist of a designated bike lane. Minimum width is
five feet (four feet bike lane, one foot for curb/gitter),
and the lane has bike lane signage, special lane lines,
and other pavement markings identifying the
designated use of bicycles.
Class III – Bike Street
This is a signed street providing for shared use of a
street by motor vehicles and bicyclists. While
bicyclists have no exclusive use or priority, the
signage—both on the side of the street and with large                                      Class III
bicycle symbols stenciled on the roadway surface—
warns motorists of bicyclists sharing the roadway
space and that the street is an official bike route.            BIKE ROUTE
Bike Streets are typically lower-volume streets, and
are enhancements of the standard Class III bike route
which is only indicated by small wayside signs. They
are identified in the Bicycle Plan at locations where
Class II Bike Lanes are not feasible but where                                                14' Minimum
necessary to provide connections in the bicycle                                                Shared Lane
network. The signage—both by the side of the street
and on the street surface itself—will clearly identify
such roadway sections as being on the bike network.
Traffic calming measures may also be implemented to
facilitate bicycles crossing major arterials along the     Figure CI-8: Types of Bike Facilities
route.

Over time, streets that are designated as Class III should be improved to
Class II bicycle lanes as and where it becomes feasible and where sufficient
right-of-way exists.
Pedestrians
A pedestrian-friendly environment is a key City goal, as
walking is encouraged both as a means to reduce auto
travel and as healthy exercise. The City looks to provide
sidewalks on all arterial roadways as funding allows, and to
improve pedestrian amenities and reducing walking
impediments (e.g. uneven surfaces, utility structures,
newspaper racks) along sidewalks on streets that are key
pedestrian routes and districts. Amenities include benches,
street trees, trash receptacles, and pedestrian scaled
lighting.
Focus areas have been identified for an enhanced pedestrian environment.
These are primarily in local commercial districts, such as Downtown and       Shade trees, wide
                                                                              sidewalks, and interesting
along Baldwin Avenue’s restaurant row, as well as the Gold Line Station,
                                                                              shops make for a pleasant
where the goal is to make streets friendlier to pedestrians and improve
                                                                              pedestrian experience.
walkability in mixed use areas. These areas are shown in Figure CI-9 and
include:
        Foothill Boulevard corridor near Santa Anita Avenue (between
         Rodeo Road and Fifth Avenue)
        Downtown connecting to the proposed transit center, and
         extending south along First Avenue
        Baldwin Avenue between Huntington Drive and Camino Real
        Live Oak Avenue/Las Tunas Drive around Santa Anita Avenue,
         from El Monte Avenue to Sixth Avenue
        Along the edges of Arcadia County Park and the Santa Anita
         County Golf Course, including connections to Downtown and
         adjacent neighborhoods, as well as along Campus Drive by Arcadia
         High School.
The improvements to sidewalks adjacent to the park
and golf course should be combined into a multi-
purpose trail/facility with the proposed bike paths
around the park. These combined facilities will greatly
enhance the accessibility and utility of the park.
Typical pedestrian enhancements will include wider
sidewalks, ensuring sufficient space and clearance on
sidewalks available for walking, improved lighting,
seating, enhanced landscaping, shade trees,
distinctive sidewalk paving, sidewalk bulb-outs or
similar treatments at intersections where feasible,
wider crosswalks, and pedestrian signage. From a
zoning perspective, regulations can require entrances
to be well marked and welcoming to pedestrians and
pedestrian-scale signage.

Truck Routes
The City Council, by resolution, establishes truck routes to minimize the
impact of truck travel on residential areas and near parks and schools, and
to help with the planning and maintenance of the street network. Streets
that bear a higher level of truck traffic typically require more durable road
bases and more frequent repair. Truck routes are limited to Major and
Secondary Arterials. Figure CI-10 identifies those routes, which will
continue to apply unless amended by subsequent City Council resolution.

Circulation Goals and
Policies
The fundamental guiding principal with regard to mobility is to provide a
multi-modal transportation environment in Arcadia that provides
transportation choices and reduces trips made and vehicles miles traveled
by private automobile.
Policy CI-1.3 sets forth roadway performance standards which may require,
but are not intended to mandate, the widening of roadways and/or
intersections. However, these standards represent only a policy goal, and
will be used to monitor traffic conditions in the City and to assess the
impacts of new development. Because level of service standards apply
only to vehicular mobility and do not account for walkability or other
modes, they shall not be the sole criteria for judging transportation system
performance. Pedestrian movement and convenience, livability, transit
access and operability, and urban aesthetics will also be used.
Goal CI-1:                   An efficient roadway system that serves all of
                             Arcadia, supports all transportation modes,
                             and balances the roadway system with
                             planned land uses
     Policy CI-1.1:          Pursue enhancements to the roadway network
                             consistent with the Figure CI-3, Master Plan of
                             Roadway, and the Transportation Master Plan.
     Policy CI-1.2:          Implement street design standards on arterial
                             corridors consistent with the Master Plan of
                             Roadways to address bicycle facilities,
                             sidewalks, and on-street parking that are
                             context sensitive to adjacent land uses and
                             districts, and to all roadway users, where
                             appropriate.
     Policy CI-1.3:          Maintain a maximum Level of Service (LOS) D
                             throughout the City, except that LOS E may be
                             permitted in the following circumstances:
                                Intersections/roadways at, or adjacent to
                                 freeway ramps
                                Intersections/roadways adjacent to Santa
                                 Anita Park during racing season
                                Intersections/roadways at or adjacent to
                                 designated Downtown, Baldwin Avenue,
                                 and Live Oak Avenue commercial and
                                 mixed-use districts

                         These performance standards may require, but
                         are not intended to mandate, roadway and/or
                         intersection widenings. They represent goals
                         used to monitor traffic conditions and to assess
                         traffic impacts of development projects.
                         Because LOS standards apply only to vehicular
                         mobility and do not account for enhanced
                         pedestrian movement or other modes, the City
                         will not use them as the sole criteria for judging
                         transportation system performance. Pedestrian
                         convenience, transit access and operations,
                         urban aesthetics, and other factors will be
                         considered.

Infrastructure
Arcadia boasts efficient and well-maintained infrastructure systems that
support the daily activities of businesses, residential life, and the operations
of the many public uses in the City. Residents comment frequently about
the outstanding services and public facilities the City provides. This
Infrastructure section addresses water storage and distribution, recycled
water, wastewater collection and disposal, storm drainage and flood
control, waste management, and telecommunications. Preserving the high
levels of service that Arcadians expect will require ongoing maintenance,
improvement, and replacement of facilities as need arises, and new
development must ensure that its needs are met without detriment to
established and planned infrastructure systems.
Water Production, Storage, and
Distribution
The Arcadia Public Works Services Department, Utilities Section is
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the water storage and            Water supply and
distribution system in Arcadia. The system serves an 11.1-square-mile area        resource issues are

Company, East Pasadena Water Company, and California-American
Water Company serve areas along the western City boundary, and
Southern California Water Company serves residents along the south and
east boundaries.
Water System Components
The City’s water system consists of local groundwater wells and natural
underground storage basins, constructed reservoirs, booster pump stations,
and over 165 miles of transmission and distribution pipelines. As described
in the Resource Sustainability Element, the water supply is derived from
local sources in the underlying groundwater basins and treated imported
water through a contract with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California (MWD).        City water wells tap into three adjudicated
groundwater basins: East Raymond, West Raymond, and Main San Gabriel.
The service area of Arcadia’s water system varies in elevation from 300 to
1,200 feet above mean sea level. To attain appropriate pressures
throughout the system (both for fire-fighting purposes and to make sure
water flows from the taps as customers expect it to), the water system
includes booster pumps and pressure-reducing stations. The booster pump
stations move water from wells in lower areas of Arcadia to reservoirs at
higher elevations. The water produced is stored in 15 reservoirs with a total
constructed volume of 44.8 million gallons.             In addition to these
constructed reservoirs, the system includes three forebay reservoirs that
have a total capacity of 1.55 million gallons.

For the purposes of meeting short-term emergency water supply needs, the
City’s water system has interconnections with adjacent water systems.
Connections include one-way connections, whereby Arcadia’s water system
can help supply outside sources, and two-way connections that allow water
to both enter and leave the City’s water system. In addition, the City has a
connection to MWD pipelines as an emergency supply source and to
facilitate replacement/auxiliary water purchases from MWD.
Water System Maintenance and Upgrades
Maintenance and improvements to the City’s water system are coordinated
through the Water Master Plan. Updated every five years,2 the Water
Master Plan helps the Public Works Services Department and the City
Council evaluate and assess operational and planning issues associated
with the water system. The master plan assesses water system reliability,
infrastructure rehabilitation needs, and restoration considerations of
various water facilities. Actualization of maintenance and rehabilitation
needs identified in the master plan is implemented through the five-year
Capital Improvement and Equipment Plan. Most of the improvements
described in the master plan consist of ongoing projects such as replacing
old and deteriorating water lines and retrofitting obsolete controls and
related equipment. The City has also identified reductions in water
pumping capacities due in part to the lowering of aquifer levels, as well the
possible need to replace existing reservoirs due to age and adjusting
pressure-reducing stations to augment fire flows at higher elevations.
The Land Use Plan provides for a modest level of growth over time, with
activity to occur largely within the focus areas identified in the Land Use
and Community Design Element. The Water Master Plan anticipates
modest growth with regard to facility sizing and ongoing maintenance
needs. For larger-scale development projects such as that could occur on
the Santa Anita Park property, developers will be required to fund on-site
improvements and any system-wide upgrades needed to support the level
of development. With regard to Downtown and the Live Oak corridor,
mixed-use developments will occur incrementally, with the City able to plan
for and fund minor facilities improvements through subsequent Water
Master Plan updates and thereby provides adequate daily, fire flow, and
emergency storage capabilities. Interestingly, the replacement of older
buildings and plumbing fixtures will provide opportunities to reduce
demands with modern water-saving plumbing features. Also, the City has
committed resources to reduce burdens on the system due to age and new
demands by implementing water-savings programs, such as plumbing
retrofit initiatives and conservation pricing.
2
  At the time this element was updated in 2008-10, the Water Master Plan was
dated 2008.

Recycled Water
Given Southern California’s Mediterranean climate with periods of limited
rainfall and even drought, the ever-growing population of the region, and
reductions in the availability of imported water supplies, potable water
resources have become increasingly strained. Like many cities throughout
the State, Arcadia has adopted water-savings practices and programs.
Even with these programs, however, Arcadia and other jurisdictions have
recognized that new methods of supplying water will be needed to meet
long-term demand. One potential source that continues to be investigated
and implemented at some level is recycled water, that is, treated effluent
from sewage treatment plants.
In 2006, the City conducted a recycled water feasibility study to assess
the need for and potential costs of using recycled water to meet overall
long-term water demands. While the study indicated that potable water
supplies are sufficient to meet demand through year 2025 (the study’s
horizon year), “the use of recycled water may be more economical than use
of replacement, treated imported, and cyclic storage water.”3
Recycled water can be used for non-potable purposes, which largely means
landscape irrigation. Arcadia has several large open space areas that are
candidates for recycled water use: Santa Anita Park grounds, Arcadia
County Park, the Santa Anita and Par 3 golf courses, street medians,
Caltrans rights-of-way, City parks, and school play fields. In addition,
recycled water can be used by car wash businesses. According to the
feasibility study, potential limitations on use include: 1) some golf courses
could limit recycled water use because certain turf may be sensitive to salt
content in reclaimed irrigation water, 2) State regulatory agencies require
specific distances be maintained between housing and recycled water
irrigation spray, and 3) water quality may be of concern to certain end
users.
Other uses for recycled water include injection of highly treated water into
local groundwater basins for blending with groundwater sources. The
water is monitored for compliance with health standards and then pumped
for potable use. The Orange County Water District’s Groundwater
Replenishment Program represents a significant example of such an
approach, whereby treated effluent from regional sewage treatment plants
is injected or percolated into large groundwater basins. OCWD reports
that the quality of the recycled water is better than that of the
groundwater basins and actually improves the overall quality of water
delivered to consumers.
The proximity of the Whittier Narrows Reclamation Plant (operated by the
Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts) and other regional treatment
facilities creates potential opportunities for use of recycled water in
Arcadia and surrounding communities. A recycled water system is

technically feasible, although expensive. The key consideration in
establishing a system will continue to be the cost of system construction
and over the long term, the cost of recycled water versus local and
imported sources.
Wastewater Collection
and Treatment
Wastewater—also called sewage—is the water that
drains from our sinks, toilets, and showers into the
sewer system. The Arcadia Public Works Services
Department, Utilities Section oversees the local
sewage collection system, which consists of
approximately 138 miles of pipelines and support
booster stations. Sewage generated in Arcadia
flows into regional trunk lines operated by the
County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles. Arcadia
lies within District No. 15, which also serves the cities of Sierra Madre,
Temple City, Rosemead, El Monte, San Gabriel, La Puente, and Baldwin
Park and adjacent unincorporated areas. The Sanitation Districts manage
a joint sewer outfall system that conveys collected sewage to treatment
plants located in Whittier (San Jose Creek West Water Reclamation Plant)
and Carson (Carson Joint Water Pollution Control Plant).
Sewer System Maintenance and Upgrades
The City updates its Sewer Master Plan and Hydraulic Modeling Report on
an approximate 10-year basis to evaluate the adequacy of the local
wastewater collection system infrastructure.4 The report helps with
identification of system deficiencies and prioritization of maintenance and
rehabilitation needs. Ongoing efforts to keep the system operating
properly include activities to identify, repair, and prevent sewer system
damage, including monitoring by closed circuit television. Common system
problems occur over time due to root intrusion from vegetation, grease
buildup, and structural deterioration. These proactive efforts and the
funding of upgrades pursuant to the Capital Improvement and Equipment
Plan generally avoid problems.
As noted above with regard to water supply infrastructure, ongoing City
efforts to reduce water consumption by requiring low-flow plumbing
fixtures have modestly reduced overall sewage flows into the system. From
a systems maintenance and planning perspective, however, key issues of
concern are peak flows and the character of the flows. System components
must respond to peak volumes, and monitoring and maintenance activities
4
  At the time of the 2008-10 General Plan update, the sewer master plan was
dated 2005. Areas of peak-load deficiencies were reported at Huntington
Drive/Campus Drive, Huntington Drive/Colorado Place, portions of Sixth Avenue,
on Old Ranch Road south of the Arboretum, and along Baldwin Avenue near
Duarte Road.
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                  Circulation and Infrastructure Element | 4-39

will need to continue to address the sewage qualities associated with, for
example, restaurants.
New development activity within the land use focus areas has the potential
to result in increased sewage flows and peak flows. The Sewer Master Plan
and Hydraulic Modeling Report does not identify any system-wide
deficiencies, and known peak-load deficiencies at particular locations are
remedied through implementation of the City’s Capital Improvement and
Equipment Plan. Through regular updates to the Sewer Master Plan and
Hydraulic Modeling Report, the City will be able to monitor conditions over
time and plan for system enhancements as needed.
Stormwater Management
Stormwater refers to precipitation and irrigation runoff that collects on
                                                                                      Stormwater quality issues

location at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains exposes it to the storm
flows that come down the canyons.
The Rio Hondo watershed, a sub-watershed of the Los Angeles
River watershed, originates in the mountains and encompasses all
of Arcadia. Rain water and snow, along with any debris and
sediment carried by runoff, are conveyed through the watershed by
many natural creeks and concrete flood control channels. To
protect the urban areas below the San Gabriel Mountains from
flooding and debris flows, the Los Angeles County Department of
Public Works has developed an extensive system of control
infrastructure in the foothills and cities below. In Arcadia, five
constructed washes are part of this system (see Figure CI-10):

focused on eliminating identified ponding issues occur consistent with the
Capital Improvement and Equipment Plan.
Long-term implementation of land use policy will focus new development
within Downtown, along Live Oak Avenue, and on the Santa Anita Park
property. Development projects within the identified focus area—and any
new project at any location in Arcadia—will be required to implement any
site-specific drainage improvements needed to minimize and control flows
into the storm drain system, as directed by the City’s Public Works Services
Department.
Waste Management
The City contracts with private waste haulers for refuse pick up and
recycling services citywide, and these franchisers dispose of materials at
local landfills. Single-family residential households are provided with
containers for standard household trash, green waste, and recyclables.
Generally, several commercial waste haulers are contracted to give
businesses and owners of multifamily rental housing a choice of companies
for their refuse and recycling needs. Container size and location is
determined by the building owner/manager in consultation with City staff.
Several local and regional landfills accept household and commercial
waste from the private haulers, although landfill capacity within the Los
Angeles region has been diminishing. In response to State directives for
waste reduction (described below), the City and its contracted haulers
have coordinated efforts to reduce the volume of refuse entering the waste
stream.
Arcadia Reclamation, Inc. still operates an inert materials landfill adjacent
to I-605 in Arcadia. This former quarry site accepts concrete, asphalt,
clean dirt, brick, block, rock, sand, rebar, stucco, and reinforced concrete
pipe, most of which generally can be classified as construction debris.
Once filled, the site can be remediated for reuse and development with
industrial and/or commercial uses consistent with its Commercial/Light
Industrial land use designation.
Reduction, Reuse, and Recycling
Waste reduction, reuse, and recycling programs are essential to reducing
pressures on regional landfills, encouraging consumers and businesses to
be mindful of the environmental consequences of wasteful practices, and
helping the City remain complaint with State laws regarding waste
diversion. In 1989, the California legislature passed AB 939, which requires
that all cities in California divert 50 percent of their trash away from
landfills. Discussion of AB 939 can be found in the Resource Sustainability
Element.
Minimizing the volume of trash that enters landfills conserves resources
and protects the environment from the negative impacts associated with
waste disposal. Reducing landfill waste is also strategy for addressing
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                  Circulation and Infrastructure Element | 4-41

climate change concerns, as wastes in landfills decompose anaerobically
and produce methane, which has a more harmful greenhouse gas effect
than CO2.
Construction and building demolition debris produces large quantities of
solid waste, much of which can be recycled or processed for reuse. One of
the basic principles of “green building,” which is discussed in the Resource
Sustainability Element, is to use recycled and reused materials in new
construction.
The City and the contracted residential waste hauler have implemented             Arcadia residents can
residential programs that help reduce the amount of waste sent to local           purchase discounted

At the facility, burned refuse is converted to energy, with the byproduct

roadways at local landfills. Unlike traditional recycling, processing solid
waste at the Refuse-to-Energy Facility has the ability to count 100 percent
of the multifamily solid waste as diversion.
Two areas that continually need addressing are: 1) increasing recycling
efforts by commercial and industrial businesses and institutions and 2)
strategies to reduce source materials, such as excessive goods packaging
and use of non-recyclable packaging materials. The City can address the
first through its contracts with contracted waste haulers. The second,
however, requires coordinated efforts of consumers and lawmakers.
Household Hazardous Waste and Electronic
Waste
A considerable amount of solid waste is made up of hazardous materials.
Paint, batteries, electronic waste (televisions, computers, cell phones, etc.)    See the Safety Element
cleaning products, motor oil, and household and commercial insecticides           for detailed discussion
and herbicides are all hazardous waste that can pose a health and safety          of hazardous wastes.
hazard if disposed of incorrectly. Disposing of incompatible household
chemicals in the trash can cause hazardous fumes or ignite fires.
The City offers curbside pickup service of household hazardous waste. In
addition, Los Angeles County sponsors a Household Hazardous Waste
program, which educates the public about toxic household waste dangers
and proper disposal, and provides collection events where people can bring
their hazardous waste for disposal. Hazardous waste and materials are
addressed in more detail in the Safety Element.

Electronic waste, or “e-waste”, is a generic term for the consumer electronic
products that people no longer want. E-waste includes computers,
monitors, printers, cell phones, televisions, DVDs, etc. These devices may
contain potentially toxic substances such as lead, copper, and heavy metals
and are treated as hazardous waste. Arcadia supports the reduction of e-
waste by advocating the reuse and recycling of working electronics. To
deal with disposal, the City coordinates with its private solid waste
contractors to provide curbside collection of e-waste at residential homes.     A necessity, a hazard, or

Telecommunications
Effective telecommunications systems in Arcadia allow private business, the
government, institutions, and residents to be productive and connected.
With the rapid evolution of telecommunications technologies, the City finds
its role to be one of facilitation: accommodating installation of the
infrastructure that businesses and people need to be efficient. With
wireless and other technologies widely available at public facilities,
campuses, hotels, and coffee houses, the community will expect to have
access to the latest innovations. Considerations for the City will include
minimizing any aesthetic impact of telecommunications infrastructure and
any impact on public streets (due to construction and access needs),
encouraging co-location of compatible providers and technologies,
providing broadband at the City’s Public Library and other public buildings,
and ensuring that businesses and residents have choices among the
services available.
Overhead Utilities
The proliferation of overhead utility lines and poles has long been cited as
a source of urban visual pollution. Although undergrounding existing
overhead utilities can be complicated and expensive, the City is making
progress toward converting overhead utilities to underground or wireless.
City codes designate certain areas as Underground Utility Districts, where
overhead utilities are strictly prohibited, with certain exceptions such as
temporary power poles and accessory equipment for utility providers.
Undergrounding overhead utilities also occurs in conjunction with major
street improvements. The City will continue to pursue these efforts
consistent with its objectives to enhance community aesthetics and to
address public safety concerns.

Infrastructure Goals and
Policies
Maintaining infrastructure capacity to meet the current and future local
needs will be an ongoing priority. Areas already identified, through
documents such as the City’s Water Master Plan, as needing improvements
must be addressed. Equally important, infill development citywide and
focused growth in Downtown Arcadia, along Live Oak Avenue, and on the
Santa Anita Park property will create new service demands and needs for
enhanced infrastructure.

Introduction
The City is home to a diverse population, a vibrant economy, a regional
shopping mall, and a world-class thoroughbred racetrack. The City has
taken pride in developing a positive climate for economic development and
a business-friendly environment. Our priority is to build a strong and
prosperous local economy that is accessible to local residents and
responsive to local needs, and contains a balance of regional-serving
businesses that attracts additional regional income.
The Land Use and Community Design Element establishes the land use mix
and design objectives that will shape the distribution and appearance of
new development in Arcadia. This Economic Development Element is
intricately tied to the goals and policies of the Land Use and Community
Design Element to maintain and enhance the fiscal health of the local
economy, and to support uses that provide high-quality jobs, generate tax
revenues, and diversify Arcadia’s tax base.

Achieving Our Vision
The City recognizes that land use and other policies must continue to
maintain and encourage a diverse and entrepreneurial local economy to
help the community thrive. Arcadia is a business-friendly city that puts a
priority on a sustainable local economy that responds to local needs and
creates opportunities for regional-serving businesses that attract spending
by consumers throughout the region.
The primary economic development issue Arcadia faces is the maintenance
and enhancement of its tax base. The City provides many public services,
from high-quality recreation and library facilities and programs, to well-
maintained parks and roads, to fully equipped and staffed Fire and Police
Departments. Historically, significant revenues from Santa Anita Park, the
shopping mall, and other long-standing retail establishments have helped
fund local programs. However, economic conditions and business practices
have significantly impacted tax revenue generated from retail businesses,
and racetrack revenues have decreased with changes in off-track betting
laws and a decline in the horse racing industry generally.
The prosperity and diversity of businesses in Arcadia is paramount. The
City will focus retention and expansion efforts on businesses that aid the
City through the provision of high-quality jobs and tax revenue benefits.
The following Guiding Principles demonstrate Arcadia’s commitment to a
diversified local economy that will continue to fund the services and
programs that Arcadian’s appreciate.
        Balanced Growth and Development
         The General Plan establishes a balance and mix of land uses that
         promote economic growth and maintain a high quality of life for
         Arcadia residents. Our development decisions reflect Smart
         Growth principles and strategies that move us toward enhanced
         mobility, more efficient use of resources and infrastructure, and
         healthier lifestyles.
        City Services
         The high quality services the City provides are a source of civic
         pride and bring us together as a community. We adjust service
         needs in response to demographic changes, and we take actions to
         provide funding to support these services.
        Economic Health
         A healthy economy requires a diversified employment and fiscal
         base. Our priority is to create a resilient and thriving local economy,
         accessible to local residents and responsive to local needs, with a
         balance of regional-serving businesses that attract additional
         regional income. We are business friendly.

Scope of this Element
The Economic Development Element is an optional element. However,
Arcadia, like many cities in California, recognizes that long-range planning
must include an economic component to further articulate how land use
policy will work to build and sustain the local economy. This element sets
policy direction focused on:
       Reinvigorating and reinventing the Downtown area, including the
        area near the planned Gold Line light rail station to create new
        opportunities for businesses and residential development
       Enhancing the Baldwin Avenue and Live Oak Avenue corridors
       Allowing for complementary new uses on the Santa Anita Park
        property that provide community benefit
       Maintaining sites for industrial businesses
       Supporting commercial uses that attract regional visitors and
        spending, and that embrace diverse cultures and business interests
       Encouraging medical-related uses that complement the services of
        Methodist Hospital
       Using redevelopment activities and resources to help achieve the
        City’s economic development objectives and support small
        businesses.

Local Conditions
Arcadia occupies a strong economic position within its market area
(defined as a three- to five-mile area surrounding the City), and the
residential population has the following characteristics which are attractive
to retailers and businesses looking for quality workers:
        High per capita and household income levels, with a significant
         share of households earning over $100,000 annually
        High education levels, with over 40 percent of residents having a
         college degree or higher
The largest employer in Arcadia is the service industry, such as personal
services, health services, and education services. The service sector
accounts for over 50 percent of jobs in Arcadia, with the two largest
employers being health and business services.
Retail
With regard to the retail sector, the presence of a large, attractive regional
mall with a mix of moderate to high-end retailers, restaurants, and
entertainment businesses has allowed Arcadia to benefit from consumer
spending even during rough economic times. Major retail sectors report
very high per capita sales and a significant retail surplus (sales in excess of
what the local population would be expected to generate). Brokers identify
a relatively healthy retail base in Arcadia into the future, given the very
positive reputation of local shopping destinations.
Retail market sectors that are not well represented in Arcadia include
building materials and home furnishings and appliances, due largely to the
fact that major players have already established themselves in nearby
communities. Additionally, Arcadia lacks large sites suitable for large-scale
retailers, with the exception of the former quarry site on Lower Azusa Road
(designated Commercial/Light Industrial).
Office
Historically, Arcadia has not been a strong location for professional offices.
Spaces typically have served smaller, more localized users, and businesses
seeking Class A-type space have found suitable buildings in Pasadena and
Glendale. Demand projections for office space indicate potential support
for a moderate amount of office space through 2025. Arcadia’s
disadvantage is that rents are marginal for new construction, particularly
Class A office space. However, growth in the healthcare industry and
development incentives provided by the Downtown Overlay (1.0 FAR) are
seen as avenues for strengthening the local office market over the long
term. Specifically, the strength of Methodist Hospital and the concentration
of health services in the City of Arcadia provide market support for medical
office uses.
3-4 | Economic Development                                       Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

Industrial
Land prices, population densities, and the cost of doing business have
pushed traditional industrial development out of the San Gabriel Valley,
with much of it relocating to the Inland Empire. As a result, industrial sites
in the Valley have converted to other uses. Despite this trend, Arcadia does
retain a successful industrial business area off of Peck Road between Clark
Street and Randolph Street. Additionally, industrial jobs represent good
employment for skilled local workers, and quasi-industrial uses support
local needs. Arcadia will continue to respond by applying the Industrial
and Commercial/Light Industrial designation on properties that are well
located for these purposes near I-605, and retaining pockets of industrial
land to support uses such as auto repair and small manufacturing
operations.
Economic Development
Strategies
The Land Use and Community Design Element defines focus areas where
the City will concentrate efforts to effect positive change, including
economic development activity for long-term community benefit. Particular
economic development initiatives and policies to be pursued are described
below.
Santa Anita Park
A major component of Arcadia’s commercial activity has been visitor-
serving uses surrounding the Santa Anita Park horse racing venue. The
restaurants, service stations, and retail shops that were positioned to serve
the needs of race track patrons have felt the effects of lower attendance at
Santa Anita Park due to diminished public interest in horse racing and an
increase in off-track betting. Reduced patronage at Santa Anita Park has
decreased the City’s share of race track revenues, resulting in a substantial
decrease in General Fund resources. In the early 2000s, the race track
owner began to explore new sources of property revenue, with a focus on
developing the track’s vast parking lots with commercial uses.
While the City remains fully committed to supporting horse racing at Santa
Anita Park, the property is too valuable to Arcadia not to address the
possibility of some alternative future use—for a portion or all of the
property—should horse racing not prove viable. As discussed in the Land
Use and Community Development Element, any future use on any part of
the race track property must represent unique, quality, highly visible, and
income-generating uses that respond to the performance criteria set forth
in the Land Use and Community Design Element.

Diversified Commercial and
Industrial Base
The City recognizes the importance of a diverse local economy that can
sustain the rise and fall of economic cycles and trends. As of 2010, Santa
Anita Park and taxes generated from sales at the Santa Anita shopping
mall and a major auto dealership represented the largest tax revenue
sources for Arcadia. The shopping center expansion in 2009 added an
outdoor promenade, and the City supports the center owner’s initiatives to
keep the facility modern and responsive to shifting consumer needs.
Similarly, auto dealerships are welcome economic partners. However, over-
reliance on businesses which are highly susceptible to consumer spending
patterns could compromise the City’s ability to stabilize revenue sources.
For example, during the 2007-2010 economic recession, which deeply
affected consumer spending, Arcadia had to substantially cut discretionary
spending and freeze hiring to balance its budget.
To diversify revenue sources and the tax base, City actions will include
allowing complementary commercial and other revenue-generating uses on
portions of the race track property, encouraging new businesses along
commercial corridors and in Downtown, and encouraging establishment of
businesses symbiotic to Methodist Hospital. Medical supply sales could be
one business area that the City can target for outreach.
One of the biggest potential revenue sources is new development on the
Lower Azusa Road reclamation property. The City will carefully evaluate
land use proposals to achieve revenue and jobs-generation goals. For
example, warehousing alone is not a desirable use. The site, or portions of
it, could be an ideal location for a unique regional-serving commercial retail
center or a mix of uses that includes productive light industrial enterprises.
Unique Districts
In addition to the regional shopping center, Arcadia has
unique and distinct commercial districts in Downtown,
along First Avenue, and along the Baldwin Avenue
corridor between Huntington Drive and Duarte Road. The
City’s overall economic development strategy includes
continuing to promote and encourage the different
functions these districts serve. Downtown, as described in
the Land Use and Community Design Element, combines
a transit-oriented mix of uses around the Gold Line
Station, with small-scale shops and restaurants fronting
Huntington Drive and offices and smaller commercial
establishments encouraged north of Santa Clare Avenue.
First Avenue will continue to provide places for neighborhood-oriented
goods, dining, and services establishments, with an emphasis on a
pedestrian orientation.
3-6 | Economic Development                                        Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

Baldwin Avenue shops and restaurants attract people from throughout the
region seeking Asian specialty goods and dining experiences. This focus
responds to a desired and desirable niche, and the City supports the
clustering of businesses that satisfy this market demand.
Redevelopment
While most areas in Arcadia function well physically and financially, some
areas need an extra push to spur economic growth and revitalization.
Redevelopment is a tool that is used in Arcadia and many cities in
California to spur economic activity and investment in urbanized areas that
have experienced economic decline. Because of economic incentives,
redevelopment is one of the most effective and sometimes the only way to
reinvigorate older neighborhoods and districts. Figure ED-1 shows the
redevelopment project area boundary for Arcadia’s Central
Redevelopment Project Area.

examples of blight. Economic blight can be characterized by vacant
buildings or land, high tenant turnover rates, residential overcrowding, or
the inability to attract or retain businesses in a particular area.
The Arcadia Redevelopment Agency was established in 1968, and its sole
project area, the Downtown Arcadia Central Redevelopment project area,
was adopted in 1973. The Agency uses a process called tax increment
financing to carry out its goals. When an area is designated as a
redevelopment area by the City Council, the property within the
boundaries of the project area has a certain total property tax value. If this
total assessed valuation increases due to redevelopment effort, most of the
taxes that are derived from the increase go to the Redevelopment Agency.
These "tax increments" can be used only in the same redevelopment project
area where they were generated, except for residential projects that
benefit low-and moderate income households.
The Central Redevelopment Plan terminates in 2017 and has a debt limit of
$200 million. Redevelopment law allows agencies that have bonded debt
(outstanding bond issues) to continue to collect tax increment for 10 years
after the expiration of the project to pay off that debt. As a result, the City
can collect tax increment in the Central Redevelopment Project Area until
January 25, 2027. The Agency’s eminent domain power is limited to non-
residential properties. The power of eminent domain within the project
area for private to private projects was eliminated through the voter
approved Measure B, which passed in 2007.
Since 1974 the Agency has assisted in the development of six hotels, 19
office buildings, four restaurants, two retail buildings, and 60 units of
affordable housing. Almost the entire east end of the project area (east of
the railroad tracks to Fifth Avenue, I-210 to the railroad tracks) has been
redeveloped with Agency assistance. Huntington Drive from Fifth Avenue
to Santa Clara Street and First Avenue from Wheeler Avenue to California
Street have been reconstructed and revitalized with new landscaping,
signage, street furniture, lighting, and water system and roadway
improvements, including the facades of 28 buildings. Seven private
hazardous waste sites were cleaned up with Agency financial assistance. A
54-unit 100 percent affordable senior housing project opened in
September, 2004 on Live Oak Avenue, and a six-unit affordable housing
unit ownership project was approved on Alta Street in 2008. The Agency
invested $1.8 million in the Heritage Park project and $1.2 million in the Alta
Street project.
Property tax increment increased from $300,000 in fiscal year 1975 to
$4,331,000 in fiscal year 2008-2009. Hotels in the City produced over
$2.37 million in transit occupancy taxes to the City in 2008-2009. Since
the first hotel opened in 1983, collectively the City has received almost $23
million from the six Agency-assisted hotels. The Agency built and donated
to the City the $3 million Public Works Service Center at 11800 Goldring
Road. It contributed $4 million to the new Police facility, $100,000 to the
Gilb Historical Museum, resurfaced four City parking lots, and contributed
$800,000 to the new Fire Headquarters building that opened in 2008.
The Agency worked with Rusnak Mercedes Benz to facilitate its expansion,

purchasing and rehabilitating two adjacent properties. Many of the traffic
signals in Downtown have been improved with redevelopment funds. New
sidewalks were installed on Colorado Place, and safety lights were installed
under the Huntington Drive Bridge at Second Avenue. Over 1,400 new full-
time and 2,000 part-time jobs have been created because of Agency-
assisted projects. The image and reputation of both the City and of the
Downtown Project Area have been significantly improved.
The City is interested in extending the project area and establishing new
monies for this important economic development tool. As a result, the City
will continue to monitor the bond market to assess opportunities to re-issue
bonds.
The Economic Development Division coordinates and administers incentive
programs and services for the business community. In particular, the
Redevelopment Division provides funding and technical assistance through
a façade improvement program, small business assistance, and general
property maintenance. The City also works with the Arcadia Chamber of
Commerce to actively promote business opportunities and events within
the City.
Goals and Policies
The City of Arcadia has taken pride in developing a positive climate for
economic development, and establishes the following goals and policies to
promote vitality, retain existing business, and attract new businesses. The
City of Arcadia has implemented programs and guidelines designed not
only to make Arcadia better place to live, but also a better place to do
business.
Goal ED-1:                   A mix of land uses and development incentives
                             that work to retain existing business and
                             attract new enterprises that generate tax
                             revenues and high-quality jobs
     Policy ED-1.1:          Work to maintain horse racing as a viable
                             business on the Santa Anita Park property.
                             However, should the property owner look to
                             transition all or a portion of the property to non-
                             racing uses, require the owner/developer to
                             demonstrate, through verifiable economic
                             analysis, that any new, alternative use or uses
                             generate jobs and tax revenues consistent with
                             City objectives for economic growth and
                             diversification.
     Policy ED-1.2:          Support a continued strong presence of
                             automobile dealerships as part of the local

                       businesses as sales tax generators.
    Policy ED-1.3:     Explore the attraction of new retail sectors,
                       such as medical supply, home furnishings and

                       that generates jobs and revenues. Discourage
                       uses at this location, such as stand-alone
                       warehousing and logistics, that provide limited
                       fiscal benefit.

                       businesses and to retain firms needing

    Policy ED-1.9:     Tailor regulations to respond to market
                       changes, maximize revenue, and maintain the

    Policy ED-1.10:    Develop and implement effective business
                       retention and business attraction programs

                         users, particularly in those retail sectors for
                         which the City is underserved and currently
                         experiencing leakage of sales tax dollars, and

Housing Element
A r c a d i a                 G e n e r a l                  P l a n
Introduction
During the 1990s to today, Arcadia has experienced a continuing shift in
the age structure and household composition of its population. Specifically,
the 2000 Census reported an increased proportion of families with young
children in the community. Arcadia’s quality neighborhoods, excellent
public services, and high-ranking public school system continue to attract
new residents and families, resulting in upward pressure on the housing
market. Even in the midst of a nationwide downturn of the housing market,
home prices in Arcadia have experienced smaller decreases compared to
neighboring communities or other communities in Los Angeles County.
Arcadia residents value the family-oriented character of their community
and take pride in the quality of its residential neighborhoods. This Housing
Element reflects this guiding principle and includes goals, policies, and
programs that work to preserve the integrity of existing neighborhoods.
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                                         Housing Element | 5-1

Because Arcadia largely is a built-out suburban community, new residential
construction has been accommodated primarily through the redevelopment
of infill properties and the recycling of existing lower-intensity housing to
medium- to higher-intensity uses. This trend is anticipated to continue. For
example, with the extension of Gold Line light rail service into the City’s
Downtown, Arcadia sees an excellent opportunity to encourage transit-
oriented development around the Gold Line station. Through the General
Plan, the City promotes smart growth principles by encouraging higher-
intensity mixed-use developments in Downtown, along First Avenue, and
along Live Oak Avenue as a means of providing housing opportunities and
encouraging walking and use of public transit (thereby reducing vehicle
trips).
Consistent with long-established City practices of promoting high-quality
housing, this Element also accommodates continued development of single-
family homes in neighborhoods that traditionally have had very large lots,
remnants of prior days when horse-keeping and small-scale agricultural
activities were permitted. Trends indicate that small-scale lot consolidation
and resubdivision will continue to provide new sites for single-family homes.
This Housing Element is an integral component of the General Plan; it
builds upon other elements and is consistent with the vision and guiding
principles that shape the General Plan goals and policies. As the General
Plan is updated over time, the City will ensure consistency among General
Plan elements so policies introduced in one element are consistent with
other elements.
The Housing Element consists of three components:
         The Housing Element itself, which sets forth the City’s housing goals
          and policies to address identified housing needs
         The General Plan Implementation Plan, which identifies specific
          programs to be pursued to achieve Housing Element goals and
          policies
         The Housing Element Technical Background Report, which includes
          the following:
              •    A summary of the community outreach efforts undertaken
                   that focused on issues relating to residential land uses and
                   housing needs
              •    The City’s demographic profile, housing characteristics, and
                   existing and future housing needs
              •    A review of potential market, governmental, and
                   environmental constraints to meeting the City’s identified
                   housing needs
              •    An evaluation of the land and financial resources available
                   to address the City’s identified housing needs
              •    A review of past accomplishments under the previously
                   adopted Housing Element

Achieving Our Vision
Development of the 2008-2014 Housing Element was guided by the
following principles:
       Balanced Growth and Development
        The General Plan establishes a balance and mix of land uses that
        promote economic growth and maintain a high quality of life for
        Arcadia residents. Our development decisions reflect Smart
        Growth principles and strategies that move us toward enhanced
        mobility, more efficient use of resources and infrastructure, and
        healthier lifestyles.
       Neighborhood Character
        Arcadia’s single-family and multifamily residential neighborhoods
        have given the City its identify as a “Community of Homes.” The
        City protects and preserves the character and quality of its
        neighborhoods by requiring harmonious design, careful planning,
        and the integration of sustainable principles.
       Changing Housing Needs
        The City encourages the retention, rehabilitation, and development
        of diverse housing that meets the people’s needs in all stages of
        their lives.

Planning Framework for
Housing
The California Legislature has indicated that a primary housing goal for
the State is ensuring every resident has a decent home and suitable living
environment. Recognizing the important role of local planning in the
pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all jurisdictions in
the State prepare a Housing Element as part of the comprehensive
General Plan. Section 65302 of the Government Code sets forth the
specific components to be included in the Housing Element. State law
further requires that the Housing Element be updated periodically to
reflect a community’s changing housing needs. The Arcadia Housing
Element was last updated in 2001. This Housing Element covers the
planning period of July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2014.
Section 65580 of the California Government Codes describes the State’s
housing goals as follows:
        The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the
         early attainment of decent housing and a suitable living
         environment for every Californian, including farm workers, is a
         priority of the highest order.
        The early attainment of this goal requires cooperative participation
         of government and the private sector in an effort to expand
         housing opportunities and accommodate the housing needs of
         Californians of all economic levels.
        The provision of housing affordable to low and moderate income
         households requires the cooperation of all levels of the government.
        Local and state governments have a responsibility to use the
         powers vested in them to facilitate the improvement and
         development of housing to make adequate provision for housing
         needs of all economic segments of the community.
        The Legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility,
         each local government also has the responsibility to consider
         economic, environmental, and fiscal factors and community goals
         set forth in the general plan and to cooperate with other local
         governments and the state in addressing regional housing needs.
Section 65581 of California Government Code reflects the Legislative
intent for mandating that each city and county prepare a Housing Element:
        Assure that counties and cities recognize their responsibilities in
         contributing to the attainment of the state housing goal
5-4 | Housing Element                                            Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

         Assure that counties and cities will prepare and implement housing
          elements, which along with federal and state programs, will move
          toward attainment of the state housing goals
         Recognize that each locality is best capable of determining what
          efforts are required by it to contribute to the attainment of the
          state housing goal, provided such a determination is compatible
          with the state housing goal and regional housing needs
         Ensure that each local government cooperates with other local
          governments in order to address regional housing needs
Role of the Housing Element
State law requires Housing Elements to be updated on a regular basis to
reflect a community’s changing housing needs.1 This Housing Element is a
six-year plan covering 2008-2014, unlike other General Plan elements,
which typically cover a ten-year or longer planning horizon. This Housing
Element identifies goals, policies, and programs that work toward:
         Providing adequate housing sites to achieve a variety of housing
         Preserving and improving housing and neighborhoods
         Assisting in the provision of affordable housing
         Removing governmental constraints to housing developments
         Promoting fair and equal housing opportunities
Housing and Household
Conditions
The Housing Element Technical Background Report details the
demographic conditions and housing needs in Arcadia, addressing the
issues required by Housing Element law. Highlighted here are the key
issues.
Existing Housing Stock
Housing and neighborhood conservation are important to maintaining and
improving quality of life. Commonly, housing over 30 years of age needs
some form of major rehabilitation, such as a new roof, foundation work,
plumbing, etc. Approximately 48 percent of the housing units in Arcadia
were built prior to 1960, making many of these close to or over 50 years
old today (Table H-1). However, because overall household incomes are
higher than the County median, local homeowners invest in housing
maintenance. Therefore, the age of homes in Arcadia does not necessarily
equate to extensive rehabilitation needs.
1
  The Housing Element is expected to be updated again by July 1, 2014 for the planning
period of 2014-2022. Per SB 375, the planning period for Housing Elements for subsequent
cycles will be eight years to better coordinate with regional planning efforts.

As of July 2009, Code Enforcement staff indicated that there were only
five substandard housing units (in need of rehabilitation or removal) in
Arcadia. Even with the depressed national and regional housing markets
of the 2007-2009 recession, during which deferred maintenance has been
prevalent and many homeowners have abandoned their homes, few
housing units in the City are considered substandard.

Despite the absence of substandard housing, the age of the housing stock
alone indicates a potentially significant need for continued code
enforcement, property maintenance, and housing rehabilitation programs
to prevent housing deterioration. Efforts to improve and revitalize housing
must address existing conditions, but also focus on encouraging preventive
efforts to ensure that housing stock quality is maintained.
Types of Housing
A housing stock that consists of varied housing types, from single-family
homes on large lots to townhomes to apartments, provide households of all
income levels, ages, and sizes the opportunity to find housing suited to their
needs. Table H-2 summarizes the housing mix in 1990, 2000, and 2008.
As shown in Table H-2, the majority of housing units in Arcadia (67 percent
in 2008) are single-family homes, while multifamily housing comprises 33
percent of the housing stock. According to the State Department of
Finance, the City’s housing stock grew by two percent between 2000 and
2008.

Tenure and Vacancy
Tenure refers to the occupancy of a housing unit — whether the unit is
owner occupied or renter occupied. Tenure preferences are primarily
related to household income, composition, and age of the householder. The
tenure distribution (owner versus renter) of a community’s housing stock
influences several aspects of the local housing market. Residential mobility
is influenced by tenure, with ownership housing evidencing a much lower
turnover rate than rental housing. In 2000, about 38 percent of Arcadia
households were renters and 62 percent owned their homes (Table H-3).
 
Housing vacancy rates – the number of vacant units compared to the total
number of units – reveal the housing supply and demand for a city. Some
amount of housing vacancy is normal to allow for people moving from one
place to another. In 2000, the vacancy rate for rental units in Arcadia was
at 2.4 percent and for owner-occupied units 1.8 percent. A limited vacancy
rate increases competition for housing and can result in higher housing
costs, reducing housing opportunities for lower-income households.
According to the California Department of Finance, the overall vacancy
rate of Arcadia in 2008 was 4.1 percent. The overall vacancy rate in Los
Angeles County in 2008 was projected at very similar 4.2 percent. The
2008 overall vacancy rates for surrounding cities were projected as
follows: Pasadena 4.23 percent, Monrovia 3.26 percent, Alhambra 3.19
percent, Temple City 2.88 percent, and Sierra Madre 3.38 percent.

Median Home Prices
In April 2009, the median price of all homes sold in Arcadia was $689,091
(Table H-4). This was eight percent lower than the median sale price in
April 2008, revealing a small decrease in home prices compared to an
almost 32 percent decrease in Los Angeles County as a whole over that
same one-year period. Overall, the median home price in Los Angeles
County is much lower than in Arcadia, at $300,000 in April 2009.
During the sub-prime mortgage meltdown and economic recession that
began in late 2007, Arcadia’s home prices have remained relatively high.

Overpayment for Housing
State and federal standards specify that households spending more than
30 percent of gross annual income on housing experience a housing cost
burden (also known as housing overpayment). Housing cost burdens occur
when housing costs increase faster than household income. When a
household spends more than 30 percent of its income on housing costs, it
has less disposable income for other necessities, including health care,
food, and clothing. As can be intuited, the cost burden decreases as overall
income increases.

In Arcadia, 35 percent of renters and 31 percent of owners experience
housing cost burden (as reported by the federal Department of Housing
and Urban Development). The most cost-burdened groups, according to
2004 HUD data, are large families and the elderly.
Overall Housing Needs
Several factors influence the degree of demand, or "need," for housing in
Arcadia. The four major need categories considered in this element are:
       Housing needs resulting from population growth, both in the City
        and the surrounding region
       Housing needs resulting from the overcrowding of units
       Housing needs that result when households pay more than they can
        afford for housing
       Housing needs of "special needs groups" such as elderly, large
        families, female-headed households, households with a disabled
        person, farm workers, and the homeless
Comprehensive Housing Affordability (CHAS) data developed by the
Census for HUD (year 2000, the most up-to-date information available)
provides detailed information on housing needs by income level for
different types of households in Arcadia. The CHAS defines housing
problems to include:
       Units with physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom)
       Overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one person
        per room)
       Housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 30 percent of
        gross income
       Severe housing cost burden, including utilities, exceeding 50
        percent of gross income

In general, renter households had a higher level of housing problems (46
percent) compared to owner households (36 percent). Among the 1,215
elderly renter households in the City, 76 percent were lower-income
households, with 50 percent of all elderly renter-households experiencing
one or more housing problems. Large renter families constituted only 679
of all households in 2000, but most (72 percent) experienced one or more
housing problems, the highest rate among all other groups.
Projected Housing Needs per the RHNA
State Housing Element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommodate
a share of the region’s projected housing needs for the planning period.
This share, called the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), is
important because State law mandates that jurisdictions provide sufficient
land to accommodate a variety of housing opportunities for all economic
segments of the community. Compliance with this requirement is measured
by the jurisdiction’s ability to provide adequate land to accommodate the
RHNA. The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), as
the regional planning agency, is responsible for allocating the RHNA to
individual jurisdictions within the region.
The RHNA is distributed by income category. For the 2008-2014 Housing
Element update, the City of Arcadia is allocated a RHNA of 2,149 units as
follows:

The City must ensure the availability of residential sites at adequate
densities and appropriate development standards to accommodate these
units.
State law requires that the City also project the housing needs of extremely
low-income households. One acceptable approach is to assume 50
percent of the very low-income households as extremely low income.
Therefore, from the very low-income household need of 549 units, the City
has a projected need of 274 units for extremely low-income households.
The RHNA for the 2008-2014 Housing Element cycle in the SCAG region
used January 1, 2006 as the baseline for projecting housing needs. As
such, housing units constructed, issued building permits, or approved since
January 1, 2006 can be credited toward the RHNA.
Between January 1, 2006 and October, 2009, the City issued building
permits for a total of 422 units, including 253 single-family units and 169
multifamily units. Included in the new multifamily units is a 76-unit senior
housing project. Specifically, the City utilized Redevelopment Housing Set-
Aside funds to assist in the development of six affordable ownership
housing for moderate-income households. These six units are deed
restricted as affordable housing for 45 years, with resale provisions as
required under California Redevelopment Law.                (The Agency has
purchased another property for affordable housing production. This second
site is included in the detailed sites inventory in the Technical Background
Report.) With these units, the City has a remaining RHNA of 1,727 units as
follow:
         549 very low income
         340 low income
         362 moderate income
         476 above moderate income
In the Land Use and Community Design Element, policies provide
opportunities for future residential development through the following land
use strategies:
          Increased maximum density in the High Density Residential
          category (R-3 zone) from 24 units per acre to 30 units per acre.
          This strategy enhances the feasibility of multifamily development.
         Allowing a density of up to 30 units per acre in the Mixed Use area
          along First Avenue, along with commercial development at an FAR
          of 1.0.
         Creation of a Downtown Mixed Use designation that allows a
          residential density of 50 units per acre, along with commercial
          development at an FAR of 1.0, to capitalize on the planned Gold
          Line station in Downtown Arcadia.

       Designating areas along Live Oak Avenue for Mixed Use
        development, allowing a density of up to 30 units per acre, along
        with commercial development at an FAR of 1.0.

parcels included in the sites inventory, maps identifying the vacant and
underutilized parcels, and photographs illustrating 2009 conditions in the
areas.

Involving the Community
in Planning
The City of Arcadia encourages and values community input. Preparation
of the 2008-2014 Housing Element was an integral component of the
General Plan update process. As part of the General Plan, the City
undertook an extensive public participation program. Outreach efforts
that directly influenced the goals and policies in this Housing Element are
described below.
General Plan Advisory
Committee
The General Plan Advisory Committee (GPAC) included 13 people
representing various City Commissions, major stakeholder groups, and the
general public. This group provided assistance and made recommendations
to the Planning Commission and City Council regarding the General Plan
Update and critically, developed the Guiding Principles that are integral to
the Plan. The Planning Commission has the legal responsibility for
reviewing the General Plan and making a final recommendation to the City
Council regarding the Update. All GPAC meetings were advertised on the
General Plan website.
The Land Use Element, which allocates the land uses throughout the City,
was a result of intensive work by the GPAC to define a physical vision for
the community. The Land Use Element introduces the following new land
use designations that present residential development potential:
       High Density Residential – permits development at a density up to
        30 units per acre
       Mixed Use – permits mixed use development at a density up to 30
        units per acre and an FAR (Floor Area Ratio) of 1.0
       Downtown Mixed Use – permits mixed use development at a density
        up to 50 units per acre and an FAR of 1.0
These land use designations recognize the changing needs of the
community and the opportunity presented with the anticipated extension of
the Gold Line and the station in Downtown Arcadia.
Public Workshops
Throughout the General Plan process, the City staff conducted community
workshops and a downtown land use workshop to hear about the types of
future land uses Arcadia residents would like to see, where they should
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                                         Housing Element | 5-13

occur, and the reasons why they think these land uses would be beneficial
to their City.
Community Workshop
The City held the first General Plan community workshop on Saturday, May
31, 2008, at the Police Department Open House and Safety Fair. The
workshop was advertised in the newspaper and on the General Plan
Website.
The City introduced the General Plan program to Arcadia residents and
gathered input from participants on potential General Plan issues and on
an overall vision for Arcadia’s future. There were six stations:
  
         1.   General Plan Information
         2.   Land Use (Live Oak in year 2025 and downtown and beyond)
         3.   Housing
         4.   Sustainability
         5.   Traffic and Mobility
         6.   Neighborhood ideas
Based on the comments received at the workshop, there was a general
concern regarding increasing density in the City. However, residents felt
that new multifamily residential should be targeted in specific locations
(such as Live Oak Avenue). A Visual Preference Survey was also
conducted; most residents prefer more traditional designs over modern
designs.
Downtown Workshop
A workshop specific to Downtown issues was conducted in October of
2008. Notice was sent to all property owners and business owners of the
Downtown area. The meeting was also advertised in the newspaper and
posted on the General Plan Website. Participants gathered at the Arcadia
Women's Club to discuss and plan the future of the City's Downtown. The
workshop consisted of a slide presentation followed by a moderated public
comment session.
In order to focus discussion of the various issues affecting Downtown, the
staff divided the Downtown into four areas.
  
         1. The future Gold Line Station and surrounding properties
         2. First Avenue and Huntington Drive
         3. Santa Anita Avenue
         4. The Industrial-zoned area
 
Participants of this workshop recognized that this area needs to attract
more people to sustain a viable business environment. Therefore,
introducing residential uses in this area complement the planned Gold Line
Station and support the business market. Mixed use development
(residential above commercial) would be an appropriate form of
development in the Downtown.

Other Public Meetings
In addition, the General Plan consultant team also attended and made
presentations at multiple meetings of community and business groups.
These include the Arcadia Chinese Association, Chamber of Commerce,
and Asian Business Night.
Stakeholder Interviews
An important component of the General Plan Update is to receive input
from important stakeholder groups within the City. As part of this process,
the City interviewed each of the City Council and Planning Commissioners,
and many major stakeholder groups during a five-day process in May and
June of 2008. Stakeholders interviewed represented the following groups:
 
     City Council                         Arcadia        High     School
     Planning Commission                     students
     Arcadia Historical Museum            Faith-based organizations
        Commission                         Arcadia Chinese Association
     Parks        and    Recreation       Arcadia First!
        Commission                         Arcadia Wins!
     Senior Citizens Commission           Chamber of Commerce
     City of Arcadia Library              Real estate and business
        Board of Trustees                     groups
     Healthcare providers                 Historic groups
     Red Cross                            Public service clubs
     Arcadia Unified School               Homeowners associations
        District
     Chinese Booster Club
     PTA representatives from
        various schools
 
The information gathered is crucial in framing the priority issues and
important characteristics of the General Plan process. Key housing
comments received include:
 
     Mansionization remains an issue in Arcadia.
     New multifamily residential development should be located around
        the planned Gold Line Station, along First Avenue where mixed use
        is appropriate, and along Live Oak Avenue.
     Maintaining the character of a “Community of Homes” is crucial to
        residents.
     Senior housing is needed, especially for long-time residents to age
        in place and downsize to homes that require less maintenance.
     Housing opportunities for local public employees (e.g. police,
        firemen, and teachers) are needed.
The Housing Element responds to these concerns by focusing new
multifamily residential development in targeted areas (Downtown Arcadia
and mixed use areas along First Avenue and Live Oak Avenue).

Addressing Public Comments
Overall, the Housing Element balances the various comments received
during the public participation process with mandates of the Housing
Element law. Specifically, the Housing Element works hand-in-hand with
the Land Use Element to facilitate new multifamily residential development
in targeted areas (Downtown Arcadia, and Mixed Use areas along First
Avenue and Live Oak Avenue) in order to accommodate the City’s share of
regional housing needs. The Housing Element also emphasizes the
importance of maintaining the integrity of existing neighborhoods and
improving the quality of housing.

Goals, Policies, and
Programs
Existing Housing Stock
As the existing housing stock in Arcadia is in good condition and provides
housing opportunities for households of all sizes, composition, and income
ranges, one key focus will be on conserving the stock.
Goal H-1:                   Conserve and improve the condition of the
                            existing housing stock.
    Policy H-1.1:           Continue to monitor and enforce building and
                            property maintenance codes in residential
                            neighborhoods to prevent the physical
                            deterioration of existing sound housing within
                            the City.
    Policy H-1.2:           Continue to provide code enforcement services
                            designed to maintain the quality of the housing
                            stock and the neighborhoods.
    Policy H-1.3:           Work with property owners and nonprofit
                            housing providers to preserve existing housing
                            for low- and moderate-income households.
    Policy H-1.4:           Support the preservation and maintenance of
                            historically and architecturally significant
                            buildings and neighborhoods.
    Policy H-1.5:           Preserve the unique environmental aspects of
                            the community, including hillsides, canyons, and
                            other environmental amenities, by allowing only
                            minimal      disruption     and       low-density
                            development.
    Policy H-1.6:           Retain no less than the present number (2009)
                            of assisted housing units of all types, and
                            expand affordable housing opportunities for
                            extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-
                            income households.
    Policy H-1.7:           Support efforts of Homeowners Associations to
                            maintain and improve the quality of the housing
                            stock and neighborhood conditions.

Adequate Sites for Housing
A major challenge in meeting the housing needs of all segments of the
community is the provision of adequate sites for all types, sizes, and prices
of housing. Persons and households of different ages, compositions,
incomes, and lifestyles have a variety of housing needs and preferences
that evolve over time and in response to changing life circumstances.
Providing an adequate supply and diversity of housing accommodates
changing housing needs of residents. The Arcadia General Plan and zoning
regulations establish where housing may be located. To provide adequate
housing and maximize use of limited land resources, new development
should be constructed at appropriate densities that maximize the intended
use of the land.
Although Arcadia is primarily built out, accommodating housing sites is
addressed by a mix of various land use strategies. The City has identified
vacant, underutilized, and mixed use sites that can accommodate housing
(see the Technical Background Report for details). Land use strategies in
this General Plan include:
       Increased maximum density in the High Density Residential
        category (R-3 zone) from 24 units per acre to 30 units per acre.
        This strategy enhances the feasibility of multifamily housing
        construction.
       Allowing a density of up to 30 units per acre in Mixed Use area
        along First Avenue, along with commercial development at an FAR
        of 1.0.
       Creation of the Downtown Mixed Use designation that allows a
        residential density of 50 units per acre, along with commercial
        development at an FAR of 1.0, to capitalize on the planned Gold
        Line station in Downtown Arcadia.
       Designating areas (along Live Oak Avenue) for Mixed Use
        development, allowing a density of up to 30 units per acre, along
        with commercial development at an FAR of 1.0.
Given the City’s built-out character, few vacant properties remain within
the City’s Residential Estate (RE) and Very Low Density Residential (VLDR)
neighborhoods. However, underutilized lots in residential areas can be
used to help accommodate housing sites. Lot sizes in these neighborhoods
vary, with some neighborhoods having predominate lot sizes of 20,000
square feet or larger even though the zoning allows minimum lot sizes of
7,500 square feet. Activity such as subdividing large lots, or even
consolidating multiple lots and re-subdividing, can help increase the supply
of market rate housing units. This type of activity has been prevalent in
Arcadia.
In addition to the new subdivisions, new residential development can occur
through the recycling of lower-intensity residential uses to higher-density
developments in the High Density Residential (HDR) areas.

The detailed sites inventory indicates that adequate sites are available to
accommodate the RHNA for all income categories within the planning
period.
 
Goal H-2:                   Provide        suitable    sites     for    housing
                            development which can accommodate a range
                            of housing by type, size, location, price, and
                            tenure.
    Policy H-2.1:           Provide for a range of residential densities and
                            products, including low-density single-family
                            uses, moderate-density townhomes, higher-
                            density apartments/ condominiums, and units in
                            mixed-use developments.
    Policy H-2.2:           Encourage development of residential uses in
                            strategic proximity to employment, recreational
                            facilities, schools, neighborhood commercial
                            areas, and transportation routes.
    Policy H-2.3:           Encourage compatible residential development
                            in areas with recyclable or underutilized land.
    Policy H-2.4:           Maintain development standards, regulations,
                            and design features that are flexible to provide
                            a variety of housing types and facilitate housing
                            that is appropriate for the neighborhoods in
                            which they are located.
    Policy H-2.5:           Promote commercial/residential mixed use
                            developments in Downtown Arcadia and along
                            First Avenue and Live Oak Avenue.
    Policy H-2.6:           Require that the density or intensity, as well as
                            design of new developments, be compatible
                            with adjacent neighborhoods.
Addressing All Economic
Segments of the Community
Providing affordable housing is essential for a healthy and balanced
community. In addition to a diverse mix of housing types, it is necessary to
make housing available for residents of all income levels to accommodate
residents at different stages of life, including but not limited to young single
professionals, young families, mature families with expanding household
size (such as children and grandparents), and seniors. Decent and
affordable housing is needed not only for lower- and moderate-income
households, but also middle-income households that form the foundation of
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                                             Housing Element | 5-19

the City’s workforce. Seeking funding from varied sources increases the
opportunities for development of affordable housing units. The City will
continue to work with both non-profit and for-profit developers in the
production of affordable for-sale and rental housing.
Goal H-3:                    Assist in the provision of housing that meets

    Policy H-3.2:            Work with non-profit and for-profit developers
                             to maximize resources available for the
                             provision of housing affordable to lower- and
                             moderate-income households.

                             development to conserve natural resources and
                             lower energy costs.
Minimizing Constraints to
Housing Development
Market factors and government regulations can significantly impact the
production and affordability of housing. Pursuant to State law, the City is
obligated to address, and where legally possible, remove governmental
constraints affecting the maintenance, improvement, and development of
housing. Although market conditions are often beyond the direct influence
of any jurisdiction, efforts can be directed at ensuring the reasonableness
of land use controls, development standards, permit-processing, fees and
exactions, and governmental requirements to encourage housing
production. Removing constraints on housing development can help
address housing needs in the City by expediting construction, and lowering
development costs.

                           to housing production and affordability.
    Policy H-4.1:          Periodically review and modify as appropriate
                           residential and mixed use development
                           standards,      regulations,    and     processing
                           procedures that are determined to constrain
                           housing development, particularly housing for
                           lower- and moderate-income households and
                           for persons with special needs.

discrimination, or through the provision of education services, fair housing
services work toward fair and equal access to housing. The following
policies are designed to continue implementation of applicable fair housing
laws.
Goal H-5:                  Continue to promote equal housing
                           opportunity in the City’s housing market
                           regardless of age, race, color, national origin,
                           ancestry, sex, disability, marital status,
                           familial status, source of income, sexual

Introduction
Arcadia’s motto, A Community of Homes, clearly identifies the defining
characteristic of our community. From large estates to post-World War II
subdivisions to attractive condominiums and apartments, Arcadia offers
diverse places to live and enjoy the qualities of this City. The City also has
attractive parks, successful business districts, abundant shopping and
entertainment venues, and a distinguished community aesthetic. This
element focuses on identifying, preserving, and enhancing those physical
aspects of Arcadia that are highly valued by residents and the business
community. The goals and policies set forth the City's vision and
fundamental land use philosophy regarding appropriate types, intensity,
and location of development, and the means for maintaining the
community’s environmental, social, physical, and economic health and
vitality.
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                              Land Use AND Community Design | 2-1

While the Land Use Policy Map defines the two-dimensional distribution of
uses citywide, equally important is the third dimension of character and
form. Quality design of both public places and private properties enhances
the visual image that Arcadia conveys to residents and visitors to the City.
Also, the form design takes can encourage walking and use of transit.
Integrating plazas, paseos, and attractive landscaping into project design
creates places that people enjoy. Thoughtful and considerate design in all
types of development can enhance property values and encourage
maintenance. This element identifies the community design priorities for
Arcadia.
Key goals relative to land use and community design are:
       Creating Identifiable Places
        The General Plan identifies locations where Arcadia residents can
        relax, enjoy the outdoors, stroll, and meet neighbors and socialize.
        These are unique places that create a sense of place, make Arcadia
        more identifiable, and promote a high quality of life.
       Enhancing the Public Realm
        The City has established policies and recommendations on how to
        improve the public realm. The public realm encompasses public
        areas and improvements such as road medians and parkways,
        street trees, public signage, and public art.
       Improving the Private Realm
        Policies and recommendations to enhance the private realm
        complement public realm improvements. The private realm includes
        areas that developers and private property owners are responsible
        for improving through design recommendations which help improve
        Arcadia overall, creating a more aesthetic and visually pleasing
        community.
Achieving Our Vision
The City’s character and amenities make Arcadia a very desirable place to
live. In Arcadia, residents value their safe and well-maintained
neighborhoods, quality housing, superior parks and recreation resources,
an unparalleled educational system, and strong sense of community. The
City is committed to preserving Arcadia as a quiet community of homes
while responding to residents’ desires for a balance of employment,
shopping, entertainment, and recreational opportunities. The Guiding
Principles that highlight this vision are:
       Balanced Growth and Development
        The General Plan establishes a balance and mix of land uses that
        promote economic growth and maintain a high quality of life for
        Arcadia residents. Our development decisions reflect Smart
        Growth principles and strategies that move us toward enhanced
        mobility, more efficient use of resources and infrastructure, and
        healthier lifestyles.

       Neighborhood Character
        Arcadia’s single-family and multifamily residential neighborhoods
        have given the City its identity as a Community of Homes. The City
        protects and preserves the character and quality of its
        neighborhoods by requiring harmonious design, careful planning,
        and the integration of sustainable principles.
       Changing Housing Needs
        The City encourages the retention, rehabilitation, and development
        of diverse housing that meets people’s needs in all stages of their
        lives.
Scope of this Element
State planning law requires that the Land Use Element designate "the
proposed general distribution and general location and extent of the uses
of the land" for a variety of purposes (Government Code Section
65302[a]). Through maps and text, this element defines the distribution
and intensity of development of residential neighborhoods, commercial and
industrial districts, parks and other open spaces, and public or semi-public
uses of property in Arcadia. In particular, the Land Use Plan section
contains the Land Use Policy Map, which presents a pictorial
representation of land use policy. The Land Use and Community Design
Element also identifies study areas throughout the community where
specific policies will be implemented to guide the City toward its land use
(and related) goals.
Development and Environmental
Sustainability
The Land Use and Community Design Element serves as a tool to plan for
the future development of the City of Arcadia, and sets priorities and goals
for development types, locations, and character. Inherent in the City’s
long-range view of development is the concept of sustainability. Planning
for tomorrow’s Arcadia includes understanding that natural resources are
limited and that these natural resources must not be consumed faster than
they can be replenished. But sustainability does not preclude development,
growth, and advancement. Sustainability can promote positive economic
growth and can stimulate technological innovation, advance
competitiveness, and improve our quality of life.
A sustainable future for Arcadia, under this General Plan, includes
strategies to conserve and enhance local resources and safeguard the
environment. The concept of sustainability is used throughout this General
Plan and is expressed in greater detail in the Resource Sustainability
Element. The Land Use and Community Design Element addresses
sustainability and environmental conservation through policies and
programs that promote site and building design elements in new
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                            Land Use and Community Design | 2-3

developments that reduce or better distribute travel demand, development
design and amenities that support transit and other alternative forms of
transportation, including bicycling and walking, and mixed-use
developments that encourage location of employment and commercial
offerings near residential units.
Flood Management
In 2007, the State adopted legislation that strengthened the long-existing
requirement that a General Plan address flood management by specifically
mandating that the Land Use Element identify flood-prone areas mapped
by either the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the State
Department of Water Resources. To prepare and mitigate hazards from
flooding, the City of Arcadia participates in the National Flood Insurance
Program. Flood Insurance Rate Maps, which are prepared by FEMA, map
potential flood zones. The Safety Element addresses this issue in detail.

Land Use
Historic Growth Patterns
The land use patterns in Arcadia today reflect the City’s heritage as a
community of homes. The planning and development approaches that date
to the City’s founding established the arrangement and densities of the
single-family residential neighborhoods we see today, as well as the
concentration of commercial businesses along key corridors and as part of
a large mall. The presence of Santa Anita Park (a world-renowned horse
racing facility) and the Los Angeles County Arboretum (formerly the Lucky
Baldwin estate)—and later Los Angeles County’s Arcadia County Park and
Santa Anita Golf Course—identify Arcadia as a place where open spaces
and public gathering places are integral to all types of development. This
is evidenced in the higher-density housing along Huntington Drive west of
Santa Anita Avenue, where generous setbacks create a grand boulevard.
As Huntington Drive crosses Santa Anita Avenue to the east, the street and
lotting patterns identify the community as one that was also built up along
the railroad, with a very traditional dense street grid and small, walkable
blocks.

                                                                             streets. This neighborhood

  Downtown                              Residential Neighborhood
Arcadia’s identity as a community of homes can be traced back to the
1930s, when the first residential subdivisions began to appear, replacing
what had previously been agricultural lands. The neighborhoods in Arcadia
today have developed over time to fill the majority of the available land in
the City. The northernmost portion of the Baldwin Ranch, which was owned
by Arcadia’s first mayor, Elias Jackson “Lucky” Baldwin, made way for the
first residential subdivisions.
The areas nearest the Baldwin Ranch, comprising today’s Downtown core,
were the first to be settled by those outside the Baldwin family. From this
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                           Land Use and Community Design | 2-5

core, single-family residential subdivisions spread to areas north and west
of the ranch throughout the 1920s and 1930s.
The southern portion of the City was also developing at this time; its
original configuration was a grid of one-acre ranches devoted primarily to
chicken raising and light agricultural uses. During the mid-1950s to the
early 1960s, hillside residential development was most prevalent, with
neighborhoods extending into the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains
along the City’s northern boundaries. With the construction of these
neighborhoods, the bulk of Arcadia’s land had been developed, and from
the 1980s to the present day, large areas of vacant land for any type of
development have not been available.
In 2009, residential development continued to represent the predominant
land use in Arcadia, covering about 68 percent of the City’s land area and
providing 20,3401 homes. Commercial uses account for approximately 11
percent, with the regional mall and areas surrounding Santa Anita Park
significant contributors to this total. As Figure LU-2 shows, Arcadia is
largely built out, with less than one percent of land within the City vacant in
2009.

Moving toward 2035
When Arcadia initiated a comprehensive General Plan update in 2008, a
key concern of residents was that land use policy changes would result in
substantial population growth. This Plan does provide for land use

transitions in targeted areas of the City, but accommodates only modest
population growth. The anticipated growth will result from natural birth           Figure lu-3:
and death rates, new people moving into Arcadia to enjoy the benefits it
                                                                                   examples of
offers, and multigenerational households.
                                                                                   Residential Densities
The City has taken a strategic approach to doing its part to ease regional
housing demand. This includes recognizing the desires of a sizeable older
population to remain in Arcadia, but to do so in smaller homes with very
limited maintenance responsibilities. It also includes responding to a
younger population’s growing interest in more dense, urban-type
development located near transit, restaurants, and entertainment.
With regard to commercial and business uses, Arcadia has long been a
regional hub, with a large mall attracting visitors from throughout the San
Gabriel Valley. Santa Anita Park has for many years been the premier
horse racing track in California, although changes in the horse racing
industry in the last 20 years have caused attendance to decline at venues
throughout the State, and portions of the property now offer opportunities
to further enhance Arcadia’s place as a destination shopping and
entertainment location. This General Plan establishes policy direction to
build upon the commercial base that has allowed Arcadia to thrive, and to
balance that with office, medical, and industrial uses that provide
additional professional and skilled labor jobs.
The subsequent land use discussion in this element provides an overview of
the planned land use patterns and distribution to achieve the vision stated
above, followed by detailed discussion of modest changes planned for the
focus areas identified in Figure LU-7.
Land Use Plan
In response to the community’s desire to maintain Arcadia’s long-
established land use patterns and identity as a community of homes,
preserve the attractiveness of the City’s neighborhoods and districts,
maintain a sound economic base, and enhance the pedestrian environment,
this Land Use Plan has been crafted to guide the development,
maintenance, and improvement of land and properties. The Land Use
Policy Map, illustrated in Figure LU-4, with the designations described in
Table LU-1, will allow the community to preserve those qualities that define
Arcadia.
Understanding Density and Intensity
When describing areas of Arcadia, we differentiate one area from another
by the principal use, such as homes (residential), shops and restaurants
(commercial), manufacturing businesses (business park), a park, or a school.
To describe the level of use, that is, how much development is allowed on a
property (and presumably, what the associated activity level is), land use
planners have developed measures called density and intensity. The term
density, illustrated in Figure LU-3, typically applies to residential uses and
refers to the population and development capacity of residential land.

Density is described in terms of the dwelling units that can be
accommodated on one acre of land (dwelling units per acre or du/ac) and
the population associated with that density (population per acre or
pop/ac).
Development intensity refers to the extent to which a property is or can be
developed. While intensity generally describes nonresidential development         Figure lu-5:
levels, in a broader sense, intensity also can be used to express overall         Floor-Area Ratio
levels of both residential and nonresidential development types. For land
uses in Arcadia, the measure of intensity used is the floor-area ratio. The
floor-area ratio, or FAR, describes the relationship between the total
square feet of development on a lot and the area of that lot. The FAR is
determined by dividing the gross floor area of all buildings on a lot by the
land area of that lot. Figure LU-5 illustrates different FAR calculations; FAR
and factors such as building square footage, building height, and the
percent of lot coverage are all interrelated. For example, a 20,000-
square-foot building on a 40,000-square-foot lot yields a FAR of 0.50:1. A
0.50:1 FAR allows, for example, a single-story building, which covers half
the lot, or a two-story building with reduced lot coverage.
Land Use Designations
The Land Use Policy Map (Figure LU-4) graphically represents the planned
distribution and intensity of land use citywide. The colors shown on the map
correspond to land use designations that describe the types of uses
established and planned in Arcadia. The descriptions on the following
pages establish the General Plan designations and indicate the permitted
nature and intensity of development.
Five residential land use designations allow for a range of housing types
and densities, largely reflective of long-established development
approaches. In addition to the primary permitted residential uses, the City
also permits accessory units and non-residential uses such as schools,
parks, child day care, and religious and charitable organizations, consistent
with State law and as set forth in the Arcadia Municipal Code.
The two commercial land use designations, single industrial designation,
and hybrid Commercial/Light Industrial designation are designed to
support business activity and provide tools to help businesses and districts
maximize their economic potential.
Two designations accommodate commercial and residential mixed-use
development. The mixed-use designations allow combined commercial and
residential developments and stand-alone commercial uses; however,
exclusively residential uses are not permitted in those areas. The
Downtown Mixed Use designation provides for more intense, mixed-used
development surrounding the planned Gold Line Station to create a
complete, compact, walkable neighborhood that encourages transit use.

RE – Residential Estates
The Residential Estates designation accommodates low-
density        single-family        residential        neighborhoods.
Development is typified by large lot, detached single-family
residences on estate-type lots of 22,000 square feet or
larger. Permitted uses include single-family residences on a
single lot and private tennis courts and similar facilities.
Other uses that may be appropriate, consistent with
zoning regulations, include public and private schools,
public parks, and other open space uses.
Unit Density: up to 2 du/ac
Typical Population Density: 3-6 persons per acre2
VLDR – Very Low Density Residential
The Very Low Density Residential designation
accommodates low-density single-family residential
neighborhoods. Development is typified by large lot,
detached single-family residences on lots ranging from
10,000 to 22,000 square feet or larger. Permitted uses
include single-family residences on a single lot and private
tennis courts and similar facilities.
Other uses that may be appropriate, consistent with
zoning regulations, include public and private schools,
public parks, and other open space uses.
Unit Density: up to 4 du/ac
Typical Population Density: 6-12 persons per acre
LDR – Low Density Residential
The Low Density Residential designation accommodates
low-density single-family residential neighborhoods.
Development is typified by detached single-family
residences on lots 7,200 to 10,000 square feet in size.
Permitted uses are limited to single-family residences on a
single lot.
Other uses that may be appropriate, consistent with
zoning regulations, include public and private schools,
public parks, and other open space uses.
Unit Density: up to 6 du/ac
Typical Population Density: 12-17 persons per acre
2
  For land use categories that allow residential development, population density estimates are stated
as required by State General Plan law. Population density has been calculated based on the
development density range and the average persons per household estimate for Arcadia reported by
the California Department of Finance (2.872 persons per household in 2008).

MDR – Medium Density Residential
The       Medium      Density    Residential    designation
accommodates varied housing types and sizes within a
suburban neighborhood context. Permitted residential uses
include detached and attached residences with private
and/or shared yards and open space areas.
Other uses that may be appropriate, consistent with
zoning regulations, include public and private schools,
public parks, and other open space uses.
Unit Density: 6 to 12 du/ac
Typical Population Density: 17-35 persons per acre
HDR – High Density Residential
The High Density Residential designation accommodates
higher-density attached housing types for both renter and
owner households within a neighborhood context. Such
housing types generally are located near transit stops,
along arterials and transit corridors, and within easy
walking distance of shops and services. Appropriate
transition to adjacent lower-density neighborhoods is
required through the use of yards, other open areas, and
building heights.
Other uses that may be appropriate, consistent with
zoning regulations, include public and private schools,
public parks, and other open space uses.
Unit Density: 12 to 30 du/ac
Typical Population Density: 34-86 persons per acre
C – Commercial
The Commercial designation is intended to permit a wide
range of commercial uses which serve both neighborhood
and citywide markets. The designation allows a broad
array of commercial enterprises, including restaurants,
durable goods sales, food stores, lodging, professional
offices, specialty shops, indoor and outdoor recreational
facilities, and entertainment uses.
Adjacent to Downtown, the Commercial designation is
intended to encourage small-scale office and
neighborhood-serving commercial uses that complement
development in the Downtown Mixed Use areas. While the
land use designation provides the general parameters
within which development must take place, the Zoning
Code or other land use regulatory document specifies the
type and intensity of uses that will be permitted in a given
area. In the Downtown area, for example, where properties
are designated Commercial, land use regulations might
specify that restaurants and cafes are permitted, but
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                         Land Use and Community Design | 2-11

secondhand stores are not. The Zoning Code and other
regulatory documents also indicate permitted building
height limits for specific properties.
Maximum FAR – 0.50
(0.30 FAR for Santa Anita Park)
Higher intensity overlays are applied to portions of
Downtown along Santa Anita Avenue, Colorado Place, and
Huntington Drive (1.0 FAR).
Building Height: up to 48 feet in the Downtown area
(including Santa Anita Avenue, Colorado Place, and
Huntington Drive); up to 40 feet for commercial uses
outside of Downtown
RC – Regional Commercial
The Regional Commercial designation applies only to the
regional shopping center located east of Baldwin Avenue
and north of Huntington Drive. The designation provides
for regional commercial centers intended to serve a
regional market and that offer a depth and variety of retail
goods, general merchandise, apparel, entertainment
center, and home furnishings businesses. Development
within the Regional Commercial designation is
characterized by large, multi-tenant centers anchored by
one or more major retailers as key tenants.
Maximum FAR – 0.50 (Based on gross leasable floor area
for regional shopping center)
HR – Horse Racing
The Horse Racing designation provides for the continued
operation of the Santa Anita Park race track for horse
racing and related activities and special events. Permitted
uses include stabling and training of race and show horses,
horse racing, pari-mutuel wagering on horse racing, horse
shows and equestrian events, and special events.
Permitted ancillary uses include seasonal housing for
employees, per Municipal Code standards.
Maximum FAR – N/A

MU - Mixed Use
The Mixed Use designation provides opportunities for
commercial and residential mixed-use development that
takes advantage of easy access to transit and proximity to
employment centers, and that provide complementary
mixes of uses that support and encourage pedestrian
activity. Mixed-use districts support commercial uses that
integrate well with residential activity without creating
conflicts. Development approaches encourage shared use
of parking areas and public open spaces, pedestrian
movement, and interaction of uses within a mixed-use
district. Design approaches should minimize or limit curb
cuts/driveways at the front of the development when rear
or side egress options are available.
Mixed Use requires the inclusion of a ground-floor, street-
frontage commercial component for all projects. Mixed
commercial/office and residential tenancies and stand-
alone commercial or office uses are allowed. However,
exclusively residential buildings are not.
Maximum FAR – 1.0 (only commercial square footage is
counted in calculation of FAR)
Unit Density: 22 -30 du/ac
Typical Population Density: 63-86 persons per acre
Maximum Height: up to 40 feet

DMU – Downtown Mixed Use
The Downtown Mixed Use designation provides
opportunities for complementary service and retail
commercial businesses, professional offices, and
residential uses to locate within the City's downtown.
Downtown Mixed Use requires the inclusion of a ground-
floor, street-frontage commercial component for all
projects. Mixed commercial/office and residential
tenancies and stand-alone commercial or office uses are
allowed. However, exclusively residential buildings are not
allowed. Development approaches encourage shared use
of parking areas and public open spaces, pedestrian travel
ways, and interaction of uses within the district. Particular
features that will define Downtown include public open
space as an integral component of the Gold Line station,
as well as any larger mixed-use or commercial
developments.
Guided by the policies and vision of the General Plan, a
specific plan or subsequent zoning changes for Downtown
will contain detailed development standards, infrastructure
requirements, land use regulations, and implementation
measures for coordinated development.
Maximum FAR: 1.0 (only commercial square footage is
counted in calculation of FAR)
Unit Density: 30-50 du/ac
Typical Population Density: 86-144 persons per acre
Maximum Height: up to 50 feet
C/LI – Commercial/Light Industrial
The Commercial/Light Industrial designation provides
areas for a complementary mix of light manufacturing
businesses, limited auto service and repair, and support
office and retail uses. The designation recognizes the
importance of small-scale industrial and quasi-industrial
businesses for the community in terms of business start-
ups/entrepreneurship, job provision, residents’ access to
needed goods and services, and revenue from point-of-
sales operations.       Such uses are low scale, with
development and operating conditions built into the
development to minimize impact on surrounding uses.
Permitted retail uses are limited to those that support the
industrial businesses. Larger-scale commercial uses will be
considered on a case-by-case basis in the Lower Azusa
Road Reclamation area.
Maximum FAR: 0.50
2-14 | Land Use AND Community Design                          Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

I - Industrial
The Industrial designation provides for an array of
warehouse, distribution, manufacturing, and assembly uses
in appropriate locations.
Maximum FAR: 0.50
P/I – Public/Institutional
The Public/Institutional designation accommodates public,
semi-public, and institutional uses, including but not limited
to offices and facilities used by federal, state, and local
government; special districts; public schools; hospitals;
colleges and universities; and other public agencies and
public utilities.
Maximum FAR: as set forth in zoning regulations
OS-OR – Open Space–Outdoor Recreation
The Open Space–Outdoor Recreation designation
encompasses all City, county, state, and federal parks and
associated facilities, including private facilities on leased
public lands. The designation identifies public lands
intended to be used for active and passive recreational
activities, such as parks, golf courses, trails, and the
Arboretum. Public lands used as detention basins may also
be designated Open Space-Outdoor Recreation when co-
located with active recreational uses or when open spaces
serve two uses, such as a sports field and a detention
basin.
Maximum FAR: N/A
OS-RP – Open Space-Resource Protection
The Open Space–Resource Protection designation applies
to areas which require special management or regulation
because of unusual environmental conditions such as
earthquake fault zones, steep slopes, flood zones, high-risk
fire areas, and areas required for the protection of water
quality. While alternative uses of such constrained areas
may be allowed, the unique character or constraints of the
area must be adequately addressed. This land use
designation may also include sensitive habitat areas,
groundwater recharge basins, hillside areas, and viewshed
management areas.
Maximum FAR: N/A

Community Design
Why do some places feel special and distinct while others are nondescript
and uninspiring? Why do we want to spend hours walking around some
neighborhoods, while others do not captivate us? Historically, great places
have come about by following tradition—people doing things the way that
they have always done them. Over time, people discovered and
incorporated into their traditions the principles of great place-making.
The field of community design studies the places that attract us and
extrapolates core principles that can be used to create new places that
appeal to us in the same way. This section describes how Arcadia
incorporates community design into development decisions for both private
properties and the public realm.
Citywide Design Principles
The following community design principles apply to all of Arcadia:
         Creating Identifiable Places
         Improving the Public Realm
         Improving the Private Realm
Creating Identifiable Places
Community character is defined by the built and natural environments.
Specific attention to urban design can enhance places where people
gather, and create memorable and attractive streetscapes. Components
of citywide urban design include:
Activity Nodes and Areas
Activity Nodes are places of pedestrian activity and excitement. These are
places where people congregate, socialize, and shop. They are also places
where residents can leisurely stroll, participate in a recreational activity, or
relax and experience the outdoors. Examples of activity nodes, identified in
Figure LU-6, include:
         Santa Anita Park
         Downtown Arcadia
         Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanical Garden
         Arcadia County Park
         Regional Shopping Mall

Major Corridors
Major Corridors are boulevards and streets that provide important multi-
modal transportation routes. They are scenic and picturesque, with large,
mature street trees on both sides of the street, with accent plantings and
landscaping. Continuous sidewalks provide pedestrian connections along
the corridor to link activity nodes, neighborhoods, and transit stops.
Some streets include medians, where landscaping and street trees create a

The public realm consists of public property along street rights-of-way and
within medians, as well as public signage and public art. These
enhancements make Arcadia more recognizable to visitors and distinguish
the City from surrounding San Gabriel Valley communities.
Gateways
Gateways announce arrival into a community or district through
such design treatments as public signage, special landscape
treatment, and unified architecture. Streets in Arcadia continue
directly into adjacent communities, and oftentimes travelers do
not know whether they are in Arcadia or Temple City or Monrovia.
To identify Arcadia entrances, gateway treatments can be utilized
where major streets cross municipal boundaries and at freeway
ramps. District gateways should be considered for especially
recognizable districts, most notably Downtown Arcadia. Figure LU-
6 indicates potential locations for gateway statements. A major
gateway exists at the corner of Huntington Drive at Fifth Avenue.
A hierarchy of gateway treatments will be developed that respond
to the significance of the entry point. There are two types of
gateways:
                                                                                        This iconic gateway on

         Primary Gateways. These gateways are the main entryways into                  welcomes visitors to
          the City. These gateways can be found on major corridors.                     Arcadia’s Downtown.
         Secondary Gateways. The gateway treatments for each of these
          entries will differ in response to their context, but will generally be
          smaller in scale and lower in profile than the primary gateways.

A particularly strong statement of arrival includes vertical design elements.
Where the City owns right-of-way to provide such components, it can.
However, private development can also contribute to community gateway
statements with strong corner massing, tower elements, or other
architectural features that create a distinct profile. Additional approaches
include using a combination of special paving, lighting, and/or landscape
treatment to augment the appearance and visual impact at gateways.
Street Trees
Arcadia’s trees are a significant aesthetic and ecological resource. They
are one of the City’s real treasures and a key part of what distinguishes               The Parks,
                                                                                        Recreation, and
Arcadia. There remain, however, many areas of the City with minimal or
                                                                                        Community

                                                                                        Resources Element

Plan will complement the positive effects of this ordinance by starting to fill
in the areas of the City that could still benefit from street trees. Street
trees should be shade trees wherever possible.
  Trees can make commercial areas much more inviting to pedestrians. Contrast the two photos.
Public Signage
A coordinated program of public signage helps identify and make a place
distinct. Public signage should emphasize local history and identity, and be
placed with regard to its surroundings. Distinctive signage should be used
to identify unique districts, neighborhoods, and locations in the City. Public
signs should also be organized, have a uniform appearance, and enhance
the visual environment.
Public Art
Public art can range from the unobtrusive to the monumental. When well
executed and appropriately sited, public art distinguishes a community and
can celebrate different cultures. Large pieces can mark a focal point of a
neighborhood or serve as a landmark for navigation. Small, out-of-the-way
pieces can impart a sense of wonder and discovery. Public art can also
lead to economic benefits, as it can be an attractor to a business area.
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                               Land Use and Community Design | 2-21

  Public art can be decorative and whimsical, and can celebrate culture and heritage.
Improving the Private Realm
The private realm consists of privately owned areas that are generally
visible to the public and that contribute to streetscape conditions. While
properties are privately owned, the City can define its expectations
through zoning regulations and design guidelines. Enhancing these areas
with design treatments works to coordinate private improvements with
public realm investment, thereby creating more aesthetic and attractive
commercial districts and neighborhoods.
Compatibility
No development exists in isolation. Every act of construction affects and is
affected by its surroundings. Every development, therefore, should be
evaluated for its compatibility in terms of use, scale, and aesthetics with the
neighborhood or district in which it is located. For small projects, this area
of influence may be considered to be as small as to only include the
buildings directly next door. For large projects, one must consider entire
blocks or corridors. Where land use or other incompatibilities exist today,
the City can take action to encourage the transition over time to a more
cohesive urban form.

Commercial Signage
Commercial signs have a significant influence on the overall aesthetic
impact of a given street. If signs have enough uniformity and are well
proportioned and appropriate to their context, they can collectively
function much the same way as public art in providing a sense of place and
unique identity. If, on the other hand, signs are ill proportioned, cheap
looking, and an odd mix of styles (monument versus pylon versus wall signs),
they create visual “noise” and clutter that make it difficult to see the
positive qualities of the street and to locate businesses.
Signage within the City’s commercial corridors, with Baldwin Avenue being
a particular example, has tended toward the latter rather than the former.
To address sign clutter, the City developed sign guidelines which are
integrated into the architectural guidelines for commercial and industrial
properties. These guidelines lay out recommendations for everything from
typefaces to materials to sign placement. If followed citywide, these
guidelines will dramatically improve the character of Arcadia’s commercial
corridors over time.

   Policy LU-1.10:       Require that new development projects provide
                         their full fair share of the improvements
                         necessary to mitigate project generated
                         impacts on the circulation and infrastructure
                         systems.
   Policy LU-1.11:       Encourage the development of a range of
                         childcare facilities, including infant care,
                         preschool care, and after-school care, to serve
                         the needs of Arcadia families and workers.
                         Encourage the development of childcare
                         facilities near transit-oriented development. In
                         accordance with the strategic plan adopted by
                         the Los Angeles Child Care Planning
                         Committee, reduce barriers to childcare
                         services due to zoning regulations and
                         expensive permit requirements.
Goal LU-2:               A City with a distinctive and attractive public
                         realm, with pedestrian-friendly amenities in
                         commercial and mixed-use districts and single-
                         family neighborhoods that continue to
                         maintain Arcadia’s standard of architectural
                         and aesthetic quality
   Policy LU-2.1:        Ensure that trees planed in the public right-of-
                         way continue to be well maintained where they
                         exist, are planted in areas where they are
                         currently lacking, and encourage replacement
                         of undesirable tree species in public right-of-
                         ways.
   Policy LU-2.2:        Emphasize the use of public spaces and design
                         that are oriented toward the pedestrian and
                         use of transit throughout the community.
   Policy LU-2.3:        Develop a public art program that encourages
                         and      guides    the     creation,   promotion,
                         implementation, and maintenance of public art
                         throughout the City. Emphasize art that draws
                         upon the local history and is placed at locations
                         accessible to the public.
   Policy LU-2.4:        Establish administrative support and community
                         participation systems for the implementation of
                         a public art program. Develop a dedicated
                         funding source for public art to be paid for as a
                         part of large private and public development
                         projects.

    Policy LU-2.5:           Develop a hierarchy of gateways to mark
                             entrances into the City, as illustrated by Figure
                             LU-6.

                             and industrial properties.
    Policy LU-2.7:           Through a combination of incentives to business
                             owners and enforcement measures, attain
                             compliance with signage standards and
                             guidelines throughout the City, with a priority
                             placed on high-traffic commercial corridors and
                             gateway areas.
Single-Family Residential
Development
Arcadia’s long-established, single-family residential neighborhoods are at
the core of the City’s identity. These stable neighborhoods, many of which
boast block after block of mature trees planted in the public right-of-way,
are what the City means when it refers to itself as a “Community of
Homes.” Protection of these most prized assets of the City is a primary
objective of this General Plan.
In 2006, largely as a response to community concerns over
“mansionization” and tree destruction on single-family properties, the City
adopted Single-Family Residential Design Guidelines. The core issues that
these guidelines address are:
        Mass and scale: Building mass and scale are required to relate to
        established homes in the neighborhood and natural site features.
        Design approaches, particularly for two- and three-story structures,
        should consist of articulated building planes, roof and façade
        offsets, and other techniques that break up building masses.
        Front entry: Building entries and entry features should not
        dominate the front façade. Architectural enhancements must blend
        with the overall home style and not use monumental or large
        vertical components.
        Garages: As street-facing garages tend to be uninviting and have
        the potential to dominate the front elevation of a house, the
        guidelines encourage garages to be set back from the front façade
        or tucked in the back yard.
2-26 | Land Use AND Community Design                              Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

        Architectural style and design: As many new homes built during
        the 1980s and 1990s lacked a coherent architectural style,
        attempted to combine too many different styles, or had a style
        clearly incompatible with surrounding homes, the guidelines
        establish preferred styles and stress the importance of maintaining
        a consistent style in a single structure or group of structures.
        Additions and accessory buildings: Additions, as opposed to new
        homes, have their own set of design challenges. The City requires
        additions to blend with the original structure as outlined in the
        guidelines.
        Colors and materials: Regulating color is tricky, but the City
        recognizes that the use of bright or strong paint colors and/or
        unnatural building materials can result in a house that looks out of
        place in a more traditional neighborhood setting.
        Landform and tree preservation: Careless removal of mature
        trees and severe grading of hillside properties show little regard for
        a site’s natural attributes. The guidelines emphasize working with
        environmental conditions on a site rather than against them.
In addition to application of the City’s guidelines, five homeowners
associations in Arcadia enforce private, neighborhood-specific design
standards through adopted covenants, conditions, and restrictions
(CC&Rs). These associations have played an important role in preserving
the character of the residential neighborhoods in the northern portion of
the City.
Arcadia’s five homeowners associations are (as of 2010):
       Highland Homeowners Association
       Rancho Santa Anita Property Owner’s Association
       Santa Anita Oaks Association
       Rancho Santa Anita Residents Association
       Santa Anita Village Association

                             character-defining features. Such features
                             include but are not limited to tree-lined streets,
                             building      orientation,     sidewalks,     and
                             architectural scale and quality.

                             conditions in a neighborhood.
    Policy LU-3.3:           Encourage a variety of architectural styles for
                             new and renovated structures that reflect local
                             architectural characteristics.
    Policy LU-3.4:           Strengthen neighborhood identity with new
                             development that is compatible with
                             surrounding structures through scale, massing,
                             and preferred architectural style.
    Policy LU-3.5:           Require that new construction, additions,
                             renovations, and infill developments be sensitive
                             to neighborhood context, building forms, scale,
                             and colors.
    Policy LU-3.6:           Encourage preservation of the natural
                             topography of a site and existing mature trees.
    Policy LU-3.7:           Ensure that the design and scale of new and
                             remodeled single-family residential buildings
                             are appropriate to their context.
Multifamily Residential
Development
The City has a goal of improving the quality of the community’s multifamily
                                                                               Policies specific to
developments. Multifamily residential developments should exhibit quality
                                                                               housing issues can be

their neighborhood. Multifamily residential developments need to respect
the scale and character of adjacent residential neighborhoods through
attention to views, building scale and orientation, proximity to adjacent
uses, location of driveways, noise and lighting mitigation, and landscape
buffering.
Goal LU-4:                   High-quality and attractive multifamily
                             residential neighborhoods that provide
                             ownership and rental opportunities for people
                             in all stages of life
    Policy LU-4.1:           Require that new multifamily residential
                             development be visually and functionally
                             integrated and consistent in scale, mass, and
                             character with structures in the surrounding
                             neighborhood.
2-28 | Land Use AND Community Design                            Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

     Policy LU-4.2:          Encourage residential development that
                             enhances the visual character, quality, and
                             uniqueness of the City’s neighborhoods and
                             districts.
     Policy LU-4.3:          Require the provision of adequate private and
                             common open space for residential units.
                             Require sufficient on-site recreational facilities
                             to meet the daily needs of residents, if possible,
                             commensurate with the size of the development.
     Policy LU-4.4:          Strictly enforce City codes, including building
                             and safety, zoning and land use regulations, and
                             property maintenance codes, to maintain safe,
                             high-quality residential neighborhoods.
     Policy LU-4.5:          Provide amenities that make a multifamily
                             development a fully functional residential
                             community.
     Policy LU-4.6:          Encourage multifamily projects built with quality
                             materials that will physically endure and
                             provide a positive long-term living environment
                             for residents.
     Policy LU-4.7:          Arrange multifamily buildings on a site to meet
                             the following criteria:
                                 Provide interest to the “street scene” within
                                  the development and give as open a feel as
                                  possible to the site.
                                 Create a sense of place by relating
                                  buildings to each other and to adjacent
                                  open space.
                                 Provide a variety of open spaces of
                                  different sizes and shapes that perform
                                  different functions on the site, including
                                  contiguous areas large enough to be used
                                  for both active and passive recreation.
                                 Separate balconies and patios on adjacent
                                  buildings from one another to increase the
                                  privacy of these spaces.
Hillside Development
Hillside areas in Arcadia offer reduced densities, a more rural character,
significant views of valleys and hills, proximity to large natural open space
areas, and privacy. However, if hillside development is improperly planned,
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                              Land Use and Community Design | 2-29

the very amenities that people seek as precious attributes of foothill living
can be destroyed. In addition, the cumulative effect of improper hillside
development can result in significant destruction of sensitive biological
habitats and habitat linkages, erosion and degradation of water quality,
increased downstream runoff and flooding problems, slope failure, fire
hazards, high utility costs, and inadequate access for emergency vehicles.
Arcadia’s approach to hillside management is to require preservation of
the natural character of hillside areas, and to require full mitigation against
hazards from wildland fires, landslides, earthquake faults, and other
environmental conditions.
Goal LU-5:                    Hillside management approaches that balance
                              desires for unique neighborhoods and home
                              sites with the need to protect residents from
                              environmental hazards and to respect wildlife
                              habitat and viewsheds
    Policy LU-5.1:            Maintain the visual character of hillsides,
                              recognizing both the importance of the
                              exposure of hillside development from off-site
                              public views and the importance of providing
                              panoramic public views from and of hillsides.
    Policy LU-5.2:            Minimize the alteration of existing landforms
                              and maintain the natural topographic
                              characteristics of hillside areas, allowing only
                              minimal disruption.
    Policy LU-5.3:            Protect the natural character of hillside areas
                              by means of contour grading to blend graded
                              slopes and terraces with the natural
                              topography.
    Policy LU-5.4:            Avoid mass graded pads within hillside areas.
                              Smaller steps or grade changes should be used
                              over single, large, slope banks to the greatest
                              extent feasible.
    Policy LU-5.5:            Ensure that any change in hillside land use is
                              accompanied by appropriate safety measures
                              and that the environmental constraints are
                              adequately addressed especially with respect to
                              runoff and erosion
    Policy LU-5.6:            Require hillside development to incorporate
                              architecture, scale, massing, building form,
                              building color, roof materials, and landscaping
                              to reflect the natural hillside setting.

Commercial Corridors and
Districts
With the exception of the regional mall, most commercial development in
Arcadia occurs along the major streets and corridors. These corridors
represent the “face” of the City to the many visitors who come to shop,
work, or do business. The corridors support businesses that provide local
jobs and services to Arcadia residents, and are a significant source of tax
revenue. Revenues from commercial businesses support the maintenance
of infrastructure, fire and police services, community services, and public
facilities. Given the uncertainty surrounding future revenue from Santa
Anita Park, Arcadia’s long-term fiscal stability is closely tied to the
continued stable financial performance of its commercial areas.
Two corridors—Live Oak Avenue and First Avenue—offer opportunities for
the incorporation of residential uses with commercial activity. Such mixed-
use development will allow the City to diversify its housing base while
enhancing the aesthetic quality of these corridors. Mixed use will also help
enliven the commercial market in these areas by providing a ready
customer base within walking distance. New mixed-use developments will
require a commercial component to ensure that new retail or office space is
provided to the area.
Goal LU-6:                  Attractive and vibrant commercial corridors
                            that provide for the retail, commercial, and
                                                                               Policies specific to
                            office needs of Arcadia with expanded              economic development

                            connections.
    Policy LU-6.2:          Use code enforcement to address maintenance
                            issues and to improve the overall appearance of
                            the City’s commercial corridors.
    Policy LU-6.3:          Establish parking districts in key commercial
                            areas to make use of shared parking, public
                            parking lots, and other creative approaches to
                            parking. The aim of such an approach should be
                            twofold: to reduce problems associated with
                            parking and to create incentives for
                            development.
    Policy LU-6.4:          Encourage design approaches that create a
                            cohesive, vibrant look and that minimize the
                            appearance of expansive parking lots on major

                        uses.
    Policy LU-6.5:      Where mixed use is permitted, promote
                        commercial uses that are complementary to
                        adjacent residential uses.
    Policy LU-6.6:      Develop landscaping that is compatible with the
                        City’s water efficient landscape ordinance and
                        façade standards for commercial properties,
                        and require all new development to adhere to
                        them. Encourage the improvement of rundown
                        buildings by offering entitlement incentives.
    Policy LU-6.7:      Encourage a balanced distribution of
                        commercial development throughout the City,
                        ensuring that neighborhoods and districts have
                        adequate access to local-serving commercial
                        uses.
    Policy LU-6.8:      Encourage the intensification of commercial
                        uses on underutilized commercial properties
                        and the transitioning of non-commercial uses on
                        commercial properties in accordance with the
                        Land Use Policy Map and all applicable
                        regulations.
    Policy LU-6.9:      Pursue public/private partnerships aimed at
                        creating an investment strategy for the City’s
                        commercial corridors.
    Policy LU-6.10:     Identify       and      provide      appropriate
                        monumentation and signage for major City
                        gateways where commercial corridors enter
                        Arcadia from neighboring cities.
    Policy LU-6.11:     Provide mature street trees, continuous
                        landscaping (that includes drought-tolerant
                        plants), and pedestrian amenities along
                        corridors and within districts to create a more
                        visually pleasing and cohesive streetscape.
    Policy LU-6.12:     Create pedestrian connections along corridors

Industrial Districts
Industrial businesses play an important part in job creation and revenue
generation. Arcadia has no heavy industrial uses and only a few areas
where light industrial uses, such as manufacturing and warehousing, occur:
north of the Downtown, along portions of Live Oak Avenue, and in the
southeastern limits of the City around Goldring Road, Clark Street, and
Lower Azusa Road.
Arcadia has done well attracting light manufacturing businesses to its
industrial areas. In fact, while this City is known for its homes and regional
mall, one of its largest revenue producers is a manufacturer of fire safety
equipment. The City can become even more attractive to such businesses,
as well as those in the technology incubator sector of the market, through a
focus on infrastructure improvements.
Particularly in regards to the development of the Lower Azusa Road
Reclamation Area, roadway and other infrastructure improvements will
help ensure that Arcadia remains able to take best advantage of its
location in the San Gabriel Valley, a significant regional center for
manufacturing with more than a proportional share of Los Angeles County
manufacturing businesses. According to a report3 from the Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corporation, the San Gabriel Valley claims
17.9 percent of Los Angeles County manufacturing establishments
although it only has 10.4 percent of all County establishments.
Goal LU-7:                      Industrial areas that encourage local, well-
                                paying employment while providing for the
                                other industrial service needs of the Arcadia
                                community
     Policy LU-7.1:             Require the use of buffers and transition in
                                industrial developments to minimize impacts on
                                surrounding residential neighborhoods.
     Policy LU-7.2:             Encourage industrial uses that provide
                                employment and revenue benefits to the City.
     Policy LU-7.3:             Require quality industrial development that
                                includes visually appealing architectural design,
                                site design, scale and massing, and landscaping
                                design features consistent with the City’s

Public/Institutional Uses
Public and institutional uses include those dedicated to government
purposes, such as the Civic Center and public schools. Quasi-public and
private uses that provide an essential community function similar to
government, such as private utilities and hospitals, are also included in this
category.
In response to changing demographics over time, the City will re-evaluate
the public services and facilities it provides to best serve the community.
For example, an increase in senior-aged residents will necessitate
community facilities that can serve the health, education, and cultural
enrichment needs of older residents.
The City’s foremost Public/Institutional area is the Civic Center campus on
Huntington Drive, which includes City Hall, the Council Chambers, and
Arcadia’s police department headquarters building. The current site is the
fourth location of City Hall in Arcadia’s history. When the City incorporated
in 1903, Arcadia’s population was approximately 400 people. City Hall
moved from the Hotel Oakwood on the southeast corner of First Avenue
and Santa Clara Street to the McCoy Building at First Avenue and La
Porte Street, which housed a general store at the street level and offices on
a second floor, the first new City Hall building was constructed on the
corner of First Avenue and Huntington Drive in 1918. City Hall moved to its
current location in 1949. The City plans to rebuild City Hall at its existing
location.
In addition to the Police Department building, which was completed in
2003, the City constructed a Fire Department headquarters station in
2008 and extensively remodeled the main library in 1996.
Founded in 1903 in Los Angeles and moved to Arcadia in 1957, the
Methodist Hospital, located on Huntington Drive just south of City Hall, is a
long-time Arcadia institution that serves as a not-for-profit hospital. This
important regional facility provides a full complement of medical services,
and is a major provider of quality jobs in the community. With the growth of
the healthcare industry, the City looks to accommodate medical office
spaces and facilities that supplement the services that Methodist Hospital
provides. The Downtown Overlay applied to properties designated
Commercial offers an FAR of 1.0 as an incentive to development of such
complementary uses near the hospital.

Land Use Focus Areas
As embodied by the City’s motto, one of Arcadia’s most treasured
resources is its single-family residential neighborhoods. As such, a primary
goal of this General Plan is to provide the necessary opportunities for the
City to grow and thrive economically while preserving the quality and
character of the single-family residential neighborhoods. Recognizing the
stability of the City, this Plan focuses on very specific areas where change
is desired to diversify housing and businesses, and to take advantage of
benefits the Gold Line station at Santa Clara Street and First Avenue will
bring. Figure LU-7 identifies the following focus areas:
        Downtown Arcadia
        First Avenue and Duarte Road
        Live Oak Avenue
        Lower Azusa Road Reclamation Area
        Baldwin Avenue and Duarte Road
        Santa Anita Park
Identification of these focus areas arose from extensive analysis and
discussion conducted with the General Plan Advisory Committee during the
summer of 2008, and subsequently later confirmed by the City Council
and Planning Commission. For the focus areas, the General Plan Advisory
Committee, City leaders, City staff, and the community developed
strategies to:
        Achieve more efficient or productive use of land resources.
        Encourage uses that would benefit the City through increased
         revenue, employment, and/or housing opportunities.
        Incentivize innovative mixed-use projects.
        Enhance select commercial corridors.
        Establish a vision for future land uses on properties that will
         experience significant transition, such as reclamation area.

Downtown Arcadia
The traditional core of Downtown has long been centered at Huntington
Drive and First Avenue, before City Hall was established at its current
location between East and West Huntington Drive. This core extends
along Huntington Drive for one block in either direction and three blocks
south along First Avenue. These blocks have buildings of a scale and street
orientation that create a wonderful walking environment, and the City has
made extensive efforts to create a pleasant pedestrian experience and
attractive business fronts. However, the area has struggled commercially
and has never really found the right mix of businesses to allow the corridor
to thrive. The proximity of the regional mall, with its many national retailers
and restaurants, creates competition for smaller, independent businesses.
Just behind the Huntington Drive frontage, several properties are
underutilized or have uses, such as inventory warehousing, that do not
foster a thriving pedestrian commercial neighborhood. Parking is not
convenient despite the presence of City-owned lots.

The most important and anticipated development in Downtown is the
Metro Gold Line extension and Arcadia station. The Metro Gold Line light
rail system runs from Union Station in downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena,
with the extension planned to add more than 24 miles to the system, with a
terminus in Montclair and possibly beyond to the Ontario Airport via either
bus or rail. The Arcadia station platform at the northwest corner of First
Avenue and East Santa Clara Avenue will access a planned parking
structure adjacent to a public transit plaza. The City envisions the
Downtown Arcadia station as a destination for visitors and a catalyst for
transit-oriented development in the surrounding district. For visitors, clearly
marked travel ways will direct them to shops and attractions in Downtown,
as well as to Santa Anita Park and the regional mall.

To revitalize Downtown and move
forward with this vision, broad-based
land use changes are required,
together with a comprehensive
parking strategy and coordinated
public signage improvements, as well
as possibly economic development
incentives     (see     the    Economic
Development section of this Element).
The Downtown Mixed Use land use
designation allows retail and service
commercial, office, entertainment, and
residential uses at development
intensities and densities—up to a 1.0
FAR and 50 units per acre—that are
higher than previously permitted.
Along the Huntington Drive frontage,
which is designated Commercial, land use policy allows a higher FAR than
in other commercial areas.
Figure LU-9: Gold Line station Planned Configuration
The land use plan for Downtown revolves around the Gold Line station and
the tremendous opportunity it presents for Downtown enhancement.
Supported by appropriate land uses, the station will attract both
commuters to shop or dine and residents who want to live within walking
distance of commercial amenities and be able to ride the train to work.
The first step to realizing the full potential of transit-oriented development
in Downtown is to create capacity for more people in the area on a 24-hour
basis. The Downtown Mixed Use land use designation focuses the most
intense mixed-use development potential around the station. The 1.0 FAR
accommodates sufficient development intensity for projects with ground-
2-40 | Land Use AND Community Design                               Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

floor commercial and up to three additional stories of residential use.
Alternatively, individual projects may consist of combined retail/office or
stand-alone office. In Downtown Mixed Use areas, ground-floor, street-
frontage commercial is required in mixed use developments to lend a lively
street scene. Stand-alone residential uses are not permitted.
Properties along First Avenue (south of Huntington Drive to Diamond
Street) are designated Mixed Use, which allows mixed uses (residential and
commercial) and stand-alone commercial uses. Developments consisting
solely of residential uses are not allowed, as the intent is to create
pedestrian activity between the ground-floor, street-fronting commercial
uses. Shared parking lots are encouraged to allow new development to
take maximum advantage of the shallow lots.
North of La Porte Street, between Saint Joseph and Santa Clara Streets,
properties are designated Commercial. The mix of light industrial and
residential uses historically comprising this sub-area are envisioned to
transition to small-scale office and neighborhood-serving commercial uses
that support the surrounding established neighborhoods and new
residential development in Downtown. The long-established uses will be
permitted to remain consistent with zoning regulations.
The extension of the Downtown focus area north and west along Santa
Anita Avenue, Huntington Drive and Colorado Place are designated
Commercial with an FAR overlay of 1.0 to allow a modest increase in
development intensity. The increase in intensity should encourage owners
of older buildings to pursue private redevelopment efforts that will provide
additional hospitality uses and office space—and medical office space in
particular on Santa Anita Avenue—to enhance the function and
appearance of these corridors.
Downtown Community Design
As described in the Land Use Focus Areas discussion above, the single-
most important factor necessary for the creation of a thriving commercial
district is people, and people walking is even better. The Gold Line station
represents the key opportunity to generate pedestrian activity Downtown,
combined with creation of a distinct, fun, safe, and multi-functional outdoor
public gathering place. The station and land use policy that allows for
higher-density residential development in Downtown will generate the
critical mass of people that small-scale retail businesses, cafes, and
restaurants require.
Good community design alone will not revitalize Downtown, but it can
complement the transit accessibility and mix of uses that will make Arcadia
a destination stop on the Gold Line, rather than merely a pass-through or
place where commuters from surrounding cities park their cars to travel
into Los Angeles. Good community design will make it more likely that the
new residents of Downtown will spend their leisure hours walking around
(and spending money in) their neighborhood, rather than going somewhere
else with more appeal.

The following are the key elements of a successful community design for
Downtown.
Public Spaces
Public spaces include publicly accessible plazas, courtyards, and similar
outdoor spaces that form a vital component of a community’s public life.
Such spaces attract people. As well-defined outdoor rooms, they may
accommodate public gatherings and celebrations, or serve as retreats from
urban activity. Shade trees and other means of escaping the sun should be
integral to all public spaces. Fountains and water follies, especially ones
which children can play in, can be a major draw for families on hot days.
                                                                                           Quality public
                                                                                           spaces attract
                                                                                           people.
Signage
In addition to the primary use of providing direction,
a program of public signage helps to mark and
make a location distinct. Key locations in Downtown,
in particular the Gold Line Station and the
Huntington Drive and First Avenue shopping
districts, should be well marked. Signs used should
be attractive and coordinated with the overall
aesthetic of the area.
Pedestrian Connectivity
Successful places include safe and convenient
connections from parking areas to shops and
restaurants, and among the shops and restaurants
themselves. Generally, people’s walking tolerance
to their destination is about one-quarter mile, but
they can be encouraged to continue walking if the
paths are clear and they can find excitement along
the way. Public plazas, courtyards, and pocket
parks in Downtown need to be connected via
sidewalks and paseos to create a network of
pedestrian spaces. Particular attention will be paid
to the connections between parking lots and
commercial areas.

                                                                                      especially well to
                                                                                      connect parking
                                                                                      lots with
                                                                                      commercial areas.
Parking
The goal for Downtown is to have visitors park once and be able to walk to
any destination in the district, such as people do at a shopping mall. One
method for achieving this is shared parking, whereby a business’s parking
requirement could be fulfilled offsite at a common lot shared with the other
businesses in the neighborhood. In addition to ensuring that customers do
not have to drive and re-park to patronize more than one establishment,
shared parking also makes it possible for businesses to use commercial
space that they would not be able to if they had to provide parking onsite.
This helps to remove a major obstacle to commercial vitality while
continuing to ensure that sufficient parking is available to serve the district
as a whole.
Where parking structures are used, they should be fronted by active uses,
such as storefronts along pedestrian walkways so as not to disrupt the
pedestrian experience.
  Parking structures should be fronted by active uses such as storefronts.
For mixed-use buildings, subterranean or interior parking courts should be
used to minimize the visual impact of parking. The location and design of
parking should not prohibit the desired street-oriented development
pattern nor inhibit the provision of comfortable and functional outdoor
spaces.

Building Orientation
Buildings should be oriented to the pedestrian and the street. Buildings act
to define the boundaries of the public “room” of the street. They should
therefore be designed to function as a part of that room, enhancing the
public space. They should not turn their backs to the street, but should offer
the pedestrian something to interact with. Rather than having an
uninterrupted blank wall, the windows or landscaping of projects should
face the street.
Architecture
Rather than have rigid architectural guidelines or standards for Downtown
that would create almost a theme park appearance, the City will allow for
individual expression. Constants will be:
        The use of quality, lasting building materials
        Building scale that relates to the almost intimate nature of
         Downtown and the generally narrower street widths
        Avoidance of “kitsch” or other design elements that will not easily
         stand the test of time
        Unified themes within a development, including ensuring that
         window treatments and detailing comport with the overall building
         style
Downtown Conceptual Community Design Study
Figures LU-10, LU-11, and LU-12 present a conceptual plan for Downtown
Arcadia. This is not a prescriptive plan for the area; it is meant to illustrate
the types of design elements desired. The plan emphasizes pedestrian
access and open space and integrating the Gold Line Station with high-
density residential, mixed-use, and commercial areas via a system of
pedestrian alleyways and plazas. These diagrams identify models to guide
development decisions for the area; the City may adopt a more definitive
specific plan document, or associated zoning standards, for Downtown.
Figure LU-10 is an overall conceptual plan depicting the central Downtown
area between East Colorado Boulevard and Huntington Drive and Santa
Anita Avenue and Second Avenue. The focal point is the Gold Line station,
which the study envisions as being surrounded by large plazas on both
sides of the tracks. The central features are pedestrian alleys and
breezeways that radiate from the station plazas to the south, connecting
the plazas to mixed-use and commercial areas south of the station and
along Huntington Drive.
Figure LU-11 illustrates the types and scale of land uses envisioned for each
area of Downtown. A well-designed Gold Line station surrounded by areas
of public open space is a crucial component of the plan. Photographs of
potential examples for this kind of station are presented in the lower right
hand corner of the figure. Just above this on the right-hand side are
examples of features that could enhance the pedestrian alleys, including
fountains, benches, trees, and other landscaping.
Figure LU-12 is a study of edge conditions―or the interfaces between land
uses―between the street and the buildings facing it, for example. Section

A illustrates the proposed pedestrian alley walk, which should be a
minimum of 20 feet wide. Key features of the alley walk include street
furniture and planters attached to the face of the future parking structure;
this adds aesthetic value for pedestrians. Another feature is the use of
trees and groundcover to provide shade and visual variety.
Section B depicts a cross-section of a pedestrian breezeway. This feature
allows for pedestrian access/connection from parking lots or alley walks in
the rear of retail stores to the street. Street furniture and landscaping are
used to “soften” the experience of walking between buildings.
Section C shows the relationship of building to street, with awnings and
street trees providing shelter for pedestrians. The trees and street parking
also form a physical buffer between automobile traffic and people on the
sidewalk. Adjacent to the building, an amenity zone provides room for
street furniture such as planters and benches.
Section D depicts the interface between a parking lot and the street. The
key feature is a bioswale that catches surface runoff from the parking lot,
preventing polluted water from running directly into the storm drain system
and eventually, into the ocean. Hedges and trees screen the parking lot
from the street.

                             lasting building materials; provides building
                             scale that relates to intimate nature of
                             Downtown; and applies a unified theme.
     Policy LU-10.13:        Recognize that well-designed public open
                             spaces are vital to the success of Downtown.

                             to facilitate the construction of such spaces.
     Policy LU-10.14:        Create a high-quality pedestrian experience in
                             Downtown through the use of street trees,
                             public art, street furniture, and public gathering
                             spaces. Using signage, art, and unique uses,
                             entice and encourage people to walk and
                             explore the commercial core of Downtown.
First Avenue and Duarte Road
The First Avenue and Duarte Road corridors provide local commercial
services and retail uses that support the surrounding residential
neighborhoods. First Avenue is envisioned as a mixed-use street that
complements the surrounding residential properties. Duarte Road is
envisioned as a neighborhood-serving commercial node with uses that
require additional traffic presence.
First Avenue between Huntington Drive and Duarte Road represents the
proving ground for mixed-use development in Arcadia, with the first
projects constructed in the early 2000s. Residential development is
required to have a ground-floor commercial component. The streetscape
improvements north of California Street, completed also in the early
2000s, have created a very pleasant pedestrian environment, with shops,
cafes, and services within easy walking distance from neighborhoods on
either side of First Avenue. However, visitors who drive to the district have
trouble with the angled parking. The concern is that exiting from such
spaces into traffic can be daunting. The City will examine options to
mitigate this problem, as well as public or shared lots. In addition, the City
will look into extending the streetscape improvements south to Duarte
Road.

Live Oak Avenue
Live Oak Avenue has supported a mix of low-intensity businesses for many
years, although a new retail center at Santa Anita Avenue and Live Oak
has established site design and architectural cues that should inspire new
development along the corridor. Along the approximately one-mile stretch
that Live Oak Avenue runs along the southern edge of the City, one can
find everything from light-industrial manufacturing and auto repair to
medical offices and apartments. Live Oak Avenue is also a major commuter
thoroughfare that provides direct access to the I-605 freeway.

 Figure lu-14: Live Oak Avenue
The City has completed landscaping, median, and other streetscape
improvements to enhance the public realm, but the pedestrian experience
is less than optimal due to a narrow sidewalk, an absence of shade trees,
and a lack of interesting places to walk to. The area serves residents of
neighborhoods north and south of Live Oak Avenue (with neighborhoods to
the south in Los Angeles County but also in Arcadia’s sphere of influence).
In particular, the avenue’s two supermarkets are major local shopping
destinations. There remains, however, a significant opportunity to improve
the other shopping and service options for the people who live nearby.
In 2002, the City attempted to establish a redevelopment area along the
Live Oak corridor as a means of financing improvements there. This move,
however, was blocked by the County of Los Angeles.
The vision for a reinvented Live Oak Avenue corridor provides for a livelier,
more diverse mix of retail and service commercial uses that better serve
local residents, together with new residential uses in select locations along
the corridor in mixed-use developments. Enhancements to accommodate
and promote pedestrian activity will be balanced with recognition of the
roadway as a major east-west connector.
The Mixed Use designation applies only to those properties that have
sufficient depth to accommodate a combination of uses; stand-alone

residential is not permitted but can be integrated either vertically or
horizontally into a comprehensive development scheme, with relationships
to the adjoining lower-scale development clearly recognized and respected
for any new development.
The Land Use Plan acknowledges and retains compatible business park
uses between Santa Anita and El Monte Avenues, as well as established
multifamily housing and low-scale office buildings along the north side of
Live Oak Avenue. Where the Commercial designation applies, the City
supports and encourages the private redevelopment of commercial
centers. Complementary policy direction is included in the Commercial
Corridors section. Applicable policies and programs include:
        Use code enforcement activities to address maintenance issues.
        Pursue public/private partnerships aimed at creating an investment
         strategy for the corridor.
        Transition non-commercial uses on commercial properties.
        Encourage the improvement or replacement of older buildings by
         offering entitlement incentives.
        Encourage landscaping and facade improvements.
        Require appropriate and coordinated landscape and design
         standards.
Live Oak Avenue is the boundary between the Arcadia Unified School
District and El Monte K-8 and high school districts. Arcadia residents have
expressed their desire to have City boundaries and school district
boundaries coincide. While the City of Arcadia has no jurisdiction to
effectuate such an adjustment, the City recognizes the value that the
Arcadia Unified School District brings.
Live Oak Avenue is major cross-town thoroughfare, yet the mix of uses that
has evolved along the corridor suggests that sections can be more
pedestrian focused and neighborhood serving, as discussed above. Also, a
unifying streetscape the length of Live Oak Avenue, and along Las Tunas
Drive from El Monte Avenue east to Santa Anita Avenue, would enhance
the driving and pedestrian experiences, and would create a better visual
image of this section of Arcadia. This will include coordinated landscaping
within parkways and medians, quality street lighting and street furniture,
and well-marked pedestrian crossings.
Pedestrian District
Between Santa Anita Avenue and Fifth Avenue, the plans for mixed-use
development will emphasize more of a pedestrian environment, with
buildings fronting the street. As with Downtown and Baldwin Avenue,
pedestrian connectivity, especially between established and new
residential uses and commercial uses along the corridor, should be the main
focus of community design efforts. The provision of awnings should be
encouraged, which in combination with a street tree plan for the avenue,
will provide areas where pedestrians can shelter from the sun. Benches and
other places where people can rest will also work to encourage walking.

For those sections along the corridor where development is more oriented
toward auto traffic, all development should have visually interesting street
frontage as well (for example, windows, variation of design, artistic
elements), with no blank walls. All development shall feature quality
building materials and attractive, well-designed landscapes.
Goal LU-12:                 An attractive and economically thriving Live
                            Oak Avenue
    Policy LU-12.1:         Encourage mixed-use development on lots that
                            have the size to support a higher intensity of
                            development. Encourage lot consolidation to
                            facilitate such development.
    Policy LU-12.2:         Encourage       and    support    the    private
                            redevelopment of commercial properties in
                            areas not designated appropriate for mixed-
                            use.
    Policy LU-12.3:         Encourage the improvement of the pedestrian
                            environment between Santa Anita Avenue and
                            Fifth Avenue by requiring new developments to
                            be designed with an emphasis on pedestrian
                            connectivity with neighboring uses.
    Policy LU-12.4:         Develop a streetscape improvement plan for
                            Live Oak Avenue. Such a plan should address
                            street trees, street furniture such as benches
                            and planters, and pedestrian-friendly amenities
                            such as awnings.
    Policy LU-12.5:         Encourage the creation of public driveways to

Baldwin Avenue/Duarte Road
Baldwin Avenue between Huntington Drive and Camino Real Avenue is a
very economically successful commercial district. This stretch functions as a
restaurant row, with numerous examples of thriving establishments. The
restaurants may primarily serve Arcadia’s booming Asian population, but
they also draw many patrons from all over the San Gabriel Valley.
Immediately behind the commercial corridors are well-established
multifamily neighborhoods. Townhomes and two- and three-story
apartment buildings, many dating from the 1960s and 1970s, are built on
most of the properties. A large percentage of these older properties were
built at densities at or near 30 dwelling units per acre. In recognition of this
condition and to give property owners the opportunity to recycle some of
the most dilapidated of these structures, the maximum density for the High
Density Residential category has been increased from 24 to 30 dwelling
units per acre. Even with this improved incentive to rebuild, it is unlikely to
result in much redevelopment of apartment buildings, except for in the
most extreme cases. If over the life of this General Plan the City faces a
problem in this or other neighborhoods with apartment buildings that have
become run down, but for which there is not adequate incentive to spur
wholesale redevelopment, the City may look at other options, such as the
allowance of smaller unit sizes. As always, guiding this process will be the
desire to balance the aesthetic and economic benefits of new development
with the potential negative consequences of increased densities.
This section of Baldwin Avenue has evolved into a vigorous, busy
commercial corridor, driven to a large degree by the influx of Chinese and
other immigrant-owned businesses, and by a volume of ethnic restaurants
that attract people from throughout the San Gabriel Valley. From the
perspective of community design, however, Baldwin Avenue leaves much to
be desired. Development is primarily auto-centered, with many buildings
oriented away from the street. Adjacent buildings do not relate to each

other. Several developments have occurred as mini-malls that are internally
focused, turning their backs on neighbors and sometimes presenting long,
blank street walls. Few pedestrian or auto connections exist between
developments. Once a customer has arrived, he or she is actively
discouraged by the built environment to walk to adjacent stores. It is easier
to drive back onto Baldwin Avenue and drive to the next destination, even
if it is a short distance away.

Along the commercial corridors, the Commercial designation supports
continued economic vitality of the diverse businesses. Increased focus is
needed, however, on orienting new developments toward Baldwin Avenue
and Duarte Road, enhancing the streetscape for pedestrians, and creating
better physical relationships and ties among developments, including
reciprocal access between adjacent parking lots and even establishing
shared or public parking lots. Reciprocal and shared parking approaches
will help reduce circulating auto traffic as people look for parking spaces.
The improvement of pedestrian connections between the residential
neighborhoods and the commercial businesses along Baldwin Avenue is
another important community design goal for this area. The strengthening
of pedestrian connectivity through directional signage, street trees,

benches, distinctively marked intersections, and other streetscape
improvements, will have positive effects in terms of economic development
and traffic mitigation, as local people are encouraged to walk to nearby
restaurants and businesses.
Clearly, improvements to the urban design quality of Baldwin Avenue will
be incremental over a period of many years. Nevertheless, the following
development approaches, when applied to new projects and the
rehabilitation of existing development, will make gradual improvements.
Shared Parking
As with Downtown, Baldwin Avenue businesses could benefit from shared
parking. A single parking structure or lot that could serve the businesses on
an entire block would allow an escape from the mini-mall-surrounding-a-
parking-lot paradigm that dominates.
Pedestrian Connectivity
Pedestrian connections between developments should be encouraged.
Buildings should be oriented toward the sidewalk, and businesses should
not be permitted to impede or eliminate sidewalk ingress and egress. Walls
or other barriers that disrupt pedestrian connectivity should not segregate
parking lots from one another.
Goal LU-14:                  Maintaining the economic success of Baldwin
                             Avenue while enhancing design
Policy LU-14.1:          Encourage new developments to incorporate public
                         gathering spaces as part of their design.
Policy LU-14.2:          Use code enforcement to address maintenance
                         issues.
Policy LU-14.3:          Facilitate landscaping and facade improvements
                         through a combination of incentives and code
                         enforcement.
Policy LU-14.4:          Require traffic mitigation and landscape and design
                         standards. Encourage design approaches that
                         minimize expansive parking lots fronting Baldwin
                         Avenue.
Policy LU-14.5:          Require new developments on Baldwin to place
                         entries on Baldwin Avenue to encourage increased
                         pedestrian use of Baldwin Avenue.
Policy LU-14.6:          Establish a marketing and branding strategy to
                         unify Baldwin Avenue as a key shopping and dining
                         destination

Santa Anita Park
The Santa Anita race track is a key community feature and an important
component of Arcadia’s character. The retention of live horse racing at this
facility and the ongoing economic vitality of the race track are part of
Arcadia’s plan for a strong economic base. Since the advent of off-track
wagering facilities and a long-term downturn in the racing industry,
attendance at the Santa Anita race track has declined. As a result, it is no
longer necessary to reserve both of the race track’s large open parking
areas exclusively for race track event parking. The combination of lower
attendance and the potential availability of a portion of the race track’s
parking areas for other uses have given rise to much community discussion

  Figure lu-17: Santa Anita Park
Arcadia’s long-term vision is to retain live horse racing at the Santa Anita
race track, and to preserve the existing grandstand structure. The
opportunity also exists to create a development of urban intensity on the
race track’s southerly parking lot which responds to the unique attributes of
the race track to the north and the shopping mall to the west, and to
cultivate this unique combination of regional attractions into a cohesive
center. The City’s goal is to ensure that new commercial development
within the southerly race track parking area is respectful of Arcadia's
existing community character, one of well-preserved, peaceful, and safe

residential neighborhoods. Because future development within the
southerly race track parking lot has the potential for impacting the
community, future development must address the following needs:
        Achieving land use compatibility with, and a logical physical
         relationship to the adjacent mall and residential uses
        Retaining the ability of area roadways to maintain Level of Service
         D (Level of Service C on local residential streets), as outlined in the
         Circulation and Infrastructure Element
        Providing sufficient on-site parking so as not to exacerbate existing
         problems of race track patrons parking offsite
        Maintaining architectural compatibility with the existing race track
         grandstands
        Preserving important community views of the existing race track
         grandstands such that the race track grandstands remain
         recognizable from locations along Huntington Drive
        Providing sufficient on-site security so as not to impact the services
         of the Arcadia Police Department
The purpose of designating the area south of the race track grandstands
Commercial is to assist in facilitating free market forces to introduce new,
compatible uses with complementary market segments to the existing mall,
Downtown, and other commercial areas within the City. Overall, the
Commercial designation of the southerly race track parking lot is intended
to assist in achieving the City's mission and the related economic
development and public infrastructure goals that are included in the
Mission Statement. By reinforcing the need to establish linkages between
new uses and existing ones, and between the race track and mall, the
General Plan also seeks to create a synergistic economic relationship
between the mall, race track, and new commercial uses in the race track’s
southerly parking area.
New development within the portion of the race track designated
Commercial is to be implemented through a specific plan pursuant to the
California Government Code or an equivalent master planning process
adopted by the City, and is to be consistent with the following provisions.
Community Context
Santa Anita Park is a vital component of the community's identity, its
cultural heritage, and its economic well-being. Further, it is a bonafide
regional destination, drawing visitors from throughout Southern California.
The race track is one of three major live horse racing venues in Southern
California, and possesses a distinct cultural heritage and recreational
identity. It consists of the grandstands, track, paddock area, stables, other
ancillary buildings, and two large surface parking areas, one to the north
and one to the south of the track itself. The southerly surface parking area
provides a unique physical opportunity for master planned infill
development which builds upon the site’s regional identity and central
location. Development within the site’s southerly parking area needs to be
carefully planned so as to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to existing
and established neighborhoods and commercial areas within Arcadia.

Located immediately southwest of the race track, the regional shopping
mall is Arcadia's primary retail sales tax generator; it consists of
approximately 1.4 million square feet with three major anchors. It serves
Arcadia residents, as well as residents from surrounding communities.
Although the race track and mall are contiguous to each other, each has a
large common boundary, and shares a common set of access roadways,
there are no common activities or functional linkages between these two
uses. A chain link fence topped with barbed wire currently separates the
southerly parking lot of the race track from the easterly mall parking area.
Large arterial roadways separate the race track/mall complex from
adjacent uses. These roadways, Baldwin Avenue and Huntington Drive, are
wide with landscaped medians, and represent the public/private edge for
the race track and mall. Both the race track and mall are set far back from
Huntington Drive and Baldwin Avenue, minimizing visual impacts. The
location of the race track parking areas to the north and south of the race
track and grandstands has increased the visibility of these features. The
unique architecture of the southerly grandstand facade has become an
important community landmark. Views of this facade are an important
attribute of the site that needs to be protected in planning for development
of the southerly parking area, such that the grandstands remain a
recognizable community feature.
The architectural design of commercial buildings that are introduced to the
southerly race track parking area needs to be compatible with existing
race track architectural design, and functionally build upon the race track’s
attributes. The mall has a significant setback with a fairly dense
landscaped buffer at the roadways' edge, limiting visibility of the mall,
particularly from Baldwin Avenue. Of utmost concern to the City is the
continued success of the mall and race track.
Proposed Commercial Uses
The approximate 85-acre development area within the southerly portion of
the Santa Anita race track is strategically located between an established
commercial use (race track) and commercial retail use (mall). The mix of
uses within this development area should add to and enhance the range of
existing retail in the City, and provide uses which can draw from and
contribute to existing patronage at the mall and race track. The mix of uses
and the design of new commercial development should work together to
create a place where people can and will want to come for shopping and
enjoyment. A wide range of compatible land uses is desired that will
increase the area's retail sales potential by bringing more activity and
buyers to the area. Thus, the retail component of new development within
the southerly portion of the race track should provide a unique shopping
experience, emphasizing a mix of general retailing and specialty goods.
Attracting a wide variety of sit-down restaurants and other types of eating
establishments is important to the success of establishing a functional link
between the mall's commercial uses and the race track's entertainment
identity. A variety of entertainment experiences are desired to support the
dominant commercial use of the site, and to increase patronage of the
area’s retail sector without creating a "theme park" or "amusement park."
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                            Land Use and Community Design | 2-65

Desirable entertainment uses include both ticketed and non-ticketed
venues. Office uses should, at most, be a minor portion of new
development, and be supportive of the overall commercial character of the
site. It is understood that, although market forces will bring an array of new
and unique uses to the area, other uses will invariably compete with
existing commercial areas in the City. Emphasis should be placed upon new
uses and uses either having complementary market segments or a different
scale and character than those currently existing within the City of Arcadia.
Community Design
There are several strong existing attributes that influence the potential
new Commercial area's design. At this time, the mall and race track are two
separate entities with no physical or commercial linkage. Development of
new commercial uses in the southerly portion of the race track property
represents a potential third major entity in the center of Arcadia. In order
to benefit from the locale of the two existing regional attractions, and to
maximize potential economic benefits, new commercial uses should be
designed to establish linkages with the two existing major attractions (mall
and race track), rather than simply create a third entity in the same area.
The intent of such linkages is to facilitate each attraction’s ability to draw
patronage from, as well as contribute patronage to the other attractions,
thereby increasing the success of the mall, race track, and new commercial
development.
New commercial buildings and structures in the southerly portion of the
race track property need to respect the architectural and cultural heritage
represented by existing race track buildings. Because any proposed
development would be located closer to Huntington Drive than the existing
race track structures, potential visual impacts of new development must be
carefully analyzed. An appropriate building setback buffer and/or public
edge landscape treatment needs to be provided to minimize potential
visual impacts along Huntington Drive, and new development needs to
protect public views of the race track grandstands. While it is not possible
for new development south of the grandstands to preserve unobstructed
views of the entire grandstand structure, it is important that the
grandstands remain recognizable from key locations along the perimeter of
the race track. Key views which merit preservation include the first views
travelers get of the grandstands from Huntington Drive/Colorado Place,
directly east of the track (Gate 5) and views of the unique architecture of
the southerly grandstand facade, particularly those of architectural details
toward the center and easterly portion of the grandstands. Views of these
key architectural details from locations along Huntington Drive should be
preserved.
Exposed elevations of new commercial buildings to Huntington Drive, the
race track, and the mall should avoid long, uninterrupted planes, using
articulated components such as staggered setbacks for different building
levels, recessed windows, projecting balconies, arcades, etc. The design of
the rear of buildings and loading or service areas should be cognizant and
respectful of adjacent uses, and the need for establishing viable linkages
with the mall and race track. The size and design of exterior building and
project signage exposed to public roadways for new development within
2-66 | Land Use AND Community Design                             Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

the southerly portion of the race track needs to be compatible with the
immediately adjacent architecture. Thus, while signage is important to
assist visitors to the site, signs should not be the dominant visual feature of
the built environment. Landscaping for new commercial development
should establish a project identity along the public edge and at the entries,
and identify the vehicular roadways, pedestrian walkways, building entries,
and plazas. Development of this site should also provide the opportunity to
construct an integrated and consistent landscape treatment along
Huntington Drive. The General Plan acknowledges that new commercial
development south of the race track grandstands will introduce a new and
potentially substantial source of nighttime lighting. Lighting needs to be
integrated into project design, and not appear to be tacked on as an
"afterthought." Lighting structures need to be in scale with the surrounding
buildings. Also, while on-site lighting needs to be bright enough to promote
the general safety of new uses, great care must be taken to prevent
"spillage" of lighting and glare into nearby residential neighborhoods.
Circulation and Parking
Given the potential intensity of new development south of the race track
grandstands, new commercial uses could generate a substantial amount of
traffic. Because of the key location of the commercial development area,
and its proximity to two major traffic generators (race track and mall), if
not properly managed, traffic from new commercial development could
result in traffic congestion.

Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                             Land Use and Community Design | 2-67

Traffic resulting from new commercial development needs to be analyzed
and mitigated from both a roadway capacity perspective (both average
daily traffic and peak-hour traffic), and from a land use compatibility
perspective. Thus, new commercial development must not exceed the
roadway performance capacity thresholds identified in the Circulation and
Infrastructure Element. In addition emergency response vehicle access, and
to the maximum possible extent, commercial traffic needs to be
accommodated on existing roadways serving commercial uses. Existing
residential neighborhoods and the hospital should not be adversely
affected by new commercial traffic. These neighborhoods and their
established character need to be protected from adverse traffic impacts
generated by potential commercial development. Because access points
are well established and appropriately spaced, the internal circulation
system for new development south of the race track grandstands should be
connected to existing points of ingress/egress. Because commercial uses
are often characterized by significant pedestrian traffic, the internal
circulation system of any new commercial project (or increment thereof)
needs to assign a high priority to pedestrian movement in terms of ease,
safety, and legibility.
As the result of new development, on-site merging of race track related
traffic with traffic from new commercial uses and the mall will occur. It is
the intent of the General Plan that patrons of the race track, mall, and new
commercial development be able to walk between these uses, and that
automobile traffic between these uses not be forced to use the external
public roadway system as the only means of access between them.
The General Plan recognizes that, by encouraging development within an
85-acre area south of the race track grandstands, a substantial amount of
race track parking will be diverted from the track's southerly parking area
to its northerly parking area on a daily basis. Because of the proximity of
residential neighborhoods north of the race track, race track-related traffic
increases onto Colorado Place need to be limited. Thus, access to the race
track parking area needs to continue to be provided from Huntington Drive
and Baldwin Avenue. At the same time, it is important that the internal
circulation system south of the race track efficiently move traffic from
parking entries along Baldwin Avenue and Huntington Drive through or
around new commercial development into race track parking areas, and
that traffic queuing up to enter race track parking areas not block entries
into the commercial area parking or uses. It is also important that an
efficient system of pedestrian access routes connecting mall and
commercial parking and uses be provided, and that safe crossings of
vehicular access routes are provided.
All requisite parking for new commercial uses must be accommodated on
site. The net effect of the physical arrangement of commercial, race track,
and mall parking must not exacerbate the problem of race track patrons
parking off site.
A number of race track patrons use public transit. This mode of
transportation needs to be preserved and enhanced through the provision
of safe and adequate staging areas for buses as determined by the Foothill
2-68 | Land Use AND Community Design                           Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

Transit District and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and through
the provision of safe and convenient pedestrian access from these staging
areas to the race track and commercial uses.
Public Safety
An important objective and benefit of new commercial development is
municipal revenue generation. However, there are often significant public
safety demands and costs associated with these types of projects. Large
commercial venues have the potential to generate large numbers of people
within a relatively small area. While this may be an objective of the new
commercial development, the maintenance of a high level of public safety
within the commercial area and surrounding lands is imperative. New
commercial development south of the race track grandstands will be
required to maintain an adequate level of security and fire protection as
determined by the City of Arcadia Police and Fire departments.
Phasing and Intensity
The commercially designated portion of the race track’s southerly parking
lot is large (85 acres) and potentially able to accommodate significant new
development. It is thus likely that new development will occur in a number
of increments. Individual development increments need to yield a cohesive,
viable mix of uses, and should not be predicated upon the construction of a
subsequent increment. Thus, with the completion of any individual
development increment, the whole of the commercial area needs to appear
to be "complete." Simultaneously, each development increment needs to
represent a rational step that provides linkages to previous commercial
development within the race track, as well as to subsequent development
increments, the mall, and to the race track itself. In addition, this guideline
will minimize visual impacts on the public roadways.
In order to ensure that new commercial development is respectful of
Arcadia's existing community character, and is compatible with the
community’s well preserved, peaceful, and safe residential neighborhoods,
new commercial uses south of the race track grandstands are to be
concentrated away from existing residential uses along Huntington Drive,
although small freestanding pads may be located along the Huntington
Drive frontage. As development approaches exterior portions of the site
nearest to existing residential uses, the intensity of new commercial uses
needs to be significantly reduced.
Future of the Race Track
Arcadia remains firmly committed to the continuation of a thriving horse-
racing enterprise at Santa Anita Race Track. Given the long-term trends in
the sport, which has seen many venerable courses closed in recent
decades, it is prudent to address the possibility that horse racing will cease
to be viable at Santa Anita at some point over the life of this plan.
The site offers tremendous potential due to its size, access, and central
location in the San Gabriel Valley; because of this, any use in the Horse
Racing designated portion of the property must meet the following
performance criteria:

           The appropriate uses will be determined through an extensive
            process of citywide community engagement.
           The uses will be a major and continual revenue source for the
            City, comparable to the race track in its heyday.
           The uses will be world class in scope and appeal, with a
            regional draw, appropriate to the scale and unique nature of
            the site
           The uses will be compatible with the character of the Arcadia
            community, which is made up of safe and attractive residential
            neighborhoods.

Regional Coordination and
Cooperation
The City’s policies regarding land use, mobility, and resource use and
preservation recognize that Arcadia is part of a large metropolitan region,
and that by working with its neighbors and regional agencies, the City can
effectively address issues that affect all.
Of particular significance to the City is the increasing role of State
mandates (or potential mandates) to address housing availability and
global warming. The most important of these State-legislature directed
efforts are the following:
Regional Housing Needs Allocation
The Regional Housing Needs Allocation, or RHNA, developed through a
process directed by the Southern California Association of Governments          Refer to the Housing
(SCAG), represents the number of housing units—divided into various             Element for discussion
                                                                                of Arcadia’s Regional
household income categories—that have been calculated to represent
                                                                                Housing Needs
every jurisdiction’s “fair share” of the regional housing need during a         Allocation.
Housing Element planning period. By law, the City is required to show in the
Housing Element that adequate sites are available in Arcadia to
accommodate the construction of new housing units consistent with the
RHNA. Recognizing that development is often constrained by the market
and environmental and other factors, the law makes no mandate that these
units actually be built. Rather, housing law merely requires that the City do
its part to facilitate housing construction by designating and zoning land
for residential use at appropriate densities, and by eliminating impediments
to housing development.
The RHNA is based on population and housing needs projections made by
the State and assigned to the regional Councils of Government (COGs)
throughout California. The regional COGs, in turn, allocate housing
absorption to its member jurisdictions. SCAG fulfills this role for the six-
county region that includes Arcadia.
AB 32
Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act (passed in 2006), sets
the target of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases statewide to 1990
levels by 2020. The bill assigned the task of coming up with a scoping plan
for this reduction to the California Air Resources Board (CARB). This plan,
which CARB’s board approved in December 2008, has a range of
greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction actions which include direct regulations,
alternative compliance mechanisms, monetary and non-monetary
incentives, voluntary actions, market-based mechanisms such as a cap-and-
trade system, and an AB 32 cost of implementation fee regulation to fund
the program.

SB 375
Senate Bill 375 (2008) takes aim at reducing the single largest source of
greenhouse gases in California—emissions from passenger vehicles—by
working to reduce vehicle miles traveled. The law prompts California
regions to work together to lower these emissions, and requires the
integration of planning processes for transportation, land use, and housing.
SB 375 requires CARB to develop regional reduction targets for
automobiles and light trucks GHG emissions. The regions, in turn, are
tasked with creating “sustainable communities strategies,” which combine
transportation and land use elements to achieve the emissions reduction
target, if feasible. Arcadia is cooperating with these efforts.
Goal LU-16:                   Regional coordination and cooperation that
                              represent Arcadia’s interests at regional and
                              statewide levels
    Policy LU-16.1:           Work with lawmakers to provide the City the
                              opportunity to contribute to legislation affecting
                              the City.
    Policy LU-16.2:           Work with Los Angeles County, Caltrans, Metro,
                              the South Coast Air Quality Management
                              District, and other public agencies to ensure
                              that actions taken by these agencies do not
                              adversely affect Arcadia’s quality of life or are
                              inconsistent with policies contained in the
                              General Plan.
    Policy LU-16.3:           Identify opportunities for joint programs to
                              further common interests in a cost-efficient
                              manner.
    Policy LU-16.4:           Assist agencies providing services within the
                              City of Arcadia, as well as agencies involved in
                              land use, transportation, and the provision of
                              public services and facilities within the City, to
                              understand the importance of the physical
                              components of Arcadia’s character, as well as
                              the potential impacts of their actions on
                              Arcadia.
    Policy LU-16.5:           Foster      systems      of    inter-jurisdictional
                              communications and development review, and
                              provide that such review respects the values of
                              adjacent      municipalities    and      equitably
                              distributes both the benefits and impacts
                              associated with a given project.

Implications of Land Use
Policy
Over time, as properties transition from one use to another or property
owners choose to rebuild, land uses and intensities will gradually shift to
align with the intent of this element. Given the built-out character of
Arcadia, significant development activities may not occur over the life of
this General Plan and certainly, not all properties will be developed to the
maximum permitted intensities and densities. Table LU-1 summarizes the
land use distribution, expected level of development anticipated within
each designation, and the resulting residential and nonresidential
outcomes that can be expected through approximately 2035.
Implementation of the General Plan Land Use Plan, with the assumptions
described below, is projected to potentially result in 3,624 additional
dwelling units, 9,916 new residents, and 3.5 million additional square feet of
non-residential development in the City of Arcadia, relative to 2008
conditions. Over a 25-year period, this averages about 145 units and
140,000 square feet of non-residential development per year. Although
most new development will be channeled toward the focus areas, scattered
private redevelopment actions will create new units and new business
opportunities citywide.
Projected Future Conditions
To define a realistic build-out scenario, assumptions about density and
intensity levels were made. Factors used to establish potential future
conditions include policies in this element, established land use patterns,
and past development trends.
Within single-family residential neighborhoods, the expected density
largely reflects established conditions, as most single-family neighborhoods
in Arcadia have lotting patterns and sizes that do not lend themselves to
new land divisions. For the multiple family residential neighborhoods,
expected density assumes 80 percent of maximum allowable density for all
multifamily land use designations. While some private redevelopment
activity may occur, particularly in areas that allow up to 30 units per acre,
physical conditions and zoning requirements for on-site improvements will
limit the ability of some properties to achieve the maximum densities.
With regard to the non-residential designations, an assumption of 80
percent of maximum allowed intensities has been made, recognizing the
well-developed character of several business districts and the fact that
land use policy does not change long-applied FAR limits.
Table LU-1 indicates the projected future number of residential units,
people, and square footage on non-residential uses based on the
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                             Land Use and Community Design | 2-73

assumptions described above. Projected dwelling units have been
calculated by multiplying the acres of residential land by the expected
density for each designation. For the mixed-use designations, the assumed
ratio of residential to non-residential development was 40 to 60 percent.
This assumption reflects the requirement for a commercial component for
all mixed-use developments and the fact that stand-alone residential
development is not permitted.
For non-residential uses (commercial, industrial, and institutional uses), the
projection represents a factor of the land use, in acres, for each
designation and the expected FAR.
The projected population figure takes into account the average number of
persons per household (2.872 in 2008) and the occupancy rate (95.9% in
2008). The number of persons per household and the occupancy rate will
change year to year, but for projection purposes, the City has used
estimates available from the California Department of Finance,
Demographic Unit at the time of General Plan adoption.
Table LU-2 compares buildout for the 2010 General Plan with that of the
1996 General Plan.

2. The General Plan addresses issues within a “Planning Area” that includes areas outside the official City limits known as the Sphere of Influence. The City’s sphere of influence
     includes an area to the west bounded by Foothill Boulevard, Rosemead Boulevard, Michillinda Avenue, and Duarte Road, and an area located on the southeastern end of the
     City, around Live Oak Avenue and divided by a small strip of land in Arcadia that connects the majority of the City with the industrial/quarry areas in the south. Figure LU-4
     shows the sphere of influence area on the Land Use Map. For purposes of the General Plan Housing Element, only land within City limits applies.
3. The figures presented in the table are derived from the 80% buildout factor that has been applied to all commercial development. These figures do not take into account
     precise entitled square footage for individual development projects. Such projects―such as the regional shopping mall―are permitted to develop consistent with
     entitlements granted.

General Plan and Zoning
Consistency
The zoning regulations within the Arcadia Municipal Code serve as the
primary implementation tool for the General Plan. Whereas the General
Plan is a policy document and sets forth direction for development
decisions, the Arcadia Municipal Code is a regulatory document that
establishes specific standards for the use and development of all properties
in the City. The Code regulates development intensity using a variety of
methods, such as setting limits on building setbacks, yard landscaping
standards, and building heights. The Code also indicates which land uses
are permitted in the various zones.
The City of Arcadia is a charter city and is governed on the basis of a
charter that establishes its powers and authorities, as contrasted with a
general law city, which enjoys only those powers specifically granted to it
by the State. While general law cities are required by Section 65860 of
the California Government Code to have zoning ordinances that are
consistent with a city’s general plan, zoning ordinances in charter cities like
Arcadia are not required to be consistent with the General Plan.
Nonetheless, the City of Arcadia strives to have a zoning ordinance that is
compatible with the goals and policies in the General Plan, as the
Municipal Code provides the primary means for implementing land use
goals. The City will work to ensure General Plan and zoning consistency by
prohibiting zoning of properties in a manner which is inconsistent or
incompatible with surrounding zoning or land uses, and reviewing
development proposals for consistency with all applicable land use
regulations.
Table LU-3 identifies the correlation between Arcadia’s zoning districts and
the General Plan land use designations.

Introduction
The City of Arcadia is exposed to several sources of noise, including traffic,
sports events, commercial activity, concerts in the park, horse racing at
Santa Anita Park, and periodic occurrences such as construction and
aircraft overflights. Excessive noise levels can affect physical health,
property values, and economic productivity. The control of noise is
therefore essential to achieving community objectives.
Achieving Our Vision
Arcadia residents understand the relationship between noise and peaceful
environments. As part of the visioning process that shaped this General
Plan, community members expressed their desires to minimize adverse
noise conditions in residential neighborhoods and in particular, to guard
against intrusive noise where commercial districts interface with homes.
The Guiding Principles, while not addressing noise directly, promote:
      Balanced Growth and Development
      The General Plan establishes a balance and mix of land uses that
      promote economic growth and maintain a high quality of life for

       Arcadia residents. Our development decisions reflect Smart Growth
       principles and strategies that move us toward enhanced mobility,
       more efficient use of resources and infrastructure, and healthier
       lifestyles.
The Effects of Noise in the
Suburban Environment
In recognition of the adverse health effects associated with excessive noise,
the California Government Code, Section 65302(f) very specifically
identifies the types of community noise to be addressed in the General
Plan. The Noise Element addresses noise sources from:
         Highways and freeways
         Primary arterials and major local streets
         Passenger and freight on-line railroad operations and
          ground rapid transit systems
         Commercial, general aviation, heliport, and military
          airport operations, aircraft over-flights, and all other
          ground facilities and maintenance functions related to
          airport operations
         Local industrial plants
         Other stationary ground noise sources identified by the
          City as contributing to the community noise environment
The interfaces between commercial and residential districts and
noise associated with roadways and Interstate 210 represent
the focus of community noise concerns in Arcadia. Although
train traffic, industrial businesses, and construction and
landscaping activities, for example, also contribute to the ambient noise
environment, these are usually more localized. The City monitors and                 Leaf blowers certainly
regulates noise in recognition of the potentially adverse physical and               make landscape
psychological health affects related to excessive noise and because, as              maintenance easy, but
noted above, low ambient noise levels contribute to quality living                   they are a common
environments.                                                                        source of community
                                                                                     noise complaints.
Understanding Noise
Defining noise with a single unit of measure is difficult because noise
consists of several components—pitch, loudness, and duration—and because
noise includes subjective qualities. In the context of this Noise Element, the
following terms are important to understand.
          Ambient Noise. This refers to the combination of sounds you hear
          in the outdoor environment. Generally, one particular noise source
          is not distinguishable from another.
          Intrusive Noise. This refers to noise, usually from a particular
          location or source, that interrupts an activity.

          events, with weighting factors of five and 10 dBA applied to the
          evening (7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M.) and nighttime (10:00 P.M. to

          Leq. This is a measurement that represents the time average sound
          level or equivalent continuous noise level.
The A-weighted sound pressure level, or dBA, is used to describe the sound
environment based on the sensitivity of the human ear. At 60 dBA, noise
can impair a person’s ability to understand what someone else is saying,
and sound levels over 40 to 45 dBA can disturb sleep. A person’s
likelihood of hearing loss strongly increases at prolonged exposure to
sound levels over 85 dBA. Table N-1 lists common sources of noise and
their approximate noise levels.
The State’s General Plan Guidelines identify the following suggested
targets for minimizing adverse community noise affects:

Noise Control
The City’s Municipal Code contains regulations that limit the levels of
stationary source noise. The broad aim is to maintain ambient noise at
acceptable levels, with specific and separate standards established for
residential, commercial, and industrial districts as follows:
         Region          7:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M.       10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.
  Residential Zone                55 dBA                      50 dBA
  Commercial Zone                 65 dBA                      60 dBA
  Industrial Zone                 70 dBA                      70 dBA

Recognizing that construction noise, amplified sound, and noise from late-
night commercial activities near residential neighborhoods represent the
chief sources of intermittent loud noise and noise complaints, the noise
ordinance addresses these sources specifically. Among other provisions,
the ordinance states that “it shall be unlawful for any person to willfully
make or continue, or cause to be made and continued, any loud,
unnecessary and unusual noise which disturbs the peace or quiet of any
neighborhood, or which causes discomfort or annoyance to residents of the
area.”
Title 24 of the California Health and Safety Code establishes an interior
noise standard of 45 dBA for multiple residential unit and hotel/motel
structures. Acoustical studies must be prepared for proposed multifamily
residential developments and hotel/motels within the CNEL noise contours
of 60 dBA or greater. The studies must demonstrate that the design of the
building will reduce interior noise to 45 dBA CNEL or lower.
Noise Sources and Conditions in
Arcadia
Transportation Noise – Baseline 2008
As is the case in many suburban communities, street and freeway traffic
represent the dominant sources of noise in Arcadia. Interstate 210, which
traverses the northern portion of the City, has abutting residential
neighborhoods on both the north and south sides which historically have
been exposed to noise levels exceeding 65 CNEL. The Los Angeles County
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) began to address long-
standing freeway noise issues in 2008-09 with the construction of
substantial sound walls within portions of Arcadia (from the western
boundary to Baldwin Avenue).3 Sound walls are to be completed on both
the north and south sides of the freeway from Santa Anita Avenue in
Arcadia to Huntington Drive and California Avenue in Monrovia. Metro’s
funding, as of 2010, does not provide for sound walls between Baldwin and
Santa Anita Avenues. Metro applies its adopted Sound Wall
Implementation Policy and uses ranking criteria to prioritize sound wall
programs throughout Los Angeles County. Funding for gap closure in
Arcadia could occur as a result of Metro’s periodic review of priorities and
funding availability.
Traffic along major roadways—Baldwin Avenue, Santa Anita Avenue,
Foothill Boulevard, Huntington Drive, Duarte Road, Las Tunas Drive, and
Live Oak Avenue—and at major intersections impacts the residential
neighborhoods in the immediate vicinity.
3
    In 1989, SB 45 transferred the responsibility for sound wall construction from
Caltrans to regional transportation planning agencies, which in Los Angeles
County is Metro. Thus, Metro oversees the I-210 sound wall construction project.

With the planned opening of Metro Gold Line light rail service into and
through Arcadia, train noise will represent a reintroduced noise source.
Freight and passenger trains once traveled along rail routes through the
City, but they ceased in 1994. Light rail commuter trains will use the same
route as the prior trains, but they do not create comparable noise levels to
the heavier diesel locomotives and long trains of the past. With the
crossing of Santa Anita Avenue to be grade separated, the need to sound
train horns in Arcadia will be minimized. Nonetheless, residents and
businesses will find themselves readjusting to the presence of train noise.
Aircraft overflights represent another transportation-related noise source.
Aircraft using El Monte Airport, located approximately one and one-
quarter mile south of Live Oak Avenue, occasionally fly at low levels over
Arcadia.
In July 2008, 24-hour noise measurements were taken to establish
baseline noise conditions at key locations in the City: near I-210, along
South Santa Anita Avenue, near Santa Anita Park (to document noise
associated with race track operations), and near railroad lines where Gold
Line service will occur.4 In addition to the 24-hour noise measurements, 13
sites around Arcadia were chosen for short-term measurements. (The
measurements were obtained prior to completion of sound wall
construction.) With regard to the transportation noise sources, the
measurements revealed:

       Railroad Right-of-way: At Newcastle Park near the railroad tracks
        on Colorado Boulevard, noise levels were measured at 60.0 dBA
        CNEL, with hourly noise levels ranging from 49.7 to 60.9 dBA Leq.
        The main contribution of noise in the area was mainly traffic noise
        on Colorado Boulevard. At the time measurements were made,
        Gold Line service had not begun.
       South Santa Anita Avenue at Longden Avenue: Noise levels
        measured within a residential neighborhood adjacent to South
        Santa Anita Avenue measured 68.1 dBA CNEL, with hourly noise
        levels ranging from 53.8 to 66.1 dBA Leq. Noise levels were
        generally constant and dependent on traffic conditions. The
        highest noise levels generally occur during the daytime rush hours
        between 6:00 A.M. and 9:00 A.M.

Noise monitoring results from the short-term measurements indicated that
generally, areas adjacent to I-210 and Foothill Boulevard, Campus Avenue,
Duarte Road, Michillinda Avenue, and Huntington Drive experience the
highest noise levels. The lowest noise levels occur along local streets in
residential neighborhoods, averaging 51.9 dBA Leq. The highest recorded
level was 69.9 dBA Leq at Foothill Boulevard at Oakdale Lane, attributed
to vehicle traffic on Foothill Boulevard.
Figure N-1 indicates ambient CNEL noise levels reflective of the noise
measurements for baseline year 2008, largely attributable to
transportation sources.
The State regulates noise generated by individual vehicles; thus, the City
cannot establish noise limits for cars and trucks. However, the Police
Department enforces State vehicle code standards. State law prohibits
vehicles from using any sound amplification system that can be heard from
50 feet away from a vehicle. State law also requires the use of adequate
mufflers to prevent excessive or unusual noise.
Stationary Source Noise
Stationary noise generators in Arcadia include Santa Anita Park (during
racing seasons), industrial businesses with outdoor operations, and
commercial businesses that have outdoor entertainment, late-night
activities, and extensive truck traffic. The impacts of these uses are
localized. Other stationary noise sources include everyday activities such as
construction and gardening equipment. Stationary noises can be as
disruptive as background traffic noise.
Noise studies performed in 2006 in the vicinity of Santa Anita Park while
races were occurring indicated that the sounds of loudspeakers and other
non-traffic related noise sources do not result in particularly loud nuisance
noise within surrounding neighborhoods,5 although the immediately
adjacent residents do hear the loudspeakers.
Anticipated Future Noise
Conditions
Over the life of this General Plan, the key change that will affect the local
noise environment will be establishment of Gold Line light rail service to the
Downtown station. Train motion along the tracks and the sounding of train
horns for approaches to at-grade street crossings will create new noise
sources. Based on Metro’s projections for service frequency and types of       Establishment of Gold
engines and train cars used, noise mitigation will be required at select       Line light rail service
locations in Arcadia, as identified schematically in Figure N-2.               to Arcadia will include
                                                                               appropriate noise and
                                                                               vibration mitigation.

                                                   Figure N-2: Train Noise Mitigation Areas
The features required include sound walls to shield residences west of
Santa Anita Avenue and generally east of Fifth Avenue. Because the train
tracks will be elevated over Santa Anita Avenue, this configuration will
reduce train horn noise since the trains are only required to use horns when
approaching at-grade crossings. As Metro prepares detailed design plans
for the Gold Line, the City anticipates that noise-reduction strategies will
evolve along the train route, and the City’s commitment is to make sure
Metro incorporates measures to achieve the noise/land use compatibility
criteria established in this element.
With regard to roadway noise, Figure N-3 identifies the noise contours
associated with projected 2035 roadway traffic volumes. The noise
analysis conducted for the General Plan determined that although traffic
levels along key streets will increase over the long term, the associated
traffic noise increases along the routes illustrated in Figure N-3 will be less
than 1.5 dBA CNEL. Given that the industry standard for assessing
whether noise increases are generally perceptible to most people is 3.0
dBA CNEL, future roadway noise in Arcadia will not create any new
conditions of concern.

Achieving Noise/Land Use
Compatibility
Land Use Siting Guidelines
Historically, Arcadia has used a very traditional and practical approach to
protecting residential neighborhoods and noise-sensitive receptors such as
schools and the Methodist Hospital from potentially harmful noise sources.
Large-scale industrial businesses generally are clustered in a district at the
southeast end of the City. Commercial uses largely occur along major
roadway corridors, and the regional shopping center and race track
property are separated from surrounding residential neighborhoods by
expanses of parking lots. Land use planning decisions have been and will
continue to be guided by the Noise/Land Use Compatibility Criteria set
forth in Figure N-4. The more detailed criteria set forth in Table N-2 will be
used on a project-specific basis.

Within mixed-use development districts in Downtown and along Live Oak
Avenue, higher ambient noise levels—relative to a strictly low-density
residential neighborhood—are generally acceptable due to residents’
expectations for a livelier environment. The Noise/Land Use Compatibility
Criteria allow for higher ambient (CNEL) noise levels for residential
development within areas designated High Density Residential, Mixed Use,
and Downtown Mixed Use. However, where mixed-use is allowed in
Arcadia, and where residential neighborhoods directly interface with
commercial development, such as in the neighborhoods south of Downtown
and surrounding First Avenue, careful review of site design and operational
characteristics of individual commercial uses will allow the City to address
any site-specific noise concerns through design and operational conditions
applied to individual projects.
Use of the Noise Ordinance
As described above, the City uses the Noise Ordinance to preserve
acceptable community ambient noise levels. The City's approach involves
regulating land use activities by either: 1) controlling nuisance noise at its
source, and/or 2) integrating noise buffering techniques into new
development projects to protect adjacent noise-sensitive uses such as
schools, churches, and Methodist Hospital. Noise ordinance regulations
address nuisance noise issues, including construction noise and noise from
landscape equipment, through limitations on the hours these activities can
occur. For on-site noises associated with specific land use or activities,
project-specific development and operational conditions are applied at the
time project approvals are given. Such conditions may require, for example,
use of boundary walls or building orientation to shield potential noise
sources (like loading or trash pick-up operations), location of parking lots,
or limitation on hours of operation. These approaches will continue to be
used.
Goals and Policies
The City’s goals and policies regarding noise are to minimize adverse noise
impacts on residents and people who come to Arcadia for work and
entertainment, and to preserve a quality noise environment for City
residents. Arcadia will maintain a peaceful environment by identifying
noise impacts and mitigating noise problems through application of
noise/land use compatibility criteria and acoustical treatments.
Transportation is the dominant source of noise in the City. However, the
City has limited ability to abate vehicle-generated noise. The City, through
the Police Department, can enforce the State’s established noise limits for
vehicles by citing noise offenders whose engines, exhaust, or music systems
create noise beyond defined limits. With regard to freeway noise, the City
will continue to work within the construct of Caltrans’ programs (as
implemented by Metro) to have freeway sound walls completed. New
technology in transportation infrastructure will be explored to attenuate
sound.

Introduction
The parks, recreation and cultural facilities and programs, school system,
and historic buildings and places in Arcadia distinguish the community.
Residents often cite these factors among the reasons they moved here.
Public open spaces and facilities are where people come together to
exercise and enjoy the company of others. They provide forums where
Arcadians can enrich their lives through learning and connecting with
nature, and where Arcadians can appreciate and celebrate arts and
cultural diversity. This element addresses Arcadia’s plan for the continual
provision and maintenance of the parks, recreation, and community
resources that are important to Arcadia’s quality of life.
Arcadia has made a strong commitment to providing the highest quality
and variety of recreational, cultural, educational, and social service
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                       Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources | 7-1

programs to respond to residents’ needs. Given the City’s long-standing
policy of providing quality community services, this element broadly defines
Arcadia’s resources to include:
       Parks and Open Space
       Maintaining the Urban Forest
       Recreation and Community Services Facilities and Programs
       Educational Resources
       Cultural Resources and Preservation
       A Plan For a Healthy Community
Achieving Our Vision
Arcadia’s vision is to create a city rich with parks and open spaces,
community facilities, and historic and cultural resources that will remain
assets for future generations of Arcadians. As part of this vision, the City
will seek to create a diverse range of spaces that complement the City’s
form-spaces that make best use of available land such as mini-parks,
community gardens, and quasi-public spaces such as plazas and squares.
The City will seek to establish new community and cultural facilities that
respond to community needs. Arcadia will work to retain the great open
spaces that currently exist, such as Wilderness Park, and ensure that
Arcadia will always have enough parks that are accessible to the
community. Arcadia will also proactively work to preserve those historic
resources that are important to the background of the City, ensuring that
valuable sites remain to help tell the local history of Arcadia. The General
Plan Guiding Principles direct the City’s commitment to providing the
resources that make Arcadia special. The Guiding Principles promote:
       Preservation of Special Assets
        Arcadia’s quality of life is enhanced by special places and features
        such as Santa Anita Park, the Los Angeles County Arboretum and
        Botanic Gardens and Arcadia Park, a vibrant Downtown, the urban
        forest, attractive streetscapes, diverse parks, hi
        storic buildings and places, and nearby views of the mountains.
        These assets are preserved and enhanced so they continue to
        contribute to our City’s character.
       City Services
        The high quality services the City provides are a source of civic
        pride and bring us together as a community. We adjust service
        needs in response to demographic changes, and we take actions to
        provide funding to support these services.
       Schools
        Our schools are a valuable community asset. The quality of the
        schools draws people to our City. We remain committed to working
        with the school district to achieve mutually beneficial goals.
7-2 | Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources                       Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

        Cultural Diversity
         We embrace and celebrate the cultural diversity of Arcadia. Our
         lives are enriched by the many cultures that contribute their arts,
         food, values, and customs to our community. We promote activities
         and programs that strengthen these community bonds.
        Balanced Growth and Development
         The General Plan establishes a balance and mix of land uses that
         promote economic growth and maintain a high quality of life for
         Arcadia residents. Our development decisions reflect Smart
         Growth principles and strategies that move us toward enhanced
         mobility, more efficient use of resources and infrastructure, and
         healthier lifestyles.
Scope of this Element
State law requires that the General Plan address open space lands and the
functions they serve in a community as:
        Places for active and passive recreation,
        Places where biological resources can be preserved and protected,
        Lands that cannot be developed due to physical conditions, such as
         earthquake fault zones or severe slopes, and
        Places used for the managed production of natural resources, such
         as groundwater recharge basins.
In response, communities often prepare elements that focus only on
physical open spaces—parks in particular—and natural resource lands.
However, open space lands often have associated development that
complements the open spaces. This is often the case in urbanized cities like
Arcadia, a good example of which is the Civic Center with the adjoining
athletic field. Thus, this Parks, Recreation and Community Resources
Element addresses not just open spaces but the broad range of community,
cultural, and educational resources and services that Arcadia offers.
The City has adopted two key planning documents related to community
resources reflected in this element and that, if amended over time, will be
consistent with longer-range objectives set forth here.
        Parks and Recreation Master Plan. Adopted in 2007, the Parks
         and Recreation Master Plan was the first document to consolidate
         City goals and strategies regarding park spaces and recreation
         programs. As part of this comprehensive master planning effort,
         the City established a standard for parkland provision/acquisition
         based on population. Standards in the plan are used to maintain
         park and recreational facilities impact fees commensurate with the
         cost of developing new facilities.
        Recreation and Community Services Strategic Plan. Adopted in
         2006, the Recreation and Community Services Strategic Plan was
         developed to assess the effectiveness of City parks, facilities, and
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                     Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources | 7-3

         recreation programs, and to identify priorities for providing new
         recreational facilities, recreation programs, and services based on
         changing demographics and community desires.
Parks and Open Space
Parks promote community health by providing places for outdoor
recreation, enjoyment of trees and nature, personal development, and
interacting with others. Arcadia is fortunate to have many different types
and sizes of parks distributed throughout the community that enhance the
beauty and character of Arcadia. They serve as places to gather and
engage in active and passive recreation. Research shows that when people
have access to parks, they exercise more. Regular physical activity has
been shown to increase health and reduce the risk of a wide range of
diseases, contributing to a healthier community.1 The goals, policies, and
programs in this element promote many types
of parks and open spaces that help make                                                Parks can be
Arcadia a healthy city.                                                                places for people
                                                                                       and pooches.
Arcadia has many parks and open spaces to
serve the needs of the community, from small
parks that provide compact green spaces
within a neighborhood, to sports fields that
have facilities for activities such as softball,
soccer, and tennis. As of 2009, the City had
approximately 785 acres of City and County
parks and recreational open space within its
corporate limits. The County of Los Angeles
operates four large recreation facilities within
Arcadia.      Also, the City has a joint-use
agreement with the Arcadia Unified School
District to allow residents’ use of school
facilities such as ball fields and courts.
Park Classifications
Parks in Arcadia range in size from the 0.24-acre Tripolis Friendship Park
to the 120-acre Wilderness Park. Depending on size, each park offers
differing levels of recreation use, from purely passive recreation to heavily
programmed use. Parks are classified as follows:
        Mini-Parks. Mini-parks, also known as pocket parks, are generally
         one acre in size or smaller and contain passive facilities such as
         small landscaped spaces with benches and picnic tables. Mini-
         parks may provide playground equipment for children. These parks
         are intended to service the immediate neighborhood within one-
         half mile of the park.

        Neighborhood Parks. Neighborhood parks are typically between
         two to 10 acres in size. Neighborhood parks can include passive
         open space, active play areas, and limited practice and play fields.
         As with mini-parks, neighborhood parks service the immediate
         neighborhood and have a service area of approximately one-half
         mile.
        Community Parks. Community parks are usually between 11 and 20
         acres in size. Community parks serve a broader purpose than
         neighborhood parks, accommodating more formal and highly
         programmed activities. A community park usually serves several
         neighborhoods. Wilderness Park is the only City-owned community
         park in Arcadia, so classified based on its size.
        Special Use Parks. Special use parks are parks that have facilities
         developed for a special purpose. Examples include skate parks,
         dog parks, and golf courses.
        Joint-Use Parks and Facilities. Joint-use parks and facilities are
         those located on a portion of school-owned land. The Arcadia
         Unified School District and the City have a joint-use agreement to
         allow use of recreational facilities on school property.
        County Operated/Owned Parks and Facilities. Los Angeles
         County maintains parks and recreation facilities within Arcadia:
         Arcadia Park and the Peck Road Water Conservation Park. These
         parks have significant recreational facilities that provide areas for
         community events and gatherings and service the larger region.
         Also in Arcadia are two unique County open space and recreation
         facilities: the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden
         and Santa Anita Golf Course. The County charges entrance and
         usage fee for both facilities.                                            Arcadia High School’s turf

residents, and Figure PR-1 shows the locations.
Shared Use of School Facilities
Public school facilities in Arcadia offer additional places where residents
can enjoy outdoor recreation. Access is made available via joint-use
agreements that allow general public access when school is not in session,
or with some type of applied user fee. This arrangement maximizes the
usage of publicly funded facilities and provides better service to the
community. Because Arcadia is largely built out, creative use of school
fields and sports courts has helped expand the City’s ability to offer
organized sports programs and for private sports groups to remain local.
The joint-use agreement between the City and the Arcadia Unified School
District allows access to lighted baseball and softball fields, all-weather
running tracks, and tennis and basketball courts.

Special Use Parks
Special use parks are recreational facilities designed for a unique purpose.
Although some special use parks have limited accessibility due to usage or
reservation fees, these parks supplement local recreational opportunities
by providing specific recreational facilities that meet specialized
community needs. Bonita Skate Park has 10,700 square feet of concrete
for skateboarders and skaters to practice their skills and take classes.
Arcadia’s 18-hole par-3 golf course and the Los Angeles County owned and
operated Santa Anita golf course are available to anyone paying the
greens fees. Both golf courses have banquet halls, snack bars, and golf
practice facilities.
The Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanical Garden is a major
regional destination in the San Gabriel Valley. The Arboretum, once part
of the Lucky Baldwin estate, is a 127-acre botanical garden and historical
site that contains a wide array of plants and vegetation and several
significant historic structures. The Arboretum hosts numerous special
events throughout the year such as outdoor concerts, educational tours,
and plant shows. The historic structures are discussed in the Cultural
Resources and Preservation section below.

Park Facility Standards and
Service Area
In 2007, the City prepared a Parks and Recreation Master Plan and
adopted its first park standards to establish defined objectives for meeting
park needs in the future. In the Parks and Recreation Master Plan, the City
established a citywide goal of providing 2.43 acres of parkland per 1,000
residents.2
Although all parks and recreation facilties and open spaces are important
components to the quality of life of Arcadians, certain recreation areas
cannot be counted toward developed parkland because either: 1) they are
not developed or maintained by the City of Arcadia, such as County parks
located within the City, or 2) they pose access issues to residents such as a
usage fee for entering or restrictions on the availability of use, or are open
space lands that are unimproved and cannot be utilized. As a result, the
park facility standard excludes certain facilities (see Table PR-2). Also,
although the City has joint-use agreements with Arcadia Unified School
District for the use of its facilities, the facilities are shared by private groups
as well, limiting full access. Thus, the inventory of available parks/open
space includes a 50 percent reduction of the total joint-use facilities
acreage. In the Master Plan, every one acre of unimproved land has been
assigned an equivalent of 0.59 acres of improved parkland.

With the above assumptions, the City has calculated a parkland inventory
of 135.13 acres. Based on a 2009 population estimate of 56,547 persons,3
Arcadia provides 2.38 acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, slightly below
the goal of 2.43 acres.
To address the deficit and anticipate a modest population increase over
time, the City will expand the definition of “park space” to include public
plazas and gathering places that will be provided in Downtown. Also,
wherever opportunities exist to add acreage to established parks, they will
be pursued.
Access to park facilities is also an important measure of quality park
service. While recognizing the importance of acreage standards to
measure progress toward goals, the City is also focused on locating parks
so that all residents have easy access. Service area standards
recommended by the National Recreation and Parks Association (NRPA)
indicate that a park typically should cover a one-quarter to one-half- mile
service area radius, depending on the size and function of the park. The
NRPA guidelines diagrammed in Figure PR-2 have been applied to City-
owned park facilities and joint-use facilities listed in Table PR-1. The same
facilities that were excluded from the Park Facility Standard calculation
have also been omitted from the analysis of park facility service areas.
Based on this standard, several residential areas in Arcadia can be
considered underserved. Notably, residential neighborhoods along the
western edge of the City do not have ready access to any City-owned
parks. Thus, while Arcadia is close to achieving its goals for providing
parkland acreage, that acreage is concentrated in large park and open
space areas; parks are not optimally located and distributed. However,
several parks and recreation facilities owned and operated by the County
or adjacent cities are near City boundaries. The use and enjoyment of
these parks are shared by both Arcadians and residents of adjacent
communities. Figure PR-1 shows parks and recreation facilities that
although are not part of Arcadia’s inventory, nonetheless are used by
Arcadia residents.
Although private open space and facilities supplement public recreational
spaces, these private amenities are not accessible to the general public
and thus are not included as local resources.

Park Facilities Acquisition and
Maintenance
Funding
Consistent funding sources are needed to maintain Arcadia’s parks and
provide new public open space and recreation areas. The City has
established a Parks and Recreation fund and imposes an assessment at the
issuance of a building permit for all new residential construction. The funds
are used for the acquisition and improvement of public parks and
playgrounds.
Maintenance and Rehabilitation
In 2000, the City conducted a Playground Safety Audit and Parks
Infrastructure Analysis. The analysis was used to establish the Fifteen-Year
Parks Rehabilitation Master Plan, approved in 2001, for renovation of
existing park sites and playground equipment. The Master Plan establishes
City policy direction to bring the facilities up to the high standards the
community expects.
Innovative Use of Spaces for Parks and
Recreation Activities
Undeveloped space for future parks and recreation facilities is virtually
unavailable in Arcadia. However, innovative uses and design of projects          For additional
can help provide supplemental public open spaces and recreational areas.         discussion of the use of
Easements can work as linear parks, where walking, jogging, and bike trails      utility easements as an

and places that can be programmed for community events, similar to the
popular summer concerts that are held on the Civic Center lawn. Arcadia
will seek to work with private developers and owners of utility and similar
easement to jointly plan, design, and develop active and passive open
spaces for community benefit.
Open Space Resources
Parks are considered developed open space. However, as noted above,
open space also includes places where biological resources can be
preserved and protected, and places used for the managed production of
natural resources, such as groundwater recharge basins. Undeveloped or
protected open spaces give residents access to nature, create boundaries
for urban growth, absorb storm water, and can provide opportunities for
recreation. Arcadia’s location adjacent to the Angeles National Forest and

the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains balance the urban character of
the City with a natural environment.
Arcadia Wilderness Park
Arcadia Wilderness Park is a natural open space park located in the San
Gabriel Mountains in north Arcadia. The park’s 120 acres offer places for
hiking and picnicking. Visitors can experience and learn more about the
important ecological functions of
this natural space by visiting the
nature center and pond. The
2007 Parks and Recreation
Master Plan identified the
Arcadia Wilderness Park as
needing renovations, with many
of the facilities in the park
outdated and non-compliant
with     the    Americans      with
Disabilities Act (ADA).        The
Master Plan indicates that
expansion of the Wilderness
Park nature center would
accommodate more exhibits and
programmable space.
Peck Road Water Conservation Park
Located at the southeast corner of the City along the Rio Hondo River,
Peck Road Water Conservation Park, managed by Los Angeles County,
has approximately 120 acres of open space. While the primary park
functions are to facilitate groundwater recharge and provide flood control
capabilities, Arcadia residents can visit the park for hiking, fishing, and bird
watching.
Goals and Policies
While Arcadia has varied park facilities and other usable open space
resources, parks are not well distributed throughout the community; many
residential neighborhoods do not have ready access to even small-scale
parks. Thus, the planning priority regarding parks is to pursue innovative
strategies to create new park, recreation, and public spaces, and to
provide better access to existing parks by pedestrian, bicycle, and transit
linkages. In more densely developed areas such as Downtown or along
Baldwin Avenue, this space may take the form of public plazas or similar
areas where residents can gather. Creative design and joint or multiple
uses of spaces are examples of methods the City will explore, including
joint-use arrangements with private entities, the County, and neighboring
jurisdictions.

Maintaining the Urban
Forest
The       trees     along        Arcadia’s
boulevards and throughout the
residential neighborhoods create an
“urban forest” that enhances the
aesthetic quality of the City. The
trees also provide cooling shade,
absorb greenhouse gases and help
clean the air, increase property
values, and control soil erosion. The
urban forest is comprised of street
trees, trees on parks and other
public lands, and trees on private
properties throughout Arcadia. Arcadia has been designated as a “Tree
City USA,”4 meeting these four standards: 1) having a tree department or
board, 2) adopting a tree care ordinance, 3) maintaining a community
forestry program with a budget of at least $2 per capita, and 4) having an
Arbor Day observance and proclamation.
Public Trees
Public trees are trees on public property, including those in City parks,
within street medians and along parkways, and on other public properties.
Public trees add character to the neighborhoods and distinguish Arcadia
as a tree city. The City maintains more than 17,000 public trees. The
Municipal Code includes an entire chapter devoted to a comprehensive                The Community Design
public tree management program, and the City has adopted a street tree              section of the Land Use and
                                                                                    Community Design Element

within 12 feet from the curb or edge of pavement) are private trees, with
maintenance the responsibility of the homeowner or business owner.
However, Municipal Code provisions clearly spell out City versus property
owner responsibilities and City objectives for “conserving and enhancing
the distinctive and unique aesthetic character of many areas in the City”
through the street tree program. 5

Landmark
Trees
In 1992 the City Council
adopted      an     ordinance
recognizing oak trees as
significant aesthetic and
ecological resources. The
ordinance          established
criteria for the preservation
of oak trees.              The
regulations     (Article    IX,
Chapter 7 of the Arcadia Municipal Code) provides that Engelmann Oak,
Coast Live Oak, California Live Oak, and any other living oak trees shall
not be removed, relocated, damaged, or have their protected zones
encroached upon unless an Oak Tree Permit is granted.
Goals and Policies
With programs firmly in place to preserve Arcadia’s status as a Tree City
USA, planning priorities regarding the urban forest focus on maintaining
those policies and programs that allow trees to continue to make a

Recreation and
Community Services
Facilities and Programs
Recreation and community services facilities and programs contribute
substantially to the social, mental, and physical well-being of community
members; they also foster an inclusive community by providing places and
activities where people of all ages and backgrounds can engage. Arcadia
has long history of sponsoring community programs and events that
respond to the specific recreation and social service interests and needs of
all residents, with programs constantly adjusted to reflect changing
demographics. Many activities occur at the community centers and parks,
although joint-use agreements have expanded the opportunities to meet
community needs. Through the provision of quality community facilities and
programs, the City promotes active engagement that improves residents’
health, responds to basic human needs, involves people in volunteer work,
and brings together people of diverse backgrounds.
Community Facilities
The Community Center and other facilities host many social, cultural, and
civic activities. These facilities provide venues for annual events such as
the Holiday Festival at the Community Center and the Summer Concert
Series on the City Hall Lawn, as well as small community programs such as
computer training and exercise classes. These events support culture and
entertainment in the City and build community bonds.
Arcadia has a single community center/senior center that provides multi-
purpose space for recreation, enrichment, and educational classes and
activities. The center is available to local civic and non-profit organizations
for activities and programs that contribute to the social, cultural, human
service, recreational, and civic needs and interests of Arcadia residents.
Demands on this single facility are significant; thus, the City Library,
facilities at Arcadia Park, and local school campuses are used to expand
program capacity. As described in the 2007 Parks and Recreation Master
Plan, the City will continue to pursue creative ways of supplementing
community center spaces and alleviate demand by retrofitting facilities to
serve multiple functions, developing new facilities when feasible, and
exploring the use of underutilized commercial spaces for community use.
Arcadia’s population, like much of the rest of the country, is expected to
age. This factor, combined with increasing adult interest in sports and
enrichment programs the City offers, will put increased demand on limited
community facilities, particularly those that serve senior residents. Many
local non-profit and faith-based organizations provide activities and
services in their own facilities, and these facilities represent a possible
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                      Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources | 7-25

resource for joint use. Other potential locations that can be explored for
shared use include Santa Anita Park, including any subsequent private
development on race track properties, and the regional mall. At many
indoor malls throughout the country, groups of walkers have organized
activities, and theaters are available for classroom space.
The Recreation and Community Services Department’s 2006 Strategic
Plan complements the Parks and Recreation Master Plan by identifying
priorities for the development of facilities. Facilities cited as a need include
a performance arts theater, a community gymnasium, and a youth center.
In 2008, the City Council and the Arcadia Unified School District Board
agreed to a joint project to construct a joint-use gymnasium at Dana
Middle School. Priorities within the Strategic Plan will continually be
evaluated as opportunities arise.

Recreation and Community
Services
The Recreation and Community Services Department has the chief
responsibility of developing and running recreation and related programs,
with advisory support from two City commissions: the Recreation and Parks
Commission and the Senior Citizens’ Commission. Together with these
volunteer commissions, the Department manages programs and activities
that meet the needs of the community.
Popular activities include active
sports; drop-in programs for youth,
teens, and seniors; and special
family events. Most classes are
fee-based programs, although
some programs are free. The
Youth       Opportunity        Grant
Program, funded by the federal
Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) Program, provides
resources for low-income residents
to participate in Recreation and
Community Services activities,
classes, and excursions that they
may not otherwise afford. In
addition to the collaboration with
the Arcadia Unified School
District, the Department works with the Arcadia Library and Museum
Services Department for joint programs, class space, and shared resources.
The key concern of the Department is ensuring that programs respond to
changing community desires and needs. As noted above, an aging
population and increased adult interest in Arcadia’s programs will require
the City to continually assess and adjust programs, and to make sure that
appropriate facilities are available to support those programs. Also, in
times of financial challenge, the City may find it necessary to reduce
spending on non-essential community programs and services or to adjust
user fees.
Meeting the Needs of Senior Residents
The Senior Citizen Services Division of the Recreation and Community
Services Department organizes recreation programs directed at Arcadia’s
senior residents (50 years and older). For residents 65 years of age and
older, more extensive programs are offered to foster social interaction,
stimulate minds, and keep seniors in good physical health. Programs
include lectures, workshops, dances, fitness activities, dinners, travel and
social clubs, classes, games, and special events. Seniors also can receive
health screenings, and counseling is available to promote seniors’
independence by providing access to information, assistance, and
7-28 | Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources                   Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

knowledge of resources that can help them live at home. The Arcadia
Community Center is the hub of activity for senior programs.
Arcadia’s Youth
The Youth Master Plan, which the City updates as needed, assesses the
recreation needs of Arcadia’s youth and identifies what types of programs,
facilities, and funding are needed to accommodate those needs. Typical
programs include:
        Tots Classes: The variety of classes range from pee wee sports to
         dance classes and tumbling classes geared towards teaching
         children basic physical skills.
        Youth-Oriented Programs: Youth programs respond to the needs
         of youth to stay engaged during non-school hours in productive
         activities, and accommodate and encourage their diverse interests.
         The City offers such activities as martial arts classes, dance classes,
         instructional sports classes, organized intramural sports leagues,
         and day camps.
        After-School Programs: The Arcadia Recreation and Community
         Services Department offers after-school programs at the
         elementary, middle, and high school levels that offer recreational
         activities for participants. All elementary schools offer a free drop-
         in program for children in grades 1 through 5 that include organized
         recreation.
        Drop-In Zone: The Arcadia Recreation and Community Services
         Department has a free drop-in program at the City’s Public Library
         for youth in grades 6 through 8. The program offers indoor and
         outdoor programs, including sports, crafts, table games, and video
         games.
        Apache Pit: Students in high school can participate in the Apache
         Pit, a free after school drop-in program courtesy of the Arcadia
         Recreation and Community Services Department.
        Private Organizations: In addition to programs and recreational
         resources devoted to the City’s youth, numerous private
         organizations provide programs for youth. Examples include, Little
         League and Pony Baseball, Arcadia Youth Basketball, Junior All
         American Football, AYSO (soccer), and Arcadia Indian
         Cheerleading, programs offered by the Boy and Girl Scouts, and
         Youth Ministry, among others.

Goals and Policies
The City recognizes that public/public and public/private partnerships will
continue to be the best means of providing places and programs for the
community to engage. With the senior population projected to grow,
longer-term needs will likely include expanded facilities and programs
geared toward this population. Other priority needs have been identified
in the Department of Recreation and Community Services 2006 Strategic
Plan, including more after-school activities for youth (given parents’ work
demands), recreation programs for adults, and development of new
facilities such as multi-purpose community facility, a community gymnasium,
and a performing arts center. In conjunction with meeting long-term facility
needs, the City recognizes the need to continually maintain existing
community events, activities, and programs, and to develop and promote
new ones to meet the changing needs and demands of Arcadians.
Goal PR-4:                   A network of City, school, and private
                             community facilities that provides spaces for
                             recreation, education, enrichment, and social

                             purpose building, which can provide additional
                             space for emerging and evolving community
                             needs. Examine how such facilities might be
                             incorporated onto the grounds surrounding City

Educational Resources
Education occurs throughout our lives. Even after we have completed high
school or college or training in a technical trade to prepare us for careers,
we continue to learn as adults for personal enrichment and professional
growth. As older or retired residents, we find continued learning important
for adapting to changed life circumstances or connecting with younger
generations. A community that values and
promotes education and learning benefits its
residents and businesses. An educated
community contributes to economic success, and
keeps youth and adults engaged in productive
activities. High-quality schools and libraries
provide a positive learning environment, and a
high-quality educational system positively
influences the future of Arcadia’s children and
the City itself. Arcadians value education, as
seen in the investment in the Arcadia Unified
School District and local private schools and
residents’ participation in educational programs
sponsored by the City.
School Facilities
The Arcadia Unified School District (AUSD) provides academic services to
most City residents, with portions of neighborhoods along the east and
south City boundaries lying within the Pasadena Unified, Temple City
Unified, El Monte City, El Monte High School, and Monrovia Unified school
districts. AUSD receives consistent recognition for high academic
achievement, and AUSD schools have the reputation of providing quality,
academically challenging educational programs that result in high student
achievement. On standardized tests, Arcadia students consistently score
well above State and national averages. Many people cite AUSD schools as
a key reason for moving to Arcadia.
In addition to its core mission to educate Arcadia’s youth, AUSD and the
City have partnered to make available school recreation and enrichment
programs and facilities to supplement those of the City. Success in all local
districts has been facilitated by considerable community involvement of
parent groups such as Parent Teacher Associations, booster clubs, the
Intercultural Committee within the AUSD, and music clubs.
AUSD serves a student population (grades kindergarten through 12) of
approximately 10,000 youth, and has six elementary schools, three middle
schools, and one high school (see Figure PR-4). Table PR-4 lists the AUSD
schools that serve Arcadia. Students from neighboring cities can also
attend AUSD schools on a space-available basis through interdistrict
transfers. In addition to AUSD, five neighboring school districts also serve

AUSD that have enrollment areas within Arcadia or the sphere of influence
are Rio Hondo School and Clemison Elementary (El Monte School District);
Arroyo High (El Monte High School District); Plymouth Elementary, Santa
Fe Middle, and Monrovia High (Monrovia Unified School District); Field
Elementary, Willard Elementary, Wilson Middle, Pasadena High, and Blair
High (Pasadena Unified School District); and Longden Elementary, Emperor
Elementary, Temple City High, and Oak Avenue Intermediate (Temple City
Unified School District).
School overcrowding and strains on classrooms have been concerns in
many districts, particularly following class size reductions in the K-3 grades
to 20 students (which allows students in these critical primary years to
receive more focused attention). AUSD has not experienced critical
overcrowding conditions and has capacity to accommodate growth that
may result from long-term implementation of General Plan land use policy.
In addition to public schools, Arcadia is home to many private schools,
including Arcadia Christian School (K-8), Barnhart School (K-8), Holy
Angels Elementary (K-8), and Rio Hondo Preparatory (6-12).
Adult Education
Adult education programs achieve many purposes: providing education
opportunities for people who did not have access earlier in life, creating
paths to supplement job skills, allowing adults to make a career transition,
or for personal development/betterment. The City supports such programs
for its mature residents in recognition that well-rounded and well-educated
adults can attain better job satisfaction, economic security, and personal
fulfillment.
The Recreation and Community Services Department offers classes for
adults that change frequently, ranging from art and music to basic life skills.
AUSD sponsors the Community-Based English Tutoring program, a
program that provides free or subsidized classes to adults wishing to learn
the English language. Arcadia Public Library offers the Learning Lab, a
program supported by the Arcadia Public Library Foundation, which allows
residents to improve their computer and online skills. In addition, the
Library co-sponsors a weekly English conversation class for people looking
to improve their communication skills.

Public Libraries
Libraries are repositories of knowledge and community and cultural assets.
People have access to countless volumes—either in traditional book or
journal form or via the internet—that provide knowledge on any possible
topic a person may wish to learn. Libraries often are also the venue for
cultural programs and provide community space for civic engagement.

City of Arcadia Library
Arcadia has had its own library since 1920, when the former Los Angeles
County Library branch in the City became one of Arcadia’s great civic
resources. The Arcadia Public Library building now on West Duarte Road
was built in 1961 and modernized in 1996 to accommodate expanded
community needs. This 48,000-square-foot facility contains over 190,000
items, from books, magazines, and periodicals to compact discs, digital
video discs, video and audio cassettes, and other electronic resources
available on the Library’s website. Visitors may use computers and other
media in the Tech Center to
access the internet, research,
and share information. During
the school year, local school
children are frequent after-
school visitors, and during the
summer,      they    come      to
participate in summer reading
programs. The Library offers
many programs and activities
that cater to children, youth,
and adults.
Included in the building is a
much-used auditorium with a
seating capacity of 200
persons. The auditorium is
regularly used for Library and
other      City     department
programs,      and     is   also
available      to    community
groups.
The Arcadia Library and Museum Services Department works with the
Recreation and Community Services Department on joint programs, class
space, and shared resources. The Library’s history collection is discussed in
the Cultural Resources and Preservation section that follows.
According to the California State Library’s 2009 Library Statistics, the
statewide mean of providing print materials (books, documents, and serial
volumes) is approximately two print materials per capita. The Arcadia
Public Library exceeds the statewide average, providing 3.51 printed
materials per capita.
Los Angeles County Library - Live Oak
Branch
The 2,890-square-foot Live Oak branch of the Los Angeles County Library
system has a collection that is primarily a popular reading collection, with a
significant collection of children’s books and viewing and listening
7-38 | Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources                    Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

materials. The library’s collection consists of approximately 55,500 items
that include books, paperbacks, magazine, and newspaper titles. The
library has 16 shelves dedicated to Spanish-language material and 35
shelves of materials in Chinese.
Goals and Policies
Promoting quality educational facilities and programs is a priority for the
City, as they reflect the value the community places on education. The
City will encourage and foster increased coordination and communication
with the AUSD and other school districts serving local residents to enhance
and maintain a high quality of educational resources for residents, and to
provide cooperative programs that reach residents of all ages. Arcadia will
continue to require new development to provide appropriate mitigation for
impacts on school and library services.
Goal PR-6:                   Continued superior educational facilities and
                             resources for residents of all ages and
                             backgrounds
     Policy PR-6.1:          Maintain effective lines of communication with
                             the Arcadia Unified School District and other
                             districts serving Arcadia residents to address
                             school planning and financing issues.
     Policy PR-6.2:          Require that new development provide
                             adequate mitigation for impacts on area
                             schools as provided in State law.
     Policy PR-6.3:          Coordinate closely with the Arcadia Unified
                             School District on an ongoing basis to resolve
                             issues such as expanding the joint use of
                             facilities and the use of vacant or underutilized
                             school sites.
     Policy PR-6.4:          Support the development of educational
                             curriculum designed to enhance student
                             awareness of their community.
     Policy PR-6.5:          Support life-long learning for adults through
                             computer training, programs, and library
                             collections.
     Policy PR-6.6:          Use development impact fees to fund City
                             Library facilities, equipment, and programs that
                             are needed as a result of new development
                             projects.

maintains arts and culture venues that celebrate the City’s rich heritage
and that provide a place where residents can share their appreciation for
visual and performing arts. The support of these resources has been
achieved through a combination of City programs, societies, volunteers,
and both private and public sector support.
Cultural/Historic Organizations
and Facilities
Multiple cultural and historic venues celebrate the City’s traditions and
heritage. These places are a source for community enrichment and add to
the special quality that distinguishes Arcadia.            Also, many local
organizations have established missions focused on increasing public
awareness and interest in Arcadia history and culture.
Arcadia’s History
Vestiges of Arcadia’s colorful history can be seen throughout the City. The
Santa Anita Depot, one of the original train stations that brought visitors to
Santa Anita Ranch in the 1900s, has been relocated to the Los Angeles
County Arboretum and Botanic Gardens. Arcadia Grammar School, which
was established to serve the first generations of Arcadians in 1907, has
slowly transformed over the years and is still educating Arcadians today as
First Avenue Middle School. Knowledge and awareness of the people,
places, and events that have helped shape Arcadia are important to
preservation efforts.      Understanding our history and knowing the
contributions those places and people have made to our community help us
easily identify places to preserve for future Arcadians.
Pre- and Early-European History
The earliest inhabitants of the region were the Tongva Indians. Meaning
“people of the earth” in the Tongva language, the Tongvans settled areas
of the Los Angeles basin because of its water sources and terrain
conducive to hunting and gathering. The Tongvans fell into rapid decline
with the arrival of the Spanish and the establishment of the San Gabriel
Mission in 1771. It was during the Mission Period that the Tongvan name
was changed by the Spanish and referred to as Gabrielinos. By the time
Spanish rule gave way to the independent Republic of Mexico in 1821, the
Tongva population that remained was minute and left to work low-level
jobs on Mexican land grants.

Santa Anita Rancho
The land that now forms Arcadia was once a part of the San Gabriel
Mission’s land holdings. However, as power transitioned from the Spanish
to Mexico, the Mission’s land holdings became public land. In 1831,
Scotsman turned Mexican citizen Hugo Reid petitioned the local council to
acquire the Rancho Santa Anita tract that would eventually encompass
Arcadia, Sierra Madre, and Monrovia. He successfully acquired the full title
to 13,319 acres of land in 1845, and as required by the Mexican
government, Reid cultivated the land, raised cattle on the ranch, and it is
believed, built the first permanent structure in Rancho Santa Anita, a three-
room adobe house. The Hugo Reid Adobe house was reconstructed on the
grounds of the Los Angeles County Arboretum. After a series of bad
business decisions, Hugo Reid was forced to sell off Santa Anita Rancho.
Elias “Lucky” Baldwin
After several changes in ownership, the
Rancho was purchased by Elias “Lucky”
Baldwin for $200,000 in 1875. Baldwin
cultivated the land for farming and orchards
and established a working ranch that, at the
time, was known throughout the region for
high-quality livestock and thoroughbred
horses. Later, due to financial necessity,
Baldwin began to subdivide his ranch and sold
portions of Santa Anita Rancho to Nathaniel
Carter and William Monroe (who developed
Sierra Madre and Monrovia, respectively). In
1887, Baldwin executed a contract with the
Los Angeles & San Gabriel Valley Railroad
that exchanged cash and railroad right-of-way
through Baldwin’s tract for the rail access and
construction of two rail depots on Baldwin’s
property. However, the rail line failed to bring
in investors into Baldwin’s Rancho due to its
proximity to the more attractive city of Monrovia. Undeterred, Baldwin
pursued the Santa Fe Railroad line through Santa Anita Rancho, a rail
service that would connect Los Angeles to the Rancho in about half the
time it took the Los Angeles & San Gabriel line, providing a second, and
much faster, direct train connection to the Santa Anita Rancho for visitors
from Los Angeles and Pasadena. Baldwin convinced the Santa Fe Railroad
to build through his tract by offering cheap land and improving his Rancho
by commencing the construction of the Town of Arcadia. The growth of a
town occurred under the careful watch of Baldwin, who built the town’s first
hotel—the Oakwood Hotel—and helped finance the construction of the
Santa Anita Depot across from the Oakwood Hotel on the corner of First
Avenue and Santa Clara Street.
Beginnings of a City
In 1903, the City incorporated, with Elias Baldwin as the first mayor of
Arcadia and government operations occurring out of the Oakwood Hotel.
The City of Arcadia’s beginnings were based on an economy of tourism and
7-42 | Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources                   Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

entertainment. What resulted was a landscape of saloons, gambling halls,
entertainment venues, and horse and dog-racing tracks. The first
incarnation of the Santa Anita Park racetrack opened in 1907 on the land
that is now Arcadia Community Regional Park and Santa Anita Golf
Course. In 1909, California made horseracing illegal, prompting the
closure of the racetrack. A subsequent fire destroyed the grandstand in
1912, and the land remained unused.
Only after Elias Baldwin’s death in 1909 did Arcadia begin to fully change
and function as a complete city. Local citizens sought to change Arcadia’s
image and in 1912, voted to ban the sale of alcoholic beverages to eliminate
Arcadia’s reputation as a pleasure park. In the 1910s, critical infrastructure
and services were established. Streets were paved; water, gas, and electric
systems were developed; and a school, church, and community
organizations were established. City services that were once operating out
of offices of Elias Baldwin’s Oakwood Hotel finally found a home in 1918 in
the first City Hall at the corner of Huntington Drive and First Avenue.
Anita Baldwin and Anoakia
In 1913, an inheritance was bequeathed upon Anita
Baldwin, one of Elias Baldwin’s children, which she
used to convert a portion of the Santa Anita Ranch
land into the Anoakia Stock and Breeding Farm, on
she which she also built her extraordinary home,
Anoakia. Although the lavish estate has since been
demolished, remnants of its walls can still be seen
today along Baldwin Avenue. An important figure
to Arcadia’s growth, Anita Baldwin was a great
benefactor to many of Arcadia’s community
organizations and a supporter of America’s war
efforts, and was largely responsible for selling the
acreage that made up the original Santa Anita
Ranch back to the public. As noted above, she sold
part of her estate for public use. Sold to Los Angeles County, the old field
of the racetrack was in turn deeded to the U.S. War Department. During
World War I, the field was christened Ross Field and used for military
reconnaissance training and a ballooning school. Ross Field has been
turned into the modern day site of Arcadia Community Regional Park.
Community of Homes and Post World War II
Dividing up large tracts of land into smaller residential subdivisions during
the 1930s led to Arcadia’s identity as a “Community of Homes.” Arcadia’s
population more than quadrupled following World War II. During the post-
war boom, the City and Southern California in general experienced
tremendous growth in population and housing. The last remaining fields
dedicated to orchards and poultry farms were sold and developed into
large tracts of single-family homes. Between 1940 and 1960, over 10,000
homes were constructed in Arcadia. In addition to residential development,
the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Gardens opened in 1955,
Arcadia Methodist Hospital was completed in 1957, the Foothill Freeway
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                    Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources | 7-43

was built through the City during the 1960s, and the Santa Anita Fashion
Park (the regional mall) opened in 1975.
Many of the homes and buildings constructed in Arcadia after World War II
have already, or will, reach the age of 50 years old during the time frame
of this General Plan. Fifty years is the common threshold for a property
qualifying as historic in California. Identifying and preserving these
“recently” built structures, as well as districts such as Santa Anita Oaks and
The Highlands, will pose new challenges; more analysis will be necessary to
determine which important characteristics and design features of post-
World War II structures are important to preserve in the community.
Recognized and Potential Historic Places
and Features
Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden
Owned and operated by the County of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles
County Arboretum and Botanic Garden is located in Arcadia on Baldwin
Avenue. The Arboretum houses plant collections from around the world,
including many rare and endangered plant species. Throughout the
Arboretum are outdoor historical landmarks that represent major phases of
California’s history. These resources include:
        The Queen Anne Cottage and Coach Barn: A cottage built by
         Lucky Baldwin in 1881. The architect who designed the cottage was
         also responsible for the designing the California Capitol Building
         dome and the Governor’s mansion in Sacramento (National
         Register of Historic Places and California Historic Landmark).
        The Hugo Reid Adobe: It is believed to be the first permanent
         structure to be built on Rancho Santa Anita, ca. 1840 (California
         Historic Landmark).
        Santa Anita Depot: Constructed in 1890, the two-story Santa Anita
         Depot was the train station for Santa Anita Rancho along the
         Santa Fe Railroad. The building was moved to the Arboretum in
         1967 (California Point of Historical Interest).
Santa Anita Park
Built in 1934, Santa Anita Park is the oldest racetrack in Southern
California. It was designed in the Art Deco style by architect Gordon B.
Kaufman. Major racing events such as the Santa Anita Derby and the
occasional hosting of the Breeders’ Cup draw national and international
visitors and participants. Although races are held seasonally, Santa Anita
Park operates programs that provide activity all year long.
The grandstand, paddock, circular receiving barn, clubhouse, saddling
stalls, and stables are eligible for listing on the California and National
Registers of Historic Places. The Santa Anita Assembly Center (California
Historic Landmark) within the park commemorates the use of the site as a
7-44 | Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources                      Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

temporary relocation camp for Japanese
Americans during World War II. The rich history
of the racetrack, its close identification with
Arcadia through the 20th and 21st centuries, the
distinctive architecture of the grandstand’s
southerly façade, and the high visibility of the
grandstand structure combine to make the
racetrack a significant cultural and historical
landmark.
The City of Arcadia is committed to supporting
the continuation of thoroughbred horse racing
at Santa Anita Park. With the decline in
attendance at the racetrack and closures of
other tracks in California, the City
acknowledges that the long-term viability of
Santa Anita Park as a horse racing venue may be in question. This General
Plan recognizes the iconic grandstand and other structures, as well as the
racetrack itself, as important features within the City worthy of
preservation. Land use considerations involving Santa Anita Park are
discussed in the Land Use and Community Design Element.
Potential Historic Places
The City has not established a formal listing of local historic places or
landmarks. However, inventories of potentially historical resources have
been compiled to identify sites for future consideration. The inventory
process involved dividing the City into eight segments, with each segment
evaluated for potentially significant buildings or “cultural landscapes.” The
criteria used to identify potential resources included searching for
unaltered buildings over 50 years of age, and identifying buildings that
appeared architecturally significant but were less than 50 years old.
“Cultural landscapes” were defined as places that exhibited the work of an
important landscape architect or designer, or the site of an important
event or activity. Using the criteria cited, at the time of the survey, 289
buildings and one cultural landscape were identified to be potentially
significant. The majority of the resources identified were residences but
also included churches, schools, and commercial and industrial buildings.
Absent any City ordinance or other program aimed at identifying or
protecting such historic places, property owners can use and modify the
properties consistent with standard zoning ordinance regulations. As of
2010, the City had no requirement for documenting conditions or
preserving any defining aspects of potentially historic properties or
features such as landmark landscaping. Any and all preservation efforts
are privately initiated.

Ruth and Charles Gilb Arcadia Historical
Museum
The Ruth and Charles Gilb Arcadia Historical Museum opened in 2001 as a
collaborative effort of the City of Arcadia and the Arcadia Historical
Society. Named after is lead donors, the museum is maintained and
operated by the City of Arcadia and houses artifacts and artwork
representative of local Arcadia history, the majority of which was collected
and is owned by the Arcadia Historical Society.
The museum rotates collections in and out of the exhibit spaces. Among
the displays are artifacts related to Elias “Lucky” Baldwin, the Santa Anita
racetrack, and the World War I Balloon School. The museum also provides
extensive historical education programs for both children and adults. The
museum’s Adult Learning Series are monthly lectures that invite the
community to come and attend lectures from guest speakers who discuss
Arcadia’s history. The museum also coordinates with teachers and schools
to organize guided tours and customized programs to help children learn
about history through a hands-on approach.
The Arcadia Veteran’s Local History Room within the Arcadia Historical
Museum is a permanent exhibit space dedicated to war veterans in
Arcadia. The exhibit honors all veterans of all ages in all services. The
exhibit changes every three months and each time presents the personal
story of one Arcadian’s experience as a veteran.
Arcadia Public Library History Collection
The Arcadia Public Library has special a collection that features the history
of Arcadia. The Arcadia history collection serves the Library’s mission to
collect and preserve materials that relate to the cultural and intellectual
heritage of Arcadia. Prominent pieces in the collection include Tournament
of Roses photographs, artwork by past local artists, and photographs of the
7-46 | Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources                   Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

Santa Anita Assembly Center for the Japanese. Indexes to some of the
Library’s historical collection are searchable from the Library’s website.
Local Cultural Organizations
Arcadia Chinese Association
Since 1982, the nonprofit, nonpolitical, and nonreligious Arcadia Chinese
Association has been active in dedicating its services and support to
different programs, departments, and organizations within Arcadia. The
Arcadia Chinese Association’s mission is to help the community with better
understanding of cultural diversity. The association has been instrumental
in involving the non-Chinese community within Arcadia in Chinese cultural
events, with the goal of establishing a better understanding of Chinese
culture and tradition. Other goals of the association have been to assist
Chinese immigrants with assimilation into the American culture, promote
volunteerism in the community, engage in community fundraising, and
support education through involvement with honors and scholarships.
Arcadia Historical Society
Established in 1952, the Arcadia Historical Society is a group whose mission
is the preservation of Arcadia’s history. With a membership of over 270
people, the society creates and participates in programs that involve, for
example, placing historic site markers, conducting history lectures, and
holding vintage fashion shows.
Resources Available for Preservation
Initiatives
Preservation is the act of deciding what is important, determining how to
protect it, and ensuring that whatever is protected is enjoyed by future
generations. Given the relatively limited number of monuments and
buildings from Arcadia’s history remaining, focused community effort on
preservation is increasingly important.
National and State Efforts
The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), which established the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) in 1966, allows federal
agencies to act as responsible stewards of our nation's resources when
their actions affect historic properties. The ACHP is the only entity with the
legal responsibility to encourage federal agencies to factor historic
preservation into federal project requirements. Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act requires federal agencies to take into
consideration the potential effects of proposed federal undertakings on
culture resources listed on or determined eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places. The Queen Anne Cottage and Coach
Barn located within the Arboretum are listed in the National Register of
Historic Places.
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                     Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources | 7-47

Cooperation with the California Office of Historic Preservation (OHP) is
one effort Arcadia undertakes to help preserve historic resources in the
City. The mission of OHP is to partner with local governmental agencies to
preserve and enhance California’s irreplaceable historic heritage in the
interest of the public. Overall, OHP serves to protect historical resources
which demonstrate a cultural, educational, recreational, aesthetic,
economic, social, or environmental legacy for future generations. OHP can
designate qualifying resources as the following:
California Landmarks are buildings, sites, features, or events that are of
statewide significance and have anthropological, cultural, military, political,
architectural, economic, scientific or technical, religious, experimental, or
other historical value.
California Points of Historical Interest are buildings, sites, features, or
events that are of local (city or county) significance and have
anthropological, cultural, military, political, architectural, economic,
scientific or technical, religious, experimental, or other historical value.
California Register of Historical Resources includes buildings, sites,
structures, objects and districts significant in the architectural, engineering,
scientific, economic, agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or
cultural annals of California.
Once designated, the resource is protected from any detrimental changes.
Any alterations, repairs, and additions must be approved under rigorous
the State Historic Building Code to ensure that the quality of the resource
remains intact. As described above, three structures within Arcadia, all
located on Los Angeles County Arboretum grounds, are under the
protection of the OHP.
In 1972, the California legislature adopted a bill known as the Mills Act.
The Mills Act grants property tax relief to owners of qualified historic
properties. The Mills Act is a preservation tool created by the California
legislature to encourage the preservation and restoration of historic
properties. The act enables cities to enter into historical property
agreements with owners of qualifying properties. Under these agreements,
owners must rehabilitate and maintain their properties to designated
standards in exchange for reductions to the owner’s property taxes. The
agreements provide a benefit to cities in that they ensure preservation and
guarantee authentic rehabilitations and a high level of maintenance of
historical resources important to communities.
Local Efforts
The City has initiated preservation efforts by taking steps toward
identifying potentially significant local historic structures. In February of
2000, the City Council approved setting aside $40,000 in Community
Development Block Grant funds for a historic resources survey program
which surveyed approximately 16,000 parcels within the City.
7-48 | Parks, Recreation, and Community Resources                        Arcadia General Plan - November 2010

The nonprofit Arcadia Historical Society's Historical Marker Committee
began a program of placing a series of sizable markers around City with
the intent to inform the community of significant historical resources. The
markers, themed as "History Lives Here," provide text and photos that
showcase long-demolished buildings such as the original City Hall that once
stood on the corner of First Avenue and Huntington Drive. The marker
program also calls attention to historical buildings still standing, such as the
100-year-old First Avenue Middle School. The markers provide a history of
organizations that were housed in the buildings, such as the Woman's Club.
Another effort of the Arcadia Historical Society is to create a printed
brochure intended to encourage a walking tour of the “History Lives Here”
markers.
While the effort of the Arcadia Historical Society carries no legal weight or
authority for preservation, the purpose of their programs is to bring to the
community greater awareness of and appreciation for Arcadia’s historic
buildings and properties in the hope that valuable historic resources are
preserved.
Cultural Programs
The City hosts events and programs that enrich the lives of Arcadians. A
popular summertime series is Concerts in the Park. During the course of
the summer, musicians give free performances on the City Hall lawn. Other
popular music events are the concert sessions held in the Arcadia Public
Library auditorium. The Arcadia Chinese Association holds cultural events
throughout the year such as Spring Festival, Chinese New Year
celebrations, and other holiday celebrations such as Mother’s Day. Cultural
programs are and will continue to be important parts in our diverse city.
Cross-cultural programs and activities are integral to fostering community
pride and creating connections among Arcadia’s residents.
Goals and Policies
Recognizing the importance of the historical resources identified, the City
considers community initiatives to preserve significant sites, buildings,
and/or landscapes. New development within and adjacent to privately
owned historical sites (as defined by the criteria set forth in the California
Register of Historic Places) will be examined for appropriate context with
the building’s or site’s significance.
The remaining physical examples of the City’s history and cultural heritage,
other than those identified above, are located on individual parcels
throughout the City. Any preservation efforts or programs will require both
City and individual property owner support. The City will consider all
available avenues for preserving resources significant to Arcadia’s history
and culture. If a formal program is established, potential historical and
cultural sites which show merit for preservation will be judged using the
following and other appropriate criteria.

A Plan for a Healthy
Community
The health of the public has become a major national concern. National
trends have shown increases in health problems like obesity, diabetes, and
heart disease affecting both children and adults. Studies show that these
health problems are partly the result of factors such as physical inactivity.
Having a healthy community is important to Arcadia. Arcadia’s plan for a
healthy community consists of facilitating access to health care facilities
and services; developing and providing community programs that
encourages healthy living; and creating a physical environment that
stimulates physical activity and social interaction.
Medical Resources and Facilities
Although most healthcare is privatized, having healthcare facilities in the
City provides residents with access to medical services that can keep the
community healthy. Arcadia is home to the Methodist Hospital, a 460-bed
not-for-profit facility that sits on 22 acres of land. Hospital services include
comprehensive acute care such as medical, surgical, pediatrics, oncology,
neonatal intensive care, adult intensive care, and complete cardiovascular
services. Many small and private medical facilities also in the City provide a
wide selection of healthcare services to Arcadia residents. Financial access
to these facilities may be an issue for some residents. Fortunately,
Arcadia’s medical resources and facilities are supplemented by those of
Los Angeles County. Although there are no Los Angeles County medical
facilities or health clinics located within the borders of the City, three major
Los Angeles County hospitals and numerous public health centers in the
region provide free health care, immunizations, and various testing and
treatments to all County residents.
The Land Use and Community Design Element establishes land use policies
that accommodate the growth of healthcare facilities within the Santa
Anita Avenue and Colorado Place corridors, in proximity to Methodist
Hospital. In addition to creating new places for medical service providers
to locate, these policies can help encourage jobs growth in well-paying
industries.
Community Health
Arcadia has been proactive in stimulating positive community health. The
City has long offered diverse recreation and enrichment classes through
the City’s Recreation and Community Services Department that promote
active lifestyles, encourage exercise and physical activity, and provide
organized athletics for Arcadians of all ages. These programs help
influence lifestyle changes, teaching people to incorporate healthy
activities into their daily lives.

The City recognizes that there are other opportunities to help promote
community health. Through re-evaluating transportation from a health
perspective, the City understands that creating a transportation network
that balances multiple modes of transportation will encourage
fundamentally healthy habits such as biking and walking to work or for
errands. As discussed in the Circulation and Infrastructure Element, the
Bicycle Plan will create a network of paths and trails that connect major
amenities throughout the City.
Efforts to revitalize Downtown with mixed-use
development areas surrounding the Metro Gold
Line station will create walkable neighborhoods.
Walkable neighborhoods are neighborhoods
where Arcadians can conveniently walk from their
homes to work or other destinations or even hop
on public transit to travel regionally, all without a
car.
Arcadia’s vision of healthier land use and
transportation options can have significant
positive health effects. Residents will have the
option of leaving their cars at home and choosing
healthier transportation alternatives such as
biking or walking to move about in the City. If
Arcadians take full advantage of biking and
pedestrian opportunities, they will simultaneously
help reduce traffic and air pollution from
automobiles while getting some exercise.
The City supports public education efforts
focused on informing Arcadians of City-sponsored
activities and possibly creating health-centric educational programs such
as nutrition and dieting classes. Vigorous outreach can stimulate higher
participation, and understanding the impacts of food choices and the
benefits of proper nutrition can help people choose the healthy alternative.
Goals and Policies

Introduction
While Arcadia is a suburban and largely built-out city, its location at the
foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and near the San Gabriel River
allows residents to enjoy expansive natural environments. The City has
benefitted from the water resources in the underlying aquifers and the
former aggregate mines that helped build Arcadia and the region. The City
recognizes that these and other natural resources—land, air, energy—are
either finite or shared, and must be used wisely to allow future generations
to enjoy the quality of life that Arcadians enjoy today. Arcadia has worked
to ensure compliance with State and federal legislation, and to cooperate
with other agencies, to safeguard these resources and the qualities that
distinguish Arcadia.
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                                     Resource Sustainability | 6-1

This element establishes policies that will help this generation of Arcadians
use resources in a manner that protects and even enhances them for future
residents. Resource issues addressed are:
        Air Quality                     Waste Management and Recycling
        Water Resources                 Mineral Resources
        Energy                          The Hillsides
Achieving Our Vision
We live in a time of ever-increasing demands on our environment. Growth
in energy consumption to operate our homes and businesses, and to
accommodate future development in the City, continues to rise. Water
resources in Arcadia and Southern California in general are strained and
will continue to be so as development and population increases in the
region. Coinciding with more development and population growth, the use
of automobiles for commuting will increase the consumption of fossil fuels
in our region. These issues—energy, air quality, and sustainability—are three
closely related issues that effect changes in the way that communities and
local governments function.
Our vision for Arcadia to meet these demands in an environmentally
friendly manner includes using natural resources in a sustainable manner,
addressing air quality and energy issues through development practices
and technologies, continuing to educate the public regarding resource
conservation and sustainable practices, and enforcing local, State, and
federal policies that promote best conservation practices.
The General Plan Guiding Principles provide the foundation for the City’s
ongoing commitment to addressing environmental concerns. The guiding
principles establish that the City is committed to:
        Balanced Growth and Development
         The General Plan establishes a balance and mix of land uses that
         promote economic growth and maintain a high quality of life for
         Arcadia residents. Our development decisions reflect Smart
         Growth principles and strategies that move us toward enhanced
         mobility, more efficient use of resources and infrastructure, and
         healthier lifestyles.
        Environmental Sustainability
         We are committed to environmental sustainability, which means
         meeting the needs of the present while conserving the ability of
         future generations to do the same. We take actions that work
         toward achieving regional environmental quality goals. Arcadia
         leads the way to a healthy environment by providing local
         government support, encouraging partnerships, and fostering
         innovation in sustainable principles.

       Preservation of Special Assets
        Arcadia’s quality of life is enhanced by special places and features
        such as Santa Anita Park, the County Arboretum and Park, a
        vibrant Downtown, the urban forest, attractive streetscapes,
        diverse parks, historic buildings and places, and nearby views of the
        mountains. These assets are preserved and enhanced so they
        continue to contribute to our City’s character.
Scope of this Element
A General Plan is required to have a Conservation Element to guide the
“conservation, development, and utilization of natural resources” of the
City (Government Code Section 65302[d]). In Arcadia, resource issues of
concern are air quality, water quality and water resource conservation,
energy conservation, waste management and recycling, sustainable
building practices, management of hillside resources, and management of
mineral resources.

SB 375, passed into law in 2008, has the goal of fostering development
patterns—and more compact patterns in particular—that reduce the need
to drive, thereby reducing air pollution from car exhaust, conserving water,
and protecting habitat, among other benefits. This law is designed to align
regional land use, housing, and transportation plans with greenhouse gas
reduction targets.
Shift in Public Concern and Focus:
Sustainability
Beginning in the 1960s, public awareness of environmental issues
burgeoned, and followed by the passage of the federal Clean Air Act and
Clean Water Act in the 1970s, the nation’s consciousness was fully raised
regarding how the actions of humans impact the environment. In 1997, the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change produced the
Kyoto Protocol, which highlighted the effects of increased greenhouse gas
emissions on climate change. In the 2000s, environmental concerns that
had been building since the 1960s led to a focus on comprehensive
approaches to environmental sustainability, approaches that look beyond
resource protection and conservation to integrate land use and mobility
planning into sustainability practices.
Many organizations have adopted similar definitions of “sustainability” as it
relates to resource conservation and lifestyle choices. They all largely
embrace the words set forth by the United Nations’ Brundtland
Commission:
      "Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of
      the present without compromising the ability of future
      generations to meet their own needs."
This description recognizes that human activities and development can
make lasting impacts on the environment and health, which in turn can
affect productivity and the economy. Prior practices that have contributed
to environmental degradation include developing on greenfield lands and
on or adjacent to natural habitat, paving over porous surfaces that help
recharge aquifers, building energy-inefficient buildings, and allowing cities
to sprawl in a manner that requires people to get into their cars for the
simplest errands.

Increasingly, Arcadia and other cities understand that sustainable land use,
building, and resource consumption practices are not only a preferred but a
necessary way to allow future Arcadia residents to enjoy the same, or
better, quality of life than we do today. Sustainability emphasizes the
integrated nature of human activities and the need to coordinate planning
among different disciplines, jurisdictions, and groups.
                       Sustainable         development              practices         offer
                       environmental and economic benefits to people,
                       agencies, businesses, and organizations that adopt
                       them. Sustainable practices can help enhance and
                       protect ecosystems and biodiversity, reduce the
                       strain on local infrastructure, improve air and water
                       quality, reduce solid waste generation and help
                       conserve natural resources. In addition to offsetting
                       negative environmental impacts, there are benefits
                       that directly reward the user. In some cases,
                       sustainable development helps reduce operating
                       costs by conserving and using less energy and

Improving Air Quality
Air is one of the essential elements of life. It is important to our health that
the air we breathe is clean and free of harmful pollutants. Although air
quality in Southern California has improved since the 1960s, the Los
Angeles region still has some of the most polluted air in the nation. With the
region’s continuing economic expansion and population growth, further
progress to reduce emissions will be needed both to have good local air
quality and to achieve state goals regarding reduction in greenhouse gas
pollutants.
According to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), more than 90%
of California residents breath unhealthy air during some portion of the
year. CARB estimates that the adverse health impacts of poor air quality
in California will lead annually to:
        9,400 hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular
         disease,
        280,00 asthma and other lower respiratory symptoms,
        22,000 cases of acute bronchitis, and
        1.9 million work days lost due to respiratory conditions.
Pollutants resulting from transportation sources, such as ozone, carbon
monoxide, and small particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), generally are the
most significant contributors to poor air quality in cities. The pollutants
contribute to major respiratory health effects such as asthma, lung
inflammations, and chest pains and tightness. Diesel trucks produce large
volumes of particulate matter.
Sensitive Receptors
The effects from air pollution can be significant, both in the short term
during smog alerts, but also from long-term exposure to pollutants. While
the majority of the populace can overcome short-term air quality health
concerns, selected segments of the population are more vulnerable to its
effects. Specifically, young children, the elderly, and persons with existing
health problems are most susceptible to respiratory complications. These
segments tend to be concentrated in schools (particularly pre-schools and
nursery schools), convalescent hospitals, senior housing, and hospitals.
Carbon monoxide (CO) pollution is a localized pollutant, emitted directly
from automobile tail pipes, that has a tendency to affect sensitive
receptors disproportionately. CO concentrations accumulate along
roadways with heavy and slow-moving traffic. Within Arcadia, residential
neighborhoods and schools are located along several roadways which
carry substantial traffic volumes. Particularly, residential neighborhoods
abut I-210, and pockets of multifamily residential neighborhoods are
located along major roadways such as Baldwin Avenue (near Santa Anita
Park), El Monte Avenue, and Duarte Road.

South Coast Air Basin
Recognizing that air pollution knows no boundaries and
affects the air quality of the region, the South Coast Air
Quality Management District (SCAQMD) was established in
1976 as the regional agency authorized to develop and
enforce air pollution control standards mandated by the
federal and state Clean Air Acts. Arcadia is located within
a geographic airshed called the South Coast Air Basin,
which is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the SCAQMD.
The basin covers an area of 6,745 square miles
encompassing Los Angeles County and the non-desert
portions of Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties.

classified as “extreme” nonattainment for ozone. Many factors contribute
to the poor air quality in the basin: the surrounding mountains which trap
air, persistent inversion conditions, the heavy reliance on cars and trucks
for transport, and the heavily urbanized character of the basin.
Local Emissions Sources
Arcadia’s limited industrial base and relatively standard retail and service
commercial uses means that few local pollutant sources contribute to
emissions within the basin. The most significant contributors are the cars
and trucks moving within the City. Automobile emissions are a primary
source of air pollution within the air basin. Thus, efforts to reduce emissions
from this source can result in significant improvements in air quality.
As noted above, the construction and operation of buildings are estimated
to use over one-third of all energy consumed in the United States. This
energy use produces carbon dioxide emissions, a primary contributor to
global warming. The refrigerants used in air-conditioned buildings not only
use more energy, these systems produce emissions that can deplete the
Earth’s ozone layer. Building materials are also a major source of air
quality problems, as they may emit damaging sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide,
and particulate emissions. Building design and construction practices can
be modified to reduce their consumption of energy and fossil fuels, and to
reduce emissions that contribute to the region’s poor air quality. These
design and construction processes can be achieved without compromising
safety and comfort or increasing construction and operating costs.

Air Quality
Besides a small portion of emissions resulting from waste decomposition,
soil disruption, or the release of industrial chemicals, energy use (in
buildings, transportation, or elsewhere) is the primary source of greenhouse
gas emissions in most U.S. cities, including Arcadia.
AB 32 mandates a state-wide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to
1990 levels by 2020, and Executive Order S-3-05 calls for greenhouse gas
emissions 80% to be below 1990 levels by 2050. And while SB 375 does
not specifically require that cities reduce emissions that contribute to
global warming, the law promulgates land use planning approaches that
can lead to emissions reductions.
Reducing Arcadia’s Carbon Footprint
Calculating and determining a carbon footprint can be a useful measuring
tool for determining impact on climate change. The carbon footprint can
be described as the total greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, etc.) produced directly or indirectly by an entity. As noted
above, the three largest emitters of carbon dioxide are buildings,
transportation, and industry.1 Arcadia’s carbon footprint composition
reflects that of national trends and largely is comprised of emissions from
energy use (in buildings and transportation).
Energy use in residential and commercial buildings is generally for heating
and cooling for comfort, lighting, and operating electronic equipment.
Although emissions may not result directly from such uses, the indirect
emissions resulting from electricity generation (such as coal power plants)
is accounted for in the carbon footprint. Transportation emissions sources
are a result of the fact that drivers whose trips originate or end in Arcadia
tend to mimic traditional California driving patterns of longer travel
distances for automobiles and an increase in frequency for automobile use
to go to work, school, and shopping, and to run errands.

Goals and Policies
Improving regional air quality requires regional cooperation among cities
under the guidance provided by SCAQMD. However, the mandates
associated with AB 32 to reduce local greenhouse gas emissions will
require that Arcadia focus more attention on improvements at the local
level than it has previously.
The City will continue active participation in cooperative regional efforts to
reduce pollutant emissions. In 1993, the City participated with other San
Gabriel Valley cities to develop the West San Gabriel Valley Air Quality
Plan. This plan provides a set of 55 overall air quality policies and 16 core
policies that if adopted and implemented by each member city would
provide the most benefit to regional air quality. On May 8, 1993, the City
adopted City Council Resolution No. 5725, accepting the principles in the
area-wide air quality plan and agreeing to use the plan in the development
of a local air quality program. The principles are reflected in the goals and
policies below.
The City recognizes that its position as a regional employment and
entertainment center attracts vehicle trips from locations where the air
quality is not so good. The City recognizes its responsibility to help reduce
vehicle trips, continue to encourage industries to adopt air friendly
practices, and to reduce energy consumption that contributes to air
pollutant emissions.
Since greenhouse gas reduction is a cross-cutting issue relevant to various
policy arenas, policies that address land use, transportation, buildings,
energy, waste, and ecology are incorporated throughout the General Plan.
The Land Use and Community Design Element includes policies that focus
compact, mixed-use development in Downtown around the Gold Line light
rail station, along Live Oak Avenue and First Avenue, and other focus
areas through the City. Trip reduction strategies are addressed in the
Circulation and Infrastructure Element.
Goal RS-1:                    Continued improvement in local and regional
                              air quality

                         air quality.
    Policy RS-1.6:       Require projects that generate potentially
                         significant levels of air pollutants to incorporate
                         the most effective air quality mitigation into
                         project design, as appropriate.

                         2050.
    Policy RS-2.2:       Reduce per capita greenhouse gas emissions to
                         15% below 2005 levels by 2020, and total
                         municipal greenhouse gas emissions to 15%
                         below 2005 levels by 2020.
    Policy RS-2.3:       Participate in regional strategies and plan to
                         implement SB 375, and in particular, use the
                         legislatively authorized incentives, such as
                         grants and transportation funding and waivers
                         to environmental assessments, to encourage
                         infill and transit-oriented development.

Water Resources
The Los Angeles basin is a semi-arid desert environment. Water is a limited
natural resource given the climate conditions and the fact that Southern
California communities rely upon local groundwater supplies, as well as
imported supplies from as far away as the Colorado River. As a community
grows, additional water is needed to meet demand. Insufficient water
supplies can limit economic development and housing growth. This section
examines Arcadia’s water supply and demand, conservation efforts, and
the importance of planning to effectively use our limited water supply.
Local plans, such as Arcadia’s Urban Water Management Plan, help with
projections for future water demand, identify conservation strategies and
reliable water sources, and create a contingency plan for water shortages.
Through other various local plans and local, state, and federal regulations,
the City already has a very strong foundation for protection of water
quality and continued water conservation efforts. These include:
        Water Master Plan: Updated every five years, the City’s Water
         Master Plan helps the City evaluate and assess operational and
         planning issues associated with the City’s water system. Included
         in the Master Plan are assessments of the water system’s reliability,
         infrastructure rehabilitation, and restoration considerations of
         various water facilities.
        Urban Water Management Plan: In accordance with the California
         Urban Water Management Planning Act (1985), the City has
         prepared and updates on a regular basis its Urban Water
         Management Plan to evaluate existing water conservation efforts
         and to review and implement alternative and supplemental water
         conservation measures.
        Clean Water Act (1972): The Clean Water Act has been the
         primary federal law that has helped limit water pollution. Although
         the act does not deal directly with groundwater issues or water
         quantity issues, the act has been instrumental in reducing direct
         pollution of waterways, financing municipal wastewater treatment
         facilities, and managing polluted runoff.
        Safe Water Drinking Act (1974): The Safe Water Drinking Act of
         1974 has been the landmark policy for protecting public health by
         regulating public drinking supplies. The law is designed to protect
         drinking water and water sources such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs,
         springs, and groundwater wells.

Water Supply and Quality
The City of Arcadia is the primary provider of local water services to
residents and businesses. The City owns and operates its own water
distribution system, and the Public Works Services Department maintains
and operates the system. The City has approximately 13,400 water service
connections that serve 56,161 customers. While the City’s corporate
boundaries encompass slightly above 11 square miles, the City’s water
service area is slightly below 11 square miles. Several areas within the City,
primarily at the surrounding boundaries, are served by small, private water
agencies. The Sunny Slope Water Company, East Pasadena Water
Company, and California-American Water Company serve an area along
the western boundary. Southern California Water Company serves
residents along the south and east boundaries.
The local water supply comes from three sources: 1) groundwater from wells
in the Main San Gabriel Basin; 2) groundwater from wells in the Raymond
Basin; and 3) imported treated surface water from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California (MWD). The reliability of the water supply
for the City of Arcadia is primarily dependent upon the management of
Raymond Basin and Main Basin.                     Management of both basins is
adjudicated.2 Within the Main and Raymond Basins, Arcadia owns and
operates groundwater wells that deliver water into the City’s system. In
addition, the City has the option of direct delivery of treated imported
water from MWD. The City is required to purchase untreated imported
surface from MWD’s Upper District when they over-pump their water rights
in the main basin.
The Raymond Basin, which covers approximately 40 square miles, is
located in the northwesterly portion of the San Gabriel Valley and is
bounded on the north by the San Gabriel Mountains, the San Rafael Hills to
the west, and the Raymond Fault to the southeast. The basin is recharged
by the Los Angeles River (through the Arroyo Seco Tributary), Eaton Wash,
Santa Anita Wash, and by streams in the San Gabriel River watershed.
Arcadia produces water from the Raymond Basin and has a “decreed right”
of 5,644 acre-feet per year.3 Based on historic management practices, the
City of Arcadia will be able to produce its decreed right from Raymond
Basin through approximately 2025.4
The Main Basin is located underneath the majority of the valley floor of the
San Gabriel Valley, and is bounded by the Raymond Basin on the
northwest, the base of the San Gabriel Mountains on the north, the Puente
Basin on the east, and Whittier Narrows to the south. The basin is
replenished by stream runoff, rainfall, and inflow from the surrounding
Raymond and Puente Basins, and is also replenished with imported water
2
  Under the adjudication, a court of law determines which entity has a right to extract water
and the maximum annual amount of water allowed to be pumped by each producer.

  An acre-foot of water equals 325,851 gallons. The average suburban household, with a
house with a lawn, uses an average of 0.3 acre-feet per year.

  City of Arcadia 2005 Urban Water Management Plan
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                                                    Resource Sustainability | 6-13

through the upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District. The City is
a retail supplier that pumps from the Main Basin and has prescriptive right
to 4.2 percent of the annual yield of the basin. The City can pump more
water than its annual right by paying a replacement assessment or pre-
purchasing water into cyclic storage.
The 2008 Water Master Plan recommends increasing the City’s
groundwater pumping capacity to be able to continue to supply existing,
and meet future demands with, groundwater. To achieve this, the City has
identified seven future wells in the Main Basin which can be expected to
add or replace 10,500 gallons per minute of groundwater pumping supply.
The total groundwater will then exceed the ultimate maximum day
groundwater demand with the largest capacity well out of service.
Land Use and Water Supply
Land use planning intersects with water supply throughout the planning
process. When planners and decision-makers review private development
projects and city-initiated plans, an understanding of water demand and
water availability is critical. Senate Bill 610 and Senate Bill 221 amended
State law in 2002 to improve the link between information on water supply
availability and certain land use decisions made by jurisdictions. SB 610
and SB 221 are companion measures that seek to promote more
collaborative planning between local water suppliers and cities and
counties. Both statutes require detailed information regarding water
availability to be provided to decision-makers prior to approval of specified
large development projects. In addition, as a water utility, Arcadia is
responsible for preparing water supply assessments for those projects
meeting the statute. Water supply assessments must describe a project’s
water demand over a 20-year period, identify the sources of water
available to meet that demand, and include an assessment of whether or
not those water supplies are, or will be, sufficient to meet the demand for
water associated with the proposed project, in addition to the demand of
existing customers and other planned future development. If a 20-year
supply is not demonstrated, the water supply assessments identify plans for
acquiring additional supplies.
For Arcadia, the water supplier for SB 610 purposes is the City’s Public
Works Services Department. The City’s Urban Water Management Plan,
updated on a five-year basis, is the primary information and planning tool
used to assess water supply adequacy.
Water Demand and Usage – Meeting Projected Needs
Residential customers make up the majority of water users in the City at 91
percent, with commercial, institutional and governmental services
constituting the remaining nine percent.           Historically, the largest
commercial water user has been Santa Anita Park. Contrary to intuition,
the largest landscaped areas within the City—the Los Angeles County
Arboretum and Santa Anita Golf Course—are not significant users,
consuming less than one percent of the total water supplied to customers.
6-14 | Resource Sustainability                                   Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

Between 2000 and 2005, water usage by City of Arcadia water service
customers increased by only about one percent, reflecting the built-out
nature of the City and local conservation initiatives. New plumbing
efficiency standards, landscape guidelines, and other conservation
programs have also helped limit water waste.                         However, despite
conservation efforts, the Public Works Services Department projects that
water usage will increase to approximately 19,131 acre-feet annually by
2025 (up from an estimated 17,400 acre-feet in 2005, when the City had
a population of 55,950).
Land use policy in this General Plan will allow for both residential and
commercial/industrial business growth, with a projected population of
61,994 residents within Arcadia in 2035 (excluding the City’s sphere of
influence), which is five percent within the projected population for year
2025 identified in the City’s Urban Water Management Plan and the level
of demand for which the City has planned. Additionally, Upper San Gabriel
Valley Municipal Water District, in its UWMP, identifies that replenishment
water will remain adequate to meet producers that over-pump their water
rights. The Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster judgment states that
producers can over-pump their water rights so long as they replenish the
basin. Therefore, in order for the City to maintain a sustainable supply of
potable water, conservation efforts will be implemented, as will as requiring
alternative sources of replenishment water, such as treated recycled waste
water.
Water Conservation Initiatives
Water conservation represents a cost-effective and environmentally sound
way to reduce current and future water demand. Homeowners and
business owners can take many actions to reduce water use, such as using
water-conserving fixtures and appliances, fixing leaks, planting drought-
tolerant landscaping, and avoiding unnecessary water use. Arcadia has
been and continues to be a strong advocate for water conservation.
Following years of below-average rainfall, very low snowmelt runoff,
growing water demand, and a court-ordered restriction on water deliveries
from the Delta,5 the State’s water supplies are at dangerously low levels. In
2008, Governor Schwarzenegger proclaimed a statewide drought and
indicated that the lack of water had created other problems, such as
extreme fire danger due to dry conditions, economic harm to urban and
rural communities, loss of crops, and the potential to degrade water quality
in some regions. The Governor issued an Executive Order to encourage
local water districts and agencies to promote water conservation. In
response, the Arcadia City Council passed an ordinance in August of 2008
implementing a voluntary Water Conservation Program, with the goal of
reducing water consumption in the City by ten percent.
5
  On August 31, 2007, the federal District Court placed protection on the rare declining
delta smelt of the San Joaquin-Sacramento River delta. The court severely curtailed water
deliveries for human use at the Delta from the months of December through June. As
Southern California relies upon sources from the north to meet demands, the restricted
deliveries aimed at preserving delta smelt habitat can be expected to affect water transfers
to Southern California.

The Municipal Code addresses water conservation through a Water
Conservation Plan that contains regulations and penalties for overuse of
water during drought times. The plan establishes basic prohibitions such as
limiting washing of sidewalks, walkways, driveways, or parking areas;
requiring use of recycled water in decorative fountains; requiring
restaurants to serve drinking water only to customers who expressly
request it; and restricting irrigation of lawn, landscape, or other turf areas
to specific hours. The City Council can order customer percentage
curtailment provisions that restrict water usage by customers to a
percentage of the amount used during a prior base period.
To further assist the community in conserving water, the City has provided
free landscape and irrigation audits to residents and businesses.
Landscape irrigation can use approximately half of home water use, and
inefficient irrigation practices can waste up to 30 percent of the water
applied, making landscape irrigation an excellent area to examine in trying
to find ways to conserve water. The City has also moved forward with
considering the use of “tiered water-rate structure,” which could used to
penalize large water consumers by charging more per gallon once users
cross certain thresholds.
Drought-tolerant Landscaping
Landscaping and yards in Southern California consume millions of gallons
of water. Californians tend to use grasses and plants more suited to humid
climates. A typical California lawn made up of a cool-season turf grass can
require multiple times more water than native plants.
A simple yet effective sustainable way of re-thinking landscaping is to
utilize drought-tolerant landscaping. In Arcadia, single-family homes, even
those on small lots, can cut down on water consumption by installing
drought-tolerant plants and installing smart irrigation controllers. Planning
and incorporating drought-tolerant landscaping can help reduce the
amount of water needed for maintenance and the amount of waste (yard
clippings) produced. Appropriate design techniques, such as selecting
indigenous or exotic drought tolerant plants, proper soil preparation,
garden layout, and installing efficient irrigations systems, can be calibrated
to balance aesthetic and use needs of landscaping with the ability to
conserve water. This system of drought-tolerant planting techniques is
called xeriscaping. Xeriscaping means simply landscaping with slow-
growing, drought-tolerant plants that use limited water and produce limited
yard trimmings. Xeriscape landscapes can:
        Lower the demand of Arcadia’s reliance of purchasing expensive
         replacement water,
        Reduce the volume of plant trimmings which must either be
         composted or otherwise managed
        Reduce the labor needed to maintain a landscape
        Require less fertilizer and fewer pest control measures than
         traditional landscapes

Although drought-tolerant landscaping approaches are already                      In recognition of long-term
encouraged in the City’s single-family residential design guidelines, these       water conservation needs, the
approaches can be applied to multifamily homes and to commercial and              City’s Urban Water

Recycled Water
Recycled water (also referred to as reclaimed water) represents an
important resource that can be used to offset use of potable water for non-
potable purposes, particularly for landscape irrigation. Recycled water is
domestic wastewater that is purified through primary, secondary, and
tertiary treatment. Using alternative sources such as reclaimed water can
help limit the need of purchasing and importing outside water sources. The
potential beneficiaries of alternative water resources such as reclaimed
water are large-volume irrigation uses such as parks, sports fields, and golf
courses, of which Arcadia has many, many acres (see the Parks, Recreation,
and Community Resources Element). Reclaimed water can also be
considered for other irrigation purposes such as street median landscaping
and public facilities landscaping.
Potential sources of recycled water supply include the City of Los Angeles-
Glendale Water Reclamation Plant (near the city of Glendale) and the
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                                    Resource Sustainability | 6-17

Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County San Jose Creek Water
Reclamation Plant and Whittier Narrows Water Reclamation Plant. The
Whittier Narrows facility appears to be the preferred water reclamation
plant to supply recycled water to Arcadia based on distance, water quality,
availability of supply, and estimated cost.
The City previously has not used recycled water due to the lack of
infrastructure and pipelines from the treatment plants to the City’s service
area. In a 2006 Recycled Water Feasibility Study, the City explored
options and opportunities to establishing recycled water infrastructure. The
report anticipated that a portion of the future water demands within
Arcadia’s commercial and industrial and government sectors can be met
through use of recycled water. Potential customers for recycled water
were identified to include all City parks, the Arboretum and Botanic
Gardens, the Civic Center athletic field, the Santa Anita and Par-3 golf
courses, Santa Anita Park, a large local car wash business, all schools
within Arcadia, and all street medians.
The estimated cost of recycled water infrastructure to serve Arcadia was
estimated, in 2006 dollars, to be approximately $42,300 per acre–foot
per year more than potable water service, which appears to be a
significant disincentive to use this resource. The City recognizes that
continued efforts to promote recycled water use will require regional, State,
and federal funding for infrastructure and services, as well as possibly
water pricing approaches for groundwater and imported supplies that
make recycled water more affordable.
Drinking Water Quality
The State and federal governments establish standards for drinking water
quality, and all water purveyors in California are required to perform
annual testing and reporting to customers. The City of Arcadia and the
water it supplies comply with all federal and State drinking water
standards.
Storm Water and Urban Runoff Management
Urban runoff consists of water that has drained from non-porous surfaces
in dense urban areas; these surfaces include roads and freeways, roofed
structures, and parking lots. Any form of precipitation and/or irrigation (for
example, rainfall, sprinkler systems overflowing onto sidewalks, car washing
on driveways) can scour these surfaces and wash away the materials on
top, carrying them into the storm drain system. Since much of the urban
terrain in Arcadia is non-porous and does not have the ability to filter or
eliminate contaminants, these contaminants are carried in the runoff that
flows into the local and regional storm drain systems and eventually into
the Pacific Ocean. Suspended sediment is the primary pollutant in this
urban runoff.
State and federal regulations work to protect watersheds and recharge
areas. In particular, the Clean Water Act provides control over urban run-
off and storm water discharges through the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES). The NPDES permit helps to protect public
6-18 | Resource Sustainability                                 Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

health and aquatic life. At the local level, cities must ensure provision of
vegetated swales, buffers, and infiltration areas in new development
projects. Additional approaches include designing sidewalks, roads, and
driveways utilizing alternative materials to minimize impervious surfaces.
The NPDES permit program controls water pollution by regulating point
sources that discharge pollutants. In Arcadia, NPDES permits are issued by
the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region. The
NPDES program coordinates the actions of all incorporated cities within
this region (except Long Beach) and the Los Angeles County government
to regulate and control storm water and urban runoff into Los Angeles
County waterways and the ocean.
In support of the NPDES permit and the obligation to keep waterways
clean by reducing or eliminating contaminants from storm water and dry-
weather runoff, the City is required to implement or require the
implementation of the most effective combination of best management
practices for storm water/urban runoff pollution control. The City has a
storm water education program, an aggressive inspection team that issues
notices of violation for water quality violations, and requires the use of best
management practices in many residential, commercial, and development-
related activities to reduce runoff.
Goals and Policies
Arcadia is committed to a balanced approach to managing its water
resources, with two key emphases: 1) promulgating conservation programs
and incentives that will result in the City achieving a 20 percent reduction
in per capita water use by 2020, and 2) ensuring that long-term supplies
are adequate foremost for established uses, and that new projects are
required to meet the requirements of SB 610 water supply assessments as
applicable.
The City will also investigate ways in which recycled water can help meet
water demands. Recycled water can be used directly for landscaping and
other applications that may be found acceptable over the long term. Other
applications may include using recycled water as a source for groundwater
recharge or using recycled water by blending it with water flowing from the
San Gabriel Mountains and water provided by MWD. In all conditions,
water will be managed to provide Arcadia users with high-quality potable
water that meets or exceeds federal and State standards.
Goal RS-4:                   Wise and sustainable water use practices that
                             respond to and support the needs of City

                        the planting of native and drought-tolerant
                        plants, use of efficient irrigation systems, and
                        collection and recycling of runoff.
    Policy RS-4.7:      Cooperate with the efforts of other cities and

Energy Use
When we drive our children to school, turn on the stove to cook dinner, or
turn on the air conditioner to cool down the house on a warm sunny day, we
use energy. That energy can come from a variety of sources, but in the
early 2000s, fossil fuels accounted for the most common source.
Beginning with the oil crisis of 1973, Americans became abundantly aware
of the costs—both monetary and environmental—associated with reliance
on fossil fuels. However, energy generation and consumption practices
were slow to change until heightened public awareness in the 2000s of
the relationship between energy use and climate change. Given the
nonrenewable and high-emission nature of fossil fuels, California
consumers and power providers have grown increasingly committed to
evaluating and using alternative energy sources and adopting energy
conservation strategies.
Energy conservation is the practice of decreasing the quantity of energy
used while achieving a similar outcome of end use. Energy conservation
has the added benefit of decreasing pollutants released into the air and
preserving natural resources. Individuals and organizations have adopted
practices that conserve energy to reduce their energy costs and promote
environmental values, and businesses now recognize a public relations
benefit to pursuing sound energy policies.

Solar Power
Energy harnessed from sunlight is a clean, reliable, and renewable energy.
Solar power systems can range in size and power output from a small
system outfitted on residential structures to a system that powers a
commercial business. Arcadia, as with many areas in Southern California,
typically has a mildly arid climate with sunny days throughout most of the
year. The weather, combined with objectives to reduce dependence on
foreign oil and decrease the use of non-renewable fossil fuels, makes
Arcadia a place well suited for solar power use.
California Solar Initiative
California’s Solar Initiative, apart of California’s campaign for promoting
solar power, offers solar rebates to customers who utilize solar energy
systems. Southern California Edison, the electric utility provider in Arcadia,
participates in incentive programs to reward both residential and
commercial users installing solar energy systems.
Million Solar Roofs
In an effort to make California the nation’s leader in solar energy,
California’s Million Solar Roofs Plan aims at have one million solar roofs
installed throughout California by the year 2018. In establishing a million
solar roofs, the State estimates that 3,000 megawatts of additional clean
energy and a reduction of greenhouse gasses by three million tons will
result. The plan assists customers of investor-owned and municipal-owned
utilities with obtaining incentives for installing solar roofs, expands the
number of consumers who can receive credits for excess power produced
by a solar system, and requires a developer of more than 50 new single-
family homes to offer the option of a solar energy system to all customers
beginning January 1, 2011.
Solar Rights and Solar Shade Acts
The California Solar Rights Act prohibits a public entity from receiving
State grant funding or loans for solar energy systems if it places
unreasonable restrictions on their installation. This law also restricts any
covenants, conditions, and restrictions (typically enforced by homeowners
associations) that excessively limit or prevent an individual from installing a
solar system on his or her home.
The State has also adopted the Solar Shade Control Act, which prohibits
shading of solar collectors from tree growth occurring after a solar
collector has been installed. It applies to solar systems for electric
generation, water heating, and space heating or cooling.

Energy Conservation
Conserving energy through efficient energy use brings environmental and
economic benefits to residents and businesses. Conservation can be
encouraged by educating and changing user behavior, rewarding use of
energy-saving appliances and light bulbs, and employing building design
and construction approaches, such as incorporating natural cooling
designs and proper insulation, to help dramatically reduce the use of
electric power and natural gas.
Arcadia’s enforcement of California building code energy performance
requirements helps integrate energy conservation efforts into current
building practices. State building codes require, for example, minimum
ceiling, wall, and raised floor insulation, and minimum heating, ventilating,
air conditioning and water heating equipment efficiencies. The City has the
option of putting into place standards that exceed those of the State.
Electricity in Arcadia is provided by a private utility company. The City
supports the private efforts that the utility provider has undertaken to
conserve energy. Arcadia’s utility provider takes part in numerous public
education and information programs that describe the economic and
environmental benefits of energy conservation for its customers. In
addition, Southern California Edison has sponsored programs that help
increase the use of energy-saving light bulbs and Energy Star appliances,
and has also implemented rebate programs to provide further incentives to
conserve energy.
Sustainable Buildings
As described earlier, inefficient buildings result in significant direct and
indirect adverse environmental effects and represent one of the largest
sources of excessive energy use in Arcadia. Cities throughout the country
have examined ways to reduce these impacts, including application of
“green” or sustainable building standards that follow tested methodologies,
such as LEED6 or locally developed approaches. Sustainable buildings are
buildings that are designed, constructed, and operated to incorporate
water conservation, waste minimization, pollution prevention, use of
recycled and efficient materials, and energy efficiency. Sustainable
building practices have become more prominent in the 2000s, with
sustainable practices including buildings that incorporate water-efficient
plumbing and landscaping, and buildings that re-use and incorporate
recycled building materials into project design.                      Most importantly,
sustainable building practices have comprehensively addressed energy use.
Examples of energy-saving practices include designing buildings that utilize
their sites and orientation for natural heating, cooling, and even lighting
options; incorporating energy-efficient HVAC and other appliances into
6
  LEED, which stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, is an
internationally recognized green building certification system developed by the private U.S.
Green Building Council. Others exist as well.
6-24 | Resource Sustainability                                               Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

buildings; designing a building to and for maximum insulation and climate
control through material use and window placement; and incorporating
renewable energy sources such as solar panels and small wind turbines.
In addition to the immediate environmental benefits sustainable building
produce, sustainable buildings also result in such benefits as reduction in
building operating costs, minimized strain on local infrastructure, and
contribution to overall quality of life of building occupants. Some
commercial building owners have cited that, all other factors being equal,
sustainable buildings command higher leases.
Goals and Policies
As an integral part of its sustainable development approach, Arcadia will
support efforts of energy service providers to utilize renewable energy
resources and reduce consumer energy use, and the City will integrate
energy efficiency considerations into the development design process. The
City also recognizes the benefits of “green” building practices, and will

diversion, with a high of 74 percent in 2003. This has been achieved
despite the fact that the City has not required separation and collection of
recyclable materials and landscaping waste for commercial users (although
waste haulers do perform some separation at regional materials sorting
facilities).
Recycle, Reduce, Reuse, and Rethink
Consumers traditionally have been encouraged to consider three Rs in
their purchasing and waste disposal practices: recycle, reduce, and reuse.
This rubric can be expanded to include residential and commercial building
practices and to incorporate a fourth R: rethink. Given Arcadia’s built-out
character, any new development will necessarily involve the demolition of
existing structures and infrastructure. What was formerly considered waste
material—wood, asphalt, steel pipes, and copper wire, for example—can find
a new life and use if developers are required to divert a portion from
landfills. Further, by rethinking how materials may be reused and how
sustainable materials can be incorporated into building design and
construction, developers may achieve economies in new projects.
Goals and Policies
Can the City achieve more? Efforts to reduce waste must be supported by
the community at large. Although the City can do its part to change its
own operating and purchasing practices to reduce waste and promote
recycling, participation from residents and businesses of the community is
essential. Continuing and expanding local programs that educate the
community and promote awareness of waste diversion and recycling is
6-28 | Resource Sustainability                                Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

critical. Continual coordination with the City’s waste hauler and other local
agencies to provide easy access to disposal sites and convenient methods
for recycling will also work toward implementing the four Rs.
Goal RS-6:                   A higher level of waste reduction and
                             recycling city-wide relative to 2009

Mineral Resources
Per the California Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (SMARA),
all cites are required to consider mapped mineral resources designations
(as defined by the State Mining and Geology Board) in long-term planning
efforts. This analysis is intended to assist in the management of lands that
have statewide and regional significance with regard to identified mineral
deposits, and to guard against compromising the long-term availability of
these resources.
The State Mining and Geology Board classifies lands in California based on
the availability of mineral resources. Four mineral resources zone (MRZ)
designations have been established for the classification of sand, gravel,
and crushed rock resources:
     MRZ-1:        Adequate information indicates that no significant mineral
                   deposits are present or likely to be present.
     MRZ-2:        Adequate information indicates that significant mineral
                   deposits are present or there is a high likelihood for their
                   presence, and development should be controlled.
     MRZ-3:        The significance of mineral deposits cannot be determined
                   from the available data.
     MRZ-4:        There is insufficient data to assign any other MRZ
                   designation.
In Arcadia, the State has defined three different mineral resource zones:
MRZ-1, MRZ-2, and MRZ-3 (see Figure RS-1). Within the designated areas,
four sites are undeveloped:
        The flood control wash and infiltration basin at the northern portion
         of the City
        The former sand and gravel excavation site at the southeast corner
         of the City (known historically as the Rodeffer site and now as the
         Lower Azusa Reclamation area)
        Peck Road spreading basin
        Livingston-Graham sand and gravel extraction site, virtually all of
         which is located in the adjacent city of Irwindale
Of these four sites, only the Livingston-Graham sand and gravel extraction
site is available for future mining activity, and this would occur in Irwindale,
not Arcadia. The two spreading basins provide vital flood control and
groundwater recharge functions, and are designated for these continued
uses. The Lower Azusa Reclamation site is subject to ongoing reclamation
activities (filling with inert construction debris and similar materials) and
designated Commercial/Industrial in the Land Use and Community Design
Element.

Goals and Policies
Because no properties in Arcadia will be subject to mining activities in the
future, the City’s focus is on continued reclamation of prior quarries and
protection of properties in Arcadia from mining operations in adjacent
communities.
Goal RS-7:                  Productive reuse of former mineral extraction
                            sites in Arcadia, and support of adjacent
                            jurisdictions’ continued extraction operations
    Policy RS-7.1:          Facilitate the reclamation of mined lands in
                            Arcadia to a usable condition that is readily
                            adaptable for long-term planned land uses.
    Policy RS-7.2:          Support the production of aggregate materials
                            that benefit the region, provided such activities
                            appropriately consider watershed, wildlife,
                            range and forage, aesthetic enjoyment, and
                            other environmental factors.
    Policy RS-7.3:          Work with adjacent jurisdictions to minimize any
                            adverse environmental effects and potential
                            public safety hazards associated with mining
                            operations along Arcadia’s borders.

The Hillsides
Arcadia has few remaining natural open space resources, with the                   The high-fire-hazard
exception of lands within the San Gabriel Mountain foothills. The foothills        nature and challenging
are an integral part of Arcadia’s identity: they provide environmental,            terrain of the foothill
wildlife habitat, aesthetic, and recreational value. These undeveloped             environment has led to
hillside areas create a scenic backdrop to the City. Arcadia’s Wilderness          adoption of numerous
Park provides a place where residents can enjoy local wildlife habitat, hike       development safety
into the Angeles National Forest, or enjoy the view of the San Gabriel             requirements and
Valley below. The Santa Anita Basin spreading grounds provide flood                regulations. The Safety
                                                                                   Element addresses these
protection and groundwater recharge functions. The neighborhoods
                                                                                   regulations with the goal
nestled into the hillsides create quiet refuges for the people who live there.     of minimizing
                                                                                   environmental hazards.
The Wilderness Park and County-owned resource area will continue to
exist and provide areas for natural habitat and wildlife refuge. However,
there remains a few sizable privately owned hillside parcels with natural
vegetation, stream channels, wildlife corridors, and panoramic views.
Development of these remaining hillside properties has long been
considered economically infeasible due to the physical and regulatory
challenges they present. However, with limited vacant land available in
Arcadia for new housing, coupled with Arcadia’s attractiveness as a
residential community, the challenges might be overcome as property
values increase.
The non-public hillside properties are designated for low-density residential
use only. Both City regulations and private development covenants have
worked to minimize environmental impact in the hillsides associated with
residential development. Zoning regulations place limits, for example, on
grading and lot coverage. State fire code requirements, enforced through
the City’s building code, require appropriate landscaping. Local
homeowners associations have restrictive covenants (unenforceable by the
City but vigorously applied by the association boards) that result in
development compatible in scale with the hillside environment. The City
anticipates that these regulations and practices will continue to provide the
protections necessary.
Goals and Policies
With regard to public properties, Arcadia’s objective is to preserve natural
lands for the enjoyment and use by people and wildlife. On private hillside
properties, Arcadia will continue to use zoning and other Municipal Code
regulations to ensure sensitive residential development practices, and will
support the efforts of homeowners associations to provide compatible and
respectful development.

                         individual hillside sites using site-specific
                         investigations, information in the General Plan
                         EIR, and other applicable information sources
                         and regulatory documents. Incorporate the
                         findings into conditions of approval for
                         individual development projects.
    Policy RS-8.2:       Require detailed biological and other
                         appropriate environmental resource and hazard
                         studies for properties within the foothills, and
                         ensure that appropriate mitigation is employed
                         to avoid and/or minimize impacts.
    Policy RS-8.3:       Investigate the value and feasibility of
                         establishing hillside areas within Arcadia as
                         habitat mitigation/banking sites.

Introduction
Community safety issues influence many decisions people make, from big
decisions such as where to live or spend leisure time, to small decisions,
such as identifying the time of day they feel comfortable walking alone.
When thinking about where to buy a home, people may consider whether a
hillside location near a wildfire zone is of concern. In its budgeting
decisions, elected bodies allocate funds to fire and law enforcement
services commensurate with overall public safety objectives. Critical to
these decision processes is knowing the hazards present in a community
and establishing safety standards. By identifying threats to our safety, we
can better guard against disasters and develop effective response plans.
This Safety Element identifies, evaluates, and addresses local and regional
safety issues, and establishes the goals, policies, and actions that will help
reduce loss of life, injuries, property loss, environmental damage, and social
and economic disruption from natural and human-caused disasters. These
issues are addressed within the context of:
        Environmental Hazards                     Emergency Services
        Human-Caused Hazards                      Emergency Preparedness
        Threats to National Security

The goals, policies, and programs in this element are shaped around three
approaches that are integral to Arcadia’s plan for a safe community: 1)
avoiding hazards and threats through careful planning, 2) being prepared
to respond to any and all crisis situations to minimize injury or loss, 3)
educating the public of best safety practices so that the community does its
part to improve public safety.
Achieving Our Vision
Residents and businesses look to the City to protect the community from
threats to public safety. Maintaining a safe community requires constant
assessment of the City’s needs regarding emergency preparedness and
hazards mitigation. While the City has no control over earthquakes or
landslides, it can establish policies that minimize exposure to these hazards.
Our vision is to create a City where residents and businesses are and feel
safe. In Arcadia, we go to work, school, and shopping knowing that our
Police and Fire Departments, as well as many volunteers and involved               Keeping Arcadia safe is a

The Safety Element is one of the General Plan elements required by State
law. The City has long emphasized a proactive approach to public safety
planning, which involves identifying and avoiding or mitigating hazards
present in the environment that may adversely affect property and
threaten lives. Government Code Sections 65302(g) and 65302(f) identify
several issues to consider in such planning efforts, as does California
Health and Safety Code Section 56050.1. In Arcadia, issues of concern
are:
        Seismic hazards, including seismically induced surface rupture,
         ground shaking, and ground failure
        Dam/reservoir failure

Environmental Hazards
Arcadia’s location adjacent to the San Gabriel Mountains exposes the City
to several environmental conditions that have shaped local landforms and
now affect how certain properties can be used and developed.
Seismic and Geologic Concerns
The Southern California landscape clearly reveals the earth forces that we
live with daily. The mountain ranges are expressions of extensive faulting
and movement of the plates that comprise the Earth’s surface, with local
tectonic activity continuing to push the San Gabriel Mountains upward at
rate of up to two centimeters per year. The San Gabriel
Mountains’ steep slopes historically caused massive volumes
of rocks and debris to flow down into the San Gabriel Valley
during periods of heavy rain, creating the rocky alluvial soils
that underlie Arcadia. However, major public works projects
in the mountains during the last century have largely
contained both storm water runoff and debris flows.
Nonetheless, Arcadia still needs to plan for the earthquakes,
secondary seismic effects, and geologic conditions that will
continue to be of concern.
Earthquakes that generate strong ground shaking and surface fault
ruptures are considered primary seismic hazards; secondary hazards
resulting from seismic activity include landslides, liquefaction, ground
fissures, and seiches (wave oscillation of the surface of water in an
enclosed or partially enclosed body of water such as a reservoir or lake).
Earthquakes and their related effects have the greatest potential to impact
a large portion of the population. Landslides and ground subsidence have
more localized effects.
Earthquakes
An earthquake is the result of movement and shifting of the Earth’s surface.
Movement occurs along fractures or faults, which represent the contact
point between two or more geologic formations. Earth movement, known
as seismic activity, causes pressure to build up along a fault, and the
release of pressure results in the ground shaking effects we call an
earthquake.

Earthquake-related hazards have the potential to cause serious damage,
injury, and death if the seismic event is large enough to generate short
duration, high-peak ground accelerations (ground motion) or long duration,
moderate to high ground acceleration. Fault rupture through a structure
would likely cause significant damage and may cause collapse of walls and
ceilings. Normal foundations would be dislocated and rendered unusable.
Combined with strong ground shaking, rupture is a very serious hazard.
Rupture can also result in damage to utilities infrastructure and water lines,
natural gas lines, power lines, and sewer system interruptions. Streets
could be passable with some difficulty if fault motion is horizontal. Vertical
fault offsets could render streets impassable for emergency traffic, except
to high-ground clearance vehicles with four-wheel drive.
Located along the southern slope of the San Gabriel Mountains, the City of
Arcadia is situated within a very seismically active area of Southern
California.1 There are currently five documented faults, fault zones, or
groundwater barriers that may be faults that underlie Arcadia, each having
different potential impacts (Figures S-1 and S-2):
         Raymond fault
         Sierra Madre fault zone and associated groundwater barriers
         Puente Hills (blind thrust)
         Upper Elysian Park (blind thrust)
         Eaton Wash groundwater barrier
The two active and potentially active faults that pass through Arcadia and
are evident at the ground surface (or just below it) are the Sierra Madre
and Raymond faults. Deep beneath the City are two so-called blind thrust
faults: the shallower Elysian Park fault and the deeper Puente Hills fault.
They are called blind thrust faults due to their depth and the fact that fault
movement consists of upward or thrusting action. The Eaton Wash
groundwater barrier shows no surface geologic evidence of existence, and
the nature of this possible buried fault is not known. In addition to these
local faults, another 20 faults have been identified within a 35-mile radius
of City Hall (see Table S-1).
Ground Shaking
Ground shaking is the general term that refers to all aspects of movement
of the Earth’s surface resulting from a seismic event. Ground shaking is
normally the major cause of damage in earthquakes, and the amount of
damage generally correlates to the magnitude and proximity to the event’s
epicenter. If any of the faults within a 35-mile radius were to achieve their
maximum earthquake potential, the Raymond, Sierra Madre, Puente Hills,
Clamshell-Sawpit, Upper Elysian Park, and Verdugo faults represent those
faults with the most potential for causing damage in Arcadia to the City
due to ground shaking.

The types of effects felt by an earthquake depend upon many factors, most
notably the intensity of the event, distance to the earthquake epicenter, the
depth of the earthquake, and local soils conditions. Seismologists use a
logarithmic magnitude scale to describe the intensity of earthquakes.
However, what impresses us most when an earthquake occurs are its
effects. What kind of damage correlates to, for example, a 5.4 Magnitude
earthquake? The Modified Mercalli Scale, presented in Table S-2, was
developed to provide a correlation between the logarithmic Magnitude
scale and general public understanding of the potential destructive effects
of earthquakes of varying magnitudes.

To reduce the ground shaking hazards associated with seismic activity, the
City requires that all new development conform to current City and State
seismic and geotechnical codes. The California Building Code, which is
adopted by the City, contains seismic regulations that are enforced during
the design and construction phases of development to ensure any structure
has the integrity to remain safe during seismic activity. California’s
Unreinforced Masonry Building Law (URM) is another measure that guards
against building collapse in the case of seismic activity. In response, the
City inventories unreinforced masonry buildings and conducts a seismic
strengthening program to retrofit masonry buildings to prevent injury or
damage. As discussed in the Emergency Preparedness section of this
element, the City maintains up-to-date emergency response plans and
educates the public about response procedures for earthquakes.
Fault Rupture and Fault Hazard Zones
Fault rupture is the term used to describe the movement along a fault line
that is evidenced by a break in the ground surface. The location of a fault
rupture generally can be assumed to occur along an active major fault
trace. The Sierra Madre and Raymond faults represent the two local faults
that have the most potential to create ground surface rupture conditions.
The Raymond fault traverses a significant section of the City (Figure S-2)
and has the potential to cause a five- to six-foot offset if severe ground
shaking occurs in the event of a major earthquake. The Sierra Made fault
crosses the northern portion of Arcadia and affects fewer properties.
However, a rupture along the Sierra Madre fault still represents a serious
potential hazard. In the event of a 7.2 Magnitude earthquake along the
Sierra Madre fault, ground rupture movements could be very large, possibly
10 feet or more.

The Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act was passed in 1972 to
prevent the construction of buildings on active faults. State geologists are
required to publish maps that identify and establish earthquake fault zones
that indicate the location of active faults. Each of the maps is then
distributed to affected cities and counties for planning purposes. Before a
project can be permitted within the fault zone, the permitting jurisdiction
must require a geologic investigation by a licensed geologist to prove that
proposed buildings will not be constructed across active faults. The
Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone underlying Arcadia is shown in Figure
S-2.
In addition to the known faults, Arcadia is crossed by potentially active and
concealed fault traces whose precise locations are not known and/or which
have not studied to the degree that activity is completely understood.
Because of the Sierra Madre fault zone potentially impacts the northern
corner of the City and limited knowledge is available regarding fault
segment activity levels and trace locations, prudent planning calls for
establishment of fault hazard management zones. The intent of a fault
hazard management zone, or FHMZ, is to require that geologic
investigations, which may include fault trenching, be performed if
conventional structures designed for human occupancy are proposed
within the zone. The goal would be to refine fault location and create a
fault activity database for the faults in the City. Figure S-2 identifies the
proposed boundaries of an FHMZ for the Sierra Madre fault which take
into account areas with 500 feet of mapped faults and groundwater
barriers most associated with the Sierra Madre fault zone.
Landslides and Liquefaction
Landslides
Landslides can result from earthquake-related ground shaking or failure of
steep slopes due to water saturation or unstable soil conditions. Landslides
can overrun structures, people, or property. They can sever utility lines and
block roads, thereby hindering rescue operations following an earthquake.
California law requires identification of landslide zones, in which the
stability of hill slopes must be evaluated.
The Seismic Hazards Mapping Act (Public Resources Code 2690 et seq.),
passed by the Legislature in 1990, addresses secondary seismic hazards
such as landslides and liquefaction. The Act is implemented by the
California Geological Survey, which prepares seismic hazards maps for
jurisdictions throughout the State. State maps (see Figure S-3) indicate
that landslide hazards in Arcadia are present only within the foothill areas.
Also, potential rock fall hazards exist along Santa Anita Canyon Road.
These areas are not necessarily unstable, but the hazard maps provide an
opportunity to consider these conditions when planning for new
development or redevelopment. While there may be evidence for some
landslide activity in these areas of Arcadia in past earthquakes, most of the
basis for the mapping of potential earthquake-induced landslide areas is
ground slope and geologic formations characteristics.

Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a geologic process that causes various types of ground
failure. Liquefaction typically occurs in loose, saturated sediments. When
liquefaction occurs, the sediments involved have a total or substantial loss
of shear strength and behave like a liquid substance. Liquefaction can
cause structural distress or failure due to ground settlement, a loss of
bearing capacity in the foundation soils, and the buoyant rise of buried
structures. Liquefaction-induced ground failure historically has been a
major cause of earthquake damage in Southern California. During the 1971
San Fernando and 1994 Northridge earthquakes, significant damage to
roads, utility pipelines, buildings, and other structures in the Los Angeles
area was caused by liquefaction-induced ground displacement.
The potential danger of liquefaction-induced ground failure can range from
simple ground cracking to complex lateral spreading landslides, conditions
that can potentially cause damage to both surface and subsurface
structures. The severity of the damage cause by liquefaction is dependent
up on the magnitude of the failure and location of structures in relation to
the failure. Localities most susceptible to liquefaction-induced damage are
those that are underlain by loose sediment, contain shallow groundwater,
and are susceptible to ground shaking.
California law requires identification of liquefaction zones. As they do for
landslide hazards, the California Geological Society’s seismic hazard zones
maps delineate areas within Arcadia that are susceptible to liquefaction.
Figure S-3 identifies four primary liquefaction areas within the Arcadia
planning area: southeast of Live Oak Avenue to the San Gabriel River,
along Live Oak Avenue between Santa Anita and Tenth Avenue, along the
wash areas of Santa Anita Canyon just north of the Raymond fault, and an
area north of the Raymond fault.
Minimizing Risks from Landslides and Liquefaction
The State Hazards Mapping Act requires that any development proposed
within a State-delineated seismic hazard zone be evaluated for landslides
and liquefaction by a certified engineering geologist and/or registered civil
engineer. Likewise, project review by the local agency must be performed
by geologists and engineers with the same credentials and experience.
Seismic hazard maps may not show all areas that have the potential for
liquefaction and landslides, nor is information shown on the maps sufficient
to serve as a substitute for detailed site investigations.
A considerable part of the City’s mapped liquefiable areas are already
built upon, mostly with residential, commercial, and industrial development.
A moderate to strong earthquake occurring along a nearby fault could
cause extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure in these areas.
Since retrofitting measures generally may not be feasible due to cost, the
City will be prepared to respond to damage and disruption in the event of
an earthquake. Any new development will require liquefaction susceptibility
studies as part of the design and construction processes.

Tsunamis
A tsunami is a large sea wave generated by any large-scale disturbance of
the ocean floor that occurs in a short period of time, such as an
earthquake, volcanic eruption, or coastal landslide, which can cause a
sudden displacement of water. Although local earthquakes may cause
tsunamis, most past tsunamis in Southern California were associated with
distant earthquakes that traveled great distances across the Pacific Ocean
basin. Tsunami hazards are not of concern in Arcadia due to elevation and
distance from the ocean.
Goals and Policies
Identification, avoidance, and sound mitigation practices represent the best
approaches to addressing seismic and geologic hazards. While the
Raymond fault zone, landslide areas, and liquefaction zones have been
mapped, uncertainty remains regarding the location of Sierra Madre fault
traces. The City will explore the creation of a fault hazard management
zone for this fault. Goals with regard to seismic and geologic hazards are
as follows.
Goal S-1:                   Minimized potential for loss of life, physical
                            injury, and property damage resulting from
                            earthquakes and geologic hazards
    Policy S-1.1:           Explore the creation of a fault hazard
                            management zone for the Sierra Madre fault.
    Policy S-1.2:           Emphasize carefully planned development
                            within seismic and geologic hazard areas to
                            minimize potential hazards risk as the City’s
                            preferred hazards management strategy.
    Policy S-1.3:           Require detailed geologic investigations to
                            accompany development proposals for sites
                            that lie within known or suspected seismic and
                            geologic hazard areas. Require that such
                            investigations and reports conform to accepted
                            professional standards and any applicable
                            State and City requirements.
    Policy S-1.4:           Monitor activities of the California Geological
                            Survey and other relevant agencies and
                            organizations to stay informed regarding new
                            mapping and reports that advance the state of
                            knowledge of seismic and geologic hazards
                            affecting Arcadia.

     Policy S-1.5:           Continue enforcing the most rigorous building
                             and grading codes which govern seismic safety.
     Policy S-1.6:           Require the removal or retrofit, as appropriate,
                             of any hazardous or substandard structures
                             that may collapse in the event of an
                             earthquake.

Arcadia and surrounding areas are, like most of Southern California,
subject to unpredictable seasonal rainfall. Most years, the scant winter
rains are barely sufficient to turn the hills green for a few weeks, but every
few years the region is subjected to periods of intense and sustained
precipitation that sometimes results in localized flooding.
Natural (Storm) Flooding
In Southern California, storm flooding is difficult to predict, and thus plan
for, because rainfall varies from year to year. To prepare and mitigate
hazards from flooding, the City of Arcadia participates in the National
Flood Insurance Program. Flood Insurance Rate Maps, or FIRMs, which are
prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), identify
potential flood zones (Figure S-4). Flood hazards related to storm events
generally are described in terms of a 100- or 500-year flood. A 100-year
flood is defined as a major flood event that has a one percent or greater
chance of occurring during any one year. Flood hazard planning practices
addresses such storms, as well as 500-year events. These floods are
considered severe; however, these floods can be
reasonably predicted and therefore reasonably
mitigated.
As noted above, the Los Angeles County
Department of Public Works has constructed
regional flood and debris control facilities
throughout the region, including the flood control
channels in Arcadia that direct runoff water
through the City into regional facilities to the
south. A system of spreading basins manages
storm water runoff and helps recharge
groundwater basins. Locally, the City maintains
approximately four miles of subsurface storm drains that flow into the

Flooding Due to Dam Inundation
Inundation can occur as a result of significant structural damage to a dam
or other water retention facility upstream of Arcadia. Dam or reservoir
failure could occur as a result of an earthquake, erosion, design flaw, or
water overflow during storms (for a dam). Arcadia’s location along the San
Gabriel Mountain foothills and below extensive regional flood control
facilities places it within the potential inundation area of six water retention
facilities (see Figure S-5).
Section 8589.5 of the California Government Code requires dam owners to
provide the Governor's Office of Emergency Services with an inundation
map showing the extent of damage to life and property that would occur
given a complete and sudden dam failure at full capacity. The inundation
areas for each water retention facility are shown on Figure S-4.
The Santa Anita Dam represents the facility that could
have the greatest flooding impact on the City. A
catastrophic failure of the Santa Anita Dam could result in
floodwaters storming down Santa Anita Canyon to about
Orange Grove Avenue and then spreading to cover
roughly the eastern one-half of Arcadia to the East Wash.
Inundation from a failure of the Sierra Madre Dam would
cover the area north of I-210 to Grandview Avenue
between the Arcadia East Wash and First Avenue. Areas
immediately adjacent to drainage courses would be the
most susceptible to damage from rapidly flowing water,
severe erosion, and associated floating debris. Higher
areas and those farthest from the existing flood channels
could suffer some damage from rising water.

Seiche Potential
A seiche is the formation of large waves in landlocked bodies of water due
to seismic activity. In the event of major ground shaking, a seiche can occur
and potentially cause major flooding and water inundation damage. While
no large water bodies exist in Arcadia, waters stored behind Santa Anita
Dam could experience seismic-induced wave action. Also, seiche-type
action could be of concern in above-ground water reservoirs, such as any of
the 16 reservoirs in Arcadia. Major reservoirs include the Baldwin Reservoir
(9.3 million gallons), St. Josephs Reservoir (5.25 million gallons), and Santa
Anita Reservoir 4 (3.5 million gallons). Reservoirs are engineered to guard
against failure due to seismic activity, both from structural failure and
internal wave action that could be generated by an earthquake.

Although highly unlikely, under the most severe earthquake scenario along
the Sierra Madre fault, water retention facilities could be damaged and
cause a release of water.
Appropriate mitigation for this type of flooding consists of evacuation
planning for most areas of the City and elevating new critical facilities (see
discussion below) above the predicted flood level for its location.
Goals and Policies
As flood hazards are well addressed by existing storm control
infrastructure, City efforts will focus on maintenance. With regard to dam
inundation, the City will work with responsible agencies—and the Los
Angeles County Department of Public Works in particular—to protect
Arcadia residents and businesses from potential inundation.

Goal S-2:                    Superior storm drainage and flood control
                             facilities that minimize risk of flooding
    Policy S-2.1:            Prioritize improvements to Arcadia’s storm
                             drain system in areas that are prone to
                             localized ponding and flooding.
    Policy S-2.2:            Continue rigorous maintenance of storm
                             drainage and flood control facilities within the
                             City’s jurisdiction.
    Policy S-2.3:            Require that new development projects retain
                             as much runoff as possible on the development
                             site to reduce flow volumes into the storm drain
                             system, allow for recharge of the groundwater
                             basins, and comply with the City’s storm water
                             permitting requirements (consistent with the
                             National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
                             Systems program, or NPDES) and employ Best
                             Management Practices (BMPs).
    Policy S-2.4:            Support efforts of the Los Angeles County
                             Department of Public Works and other agencies
                             responsible for the maintenance of dams and
                             reservoirs above Arcadia to improve conditions
                             of the facilities and reduce the risk of inundation
                             resulting from dam or reservoir failure.

humans settled the area, but fires were not of significant concern until
people started building houses in the hills and mountains where fires are
part of nature’s processes. Wildfires are extremely costly, not only to
property owners and residents, but to government agencies as well.
The wildfire front is not the only source of risk; embers, or firebrands, travel
far beyond the area impacted by the front and pose a risk of ignition to a
structure or fuel source. Since fires ignore civil boundaries, cities, counties,
special districts, State and federal agencies work together to bring fires
under control. Preventive measures can be very effective in minimizing the
scope of a fire event, including brush clearance around structures,

controlled burns to protect habited areas, and limiting or avoiding any new
development in high-risk areas.
The threat of fire to hillside developments at the base
of the San Gabriel Mountains is of real concern to
Arcadia residents living in the foothills. On October 27,
1993, the Kinneola fire destroyed 122 single family
homes in Altadena, Pasadena, and Sierra Madre. In
2009, Los Angeles County was ravaged by the Station
fire, the largest brush fire in Los Angeles County’s
modern history. The fire burned an estimated 160,000
acres of land (approximately 250 square miles) across
the Angeles National Forest, costing millions of dollars
to fight, demanding extraordinary fire-fighting
resources, and threatening communities very close to
Arcadia. The northern portion of Arcadia has similar
topography and vegetation as the areas destroyed by
the Kinneloa and Station fires, and represents the area
in Arcadia most exposed to wildfire hazards. The local
U. S. Forest Service office states that maintenance of Chantry Flats Road,
which passes through Arcadia, Sierra Madre, and the Angeles National
Forest, is critical to providing fire prevention and response activities within
the natural hillside areas above the City.
California’s Public Resource Code and Government Code 51175-89 direct
the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL Fire) to
map areas of significant fire hazards based on fuels, terrain, weather, and
other relevant factors. CAL Fire created a mapping system that identifies
Fire Hazard Zones, and has created a map showing areas that are
considered to be Very High Fire Hazards Zones in Arcadia. The map has
been officially adopted by the City (see Figure S-6), and the City has
targeted these areas to implement stringent wildland fire mitigation
strategies. New construction within this zone, also known as a
wildland/urban interface area, is required to maintain “defensible space”
(areas clear of possible fire fuels such as dried vegetation and additionally
provide emergency access) and to comply with special building code
requirements for high-fire hazard areas, including such measures as
ignition-resistant construction materials for roofs, eaves, vents, exterior
walls, exterior windows, doors, and decks.
Urban Fires
Building and equipment fires potentially could occur any day of the week,
regardless of weather and fuel load. Although urban fires accounted for
less than four percent of the City Fire Department’s total incident
responses in 2007, fire damage to residential structures alone was
estimated at around $1.5 million. The Fire Department focuses on fire
prevention and education to keep incident levels and damage low.
Prevention includes having appropriate fire and life safety systems in place,
such as automatic fire sprinklers and smoke alarms, and conformance with
the City’s adopted fire codes.

Due to factors such as manufacturing operations and/or storage involving
chemicals or flammable materials, industrial businesses located north of
Huntington Drive and east of Santa Anita Avenue, and those within the
southeast corner of the City, have higher hazard levels than other uses in
the City. All businesses are required to comply with Fire Department
requirements regarding storage of flammable and hazardous materials and
emergency incident planning. Construction standards in Building and Fire
Codes provide mitigation against fire events and fire damage. Emergency
fire services are discussed in further detail in the Emergency Services
section that follows.
The City supplements its own fire suppression resources with mutual aid
agreements with the U.S. Forest Service and the County of Los Angeles for
fire protection services in the hillside areas. Mutual aid agreements with
neighboring jurisdictions for general fire and emergency services provide
additional response capabilities throughout the rest of the City. A
discussion of Arcadia Fire Department’s facilities and services is located in
the Emergency Services section that follows.
Goals and Policies
The City implements State and local fire codes, policies, and programs to
protect the community from wildland and urban fires. Enforcement of the
California Fire Code has been the City’s most effective way of guarding
against fire incidents. The California Fire Code provides the minimum
standards that govern projects ensuring the use of proper building
materials, fire protection system design, occupancy limits, and emergency
access. Other fire policies such as storage limitations and the City’s fire
sprinkler standards for commercial and residential structures help prevent
and limit damage from fires.
The City has also been aggressive in minimizing wildland fire hazards,
specifically by adopting wildfire prevention policies that apply to all
properties within the wildland-urban interface zone. Requirements in this
zone include planting of appropriate plant materials, landscape
maintenance, irrigating vegetation, proper storage of fuels (firewood,
propane tanks), and roof and chimney maintenance. Additionally, the City
enforces California Government Code and California Building Code
requirements that further preventative measures in areas designated as
Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones.

                  approaches,        defensible    spaces,    brush
                  clearance, required fire flows, on-site or nearby
                  fire-fighting     equipment,     and     adequate
                  emergency vehicle access to accommodate the
                  weight and size of vehicles..
    Policy S-3.5: Prohibit new development in areas which do not
                  have adequate water pressure or fire flows until
                  sufficient pressure and fire flows can reliably be
                  provided and maintained.
    Policy S-3.6: Define and maintain effective evacuation routes
                  for neighborhoods within high-fire-hazard areas.
    Policy S-3.7: Perform regular life safety inspections of all
                  commercial, multifamily, and brush area
                  occupancies to ensure compliance with City and
                  State fire codes, standards, and regulations.

Human-Caused Hazards
Hazardous Materials
Hazardous materials and chemicals are used daily in households and
businesses throughout Arcadia. Not limited to the popular conception of
large chemical and industrial factories, sources of hazardous materials can
originate from seemingly innocuous places such as service stations,
hospitals, dry cleaners, and almost any industrial business. Hazardous
waste is any material with properties that make it dangerous or potentially
harmful to human health or the environment. Hazardous waste can take
the form of liquids, solids, contained gases, or sludge, and can be the by-
products of manufacturing processes or simply discarded commercial
products, like cleaning fluids and pesticides.
Hazardous Materials Sites
Arcadia’s land use patterns generally separate industry from residential
uses, although large-scale industrial activities have the potential to impact
broad areas should an accident occur. Also, commercial freight carriers
transporting hazardous substances along major roads or railways present
potential hazards.        Federal, State, and County agencies enforce
regulations for hazardous waste generators and users, and these
regulations provide a high degree of protection. The Arcadia Fire
Department has inspection programs to monitor proper storage of
hazardous materials.
Figure S-6 shows the general location of businesses that use, store,
produce, or transport hazardous materials. Specific site addresses are not
given as businesses that use, store, produce, or transport hazardous
materials change over time. Also as new sites can be discovered or existing
sites remediated. Areas with concentrations of such businesses include the
industrial districts along the railroad line between Santa Anita Avenue and
Second Avenue and at the southern edge of the City near the San Gabriel
River, and commercial districts along Duarte Road, Baldwin Avenue,
Foothill Boulevard, and Live Oak Avenue.
Hazardous Material Generators
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains and publishes a
database that lists properties that handle or produce hazardous materials.
Small businesses like dry cleaners, auto repair shops, hospitals, and metal
plating shops usually are defined as generators of small quantities of
hazardous waste. The EPA defines a small quantity generator as one which
produces between 100 and 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per
month. As of 2006, approximately 63 small quantity generators operated
in Arcadia. Many of these businesses are located in the industrial and
commercial districts mentioned above (Figure S-7).

businesses like chemical manufacturers. The EPA defines a large quantity
generator as a business which produces over 1,000 kilograms of
hazardous waste per month. As of 2008, three large quantity generators
are located in Arcadia. Two of the three large quantity generators are
located in industrial areas in the southeastern portion of the City, one
along Lower Azusa Road by the San Gabriel River, and the other on Clark
Street by Peck Road. The third site is located on La Porte Street near
Santa Anita Avenue.
Underground Storage Tanks
An underground storage tank is any one or combination of tanks, including
associated piping, used to contain industrial solvents, petroleum products,
and other hazardous substances. Since the early 1980s, the State has
recognized leaking underground storage tanks as the primary cause of
groundwater contamination by gasoline compounds and solvents. In
California, regulations aimed at mitigating underground storage tank leaks
were initiated in 1983. The following year, underground tank systems were
required to be installed in accordance with new standards that addressed
prevention of future leaks.
Legislation also required owners of known leaking underground storage
tanks to prepare clean-up plans. Many of the leaking tanks were at
gasoline service stations or businesses that maintained fuel tanks for
business operations. Through vigorous programs to address these
conditions, leaking underground storage tank issues in Arcadia have
largely been abated.
Household Hazardous Materials

reactive ingredients are referred to as household hazardous waste (HHW).        See the Circulation

health.
City programs, operated jointly with the County of Los Angeles, allow
residents to take advantage of curbside pick-up services which deliver the
household waste to proper disposal or recycling facilities, or to drop off
household wastes at specified locations during countywide “round up”
events. Residents can also drop off used oil and filters at advertised
locations in the City year-round. Through comprehensive and multi-lingual
resident education efforts, the City has been able to limit incidents of
illegal household hazardous waste disposal.

Used or discarded electronics, such as televisions, cell phones, and obsolete
equipment like videocassette recorders are referred to as e-waste.
Electronic components can contain toxic metals and non-biodegradable
materials that should not be put into sanitary landfills.
Goals and Policies
As is the case with natural hazards, recognition of human-caused hazards
and mitigation represent the most effective means of minimizing the
number and scope accidents resulting from the presence of hazardous
materials in the community, and associated with terrorism. Cooperative
City efforts with federal and State programs effectively regulate the use,
storage, and transportation of hazardous materials. Programs such as the
Hazardous Materials Disclosure Program require that businesses which
handle defined quantities of materials submit a hazardous materials
inventory and contingency plan. The Aboveground Petroleum Storage Act
requires owner and operators of aboveground petroleum storage tanks to
file with the State Water Resources Control Board, and to develop and
implement a spill prevention control and countermeasure plan. The Fire
Department handles abatement and clean up of any hazardous material
deposited on any property or facility in Arcadia in compliance with State
and federal standards. Additionally, the City promotes public awareness
for proper handling and disposal of household hazardous waste.
Goal S-4:                  A continued high level of protection from risks
                           to life, the environment, and property
                           associated with human-caused hazards in
                           Arcadia
     Policy S-4.1:         Adopt and strictly enforce the most current
                           regulations governing hazardous waste
                           management.
     Policy S-4.2:         Minimize exposure of the environment, critical
                           facilities, and residences to hazardous
                           materials.
     Policy S-4.3:         Ensure that all businesses and hazardous
                           materials transportation services within the City
                           adhere to the requirements of the City’s
                           hazardous materials plans and programs.
     Policy S-4.4:         Provide a high level of public awareness of all
                           County and City household hazardous waste
                           programs and activities.

Emergency Services
Arcadia pursues two key strategies to address threats to public health and
safety: 1) plan to prevent them and 2) develop responses that minimize the
extent of distress when a disaster occurs. The City has consistently
provided its residents, businesses, and visitors with superior emergency
preparedness and response services. This commitment will continue by
reducing hazards and responding quickly and efficiently to all types of
incidents.
Fire Protection and Emergency
Services
The mission of the Arcadia Fire Department is to proactively prevent
situations of risk due to fires, and to deliver the services necessary to
minimize the loss of life and property threatened by the hazards of fire,
medical and rescue emergencies, hazardous materials incidents, and
disaster situations. The Arcadia Fire Department is an all-risk department
that provides fire suppression, urban search and rescue, paramedic
ambulance service, fire prevention inspections/permits, public fire
education programs, emergency preparedness planning, fire cause and
origin investigation, fire patrols, and other services based on community
needs. Services are provided from three stations, each of which has a
primary service area but responds to wherever needed in Arcadia.
        Fire Station No. 105, at 710 South Santa Anita Avenue, provides
         fire protection services to the downtown business district and the
         southeast portion of the City. The station was constructed in 2008
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                                        Safety | 8-29

         and can accommodate up to 12 firefighters per 24-hour shift. This
         station serves as headquarters and houses fire suppression staff,
         administrative staff, and fire prevention bureau personnel. The
         station is equipped with one engine, one truck company, one rescue
         ambulance, and a battalion chief vehicle, reserve engine, and one
         State-owned fire engine.
        Fire Station No. 106, located at 630 South Baldwin Avenue,
         primarily serves the central and southwest portions of the City. The
         station, constructed in April of 1994, can accommodate up to 10
         firefighters per 24-hour shift. Equipment includes one engine, one
         rescue ambulance, an Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) unit, a
         reserve engine, a reserve rescue ambulance, a mobile air unit, and
         equipment.
        Fire Station No. 107, at 79 West Orange Grove, provides fire
         protection services to the northern portion of the City. The station
         has been in operation since 1948 and was remodeled in 2003. The
         station can accommodate up to four firefighters per 24-hour shift.
         The station is equipped with one engine and one reserve engine.
         An antique fire engine—a 1926 American La France restored
         antique fire pumper—is on display as part of the Department’s
         educational programs.
Because of its successful fire education and prevention efforts, the Fire
Department finds that the majority of its responses consists of emergency
medical and rescue services as opposed to fire suppression incidents. The
second highest type of incident response is fire related. Fire and hazardous
material incidents are fairly infrequent. The average response time to the
majority of incidents is four to five minutes. Only rarely do Department
personnel take six minutes or more to respond to calls for service. The City
has not identified a need to build a fourth fire station, as current station
locations provide excellent response capabilities.
Staffing
The City strives to accommodate the National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) Standard 1710, Standard for the Organization and Deployment of
Fire Suppression Operations, Emergency Medical Operations, and Special
Operations to the Public by Career Fire Departments, which requires that a
minimum of four firefighters be assigned to engine and truck companies.
Emergency Response Times
One of the primary concerns of the Fire Department is response times;
making every effort to reduce or maintain response times continues to be a
goal. According to the Verdugo Fire Communications 2008-2009 Annual
Report (Verdugo Fire Communications dispatches all emergency calls for
the fire department), response times for the Department in 2008 were as
follows:
8-30 | Safety                                                   Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

         1.   The Department responded to fire emergencies in five minutes
              or less 64.2 percent of the time, with an average response time
              of 4:32 minutes.
         2. The Department responded to medical emergencies in five
              minutes or less 70.9 percent of the time, with an average
              response time of 4:08 minutes.
The Department strives to comply with NFPA Standard 1710, which states
first-arriving fire department units should arrive at the scene of either a fire
or medical emergency within 240 seconds 90 percent of the time.
As new commercial and industrial development occurs within the Live Oak
Corridor and Lower Azusa Reclamation area consistent with the Land Use
Plan, the City will assess whether Fire Department response times to these
areas remain sufficient and within NFPA Standard 1710. Issues considered
during such an assessment would include verifying that equipment and
staffing resources meet response time standards or whether a fourth fire
station would be needed to serve the southeast portion of Arcadia.
Increased traffic on major, primary, and secondary arterials and enhanced
collector roads could potentially affect response times. The City will
evaluate options that may help maintain or enhance response times; these
options may include:
         1.   Add traffic signal preemption devices at major intersections,
              and install traffic signal preemption emitters on emergency
              response vehicles.
         2. Explore the possibility of integrating mobile data computers
              (MDC) on emergency response vehicles and the City’s
              intelligent transportation system (ITS). One of the functions of
              an MDC is to provide a suggested response route to
              emergency incidents. Integrating ITS and MDC could provide a
              method of maintaining traffic flow at intersections along
              suggested response routes.
Fire Prevention and Emergency Services
Programs
Fire prevention is the preferred way of protecting Arcadia from the
dangers of fire. Fire prevention consists of design review and inspection of
commercial and residential structures under construction; periodic life
safety inspections of commercial, multifamily, and brush area occupancies;
and public education programs. Although it is difficult to quantify, the
City’s Fire Prevention Program has greatly reduced property loss, injuries,
and loss of life associated with incidents and fires. In 2007, members of the
Arcadia Fire Department conducted 3,714 fire inspections of businesses
and residences to review new construction, perform annual life safety
inspections, and ensure fire code compliance. Fire Prevention Bureau staff
perform fire code compliance inspections on certain new businesses that
Arcadia General Plan – November 2010                                             Safety | 8-31

are of a higher risk in nature. Performing this initial inspection aids business
owners by providing them specific safety requirements that their
occupancy will need prior to commencing operations.
The City will periodically assess the necessity for additional staffing in the
Fire Prevention Bureau as commercial occupancies increase. With the
increases in commercial occupancies, fire and life safety inspection loads
will increase, and the potential for additional staffing in the Fire Prevention
Bureau may be necessary.
Since emergency medical and rescue services
represent the majority of annual response
incidents, the City established the Paramedic
Membership Program to minimize the cost to the
community for emergency response. Enrollees
sign up with the program voluntarily and pay a
nominal membership fee. In return, the program
protects its members from all out-of-pocket
expenses for emergency paramedic and
ambulance transport services provided within
the City of Arcadia as a result of a 911 call. Since
the program’s inception, members have saved
over one million dollars on emergency
paramedic and ambulance services.
Public education is one of the key elements in safeguarding a community
from fire and environmental hazards. Accordingly, the Arcadia Fire
Department routinely and enthusiastically shares fire safety knowledge
with the community. In 2007, the Department organized 18 public
education tours of fire stations and 51 demonstrations for the Arcadia
Unified School District and various community organizations. During Fire
Prevention Month, Fire Prevention Bureau staff and fire suppression
personnel coordinate visits to school campuses to give fire safety
presentations to both students and teachers.
Joint Training Facility
The City has considered planning for and constructing a joint training
facility to be utilized by Fire, Police, and Public Works Departments and all
City employees to overcome the lack of training sites within the City of
Arcadia. All training occurs at facilities outside of Arcadia. With the
anticipated increase in call volumes, it becomes even more important to
keep units and crews in town at a local training site for rapid response to
emergencies while crews are involved in training exercises.
The primary element of the joint training facility would be a training tower
with an enclosed stairwell, exterior balconies, accessible rooftops, water
standpipe and sprinkler systems, smoke-generating system, anchor points
for repelling, and a burn room for live fire training. Such a facility would
enable Fire and Police personnel to practice multiple disciplines within their
areas of expertise. Training props would be available to simulate trench
rescue, confined space rescue, and building collapse scenarios. These

training props would enable Fire, Police, and Public Works personnel to
practice the rescue of persons injured or trapped and provide a suitable
site for Public Works and Fire personnel to stay current in Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) mandated training. Additionally,
a multi-use community room would be available to all City of Arcadia
Departments for classroom training and meetings.
The addition of a local, City-owned joint training facility will assist the Fire
Department with maintaining its Insurance Services Office (ISO) Class I
rating. The ISO Class I rating benefits the entire community by keeping fire
insurance costs lower for commercial and residential property owners.
Law Enforcement and Crime
Prevention
Arcadia residents and businesses enjoy a very safe community. The mission
of the Arcadia Police Department is “dedication to protecting quality of life
and providing the highest level of service.” Arcadia emphasizes that the
best way to provide a safer community and reduce the cost of providing
law enforcement services is to prevent crime. The majority of crimes that
the Department responds to are property crimes, the largest occurring
property crime being larceny, followed by burglary. Only a small
percentage of crimes in Arcadia are violent crimes.
                                                                                 In 2003, the Arcadia

                                                                                 “Making a Difference.”
The Arcadia Police Department has over 75 sworn peace officers and
support staff. The Department also employs a volunteer services
coordinator, part-time crossing guards, reserve police officers, and civilian
volunteers. In addition to general duty policing, the Department has a
detective bureau, traffic and parking bureau, records department, dispatch
department, community and youth services department, and several
specialized teams and police units. The Community and Youth Services
Department is primarily responsible for the public outreach and public
education efforts of the Police Department.

Community-based policing is the foundation philosophy of the Arcadia
Police Department. This philosophy is based on a strong relationship
between the Police Department and the community at large. The
Department maintains these relationships throughout the year through
public speaking engagements, meetings, and public events. This approach
is augmented by its various volunteer programs. The Volunteer Services
Section allows the Department to augment its resources without additional
costs to the City. For example, the Amateur Radio and Auxiliary
Communications Service (ACS) is a volunteer program that uses amateur
radio ("ham") operators for crime suppression, surveillance, disaster, and
special events communications. The Chaplain Program, initiated in 1994,
offers spiritual guidance, counsel, and assistance for officers and their
                                            families. The Volunteers in
                                            Patrol Support (VIPS) provides
                                            additional volunteer support to
                                            the Arcadia Police Department
                                            operations, increases police
                                            visibility in the City, and
                                            enhances partnerships with the
                                            community.     The     Mounted
                                            Volunteer    Patrol    program
                                            assists the regular mounted
officers and other Department officers with patrol of horse trails, the
shopping mall, and Santa Anita Park. The Arcadia Police Department
Explorer Program is designed for youth 14 to 18 years of age who assist the
Police with searches for evidence, report writing, desk officer duties,
command post operations, crime prevention surveillance, disaster
assistance, crowd and traffic control, security at major events, and other
challenging assignments.
Mutual Aid Agreements
While the Arcadia Police Department is tasked with preserving the safety
and quality of life of the community and the Fire Department is tasked with
the responsibility of fire prevention and fire suppression in the City, both
departments team with other public safety agencies to coordinate during
emergencies.       These teaming arrangements are handled through
automatic and mutual aid agreements, which obligate the public safety
departments to help each other under pre-defined circumstances.
The Arcadia Fire Department maintains reciprocal automatic aid
agreements for fire protection with the surrounding cities of Monrovia,
Pasadena, South Pasadena, San Marino, San Gabriel, Sierra Madre,
Alhambra, Monterey Park, Glendale, and Burbank and Los Angeles County.
The City also has a mutual aid contract with the United States Forest
Service for fire protection in hillside and brush areas. As an additional
safety measure, the City participates in the State of California Master
Mutual Aid program.
The Police Department maintains a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT)
team comprised of approximately 16 tactical operators. The Arcadia Police
Department is a member of a regional police helicopter program, called
8-34 | Safety                                                 Arcadia General Plan – November 2010

the Foothill Air Support Team (FAST). FAST is a cooperative program
among the cities of Alhambra, Arcadia, Monrovia, Covina, Pasadena,
Glendora, La Verne, San Marino, Sierra Madre, and West Covina that
provides regional helicopter support services to aid in any crime or
emergency situation.
Threats to National Security
After the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001, the harsh reality of
large terrorist attacks affecting the United States domestically became
part of the public consciousness. In response, the City of Arcadia’s
emergency preparedness and response services expanded to address
terrorism issues. At the federal, State, and local levels, a considerable
amount of information has been generated on potential vulnerabilities,
protective measures, and anti-terrorism technologies. The City’s Police and
Fire Departments recognize the need not only to learn from the lessons
from 9/11, but also to collectively address terrorism planning and policy
issues that most affect Arcadia.
The City’s strong relationship with federal and State law enforcement
agencies is helping secure the City. The California Anti-Terrorism
Information Center was formed in the wake of the September 11 attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to provide law enforcement
with statewide intelligence support to combat terrorism. Through the
center, law enforcement agencies in California can obtain information on
terrorist threats and activities anywhere in the State through a secure,
central database. Reliable information from the center that meets the
stringent guidelines for intelligence gathering and civil rights protections
are made available only to authorized local, State, and federal law
enforcement personnel as necessary to protect the health and safety of
Californians and others at risk from criminal terrorist activity.
Goals and Policies
Arcadia’s investments in its fire and police forces have created a
community that experiences very low levels of fire incidents and crime, and
that allow residents to participate in volunteer programs that help keep the
community safe. To address possible threats to national security, the City
will continue to work with federal and State law enforcement agencies.
Through its ACTION program, Arcadia will continue to prepare community
members with appropriate prevention measures to help detect suspicious
activity and to appropriate response and readiness measures to any
terrorist activities to ensure that life-threatening situations are avoided.
Goal S-5:                     To provide a continued high level of fire and
                              police protection services, with an emphasis
                              on prevention and education

Emergency Preparedness
Arcadia sets emergency preparedness as one of its top priorities,
recognizing that proper planning at all levels in the community—from
response agencies to businesses and residents—will minimize the adverse
effects of natural and human-caused disasters. Arcadia provides quality,
effective police and fire services, personnel, and volunteers who are
committed to safety and tirelessly work to plan and prepare for all types of
emergencies and disasters. The City’s Emergency Preparedness Program
allows it to prepare for and respond effectively to emergencies.
Emergency Preparedness and
Response Programs
The Fire Department’s Emergency Services Division
coordinates Arcadia’s emergency operations during a
human-caused or natural disaster. The division manages
the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), a central
command post to manage emergency efforts, in the event
of a disaster. In addition, this division is responsible for
developing and maintaining the citywide Emergency
Operation Plan (EOP), which includes designing and
conducting annual EOC drills, ranging from table-top
exercises to full-scale functional drills, for City employees so
that EOC workers from all City departments can practice
how to respond to emergencies. Past exercises have
included the large-scale evacuation of the mall, response to a major
earthquake, large-scale contamination, and a pandemic flu. Other
participants in these drills have included the Methodist Hospital, the
Arcadia Chapter of the American Red Cross, and the Arcadia Unified
School District.
The City’s ACTION program (Arcadians Caring Together Improves Our
Neighborhoods) is an example of the Fire Department working with other
City departments and the community to provide valuable information
regarding emergency preparedness, fire safety, first aid, earthquake
preparedness, and crime prevention. The ACTION program covers general
emergency preparedness with information on putting together a survival
kit, first aid kit, storing appropriate food and water, and how to care for
people with special needs in the time of an emergency. The ACTION
program also addresses earthquake preparedness, terrorism
preparedness, crime prevention, and fire safety and prevention, and
provides an emergency resource guide.

Emergency Plans
Arcadia has adopted an Emergency Operations Plan that addresses
Arcadia’s response to extraordinary emergency situations associated with
natural disasters, technological incidents, and threats to national security.
It provides operational concepts related to the various emergency
situations, identifies components of the City of Arcadia Emergency
Management Organization, and describes the overall responsibilities of the
organization for protecting life and property and assuring the overall well
being of the population. The plan also identifies the sources of outside
support which might be provided (through mutual aid and specific statutory
authorities) by other jurisdictions, State and federal agencies, and the
private sector.
In 2010, Arcadia adopted a Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan in response to
requirements of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA.
Like this Safety Element, the plan promotes policy aimed at protecting the
City from natural hazards. The policy design revolves around an effort to
increase public awareness and document resources needed to reduce risks.
Siting Critical Facilities
As part of its emergency planning and response program, and to address
hazard mitigation through prevention, the City has identified “critical
facilities” that serve an essential or important function in disaster situations
(government and public safety buildings, hospitals, and major
transportation infrastructure) and/or contain concentrations of population
(schools, large office and residential buildings). These are places from
which emergency operations and response can be conducted. With regard
to schools, they can be used for assembly and shelter; thus, it is critically
important that schools be at locations removed from hazardous conditions,
both to provide this support function and to minimize impact to school
children and staff when a disaster occurs. Table S-3 and Figure S-8 identify
the critical facilities in Arcadia. Table S-3 also indicates that a few facilities
are located within known or suspected fault hazard and/or liquefaction
zones.

Goals and Policies
Coupled with its commitment to prevent disasters large and small is the
City’s resolve to be well prepared to respond to any type of emergency.
This includes a solid Emergency Management Plan and sound planning for
critical facilities such as hospitals, police and fire facilities, communication
and emergency operations centers, and places of community assembly.
Goal S-6:                     Comprehensive and effective emergency and
                              disaster response preparedness
     Policy S-6.1:            Coordinate with Los Angeles County, adjacent
                              municipalities,    the     Federal      Emergency
                              Management Agency, and the California
                              Emergency Management Agency in reducing
                              the risk of loss of life, injury, and property
                              damage in the event of an emergency.
     Policy S-6.2:            Coordinate with other government agencies
                              and organizations to leverage resources related
                              to seismic technology and information, and
                              emergency preparedness.
     Policy S-6.3:            Maintain an up-to-date Emergency Operations
                              Plan and Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan on a
                              five-year basis to secure adequate federal
                              resources in the event of a disaster.
     Policy S-6.4:            Conduct ongoing public outreach and promote
                              community awareness regarding evacuation
                              routes and procedures to be followed in the
                              event of an emergency.
     Policy S-6.5:            Integrate the goals and action items from the
                              City’s emergency response and preparedness
                              plans into regulatory documents and City
                              processes, where appropriate.
     Policy S-6.6:            Monitor the development of technology for the
                              use in the Emergency Operations Center, and
                              acquire and use the latest technology as
                              funding permits to enhance emergency services.
