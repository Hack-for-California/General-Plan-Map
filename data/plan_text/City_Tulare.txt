Introduction
                                                                                               1
Chapter 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction
The housing goal for the State of California is for every Californian to have access to a decent
home and suitable living environment. Recognizing the important role that local governments
play in pursuit of this goal, the Legislature has mandated that all cities and counties prepare a
Housing Element as part of their comprehensive General Plan (California Government Code
Section 65302 (c)).
This Housing Element update covers the planning period from 2015-2023. It addresses housing
opportunities for present and future residents over the next eight years, and provides the
primary policy guidance for local decision making as it relates to housing. The Housing Element
has a shorter (eight-year) planning period than the other General Plan elements and is the only
General Plan element that requires review and certification by the State of California.
The Housing Element provides a detailed analysis of the city’s demographic, economic, and
housing characteristics as required by State Law. The Element also provides a comprehensive
evaluation of the City’s progress in implementing the past policies and programs related to
housing production, preservation, and conservation. Based on the community’s housing needs,
available resources, constraints, and opportunities for housing production and preservation, the
Housing Element identifies goals, policies, and programs that address the housing needs of
present and future residents. The goals, policies, and programs are included in the Housing
Element Policy Document.
Consistency with State Law
This update has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of California Government
Code Article 10.6 (commencing with Section 65580) and contains:
       An assessment of housing needs in the city;
       The identification of constraints upon the maintenance, improvement, and development
        of housing for all income levels;
       An inventory of resources available to the City to meet the housing needs for all income
        groups;
Public Review Draft                                                                           Page 1

Tulare Housing Element
       A statement of the community’s goals, quantified objectives, and policies related to the
        maintenance, improvement, and development of housing; and
       An eight-year schedule of actions the City will undertake to implement the policies and
        achieve the goals and objectives of the Housing Element.
The California Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of
the General Plan. Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the General Plan’s
various elements shall provide an integrated and internally consistent and compatible statement
of policy. The updated Housing Element will be incorporated into the General Plan. The General
Plan’s Land Use Plan and the policies contained in the Land Use Element were used to
determine the location, amount, and type of potential housing. The City will maintain this
consistency as future General Plan amendments are processed by evaluating proposed
amendments for consistency with all elements of the General Plan.
1.2 Data Sources
Various information sources have been used to prepare the Housing Element, with 2000 and
2010 Census Data representing the primary source. Other sources used to update and
supplement the Census data, included:
       Population and demographic data from the State Department of Finance (DOF) and
        American Community Survey (ACS)
       Employment information from the California Employment Development Department
       Housing market information, such as home sales, rents, and vacancies from the U.S.
        Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
       Public and non-profit agencies were consulted for data on special needs groups, the
        services available to them, and gaps in the system.
1.3 Relationship to the General Plan
The 2015-2023 Housing Element is one of the elements of the City General Plan. The Housing
Element builds upon the other General Plan Elements and is consistent with the policies set
forth in those elements.
The City will ensure ongoing consistency between the Housing Element and other General Plan
elements so that policies introduced in one element are consistent with other elements. At this
time, the Housing Element does not propose significant changes to any other element of the
City’s General Plan. However, if it becomes apparent that changes to any element are needed,
such changes will be proposed for consideration by the Planning Commission and City Council.

Introduction
                                                                                            1
1.4 Public Participation
State law requires local governments to make a diligent effort to achieve public participation of
all socioeconomic segments of the community in the development of the Housing Element. The
public participation process for this Housing Element involved four major stages:
        1. A stakeholder meeting and community workshop;
        2. Publication of the Draft Housing Element and a public study session with the
             planning commission to present the document to the public;
        3. Review by the California Department of Housing and Community Development
             (HCD);
        4. Public hearings before the Planning Commission and City Council prior to adoption
             of the final Housing Element.
Stakeholder Meeting and Community Workshop, June 2, 2015
On June 2, 2015, the city of Tulare held a stakeholder meeting and community workshop to
provide an overview of the Housing Element Update process and solicit input from the public on
housing issues prior to preparing the Draft Housing Element. The stakeholder meeting was held
at 3:30 pm. Following a presentation that described key issues related to Tulare’s housing needs,
attendees participated in a roundtable discussion about Tulare’s major housing issues and
possible solutions to the identified issues. At 5:30, the City held a community workshop open to
the public. A full summary of the workshop and list of attendees is provided in Appendix C.

EXISTING CONDITIONS
2.1 Population, Employment, and Housing Characteristics
Community Context
Tulare is a moderately-sized, agriculture-based community located along State Route 99 at the
southern end of the San Joaquin Valley in Tulare County, California. Similar size cities located
near Tulare include Visalia, Porterville, and Hanford. As of 2014 Tulare had 61,857 citizens.
Population Change
The Department of Finance (DOF) provides population estimates for each jurisdiction in
California. Analyzing population change can help assess where there may be a need for new
housing and services. Table 2.1 shows population growth from 2000-2014 for cities in Tulare
and Kings Counties. The city of Tulare grew by over 17,000 from 2000 to 2014, and was the
second most populous city in Tulare County. The city of Tulare experienced an average annual
growth rate of 2.5 percent from 2000 to 2014, which was at the high end of growth rates for
nearby communities, but the same as Dinuba, Porterville, and Visalia.

2.2 Overpayment & Overcrowding
Overcrowding
Generally overcrowding is a measure of the ability of existing housing to adequately
accommodate residents and can result in deterioration of the quality of life within a community.
The U.S. Census defines an “overcrowded” household as 1.01 or more persons per room,
excluding bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyers, halls, and half-rooms. “Severe overcrowding”
occurs in households with more than 1.5 persons per room. Overcrowding typically results when
either: the costs of available housing with a sufficient number of bedrooms for larger families
exceeds the family’s ability to afford such housing, or unrelated individuals (such as students or
low-wage single adult workers) share dwelling units due to high housing costs. This can lead to
overcrowded situations if the housing unit is not large enough to accommodate all of the people
effectively.
Table 2.11 summarizes the overcrowding status in the city of Tulare and countywide. In 2011, 7.7
percent of owner-occupied households and 12.7 percent of renter-occupied households were
overcrowded. By comparison, 7.5 percent of the owners and 17.5 percent of renters were
overcrowded countywide. Severely overcrowded households comprised a small percentage of
owner (1.2 percent) and renter (4.6 percent) households citywide.

 Overpayment
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) establishes that a household is
 “cost-burdened” (i.e., overpaying for housing) if it spends more than 30 percent of gross income
 on housing-related costs. The prevalence of overpayment varies significantly by income, tenure,
 household type, and household size. For example, households generally impacted by cost
 burdens include single mothers, large families, and seniors. Affordable housing options are
 generally limited for these residents and there are few programs to assist with providing
 financial assistance.
 As shown in Table 2.12, the prevalence of overpayment decreases as income increases. For
 example, 63 percent of all lower-income owners were overpaying in 2011, compared to 26
 percent of higher-income owners. Renters generally overpaid for housing more than owners,
 with the exception of higher-income households. Overall, 36 percent of all owners in Tulare
 overpaid, while 52 percent of renters overpaid.

2.4 Housing Stock Characteristics
A household refers to the people occupying a home, such as a family, a single person, or
unrelated persons living together. Families often prefer single family homes or condominiums
to accommodate children, while single persons generally occupy smaller apartments or
condominiums. Single-person households may include seniors living alone or young adults.

Age of Housing Stock
Housing conditions are an important indicator of quality of life in the city of Tulare. Housing
ages and deteriorates over time. If not regularly maintained, structures can deteriorate and
discourage reinvestment, depress neighborhood property values, and even become health
hazards. Maintaining and improving housing quality is an important goal for communities.
Housing age can be an indicator of the need for housing rehabilitation. Generally, housing older
than 30 years (i.e., built before 1980) will require minimal repairs and improvements. Housing
units over 50 years old (i.e., built before 1960) are more likely to require major rehabilitation
such as roofing, plumbing, and electrical system repairs.
Table 2.16 shows the age of the housing stock in the city of Tulare. The majority of Tulare
residential structures, nearly 44 percent, were built between 1970 and 2000. Approximately 45
percent of the housing stock is over 30 years old. Almost one quarter of the housing stock in
Tulare has been built since 2000 (24.2 percent).

Housing Conditions
The most recent housing conditions survey to determine the number of units considered to be
substandard in quality or in need of repair or replacement was conducted in 2003. The survey
was conducted within the City limits by members of the Redevelopment, Building and Planning
Departments. There were 509 homes surveyed in throughout the City.
Structural integrity of area housing stock was surveyed according to State Department of
Housing and Community Development protocol. A point rating system was assigned to various
levels of structural integrity pertaining to such items as the foundation, roofing, siding,
windows, and electrical that can be viewed from the street. Points increased with the degree of
deficit relating to maintenance and upkeep. One of five rating categories are assigned by the
points achieved:

   The total number of housing units was assessed in each Census Tract and a percentage of that
   total was derived and surveyed. The sample size exceeded the minimum number of surveys
   required by HCD. Housing conditions in the City generally rated sound (9 points or less), with a
   few minor exceptions. Table 2.18 shows that approximately 80 percent of the housing units
   surveyed were rated sound; 12 percent needed minor repair; 6 percent needed moderate repair;
   2 percent needed substantial rehabilitation; and 1 percent were rated as dilapidated and in need
   of replacement.

   Housing conditions have not changed substantially since the survey was completed. In addition,
   the City has several ongoing programs to help address the need for rehabilitation and repair of
   lower income units.
   Prior to the dissolution of Tulare’s Redevelopment Agency (RDA), the City, through its RDA,
   offered the Rehabilitation Assistance Program (RAP). RAP provided funds to assist low-income
   homeowners with repairs in order to comply with code requirements and improve the overall
   safety of the home. Currently (2015) home rehabilitation programs are offered through Self-
   Help Enterprises, located in Visalia.
   Occupancy Status
   Table 2.19 depicts the number of units identified as occupied and vacant. As of 2010, about 94
   percent (17,720 units) of the total 18,863 units in the city were identified as occupied. The
   percentage is similar in both the city of Porterville and Tulare County, with 93 percent of units
   and 92 percent of units identified as occupied, respectively.

Rental Trends
An online survey of rentals in the city of Tulare on March 19, 2015, indicated there is a lack of
multifamily units available for rent. Several 2-bedroom apartments were for rent, ranging from
$595 - $975. In addition, there were many 3-bedroom single family homes available for rent
with rental prices ranged from $1,000 - $1,300. It is unlikely that an extremely low-income
family of four would be able to afford rent at the low end of this single family housing range, but
rents would be affordable for a median-income household.

Tulare Housing Element
Ability to Pay
To meet the housing needs of various income groups, housing in the community must be
available at a range of prices. Housing affordability can be inferred by comparing the cost of
renting or owning a home to the average income levels of households. Table 2.22 summarizes
2014 HCD-defined household income limits for very low-, low-, and moderate-income
households in Tulare County by the number of persons in the household. Households earning
the 2014 area median income for a family of four in Tulare County ($57,900) could afford to
spend up to $1,448 per month on rent without overpaying. A three-person household would be
classified as low-income if its annual income was less than $31,250. This household could afford
a $781 maximum monthly rent.
For renters this is a straightforward calculation, but home ownership costs are less transparent.
An affordable price depends on several factors, including the down payment, the level of other
long-term obligations (such as a car loan), and interest rates. In practice the interaction of these
factors as well as insurance, and taxes allows some households to qualify for homes priced at
more than three times their annual income, while other households may be limited to
purchasing homes no more than two times their annual incomes. Interest rates, insurance, and
taxes are held constant in the table below in order to determine maximum affordable rent and
purchase price for households in each income category. It is important to note that this table is
used for illustrative purposes only.
As shown in Error! Reference source not found., for a very low-income four-person
household making $28,950 per year, an estimated maximum purchase price would be about
$116,936.

Tulare Housing Element
Fair Market Rents
Table 2.23 shows HUD-defined fair market rent levels (FMR) for Tulare County for 2015. In
general the FMR for an area is the amount needed to pay the gross rent (shelter rent plus
utilities) of privately-owned, decent, safe, and sanitary rental housing of a modest (non-luxury)
nature with suitable amenities. The rents are drawn from the distribution of rents of all units
that are occupied by recent movers. Adjustments are made to exclude public housing units,
newly built units, and substandard units.
As shown in 2.19 (Ability to Pay) a three-person household classified as low-income with an
annual income of $31,250 (60 percent of AMI) could afford to pay $781 monthly gross rent
(including utilities). The 2014 FMR for a two-bedroom unit in Tulare County is $771. A low-
income three-person household at the middle of the income range could just afford to rent a
two-bedroom unit at the FMR level, assuming such a unit at that price is available.

2.5 Assisted Housing Developments “At Risk” of Conversion
Per State law, the City must identify affordable housing that is at-risk of converting to higher
market rates. Many of the affordable housing projects in Tulare were developed with Federal
and State subsidies. In exchange for the subsidies, the project developers agreed to retain rental
rates that were deemed affordable to lower income households for a specified number of years.
The potential loss of existing affordable housing units is an important issue to the City due to
displacement of lower-income tenants and the limited alternative housing for such persons. It is
typically less expensive to preserve the affordability of existing units than to subsidize
construction of new affordable units due to the rising cost of land and construction.

 Table 2.24 inventories government-assisted rental properties in the city of Tulare that may be at
 risk of opting out of programs that keep them affordable to lower- income households within 10
 years from the Housing Element adoption deadline (i.e., 2016 through 2025).
 In total, there are an estimated 737 assisted housing units in Tulare, none of which are at-risk of
 converting to market rate within the next 10 years.

 Acquisition and Rehabilitation
 One method of ensuring long-term affordability of low-income units is to transfer ownership to
 a qualified nonprofit or for-profit affordable housing organization. This transfer would make the
 project eligible for re-financing using affordable housing financing programs, such as low-
 income housing tax credits and tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. These financing programs
 would ensure affordability for at least 55 years. Generally, rehabilitation accompanies a transfer
 of ownership.

                                                                                             July 2015

                   Actual acquisition costs depend on several variables such as condition, size, location,
                    existing financing, and availability of financing (government and market). For
                    example, According to the former director of Tulare’s Housing Authority it is
                    difficult to do an acquisition/rehab project with tax credits in the city of Tulare. The
                    Housing Authority did do an acquisition/rehab of Oakwood Apartments, located in
                    southwest Tulare. Oakwood apartments, however, did not use tax credits, and it had
                    some support from the city’s Redevelopment Agency, which no longer exists. This
                    acquisition/rehab was a 20 unit project and the rehabilitation portion was $14,500 per
                    unit.
Replacement (New Construction)
Another strategy is to replace the units by constructing new affordable units. This includes
purchasing land and then constructing affordable units. This is generally the most expensive
option. A recently built 48-unit multifamily development in Tulare (The Aspens) cost about
$10.91 million, or $232,086 per unit.
Rent Subsidy
Rent subsidies can also be used to preserve affordability of housing, although there are limited
funding sources to subsidize rents. The amount of a rent subsidy would be equal to the
difference between the HUD defined fair market rent (FMR) for a unit and the cost that would
be affordable to a lower-income household based on HUD income limits. The exact amount is
difficult to estimate because the rents are based on a tenant’s income and, therefore, would
depend on the size and income level of the household. The following analysis presents some
general examples of expected subsidies:
SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Within the general population, there are several groups of people who have special housing
needs. These needs can make it difficult for members of these groups to locate suitable housing.
The following subsections discuss these special housing needs of six groups identified in State
Housing Element Law (Government Code, Section 65583(a)(7), including: the elderly, persons
with disabilities (including developmental disabilities), large households, farmworkers, families
with single-headed households, and families and persons in need of emergency shelter. This
section also describes the needs of extremely low-income households. Where possible, This
section presents estimates of the population or number of households in Tulare County
belonging to each group.

2.6 Persons with Disabilities
Persons with disabilities typically have special housing needs because of their physical and/or
developmental capabilities, fixed or limited incomes, and higher health costs associated with
their disabilities. A disability is defined broadly by the Census Bureau as a physical, mental, or
emotional condition that lasts over a long period of time and makes it difficult to live
independently. The Census Bureau defines five disabilities: hearing, vision, cognitive,
ambulatory, self-care, or independent living disabilities.
Persons with disabilities have different housing needs depending on the nature and severity of
the disability. Physically disabled persons generally require modifications to their housing units,
such as wheelchair ramps, elevators or lifts, wide doorways, accessible cabinetry, and modified
fixtures and appliances. Special design and other considerations for persons with disabilities
include single-level units, availability of services, group living opportunities, and proximity to
transit. While regulations adopted by the State require all ground floor units of new apartment
complexes with five or more units to be accessible to persons with disabilities, single family
units have no accessibility requirements. If a disability prevents a person from operating a
vehicle, then proximity to services and access to public transportation are particularly
important. Those with severe physical or mental disabilities may also require supportive
housing, nursing facilities, or care facilities. In addition, many disabled people rely solely on
Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which is insufficient for market rate housing.
Table 2.25 shows disability by age in the city of Tulare. As shown in the table, 12.3 percent of
Tulare’s population is living with one or more disability. The population 65 years and over has
the highest rate of disabilities (45.6 percent).

Table 2.26 shows persons with disabilities by employment status. Of the 16,042 individuals who
were employed in a full-time capacity, 4.5 percent had one or more disability. A slightly higher
percentage of persons employed part-time had a disability (9.9 percent). Employment status for
disabled persons is significant because if a disability prevents an individual from working or
limits income, then the cost of housing and the costs of modifications are likely to be even more
challenging.

Developmental Disabilities
SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law to require an
evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. A
"developmental disability" is defined as a disability that originates before an individual becomes
18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
disability for that individual. This includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and
autism. Many developmentally disabled persons are able to live and work rather normally.
However, more severely disabled individuals require a group living environment with
supervision, or an institutional environment with medical attention and physical therapy.
Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first housing issue for the
developmentally disabled is the transition from living with a parent/guardian as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult.
Table 2.27 shows the number of people in the city of Tulare who were receiving disability
assistance in December 2014. Approximately 48 percent of individuals receiving assistance are
under 18 years old, and 52 percent are 18 years or older. Over three-quarters (76.2 percent) of
the total number of individuals receiving assistance in December 2014 reside at home with a
family member or guardian.

It is important to note that this is only a count of those developmentally disabled people
receiving services from the Department of Developmental Services as of December 2014. It is
likely that the actual count is higher.
Housing needs for those with disabilities vary depending on the severity of the disability. Many
disabled persons live in their own home, in an independent situation, or with other family
members. While figures provided by the Census provide useful information regarding the
disabled population, not all disabilities identify the need for accessible (based on Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards) or low-income housing. The U.S. Census collects data for
several categories of disability. These categories are defined below:
Long lasting disabilities:
        Sensory disability: Blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment.
        Physical disability: A condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical
         activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.
Disabilities lasting six months or more:
        Mental disability: Difficulty learning, remembering, or concentrating.
        Self-care disability: Difficulty dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home.
        Going outside of home disability: Difficulty going outside the home alone to shop or visit
         a doctor’s office.
        Employment disability: Difficulty working at a job or business.
Physically disabled persons generally require modifications to housing such as: wheelchair
ramps, elevators or lifts, wide doorways, accessible cabinetry, modified fixtures and appliances,
etc. If the disability prevents the person from operating a vehicle, then proximity to services and
access to public transportation are also important. People with severe physical or mental
disabilities may also require supportive housing, nursing facilities, or care facilities. If the
physical disability prevents individuals from working or limits their income, then the ability to
meet the cost of housing and the costs of modifications becomes more difficult. Many disabled
people rely solely on Social Security Income, which does not cover the costs of market-rate
housing.

The State requires that those with disabilities receive opportunities for reasonable
accommodation in housing opportunities. An analysis of housing constraints for residents with
disabilities is included under the constraints discussion.
A growing number of architects and developers are integrating Universal Design principles into
their projects to increase the accessibility of the built environment. The intent of Universal
Design is to simplify design and construction by making products, the ability to communicate,
and the built environment more usable by as many people as possible without the need for
adaptation or specialized design. By applying these principles, in addition to the regulations
specified in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), new construction could increase the
opportunities in housing and employment for everyone. The following are the seven principles
of universal design as outlined by the Center for Universal Design:
       Equitable Use: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
       Flexibility in Use: The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and
        abilities.
       Simple and Intuitive: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s
        experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.
       Perceptible Information: The design communicates necessary information effectively to
        the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.
       Tolerance for Error: The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of
        accidental or unintended action.
       Low Physical Effort: The design can be used efficiently and comfortably with minimum
        fatigue.
       Size and Space for Approach and Use: Appropriate size and space is provided for
        approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or
        mobility.
2.7 Elderly Persons
Seniors or the elderly are defined as persons 65 years and older and senior and elderly
households are those households headed by a person 65 years and older. The elderly have
special housing needs based on factors such as age, health, self-care capacity, economic status,
family arrangement, and homeownership. Particular needs for the elderly include smaller and
more efficient housing, barrier-free and accessible housing, and a wide variety of housing with
health care and/or personal services. Various programs can help meet the needs of seniors and
the elderly, including, but not limited to, congregate care, supportive services, rental subsidies,
shared housing, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For elderly with disabilities, housing with

   features that accommodate disabilities can help ensure continued independent living. Elderly
   with mobility/self-care limitation also benefit from transportation alternatives. Senior and
   elderly housing with these accommodations can allow living that is more independent.
   Table 2.28 shows elderly households by tenure in the city of Tulare and countywide. Senior
   households generally have a high homeownership rate. Citywide, 20.8 percent of owner-
   occupied households were senior householders compared to 24.7 percent countywide. A slightly
   lower percentage of seniors comprised renter occupied units citywide (13.3 percent).

   The special needs of seniors can be met by integrating congregate care, rent subsidies, shared
   housing, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the frail or disabled elderly, housing with
   architectural design features that accommodate disabilities can help extend the ability to live
   independently. In addition, seniors with mobility or self care limitations benefit from
   transportation options. Senior housing with supportive services should be provided to facilitate
   independent living.
   As shown in Table 2.29, 45.6 percent of seniors citywide have a disability, which is slightly
   higher than the countywide rate of 42.6 percent. Physical limitations (e.g., hearing, vision,
   ambulatory) were the most common amongst this age group.

2.8 Large Households
HUD defines a large household as one with five or more members. Large households may have
specific needs that differ from other households due to income and housing stock constraints.
The most critical housing need of a large household is access to larger housing units with more
bedrooms than a standard three-bedroom dwelling. As a result, large households may be
overcrowded in smaller units. In general, housing for large households should provide safe
outdoor or play areas for children and should be located to provide convenient access to schools
and childcare facilities.
Table 2.30 shows households by size and tenure. Large households made up 21.9 percent of the
17,759 housing units in the city of Tulare in 2011, compared to 25.2 percent countywide. Owners
comprised 54.3 percent of large households citywide (2,113).

2.9 Female-Headed Households
Table 2.32 compares the number of female-headed households and poverty rates in the city of
Tulare in 2011. A majority of single female householders had children (70.7 percent) and of the
2,380 households below the poverty level, 48.5 percent (1,156) were female headed households.
Single-parent households with children often require special consideration and assistance
because of their greater need for affordable housing, accessible day care, health care, and a
variety of other supportive services. Moreover, because of their relatively lower household
incomes, single-parent households are more likely to experience difficulties in finding
affordable, decent, and safe housing.

2.10 Extremely Low Income Housing Needs
Extremely low-income households are defined as those households with incomes under 30
percent of the county’s median income. Extremely low-income households typically consist of
minimum wage workers, seniors on fixed incomes, the disabled, and farmworkers. This group of
households has specific housing needs that require greater government subsidies and assistance,
housing with supportive services, single room occupancy (SRO) and/or shared housing, and/or
rental subsidies or vouchers. This income group is likely to live in overcrowded and substandard
housing conditions. High rents, higher income and credit standards imposed by landlords, and
insufficient government assistance can exacerbate the problem. Without adequate assistance,
extremely low income individuals and families have a higher risk for becoming homeless.
For a family of four in Tulare, a household making under $17,350 in 2014 would be considered
an extremely low-income household. It is important to note that this is based off of HCD’s area
median income estimate of $57,900.

2.11 Farmworkers
Estimating farmworkers and those households associated with farm work within the state is
extremely difficult. Generally known as the ‘invisible’ population, the farmworker population
contains two segments: permanent and migratory (seasonal) farmworkers. The permanent
population consists of farmworkers who have settled in the region and maintain local residence
and who are employed most of the year. The migratory farmworker population consists of those
farmworkers who typically migrate to the region during seasonal periods in search of farm labor
employment. Because farm workers are of very low income and their employment status is
tenuous, they are often unable to compete for housing on the open market.
Housing affordability has historically been an issue for farmworkers and continues to be so
today. Some issues contributing to this challenge include low incomes, large family sizes, and
language barriers. Table 2.34 shows that of the 25,247 total farmworkers in Tulare County in
2012, 11,745 (46.5 percent) were permanent workers. In 2012, 10 percent of the city of Tulare’s
employed population 16 years and over worked in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting
or mining industry. It is difficult to know how accurate these numbers are as under-reporting is
common especially for those in the U.S. without documentation.
There is one existing farmworker housing project in Tulare, the Sonora Apartments, which
provides 52 units of affordable housing for farmworkers. It was built in 1985 and is managed by
the Tulare County Housing Authority.

2.12 People in Need of Emergency Shelter
Due to their transient nature, it is difficult to count the homeless in any one area. It should also
be noted that there are generally two types of homeless–the "permanent homeless" who are the
transient and most visible homeless population and the "temporary homeless" who are
homeless usually due to eviction and may stay with friends, family, or in a shelter or motel until
they can be assisted with finding a more permanent residence. Individuals in need of emergency
shelters are classified as homeless.
According to the 2015 Point-in-time (PIT) Count Report released by the Kings/Tulare Homeless
Alliance (formerly the Continuum of Care on Homelessness), there were 83 homeless adult
individuals counted in 2014 and 135 counted in 2015, an increase of about 63 percent. This 63
percent increase is the largest increase of homelessness in all PIT count participating cities. In
2014 the Alliance estimated there were 590 homeless people living in Tulare County. This figure
grew to 636 in 2015. Also according to the 2015 PIT Count Report, the city of Tulare’s homeless
population (135) makes up about 16 percent of the region’s homeless, while the county’s
homeless population (636) makes up about 74 percent of the region’s homeless.
Emergency housing offers short-term shelter and a safe, decent alternative to the streets or a
car. Other provisions of emergency shelters may include showers, meals, and telephone
privileges for local calls or limited calls to out-of-area family. Stays in emergency housing are
usually subject to limits.
In the city of Tulare, the Lighthouse Rescue Mission offers 30 - 60 days of emergency housing
for women and children with 16 beds. The City also refers homeless men in need of shelter to the
Visalia Rescue Mission. Additionally the Tulare Rescue Mission/Homeland Mission operates a
7-bed shelter for men and women.

PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS
3.1 Income Limits and Regional Housing Needs
State Housing Element law (Government Code § 65580 et. seq.) requires regional councils of
government (COG) to identify for each city and county its “fair share allocation” of the Regional
Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) provided by the California Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD). The Tulare County Association of Governments, the COG for
the city area, adopted the final Regional Housing Needs Plan (RHNP) in May 2014. TCAG took
into account several factors in preparing the RHNP, including projected household formation,
job growth, and regional income distribution. In turn, each city and county must address their
local share of regional housing needs in their housing elements.
For the January 1, 2014, to the September 30, 2023, planning period, the City has a total
allocation of 3,594 units. See Table 3.1 for the 2014-2023 Regional Housing Needs Allocation for
the city of Tulare.
The projected housing needs in the RHNA are broken down by income category based on the
limits for very-low, low, moderate, and above moderate income households established by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (California Health and Safety
Code Section 50079.5).
Definitions of household income:
       Extremely Low Income: Incomes less than or equal to 30 percent of the area median
        household income (MFI).
       Very Low-Income: Incomes between 31 percent and 50 percent of the area median
        household income (MFI).
       Low-Income: Incomes between 51 percent and 80 percent of the area median household
        income.
       Moderate-Income: Incomes between 81 percent and 119 percent of the area median
        household income.
       Above Moderate-Income. Incomes over 120 percent of the area median household
        income.

Adjusting the allocation by income category allows for a balanced distribution of lower-income
households between jurisdictions. Based on the requirements of AB 2634 (Statutes of 2006),
each jurisdiction must also address the projected needs of extremely low-income households,
defined as households earning less than 30 percent of the median income. The projected
extremely low-income need can be assumed as 50 percent of total need for the very low-income
households.

State law requires the city of Tulare to demonstrate that it has or will make available adequate
sites with appropriate zoning and development standards to accommodate the RHNA. The
following section discusses the assumptions for this analysis how Tulare will meet this
requirement through units built or under construction, planned or approved projects, and
vacant and underutilized sites.
3.2 Affordability and Density
To identify sites that can accommodate a local government’s share of the RHNA for lower-
income households, housing elements must include an analysis that demonstrates the
appropriate density to encourage and facilitate the development of housing for lower-income
households. The statute (Government Code Section 65583.2(c)(3)) provides two options for
demonstrating appropriate densities:
       Provide a detailed market-based analysis demonstrating how the adopted densities
        accommodate this need. The analysis shall include, but is not limited to, factors such as
        market demand, financial feasibility, or information based on development project
        experience within a zone or zones that provide housing for lower-income households.
       Use the “default density standards” that are “deemed appropriate” in State law to
        accommodate housing for lower-income households given the type of the jurisdiction.
        Tulare is considered a “suburban jurisdiction” with a default density standard of 20 units
Page 40                                                                            Public Review Draft
                                                                                            July 2015

Projected Housing Needs
        per acre. HCD is required to accept sites that allow for zoning at this density as
                                                                                               3
        appropriate for accommodating a jurisdiction’s share of the regional housing need for
        lower-income households.
Tulare has opted to rely on the default density standard of 20 units per acre to demonstrate it
has adequate sites to accommodate the lower-income share of the RHNA. All sites were
inventoried based on allowed densities. For these sites/projects, if the maximum allowed
density was equal to or exceeded the default density standard of 20 units per acre, the site was
inventoried as feasible for lower-income. This includes sites zoned R-M-3 and R-M-4.
While the maximum allowed residential density was used to determine the inventoried income
categories, realistic unit densities were used as the inventoried density. The inventoried density,
which is used to calculate how many units each site can count towards the RHNA, reflects the
typically built densities in each land use designation. Maximum allowable densities may not
always be achievable in many jurisdictions due to various factors including environmental
constraints and lack of infrastructure. The inventoried densities reflect these constraints.
Assumptions for inventoried densities are described under vacant and underutilized sites below.
3.3 AB 1233 RHNA “Carry Over” Analysis
Assembly Bill (AB) 1233, passed in 2005, amended State Housing Element law (Government
Code Section 65584.09) to promote the effective and timely implementation of local housing
elements. This bill applies to jurisdictions that included programs in their previous housing
elements to rezone sites as a means of meeting their previous RHNA, as well as jurisdictions
who failed to adopt a State-certified housing element in the previous housing element cycle. Key
provisions of Government Code Section 65584.09 state that where a local government failed to
identify or make adequate sites available in the prior planning period, the jurisdiction must zone
or rezone adequate sites to address the unaccommodated housing need within the first year of
the new planning period. In addition to demonstrating adequate sites for the new planning
period, the updated housing element must identify the unaccommodated housing need from the
previous planning period.
The City of Tulare’s Fourth Cycle (2006-2013) Housing Element contained a rezone program to
meet its RHNA. As such, the potential AB 1233 penalty equals the portion of the RHNA not
accommodated either through actual housing production or land made available for residential
development. To determine any possible penalties, this analysis follows the following approach
outlined by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD):
       Step 1: Subtracting the number of housing units constructed, under construction,
        permitted, or approved since 2006 to date by income/affordability level;
Public Review Draft                                                                          Page 41

Tulare Housing Element
       Step 2: Subtracting the number of units that could be accommodated on any
        appropriately zoned sites (not requiring rezoning) identified in the Housing Element;
        and
       Step 3: Subtracting the number of units that could be accommodated by rezonings that
        did occur; including:
                   Rezonings identified in the Housing Element; and
                   Rezonings that occurred independent of the Housing Element.
Progress Toward the RHNA
The City’s unaccommodated need can be reduced by the number of building permits issued
since January 1, 2006, the start of the Fourth Cycle RHNA projection period. As shown in Table
3.2, Tulare has issued permits for 1,433 units since 2006. Deed-restricted units were inventoried
as lower-income, multifamily units were inventoried as moderate-income based on expected
units sizes and rents, and all other units were inventoried as above moderate-income.

Fourth Cycle Housing Element Built and Approved Projects

Tulare’s Fourth Cycle Housing Element inventoried units built or approved between the
beginning of the fourth cycle RHNA period and the time that the fourth cycle Housing Element
was prepared. The Housing Element identified that these projects could accommodate a total of
1,305 units, including 374 lower-income units, 238 moderate-income units, and 695 above-
moderate-income units.
Rezoned Sites
To accommodate the remaining need from the Fourth Cycle RHNA, the City’s Fourth Cycle
Housing Element contained a rezone program. Action Plan 1-A-3 of the Fourth Cycle Housing
Element provided sites that the City could rezone to meet its unaccommodated need of 1,214
units in the lower-income RHNA categories. In total, the City rezoned or annexed and rezoned
six parcels and created residential capacity for 500 total units.
Table 3.3 shows all sites that were rezoned or annexed in the Fourth Cycle RHNA period. The
table employs the same assumptions as it does for vacant and underutilized land (Table 3.7).
These sites have a capacity for 500 units, including 409 lower-income units, and 114 moderate-
income units.

Table 3.4 summarizes the AB 1233 carry-over analysis for the City of Tulare. Based on units
constructed, capacity from units built or approved as identified in the Fourth Cycle Housing
Element, capacity on vacant land identified in the Fourth Cycle Housing Element, and sites that
the City rezoned, Tulare exceeds its Fourth Cycle RHNA in the moderate- and above moderate-
income categories. However, the City has an unaccommodated need of 969 lower-income units.
This unaccommodated need will be added to Tulare’s Fifth Cycle RHNA.

3.4 Fifth Cycle Housing Element RHNA Analysis
For the Fifth Cycle Housing Element update, Tulare has been assigned a RHNA of 3,594 units,
including 920 very low income units, 609 low income units, 613 moderate income units, and
1,452 above moderate income units. In addition, the City has a carryover of 969 lower-income
units from the Fourth Cycle RHNA. After adding together the City’s fifth cycle lower-income
RHNA and its fourth cycle carry-over, Tulare has a total lower-income RHNA of 2,498 units.
Units Built or Under Construction
Since the RHNA projection period for the Fifth Cycle Housing Element runs from January 1,
2013, to December 31, 2023, the City of Tulare’s RHNA can be reduced by the number of units
built or under construction since January 1, 2014. Table 3.5 shows units built or under
construction since January 1, 2014 in Tulare. The Valley Oak Apartments project has 36 units
remaining, all of which were inventoried as moderate-income based on expected rents.

Planned or Approved Projects
Tulare’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) can also be reduced by the number of new
units in projects that are planned or approved, but not yet built. Table 3.6 and Figure 3-1 show
an inventory of all residential projects that are (as of June 2015) approved or in the planning
process and scheduled to be built by the end of the current Housing Element planning period
(December 31, 2023). For each project the table shows the name of the development, number of
units by income category, a description of the units, and the current status of the project.
Planned or approved projects total 2,985 units including 274 moderate-income units and 2,711
above moderate-income units.

Tulare Housing Element
Vacant Land and Underutilized Sites
The final source for future housing is on vacant land and underutilized sites. The Tulare
Housing Element sites inventory uses the following assumptions to inventory residential
development potential on vacant land or underutilized sites:
       Relation of density to income categories. The following assumptions were used to
        determine the income categories according to the allowed densities for each site:
                   Lower-income (LI) Sites. Sites at least 0.5 acres in size that allow at least
                    20 units per acre were inventoried as feasible for lower-income (low- and very
                    low-income) residential development. This includes sites zoned RM-4 and
                    RM-3, which allow for up to 29 and 21.78 units per acre, respectively.
                   Moderate-Income (MI) Sites. Sites that are zoned RM-1 and RM-2 allow
                    for up to 11.62 and 14.52 units per acre, respectively. These areas were
                    inventoried as feasible for moderate-income residential development. Typical
                    dwelling units include small and medium-sized apartments and other
                    attached units. Sites that are less than 0.5 acres in size and zoned for R-4 or
                    RM-3 were deemed too small to be inventoried as lower-income and were
                    instead inventoried as moderate-income.
                   Above Moderate-Income (AMI) Sites. Sites within zones that allow only
                    single family homes at lower densities were inventoried as above moderate-
                    income units.
       Development Potential. The inventory assumes build out of 80 percent of the
        maximum permitted density for all residentially zoned sites.
       Assumptions for Underutilized Sites. The inventory includes seven underutilized
        sites. These sites have been identified because the existing uses (agriculture) are not
        maximizing development potential that was identified in the Tulare General Plan. These
        sites exhibit redevelopment potential. For each site, the City has evaluated overall site
        potential, potential for lot consolidation, and the status of existing uses.
Table 3.7 identifies vacant and underutilized sites. Figure 3.1 identifies the location of these
sites. Based on permitted densities and the assumptions described above, the sites identified in
Table 3.7 can accommodate an estimated 3,130 units, including 544 lower-income units, 676
moderate-income units, and 1,910 above moderate-income units. All of these sites are outside of
FEMA 100-year flood zones and do not have other environmental constraints that could hinder
future development.

Rezone Program
While the sites identified in Table 3.8 provide enough capacity in the moderate- and above
moderate-income categories, the City has a remaining need of 1,954 lower-income units. In
order to meet this need, Tulare has identified 25 potential rezone sites, summarized in Table 3.9
and shown in Figure 3.1. These sites, if rezoned to R-4, have a capacity for 4,208 units. Given the
City’s remaining need, the City will only need to rezone some of the candidate sites in order to
meet its RHNA.
When the new zoning is adopted, the final rezone sites will allow the City to meet its RHNA in all
categories. The rezone program is supported through Program A-4. Per State law, the City must
rezone to accommodate the unaccommodated need from the Fourth Cycle RHNA within one
year of the Housing Element adoption due date, and must accommodate the Fifth Cycle RHNA
within three years of the actual Housing Element adoption date. In accordance with State law,
the City will rezone enough land to cover the unaccommodated need from the Fourth Cycle of
969 lower-income units within one year of adoption of the Housing Element. The City will
rezone enough land to cover the remaining Fifth Cycle unaccommodated need of 985 lower-
income units within three years of the Housing Element adoption due date (i.e., December 31,

Projected Housing Needs
                                                                                               3
3.5 Infrastructure Capacity
The proximity, availability, and capacity of infrastructure help to determine the suitability of
residential land. Below is an evaluation of water and sewer capacity available to accommodate
the housing needs during the planning period.
Wastewater Treatment
The City’s domestic wastewater treatment plant, located in the southwest part of the City, has a
design capacity of 6.09 million gallons per day (mgd). In 1998, the plant was operating close to
its hydraulic capacity. In response to this condition, the City constructed a new anaerobic
treatment plant to treat milk waste discharges and a portion of the City’s domestic waste. By
constructing the new facility, the City reduced flows to the older treatment plant by 1.0 to 1.25
mgd. Design is underway to increase the domestic wastewater treatment capacity to 8.0 mgd.
The City also operates an industrial wastewater treatment plant with a design capacity of 12.0
mgd.
Water System
The City’s water is sourced from an aquifer. The City of Tulare owns and operates its own water
infrastructure system. The City provides careful oversight to the system as new development
occurs. The current (2015) capacity of all operational wells connected to the existing water
infrastructure is 30.4 mgd. The 2014 peak single day demand was 22.7 mgd. The daily average
for the year was 16.4 mgd.
3.6 Redevelopment Agency Resources
The city of Tulare’s Redevelopment Agency provided staff support for administering
rehabilitation and first-time homebuyer funds for low-income homeowners and housing
programs. However, Tulare’s Redevelopment Agency was dissolved on February 1, 2012. State
law required that Redevelopment Agency deposit 20 percent of the gross tax incremental
revenues from redevelopment project areas into the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund
(LMIHF) to be used exclusively for housing for persons with low and moderate income. With the
elimination of the Redevelopment Agency, there will be no future funding for the LMIHF from
property tax increment. The city of Tulare acts as the Housing Successor Agency of the former
Redevelopment Agency.

CONSTRAINTS
4.1 Local Governmental Constraints
Local policies and regulations can affect the quantity, type, and affordability of residential
development. Since governmental actions can constrain the development and the affordability
of housing, State law requires the housing element to “address and, where appropriate and
legally possible, remove governmental constraints to the maintenance, improvement, and
development of housing” (Government Code § 65583(c)(3)).
The City’s primary policies and regulations that affect residential development and housing
affordability include: the Zoning Ordinance, the Land Use Element of the General Plan,
development processing procedures and fees, on and off-site improvement requirements, and
the California Building and Housing Codes. In addition to a review of these policies and
regulations, this Chapter analyses governmental constraints on housing production for persons
with disabilities.
The City’s land use controls generally do not constrain the development of multifamily rental
housing, manufactured housing or mobile homes, housing for agricultural employees,
transitional and supportive housing, single-family occupancy units, and emergency shelters.
As defined by the City, multifamily dwellings are structures containing more than one dwelling
unit, designed for occupancy or occupied by more than one family. Multifamily housing can
provide a suitable environment for family life and provides housing opportunities for a diverse
demographic, including older adults.
Existing resource protection policies, including the City’s Street Tree Ordinance (Chapter 8.32)
and Preservation of Heritage Trees Ordinance (Chapter 8.52), are designed to encourage
resource sensitive mitigation and facilitate the preservation and maintenance of protected trees
(heritage and oak), without limiting development potential. Mitigation requirements may
become cumbersome for high-density projects, as tree replacement may be required on site that
is at the sole expense of the applicant. The tree replacement ratio is 2 replacement, from 15-
gallon containers or larger for each tree removed. The following sections provide information on
local land use regulations.

Constraints
Zoning Ordinance
                                                                                                   4
This section addresses the zoning districts, which allow residential development, and the
development standards for each district, followed by specific development regulations for multi-
family housing, mixed-use development, secondary dwelling units, and transitional
housing/emergency shelters.
Zoning Districts
Based on the City’s Zoning Ordinance, residential development is allowed in four residential
zoning districts, one agriculture district, four commercial districts, and the urban reserve
district. The maximum residential density allowed is 29 units per acre.
The Zoning Ordinance includes three overlay districts that can be combined with other districts
to allow for greater flexibility in land use and density. The overlay districts include the Planned
Residential Combining (PR) district; Downtown Combining (D) district; and Mixed Use
Combining (MU) district. Residential uses may be accommodated in each of these districts as
well.
Tulare’s zoning districts that allow residential development include:
       Agricultural (A) District: The A district is applied to areas to preserve lands for
        agricultural uses and to protect undeveloped lands around the City for future urban
        development. The A district allows for such uses as the raising of crops and livestock,
        agricultural processing, very low-density residential uses, and home occupations. This
        district also allows housing for up to 36 beds in group quarters or 12 single-family units
        for employees that live on the property. The A zoning district is consistent with and
        implements the Agricultural land use designation of the General Plan.
       Rural Residential (R-A) District: The R-A district is applied to areas appropriate for
        very low density concentrations of single-family dwellings, together with limited
        agricultural uses such as the raising of fruit and nut trees, horticultural specialties, and
        livestock, where proposed development and agricultural uses maintain a suitable
        environment for family life on large parcels of land. Second residential units are
        permitted by right in this district. Residential density is limited to one primary dwelling
        unit on each site. The R-A district is consistent with and implements the Rural
        Residential land use designation of the General Plan.
       Single-Family Residential (R-1) District: The R-1 district is applied to areas
        appropriate for neighborhoods of low-density concentrations of single-family dwellings,
        and related community facilities. Condominiums and guest houses are allowed in this
        district upon approval of a Conditional Use Permit. Second residential units are
        permitted by right in this district. For greater density variety, the R-1 district is further

        subdivided into sub-districts: R-1-5; R-1-6; R-1-7; R-1-8; R-1-12.5; and R-1-20. The
        maximum allowable density ranges from one dwelling per half-acre to eight dwellings
        per acre, with the specific allowable density for each parcel shown on the zoning map by
        a numerical suffix to the R-1 map symbol (see Section 10.32.060). The R-1 district is
        consistent with and implements the Suburban Residential land use designations of the
        General Plan.
       Small Lot Residential (R-1-4) District: The R-1-4 district is applied to areas
        appropriate for compact residential development on lot sizes ranging from 3,200 square
        feet to 4,000 square feet. One of the objectives of the R-1-4 district is to provide for an
        additional housing type and address issues of affordability. The maximum allowable
        density is limited to one dwelling on each parcel, density ranges from 10 to 13 dwellings
        per acre. The R-1-4 district helps to implement the Suburban Residential land use
        designation of the General Plan.
       Multiple-Family Residential (R-M) District: The R-M district is applied to areas
        appropriate for multi-family housing and related uses, including home-based
        occupations. Single-family dwellings, townhouses (R-M-3 and R-M-4), and
        condominiums (R-M-2, R-M-3 and R-M-4) are allowed with a Conditional Use Permit.
        For greater density variety, the R-M district is further subdivided into sub-districts: R-
        M-1; R-M-2; R-M-3; and R-M-4. The maximum allowable density ranges from 11 to 29
        dwellings per acre, with the specific allowable density for each parcel shown on the
        zoning map by a numerical suffix to the R-M map symbol (see Section 10.36.060). The
        R-M district is consistent with and implements the Urban Residential land use
        designations of the General Plan. Emergency shelters and transitional housing for fewer
        than 13 residents are permitted.
       Neighborhood Commercial (C-1) District: The C-1 district is applied to areas
        appropriate for commercial uses that cater to the daily needs of residents. Residential
        uses may also be accommodated by Conditional Use Permits in this district. The C-1
        district is consistent with and implements the Neighborhood Commercial land use
        designation of the General Plan.
       Office Commercial (C-2) District: The C-2 district is applied to areas appropriate
        for small to large-scale office facilities and related support services. Residential uses may
        also be accommodated by Conditional Use Permit in this district. The C-2 district is
        consistent with the Office/Business Park land use designation of the General Plan.
       Retail Commercial (C-3) District: The C-3 district is applied to a wide variety of
        commercial and office uses that serve the general commercial needs of the community.
        Residential uses may also be accommodated by Conditional Use Permit in this district.
        The C-3 district is consistent with and implements the Community Commercial land use
        designation of the General Plan.

                                                                                               July 2015

Constraints
       Service Commercial (C-4) District: The C-4 district is applied to areas appropriate
                                                                                                  4
        for wholesale and heavy commercial uses and service establishments. Residential uses,
        including multi-family housing, may also be accommodated by Conditional Use Permit
        in this district. The C-4 district is consistent with the General Commercial land use
        designation of the General Plan.
       Urban Reserve (UR) District: The UR district is applied to undeveloped lands on the
        City’s edge, including agricultural land and open space land. Single-family dwellings are
        permitted by right in this district. The UR district is consistent with and implements the
        Residential Reserve land use designation of the General Plan.
The overlay zoning districts are:
       Planned Residential Combining (PD) district: The PD district may be applied to
        areas appropriate for residential development that are designed differently than
        traditional residential development. Permitted uses in the PD district include all uses
        that are permitted in the base single-family residential zone district. The PD district
        allows for greater flexibility in lot width, lot depth, street width, housing type, and
        density within the same zoning district. Multi-family residential development may also
        be accommodated by Conditional Use Permit with this overlay.
       Downtown Combining (D) district: The D district provides a comprehensive set of
        development standards to be applied within the City’s downtown area. Residential uses
        are also allowed in this district consistent with those allowed in the C-3 district and
        subject to a Conditional Use Permit.
       Mixed Use Combining (MU) district: The MU district may be applied to areas
        appropriate for the development of a variety of compatible commercial and residential
        uses within the same building or site. The MU district encourages medium to high-
        density residential development on sites close to the downtown area. Single-family
        attached housing, townhouses, apartments, and condominiums are permitted by right in
        this overlay district. Densities vary based on how the residential component is sited (see
        also discussion below on Mixed Use).
Table 4.1 displays the types of permits required for residential uses in the City. The table does
not include supportive housing, but the City will adopt an ordinance that states that transitional
and supportive housing must be permitted in all zones allowing residential uses and are not
subject to any restrictions not imposed on similar dwellings in the same zone in which the
transitional housing and supportive housing is located. The City will adopt the ordinance before
the adoption of this Housing Element.

Development Standards
Tables 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 provide development standards for the residential zoning districts. The
development standards generally do not impede the City’s ability to achieve maximum allowable
densities.
Multi-Family Housing
Standards for multi-family projects are specified within the multiple-family residential district,
Section 10.36.060 of the Zoning Ordinance, which includes:
       Building facades: In multi-family projects building facades shall be designed utilizing
        varying setbacks, projections, balconies, and by varying the pattern and location of
        windows and doors on the building face.
       Multiple-family infill: Multiple-family infill in existing neighborhoods is required to
        be compatible in appearance with existing residences, especially single-family dwellings.
       Landscaping: All outdoor areas not used for parking, walkways or other features shall
        be landscaped, but not less than 10 percent of the total site area of each parcel shall be
        landscaped.
       Parking facilities: Parking lots, driveways and entries should be designed to blend in
        with the overall project.
                  Long, unbroken rows of parking spaces are discouraged. Where possible,
                   individual attached garages (with garage doors) for each unit are preferred.
                   Otherwise, dispersed parking lots and heavy landscaping can serve to break
                   up large parking areas.
                  Parking rows shall be broken up with a landscape island every eight spaces.
                  Special treatment should be given to project entryways, including the use of
                   landscaping, walls, fountains, signs and other architectural features.
                   Entryway paving should be given special treatment, such as stamped paving,
                   colored paving, or cobblestones.
                  Parking areas shall be screened from view from adjoining properties and
                   street right-of-ways by a solid fence, wall, landscaping, or architectural
                   feature.
For the multi-family housing types in mixed-use projects, such as apartments and duplexes,
which are conditionally permitted in the overlay zones, separate standards exist. The following
section addresses these unique architectural and design standards.

Mixed-Use Development
                                                                                               4
Multi-family housing in a mixed-use development is permitted by right in the MU district. The
standards within the MU district encourage urban development with pedestrian character. The
following standards apply to mixed-use projects (Chapter 10.109 of the Zoning Ordinance).
These standards are designed to address compatibility issues between residential and
commercial uses and are not intended to discourage the construction of affordable housing.
       Residential Density:
                   When housing is part of a mixed-use development, dwellings are permitted
                    on and above the second floor of commercial uses with no minimum density.
                   Freestanding residential building densities range from 12 to 90 units per
                    residential acre.
                   Maximum residential density is ninety dwelling units per net residential acre,
                    either in freestanding residential buildings or in mixed-use buildings on and
                    above the second floor.
       Architectural Design Requirements: Good design results in buildings visually
        compatible with one another and adjacent neighborhoods contributing to mixed use
        areas, which are attractive, stimulating, active and safe. The following design
        requirements shall apply:
                   Mixed use and residential buildings constructed within a Mixed Use District
                    shall demonstrate that they promote and enhance a pedestrian scale and
                    orientation on any facade facing a public or private street and they
                    incorporate discernible and architecturally appropriate features; such as,
                    cornices, bays, arcades, unique entry areas or other treatments for visual
                    interest, to create community character and to promote a sense of pedestrian
                    scale; and
                   All residential dwellings, of any type, constructed within any MU district shall
                    be constructed with exterior building materials and finishes of high quality to
                    convey an impression of durability.
       Parking: Mixed Use buildings or sites are required to provide on-site parking equal to
        75 percent of the aggregate total of all required commercial, office and residential
        parking. This 25 percent credit acknowledges sharing parking concepts between
        commercial, office and residential uses.
       Residential Parking Requirement: One space per residential unit.

        Maintenance: A property owner association, a landscape and lighting district or other
         similar mechanism for the maintenance of common open space, private streets or other
         improvements shall be set up as a condition of approval.
        Commercial Operations and Noise: Commercial buildings shall be organized to
         group the utilitarian functions away from the public view.
                      Delivery and loading operations and other utility and service functions shall
                       be incorporated into the overall design of the building(s) and landscaping.
                      Visual and acoustic impacts of operations, along with all wall-or ground-
                       mounted mechanical, electrical and communications equipment, shall be out
                       of view from adjacent properties and public streets

 Secondary Dwelling Units
 To encourage establishment of secondary dwelling units on existing developed lots, State law
 requires cities and counties to either adopt an ordinance based on standards set out in the law
 authorizing creation of second units in residentially-zoned areas, or where no ordinance has
 been adopted, to allow second units if they meet standards set out in the State law. State law
 requires ministerial consideration of second-unit applications in zones where single-family
 dwellings are permitted. Local governments are precluded from totally prohibiting second units
 in residentially zoned areas unless they make specific findings (Government Code § 65852.2).
 Second units can be an important source of affordable housing since they are smaller than

supplemental income to the homeowner, thus allowing the elderly to remain in their homes or
moderate-income families to afford houses.
In the City’s Zoning Ordinance secondary dwelling units are referred to as “second residential
unit” or “granny flats.” A second residential unit is either detached or attached dwelling unit that
provides complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons, including permanent
provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as the primary
residence.
Table 4.5 sets out the primary standards for second residential units in the city. Second units are
permitted by right in all single family residential zones.

Manufactured Housing and Mobile Homes
State law requires that mobile and manufactured homes be allowed on parcels zoned for
conventional single-family units. These units cannot be regulated by any planning fees or review
processes not applicable to conventional single-family dwellings. However, the architectural
design of manufactured or mobile homes can be regulated by the City.
Under the current City zoning regulations manufactured homes are not permitted in all
residential zones. Mobile Homes are not allowed within the city limits unless they are in a
mobile home park, and mobile home parks require a Conditional Use Permit. The City is not

consistent with state law requirements for mobile and manufactured homes. The City is
currently (2015) revising its zoning code to be in compliance with State law. These amendments
will occur prior to the adoption of this Housing Element.
Transitional Housing and Emergency Shelters
State legislation SB 2 requires jurisdictions to permit emergency shelters without a Conditional
Use Permit (CUP) or other discretionary permits, and transitional housing and supportive
housing must be considered residential uses and must only be subject to the same restrictions
that apply to the same housing types in the same zone.
In the City Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 10.147), transitional housing and emergency shelters are
considered group care home. Both are permitted uses in all residential districts and are held to
the same development standards as single family units, provided that six or fewer persons
occupy the structure. These facilities are also allowed in commercial zones subject to a
Conditional Use Permit. Transitional housing or shelters that offer services to seven or more
persons are considered to be of a lodging or boarding nature, therefore are permitted uses in
commercial and residential districts retail and service commercial districts with a Conditional
Use Permit.
Development standards for transitional housing and emergency shelter housing for seven or
more persons are equivalent to those of multi-family or commercial uses. Transitional housing
and emergency shelters are required to follow a site design that promotes efficient utilization of
the lot, on-site circulation, on-site parking and landscaping.
This chapter of the zoning ordinance does not comply with State law for transitional and
supportive housing. State law (Government Code Section 65583) requires cities and counties to
consider transitional and supportive housing as residential uses and only subject to those
restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the same zone. The City will
revise the Zoning Ordinance to bring it into compliance before the adoption of this housing
element.
Housing for Agricultural Employees
The City provides a number of opportunities for the provision of housing for agricultural
employees. The Agricultural Zoning District permits employee housing for employees that live
on the property for up to 36 beds in a group quarters or 12 units or spaces designed for use by a
single family or household. Employee housing for less than six persons is also permitted in
single family zones consistent with the Employee Housing Act. Because the percent of the
existing farmworker housing population is small, many of the housing needs of this group are
addressed through affordable housing strategies.

By definition local land use controls constrain housing development by restricting housing to
certain sections of the city and by restricting the number of housing units that can be built on a
given parcel of land. The 2013 General Plan sets forth the City’s policies regarding local land
development. These policies, together with the zoning regulations above, establish the amount
and distribution of land allocated for different uses. The General Plan has seven land use
designations that allow for residential use. They are shown in Table 4.6.

4.2 Development Processing Procedures and Fees
Government policies and ordinances regulating development affect the availability and cost of
new housing. Although land use controls have the greatest direct impact, development approval
procedures and fees affect housing costs as well.
Although the permit approval process must conform to the Permit Streamlining Act
(Government Code § 65920 et. seq.), housing proposed in the city is subject to one or more of
the following review processes: environmental review, zoning, subdivision review, Conditional
Use Permit control, design review, and building permit approval.

Tulare Housing Element
As required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the City’s permit processing
procedures include an assessment of the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects.
If a project requires an environmental impact report, additional processing and time is required.
Many of the environmental regulations have protected the public from the effects of significant
environmental degradation and the location of certain developments on inappropriate sites and
have given the public an opportunity to comment on project impacts. This process does,
however, increase the time and cost of project approval.
Permit and Development Fees
The City collects fees to help cover the costs of permit processing, inspections, and
environmental review. The City also collects development fees in accordance with California
Government Code § 66000-66025 to help offset the cost to the City to provide infrastructure
and services to new development. These fees are generally assessed on the number of units in a
residential development, and collected at the beginning of the approval process. The exact fee
varies depending on the area of the city, and some areas, designated as “Developed,” are exempt
from these fees. The fees are adjusted regularly to account for increases in construction costs
and the needs of the community. Fees collected by the City do not exceed the City’s costs for
providing these services (See Table 4.7).

Table 4.9 displays the typical timelines for types of approvals and permits. Table 4.10 lists the
review authority for various applications in the City. Conditional Use Permits are reviewed by
the Planning Commission, which holds a public hearing to decide on approval. Appeals on the
Planning Commission’s action can be made to the City Council. The decision and findings are
recorded for the Conditional Use Permit and conditions of approval may be imposed for the
permit. (See Table 4.1 for the types of permits required for residential construction.)

Planning Permit Procedures
Procedures for processing permits vary. Generally, the following procedures are common to the
permitting process:
    1. Pre-application meeting with the Planning Director or Staff (optional)
    2. Filing of application and fees
    3. Initial application review – completeness check
    4. Site Plan Review Committee
    5. Environmental Review
    6. Staff Report and recommendation
    7. Permit approval or disapproval
Density Bonus
The purpose of density bonus regulations are to encourage the private sector to construct
affordable housing for very low income, low income, or senior citizen households (target
households).
Under the current density bonus program (Zoning Ordinance Chapter 10.148), a residential
project may qualify for a minimum increase of 25 percent over the maximum allowable base
density. The zoning district determines base density. For a residential project to qualify for a
density bonus and a developer incentive, a developer of a residential project in the city must
agree to construct at least:
       Twenty percent of the units for lower income households;
       Ten percent of the units for very low income households; or
       Fifty percent of the units for senior citizens.
Developer incentives are granted to developer of density bonus projects to provide an
instrument that will insure that the target households will remain affordable for 30 years or
longer. Incentives granted by the City include:
       Reduce or eliminate standards contained in the Subdivision title or the City Standards
        and Specifications Manual;
       Reduce or eliminate ordinance requirements, including open space, lot size, setback or
        parking standards; and
       Reduce or eliminate any design requirements exceeding Uniform Building Code
        specifications.

Constraints
Senate Bill 1818 (SB1818) amended the State density bonus program (Government Code 65915)
                                                                                                4
and became effective on January 1, 2005. Applicants are now eligible for a range requirements
exceeding Uniform Building Code specifications.
Senate Bill 1818 (SB1818) amended the State density bonus program (Government Code 65915)
and became effective on January 1, 2005. Applicants are now eligible for a range of density
bonuses up to 35 percent, based on the percentage of affordable units in a development.
Applicants are also eligible for an innovative new land donation density bonus. Jurisdictions are
required to offer at least 1-3 incentives (reductions in parking, for example), based on the
percentage of affordable units in a development. SB 1818 also limits parking requirements that
may be imposed by the Zoning Ordinance’s parking standards. The City’s Zoning Ordinance has
not been updated to be consistent with SB1818. The City will adopt a revised density bonus
program before the adoption of this housing element.
Design Review
Design review is required for all multifamily projects and mobile home or trailer parks proposed
in the city. In addition, the conversion of a single-family dwelling to non-residential uses or the
conversion of apartments into condominiums requires individual design review.
According to the City’s Zoning Ordinance, Design Review is intended to ensure that the
proposed project is consistent with the 2013 General Plan, in conformance with the zone
district, and is visually appealing. Design Review prevents adverse impacts on adjacent
properties and encourages the protection of natural and man-made resources in the city.
Projects undergoing design review are evaluated for architectural design, surface and drainage
improvements, lighting, and appearance of buildings. The project should include a desirable site
layout and design, including but not limited to, building arrangement, exterior surfacing
materials, fences and walls, grading, landscaping, lighting, signs, etc. The project must provide
efficient circulation, appropriate landscaping, and be consistent with the General Plan.
Projects where the area of an existing building or lot is being expanded by less than 25 percent
may be processed administratively by the Planning and Building Director through the design
review process. An Administrative Agreement is prepared for administrative site plan approval,
which records the decision of the Director and any conditions of approval. For projects that
require discretionary review, the Site Plan Review Committee is responsible for initial review
and makes recommendations to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission then has
final decision-making authority, unless appealed to the City Council.
The City’s design review process does not act as a constraint to the development of affordable
housing. The ministerial and the discretionary design review processes are done within
acceptable timeframes.

On- and Off-Site Improvement Requirements
The City regulates site improvements by the Subdivision Ordinance (Section 8.24.160) through
conditions and standards imposed through the City’s Site Plan Review process. On-site
improvements typically include street, curb, gutter, sidewalk, and utilities as well as amenities
such as landscaping, required off-street parking, fencing, streetlights, open space, and water
systems. Off-site improvements typically include the following (some of which are regulated by
other agencies):
       Road improvements, including construction of sections of streets, alleys, curbs and
        gutters, bridges, pedestrian ways, and bicycle paths.
       Street Trees, in compliance with the City’s Street Tree Planting Ordinance.
       Sewage collection and treatment (city of Tulare Sewer Division).
       Water systems improvements, including water mains, connections, fire hydrants, storage
        tanks, and treatment plants (city of Tulare Water District).
       Public facilities for fire (city of Tulare Fire Department), school (Tulare City Elementary
        School District, Tulare Joint Union High School District), and recreation.
To reduce housing costs, the City aims to require only those improvements that are deemed
necessary to maintain public health, safety, and welfare. Although site improvement is generally
not considered a constraint for new development, older infill parcels are oddly shaped and pose
a constraint to infill housing. Major infrastructure constraints are primarily in the older parts of
the community where the inefficient stormwater drainage system cause localized drainage
issues.
Generally, the developer passes on-site and off-site improvement costs to the homebuyer or

While local regulations and fees increase housing costs, some building and housing regulations
and fees are mandated by State law to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community
or to protect existing residents from financial or environmental impacts.
The City uses the latest edition of the California Building Code, which sets minimum standards
for residential and other structures. Table 4.13 lists applicable building and housing codes. No
local amendments have been made to the codes that would significantly increase housing costs.
Building codes are enforced through scheduled inspections of new construction, remodeling,
and rehabilitation projects. Inspections are also conducted in response to public complaints or
an inspector’s observation of code violation.

Other Governmental Constraints
In smaller communities such as Tulare there are often a limited number of qualified HOME
administrative subcontractors and nonprofit affordable housing developers. In a situation where
an organization acts as the Administrative Subcontractor to a State Recipient in the State HOME
Public Review Draft                                                                                      Page 87

program for a first-time homebuyer (FTHB) assistance program, and also develops affordable
housing in the same community, HCD restricts homebuyers participating in a development
program (i.e., mutual self-help housing) from utilizing HOME FTHB funding to purchase a
home. This causes not only an impediment to the ability to develop new single family affordable
homeownership opportunities, but also impacts the State Recipients ability to spend FTHB
funds in a community with limited affordable housing.
Governmental Constraints on Housing Production for Persons with Disabilities
As part of the governmental constraints analysis, State law calls for the analysis of potential and
actual constraints upon the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons
with disabilities. Table A-1 in Appendix A reviews not only the Zoning Ordinance, but also land
use policies, permitting practices, and building codes to ensure compliance with State and
Federal fair housing laws. Where necessary, the City proposes new policies or programs to
remove constraints.
The City has not specifically adopted a reasonable accommodation ordinance for housing
designed for persons with disabilities. However, the City does follow California’s handicap and
accessibility laws, in compliance with SB520, which require the following for multi-family
residential developments:
        Multi-family developments containing 4-20 units only require that all of their ground
         floor units are adaptable (interior modifications) and meet accessibility requirements.
        Multi-family developments containing greater than 20 units require that 2 percent of
         total units are adaptable and the remainder of the units are accessible.
        Single-family residential developments are exempt from accessibility requirements, but
         accessibility features for a single-family dwelling may be added at the request of a
         homeowner.
Reasonable accommodation elements can be integrated into developments through two
approval methods. The zoning ordinance allows the Planning and Building Director the
authority to grant a 20 percent reduction in front yard setbacks. This reduction would provide
the space for a ramp to be constructed. The fee for administrative approval is $44.00. In
addition, the City allows by right front porches to extend into the front yard setback area by five
feet. A front porch can be designed to serve as a ramp as well. The City also has a variance
procedure for review by the Planning Commission within 30 - 60 days.
Universal Design can address limited lifting or flexibility (with roll-in showers and grab bars),
limited mobility (with push/pull lever faucets, wide swing hinges) and limited vision (by
additional stairwell and task lighting). The City’s Building Code does not include specific
regulations that require the incorporation of Universal Design in new construction. The City’s
Building Department does expect that Universal Design will be part of the next code revision

cycle. The City has proposed Policy 3, Program A, Action Plan 5 to ensure that the building code
                                                                                                4
is revised with Universal Design criteria.
4.3 Non-governmental Constraints
The availability and cost of housing is strongly influenced by market factors over which local
governments have little or no control. Nonetheless, State law requires that the housing element
contain a general assessment of these constraints. This assessment can serve as the basis for
actions to offset the effects of such constraints. The primary non-governmental constraints to
the development of new housing in The City are land, construction costs, and environmental
constraints.
Land Costs
Costs associated with the acquisition of land include both the market price of raw land and the
cost of holding the property throughout the development process. These costs can account for
over half of the final sale prices of new homes in very small developments and in areas where
land is scarce. Among the variables affecting the cost of land are its location, amenities, the
availability and proximity of public services, and financing arrangements. According to real
estate listing website Zillow.com, as of April 2015, an acre of vacant, unimproved land that is
suitable for single-family development in the city ranges between $80,000 and $130,000. As of
June 2015, there is no multifamily land available for sale.
Construction Costs
Construction costs vary widely depending on the type, size, and amenities of the development.
According to building-cost.net, an online building estimator, construction costs for typical,
2,000 square foot single-family home are approximately $228,000, or about $114 per square
foot.
An even greater constraint to residential development is financing the cost of infrastructure.
Since the passage of Proposition 13, infrastructure costs cannot practically be passed on to the
taxpayer through property tax backed general or special obligations bonds by the local
jurisdiction. The incremental cost of these facilities must be partially financed through impact
fees; however, these costs are typically passed along by increasing the cost of housing and rents.

Environmental and Physical Constraints
The following potential physical and environmental constraints may affect development
regulated by the City by limiting the development potential and/or adding mitigation costs to a
project.
Environmental Constraints
       Two sensitive plant communities are known to occur in the city: Oak Woodland and
        wetlands.
       Vernal pools historically occurred in the area, however at present vernal pools are not
        known to occur within the city due to urbanization, landscaping, and agriculture. If a
        vernal pool were discovered at the site of a potential project it would constrain
        development in its vicinity.
       Two special status animal species are known to occur in the city, the burrowing owl and
        the San Joaquin kit fox. Other special status species with the potential to occur in and
        around the city are the Blunt-nosed leopard lizard, white-tailed kite, San Joaquin
        antelope squirrel, and San Joaquin pocket mouse. Barriers to wildlife movement and
        migration and the removal of raptor nesting sites are to be avoided in future
        development. The occurrence of any of these species on a site could pose constraints to a
        housing project.
       Sites in the city historically used for agriculture may have contamination due to former
        pesticide use, a potential environmental constraint.
Physical Constraints
       A small part of the city falls within the 100-year and 500-year floodplains, therefore
        flood hazards may pose potential constraints to some areas in the city (See Figure 4.1).
       Operational noise sources near potential sites for development may pose constraints. For
        example, the railroad tracks that run north-south through the city exceed acceptable
        noise levels. Noise levels for vacant residential zones in the area surrounding the airport
        do not exceed acceptable standards for development.
       Housing may be limited within 500 feet of State Route 99 under CEQA, due to the health
        hazards of siting sensitive uses near urban roads with over 100,000 vehicles per day.

4.5 Energy Conservation
Planning to maximize energy efficiency and the incorporation of energy conservation and green
building features can contribute to reduced housing costs for homeowners and renters. Energy
efficiency design produces sustainable community design and reduced dependence on
automobiles. Additionally, maximizing energy efficiency renders a reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions contributing to global climate change. In response to landmark legislation on global
climate change, local governments are required to implement measures that cut greenhouse gas
emissions attributable to land use decisions (see discussion on Climate Change below). The
Housing Element programs can support energy efficiency that benefits both the market and the
changing climate by
       Establishing a more compact urban core, bringing residents closer to work and services,
        therefore reducing automobile trips and reducing emissions that add to global climate
        change.
       Implementing passive solar construction techniques that require solar orientation,
        thermal massing, and other energy efficient design techniques.
       Encouraging the use of solar water and space heating.

                                                                                           July 2015

Constraints
Executive Order S-E-05 set into action the first steps in establishing greenhouse gas emission
                                                                                               4
reduction targets in California. This was followed by the California Global Warming Solutions
Act (AB 32), which required CARB to establish reduction measures.
There are several areas where programs for energy conservation in new and existing housing is
supported by the City:
       Through application of State residential building standards that establish energy
        performance criteria for new residential buildings (Title 24 of the California
        Administrative Code).
       Through appropriate Smart Growth land use policies and development standards that
        reduce energy consumption, such as promoting infill projects; building the downtown
        area up as an active business district with more compact, walkable neighborhoods; and
        planning and zoning for mixed-use and higher development.
Southern California Edison (SCE) provides a variety of energy conservation services for
residents and participates in several other energy assistance programs for lower income
households, which help qualified homeowners and renters conserve energy and control
electricity costs. These programs include the Multifamily Energy Efficiency Rebate Program, the
Multifamily Affordable Solar Housing (MASH) Program, and four programs for income
qualified households: the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) Program, Family
Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) Program, Energy Management Assistance (EMA) Program,
Energy Assistance Fund (EAF) Program.
The City Council of Tulare launched the HERO Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)
Program on June 10, 2015. HERO PACE financing enables homeowners to make energy- and
water-efficiency improvements and pay them off through their property tax bill. Property
owners repay the assessment over up to 20 years,the interest is tax-deductible, and homeowners
see immediate savings on utility bills. Given the State of California’s newly-adopted regulations
aimed at reducing urban water consumption by 25 percent, PACE financing is a particularly
appealing option for homeowners and cities.
The Residential Multifamily Energy Efficiency Rebate Program offers property owners and
managers incentives on a broad list of energy efficiency improvements in lighting, HVAC,
insulation and window categories. These improvements are to be used to retrofit existing
multifamily properties of two or more units.
The MASH program is part of the statewide California Solar Initiative (CSI). MASH offers
incentives for installing eligible photovoltaic systems for qualifying multifamily affordable
housing. The program subsidizes photovoltaic systems in multifamily housing, which in turn
offsets electricity loads and provides economic benefits for housing property owners and
tenants.

The income qualified programs are designed to help families manage their energy consumption
and also assist with electricity bills. The EMA program pays for the cost of purchasing and
installing energy efficient appliances and equipment for income-qualified customers. The CARE
provides a 20 percent or more monthly discount on electricity rates to income-qualified
households, certain non-profits, facilities housing agricultural employees, homeless shelters,
hospices and other qualified non-profit group living facilities. If a household does not qualify for
the CARE program, they have the opportunity to qualify for the FERA program. Additionally,
the EAF program is available to assist customers with their electric bill once in a 12-month
period.
Energy Consumption
Residential water heating and space heating/cooling are major sources of energy consumption.
With the application of energy efficient design and the use of solar power systems, these sources
can be operated on a much more efficient and sustainable level.
       Active Systems use mechanical equipment to collect and transport heat, such as a roof
        plate collector system used in solar water and space heaters.
       Passive Systems use certain types of building materials to absorb solar energy and can
        transmit that energy later, without mechanization.
By encouraging solar energy technology for residential heating/cooling in both retrofits and new
construction the City can play a major role in energy conservation. There are two distinct
approaches to solar heating: active and passive. The best method to encourage use of these solar
systems for heating and cooling is to not restrict their use in the zoning and building ordinances
and to require subdivision layouts that facilitate solar use.
Residential water heating can be made more energy efficient through the application of solar
water heating technologies. Solar water heating uses the sun to heat water, which is then stored
for later use, a conventional water heater is needed only as a backup. By cutting the amount of
natural gas needed to heat water 50-75 percent per building, solar water heating systems can
lower energy bills and reduce global warming pollution. The City has the opportunity to
implement solar technologies with the help or recent legislation. The Solar Water Heating and
Efficiency Act of 2007 (AB 1470) established a $250 million ten-year program to provide
consumer rebates for solar water heating systems.

Tulare Housing Element
Chapter 5
GOALS, POLICIES, PROGRAMS, & ACTION PLANS
The Housing Element Policy Document includes eight goal statements. Under each goal
statement, the element sets out policies to help the City achieve the goal. Implementation
programs are listed directly below the related policy and describe the specific actions the City
will take to achieve its housing goals. The implementation programs also identify the City
agencies or departments with primary responsibility for carrying out the program, the time
frame and potential funding sources for accomplishing the program, and quantified objectives
for the number of units expected to result from implementing the program.
The following definitions describe the nature of the statements of goals, policies,
implementation programs, and quantified objectives as they are used in the Housing Element
Policy Document:
       Goal: The ultimate purpose for or intended outcome of an effort stated in a way that is
        general in nature and immeasurable.
       Policy: A specific statement to guide actions and implies a clear commitment to achieve
        the Goal.
       Implementation Program: An action, procedure, program, or technique that carries out
        the policy. Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for carrying out
        the action and an estimated timeframe for its accomplishment. These timeframes are
        general guidelines and may be adjusted based on City staffing and budgetary
        considerations.
       Quantified Objective: The number of housing units that the City expects to be
        constructed, conserved, or rehabilitated; or the number of households the City expects
        will be assisted through Housing Element programs and based on general market
        conditions during the eight-year timeframe of the Housing Element (December 31, 2015
        – December 31, 2023).
        The quantified objectives identified in this Element are only included for programs that
        can be reasonably quantified. The quantified objectives are not targets or goals the City is
        committing achieve. Rather, they are estimates for tracking the effectiveness of each
        program in meeting the city’s housing needs. Funding availability, staffing resources,
        market conditions, and other factors will ultimately influence the City’s ability to achieve
        or exceed each objective.

HOUSING POLICIES, PROGRAMS, & ACTION PLANS
Goal A: New Housing Development
Provide opportunities for a broad range of housing types to meet the needs of all Tulare
residents.
Policy A-1:      The City shall ensure sufficient land is zoned at appropriate densities to
                 accommodate the city’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). (Program
                 A, edited)
Policy A-2:      The City shall encourage residential infill development on vacant and
                 underutilized land that are properly zoned and planned for residential uses
                 within the City limits. (New Policy)
Policy A-3:      The City shall encourage home builders to develop multifamily designated land at
                 the highest allowed density to make the use of land and facilities more efficient
                 and to provide more affordable housing opportunities. (New Policy)
Policy A-4:      The City shall require that 8 to 12 percent of units in all Master Planned
                 Communities be higher density residential. (Action Plan 4)
Policy A-5:      The City shall consider the potential impact on the City’s ability to meet its share
                 of the regional housing need when reviewing proposals to downzone residential
                 properties, reclassify residentially-designated property to other uses, or develop a
                 residential site with fewer units than what is assumed for the site in the Housing
                 Element sites inventory. (New Policy)
PolicyA-6:       The City shall strive to ensure adequate infrastructure and public services are
                 provided to serve existing and planned residential development. (New Policy)
                 Implementation Program A-1: Provision of Adequate Sites
                 The City shall maintain and annually update the inventory of residential land
                 resources identified in the Housing Element and shall monitor development and
                 other changes in the inventory to ensure the City has remaining capacity
                 consistent with its share of the regional housing need, and shall develop and
                 implement a formal evaluation procedure pursuant to Government Code Section
                 65863. The City shall actively participate in the development of the next RHNA
                 Plan to ensure that the allocations are reflective of regional and local land use
                 goals and policies. (New Program)
                 Responsibility:           Planning Division

Tulare Housing Element
            Timing:                   Annually and Ongoing
            Quantified Objective:     N/A
            Implementation Program A-2: Public Lands for Housing
            The City shall maintain and regularly update its inventory of State-, Federal-,
            County, and City-owned lands and analyze that land for possible housing sites. If
            appropriate sites are identified, the City shall approach the land owner, potential
            developers, and funding agencies to facilitate development of the sites for
            affordable housing and provide priority permit processing. The City shall sell or
            lease, as appropriate, City-owned land to non-profit housing organizations or
            governmental agencies who will construct housing for lower-income households.
            (Action Plan 2). Since the disbanding of the RDA, the City has
            established a property management division, which maintains a
            listing of City-owned properties. The City will consider offers from
            the development community and NPO’s to purchase City-owned
            properties for the construction of affordable housing. The City is not
            required to assist with any type of foreclosure acquisition programs
            or the like at this time.
            Responsibility:           City Council and the Planning Division
            Funding Source:           General Fund
            Timing:                   Ongoing
            Quantified Objective:     20 very low-income and 30 low-income units
            Implementation Program A-3: Rezone Program
            In order to meet State law requirements (Government Code Section 65583(c)(1)
            (A) and 65583(c)(1) (B)) to address the 2015-2023 RHNA, the City shall amend
            the General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance to provide adequate sites for 1,954
            lower-income units at a minimum of 20 dwelling units per acre from the sites
            identified in Table 3.9. At least half (50%) of these sites shall be zoned for
            residential uses only. Projects can be subject to design review as long as they do
            not trigger the CEQA review process.
            Per State law, the City must rezone to accommodate the unaccommodated need
            from the Fourth Cycle RHNA within one year of the Housing Element adoption
            due date, and must accommodate the Fifth Cycle RHNA within three years of the
            actual Housing Element adoption date. The City will rezone enough land and
            appropriate densities to cover the unaccommodated need from the Fourth Cycle
            of 969 lower-income units within one year of adoption of the Housing Element.
            The City will rezone enough land to cover the remaining Fifth Cycle
            unaccommodated need of 985 lower-income units within three years of adoption

Tulare Housing Element
Quantified Objectives
The following quantified objectives are based on the Housing Element’s identification of
existing and projected housing needs, potential housing development sites and financial
resources, and the Element’s analysis of constraints to the development and maintenance of
housing. This information has been used to establish reasonable estimates of what these
programs and policies can accomplish. These quantified objectives do not represent targets.
They are not designed to be minimum requirements. They are estimates based on past
experience, anticipated funding levels, and expected housing market conditions.
The City has estimated the number of units likely to be constructed, rehabilitated, and
conserved/preserved during the planning period (December 31, 2015 to December 31,
2023). These quantified objectives do not represent a ceiling, but rather establish a goal for
the City to strive to achieve, based on needs, resources and constraints.

Table B.1 summarizes the City’s regional housing needs allocation for the period of January 1,
2006 - December 31, 2013 and the number of housing units built or approved during that
planning period. Since January 2006, 1,433 single family and multifamily homes have been built
or approved. Most of these were affordable to above-moderate households. However, 56 units
were homes affordable to very low- or low-income households.

Since the adoption of the Impediments to Fair Housing in 2007, the City of Tulare has
accomplished the following:
VIAH and the Housing Authority completed five homes that were rehabilitated or constructed
utilizing Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) funding. Those units are currently (2015)
rented to low-income residents.
Self-Help Enterprises completed 9 of 22 single family affordable units at Gail Estates, and are
recruiting and qualifying families for the remaining units.
The Housing Authority acquired 20 low-mod rental apartment units at West Oakwood Estates
and rehabilitated them with a $250,000 loan from the former Redevelopment Agency. Since it
re-opened the project has been fully rented to low-mod Tulare families. Between 2012 and 2013
$100,501 in CDBG funding was used to purchase new tot lot equipment for the City park next
door.

Tulare worked with Pacific West Communities (PWC) and Self-Help to redevelop a remediated
former industrial site into affordable rental housing. The former Tulare Irrigation District
operations center is surrounded with residential uses, making the project a good fit for the
neighborhood. The project includes 49-units of affordable housing, including units designated
for very low income farmworker housing, and it is adjacent to the Santa Fe Trail, one of Tulare’s
prime recreational amenities. PWC completed construction on the project in January, 2012.
Tulare also worked with Pacific West Communities to construct 57 affordable small-lot homes in
the Tule Vista development. The project plan includes renting the homes to qualified tenants for
15 years and then allowing them to purchase their homes using the First Time Homebuyer
program. The first units became available in June, 2011 and the entire project is fully
occupied. The project has been awarded both an APA Central California regional award for
planning excellence, and a California APA award of excellence for the sustainable components,
integration with the surrounding community, and use of a unique financing structure.
The City committed $1.25 million to the development of Phase II of the Valley Oaks Apartment
complex to meet the needs of an additional 72 low-income Tulare individuals and families.
Construction was completed in spring 2011.

1 INTRODUCTION
  A. General Plans in California
  State law requires each county and city to prepare and adopt a comprehensive and
  long-range general plan for its physical development (Government Code Section
  65300). The general plan must address the seven topics (referred to as “elements”)
  of land use, circulation, housing, open­ space, conservation, safety, and noise (Gov-
  ernment Code Section 65302), to the extent that the topics are locally relevant. It
  may also include other topics of local interest, as chosen by the city (Government
  Code Section 65303).
  Together, the seven mandated elements of a general plan form a comprehensive set
  of planning policies. The land use element designates the general distribution and
  intensity of land uses within the planning area. The circulation element identifies the
  general location and extent of existing and proposed transportation facilities and util-

INTRODUCTION
ities. The housing element is a comprehensive assessment of current and future
housing needs for all segments of the city population, as well as a program for meet-
ing those needs. The open-space element describes measures for the preservation of
open space for the protection of natural resources, the managed production of re-
sources, and for recreation and public health and safety. The conservation element
addresses the conservation, development, and use of natural resources. The safety
element establishes policies to protect the community from risks associated with
natural and human-made hazards such as seismic, geologic, flooding, wildfire haz-
ards, and air pollution. The noise element identifies major noise sources and con-
tains policies intended to protect the community from exposure to excessive noise
levels.
A comprehensive general plan provides a city with a consistent framework for land
use decision­making. The general plan has been called the “constitution” for land
use development to emphasize its importance to land use decisions. The general
plan and its maps, diagrams, and development policies form the basis for city zoning,
subdivision, and public works actions. Under California law, no specific plan, area
plan, zoning ordinance, subdivision map, nor public works project may be approved
unless the city finds that it is consistent with the adopted general plan.
A city may adopt a general plan in the format that best fits its unique circumstances
(Government Code Section 65300.5). In doing so, the city must ensure that the gen-
eral plan and its component parts comprise an integrated, internally consistent, and
compatible statement of development policies. As part of this General Plan Update,
the City of Tulare updated three General Plan elements (Land Use, Circulation, and
Conservation and Open Space), and has integrated background information, goals
and policies, and environmental analysis, as described below.
B. Community Involvement Process
In updating the General Plan, the City conducted an extensive community in-
volvement process, which involved the components discussed in the following
paragraphs.
1. Community Advisory Committee CCAC
To provide guidance in the General Plan Update, the City created a General Plan
advisory committee – the CAC. The CAC was made up of individuals selected from
I-2                                                       CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035

                                                                INTRODUCTION
the community and was designed to provide additional community input to the
Planning Commission and City Council and give input to City staff and the General
Plan consulting team during the development of the General Plan.
2. Community Workshops
Four community workshops were held to gain public input on the development and
content of the General Plan documents.
 ♦ Issues and Opportunities, September 27, 2005
 ♦ Actions and Alternatives, March 2, 2006
 ♦ Land Use Concepts, May 3, 2006
 ♦ Vision, November 14, 2006
3. City Council/Planning Commission Joint Workshops
During the development of the draft General Plan Update, three joint City Coun-
cil/Planning Commission workshops were held. During these workshops, input was
sought on the following:
 ♦ Formation of the CAC and identifying its membership.
 ♦ Defining the Planning Area for the General Plan.
 ♦ Evaluating issues and opportunities and providing direction on key policy solu-
    tions.
 ♦ Evaluating land use alternatives and defining a preferred alternative.
4. Public Hearings
The Planning Commission and the City Council held formal public hearings to solicit
public input on the draft General Plan and associated EIR. The Planning Commis-
sion held a public hearing on November 25, 2013 and the City Council hearing on
December 3, 2013.
5. Website
A website was maintained
during preparation of the
General Plan Update to
provide up-to-date infor-
mation on the program. This site contained schedules for future meetings and pro-
vided a location to download documents prepared during the update process. Fol-
lowing adoption of the General Plan Update, the final files were made available on
the City’s website.

INTRODUCTION
6. Newsletters
As part of the community involvement process, two newsletters were prepared to
provide information on the progress of the General Plan Update.
  ♦ Defining the Future. This newsletter provided an overview of the General
    Plan Update process, including a description of what would be covered in the
    update and how to stay involved in the process.
  ♦ Issues and Alternatives. Based on inputs received from the public workshops,
    a newsletter summary of key issues and potential policy responses was prepared.
    This newsletter was presented and updated during workshops with the City
    Council and Planning Commission. The purpose of the newsletter was to identi-
    fy and discuss the policy directions that would be used to guide the preparation
    of the General Plan Update. The final version of this newsletter became the Is-
    sues and Alternatives Report.
C. Environmental Analysis
As required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA, Public Resources
Code Section 21000, et seq.), the City Council considered the findings of an envi-
ronmental impact report (EIR) prior to adopting the General Plan Update. In order
to minimize redundancy, the General Plan Update and EIR have been prepared as a
combined document, as allowed under Section 15166 of the State CEQA Guidelines.
The components of the General Plan Update and EIR taken together met the
CEQA requirements for EIR content and analysis. The General Plan Update –
Goals and Policies Report was the project description and provided environmental
mitigation in the form of goals, policies, and implementation measures. The EIR
included the remaining components required by CEQA.
All mitigation measures recommended to reduce the potential environmental im-
pacts of the General Plan Update below a level of significance that related to the
three elements being updated were incorporated as policies and implementation
measures in the General Plan Update. For mitigation measures related to other ele-
ments not covered by this update, a separate set of mitigations was prepared and
adopted.

                                                                    INTRODUCTION
D. General Plan Organization
The Tulare General Plan 2035 sets out a hierarchy of goals, policies, and implemen-
tation programs to guide future development in the city, encouraging infill develop-
ment and providing guidance for the city’s orderly expansion in a manner that is
economically sustainable.
Each element in this update contains the goals, policies, and implementation
measures that will be used to guide the future of the city. In each element, goals and
policies are numbered according to the topic they address. In the General Plan Up-
date, a one-, two-, or three-letter acronym is given to each element. This acronym is
used to identify all goals and policies in a given element, and is used to identify which
policy and implementation measures go together. For example, goals and policies
for the Land Use Element use the acronym “LU.”
The General Plan is organized as shown below.
 ♦ Chapter 1, Introduction. The introduction covers general plans in California,
     the City of Tulare's General Plan update program, public participation, and or-
     ganization of this document.
 ♦ Chapter 2, Land Use Element. This element establishes goals, policies, and
     implementation measures for residential, commercial, industrial, and other land
     uses in the city.
 ♦ Chapter 3, Transportation and Circulation Element. This element identifies
     goals, policies, and implementation measures to ensure that transportation and
     circulation needs are met within the city. In addition to automobile travel, this
     element also addresses pedestrian, bicycle, transit, trucking, parking, aviation, and
     other transportation issues.
 ♦ Chapter 4, Conservation and Open Space Element. This element identifies
     goals, policies, and implementation measures to ensure the appropriate use, en-
     joyment, and protection of natural and cultural resources in the city. This ele-
     ment also covers recreational facilities and activities.
 ♦ Chapter 5, Safety Element. This Element provides information about risks in
     Tulare due to natural and human-made hazards, and contains goals and policies
     to protect the community and its property from hazards. The City Council
     adopted the Safety Element on April 17, 1990. During this update to the Gen-

INTRODUCTION
    eral Plan, the Safety Element was reformatted and edited slightly. However, the
    content of this Element remains largely the same since the 1990 adoption.
  ♦ Chapter 6, Air Quality Element. As required by Assembly Bill 170, the Air
    Quality Element includes goals, policies, and implementation measures to im-
    prove the air quality in the San Joaquin Valley. This Element was adopted by the
    City Council on April 20, 2010. During this update to the General Plan, the Air
    Quality Element was reformatted and edited slightly. However, the content of
    this Element remains largely the same since the 2010 adoption.
  ♦ Chapter 7, Noise Element. The State-required Noise Element addresses noise
    problems, quantifies current and projected noise levels from a variety of sources,
    and establishes noise compatibility guidelines for different land uses. This Ele-
    ment was adopted by the City Council on July 19, 1988. During this update to
    the General Plan, the Noise Element was reformatted and edited slightly. How-
    ever, the content of this Element remains largely the same since the 1988 adop-
    tion.
As stated above, this General Plan includes updates to three elements, which are fur-
ther divided into related topic areas. To make the elements easier to use and refer-
ence, each element is organized using a similar structure.
1. Goal
Each element contains the goals and policies that will be used by the City to guide
future land use, development, and environmental protection decisions. In general
terms, a goal is a statement that describes in general terms a desired future condition
or “end” state. A goal serves as a general direction-setter.
In this General Plan, goal statements will be formatted like the following example.
In the example, the shaded box on the left is the goal’s reference number: “LU” re-
fers to the Land Use element and the “2” means this is the second goal under this
topic. Each element will have one or more goals.

                                                                    INTRODUCTION
For each goal, policy, and implementation measure, the information in the brackets
at the end of the statement shows if this item is a modification of an existing General
Plan component or something new with this update. These references are provided
to assist in the review of the draft General Plan and will be removed in the adopted
version.
2. Policy
A policy is a statement that guides a specific course of action for decision-makers to
achieve a desired goal. A policy must be clear and unambiguous. In this General
Plan, every goal has one or more policies associated with it. The letters and first
number (e.g. “LU-P2.2”) shows the number of the goal that the policy supports.
The final number in the identifier (e.g., “.2”) shows that this is the second policy that
supports Goal LU-2.
3. Implementation Measures
To help ensure that appropriate actions are taken to implement the General Plan, a
set of implementation measures are provided at the end of each element. An imple-
mentation measure is a specific measure, program, procedure, or technique that car-
ries out plan policies. Following the goals and policies for each element, a table lists
the implementation measures, states which policy(ies) the implementation measure
supports, states what City departments are responsible to see this implementation is
accomplished, and provides a timeline for when this implementation will be com-
pleted.

INTRODUCTION
I-8          CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035
2 LAND USE ELEMENT
  A. Background Information
  Situated within the largely rural San Joaquin Valley, and in what was once almost
  solely a rural area itself, the City of Tulare finds itself an urbanizing City with an ex-
  panding population. Continuing at a slightly slower pace of development compared
  to the average annual growth rate from the last 20 years (1990-2010) of 2.9 percent,
  the City is expected to witness an additional 42,020 residents over the next 20 years
  at an average annual growth rate of 2.7 percent. In addition to accommodating fu-
  ture population growth, the City is working to create a pace that is both safe and
  offers a high quality of life in a manner that can be maintained from both resource
  and financial points of view.
  CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                       2-1
LAND USE ELEMENT
Quality of life can be measured by many factors, including the sense of community,
adequacy of services available, environmental quality, and other locally important
factors. To maintain the City's quality of life, Tulare's ability to continue to develop
unique urban forms that foster connectivity and community interaction is critical.
Residents who identify with and establish ties to their neighborhoods and communi-
ty enjoy a higher satisfaction with their quality of life.
This Land Use Element is based on the following guiding principles:
 ♦ Ensure compliance with all laws while maintaining to the maximum ex-
    tent local control. The City is a charter city and, while intending to at least
    achieve full minimal compliance with all federal, State, regional, and other laws
    external to itself, the City also intends to preserve maximum local control. The
    City Council retains its powers consistent with the Charter and law to impose
    standards that exceed the applicable external laws. While not exclusive, the fol-
    lowing are laws that the City intends to achieve at least minimal compliance with
    in the preparation of this General Plan:
     Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) and Sustainable Communities
       and Climate Protection Act of 2008 (SB 375)
     2007 California flood legislation (AB 162, SB 5, and others)
     California Complete Streets Act (AB 1358)
     California State housing law
 ♦ Achieve the highest and best beneficial use for all property within the City.
    Properties within the City, both individually and collectively, are to be used for
    their highest beneficial purposes. Such use results in the optimal benefit to the
    entire community.
 ♦ Protect important natural resources and agricultural lands. The natural
    land is one of the region's best assets. Protecting these vital resources will be
    paramount to the development of a sustainable and vibrant community.
 ♦ Encourage sustainable design requirements. The use of community design
    guidelines and policies that encourage the development of strong neighborhoods,
    efficient mobility, and natural and cultural resource protection will promote a
    healthy and economically viable city. Urban form and design are the building
    blocks of what defines neighborhoods, centers, and communities. From the
    downtown core to a residential neighborhood, the continuity among existing and
    new development helps identify the various places that make Tulare a great
    community in the Central Valley.

                                                            LAND USE ELEMENT
 ♦ Ensure the provision of housing for all economic segments of the com-
    munity. These State mandated policies seek to promote the development of
    range of housing types, both through conservation and enhancement of existing
    housing and the promotion of new neighborhoods with a mixture of densities.
 ♦ Neighborhoods and Villages. Develop a series of interconnected neighbor-
    hoods and villages intended to embody features that encourage alternative modes
    of transportation and promote mixed-use and mixed density areas. To develop
    effective transportation choices that include auto, transit, pedestrian and bicycle
    facilities in new or redeveloped neighborhoods, the City is encouraging the de-
    velopment of compact and walkable villages. Village policies are centered on the
    foundation of the need to maximize sustainability and reduce external trips and
    reliance on the automobile.
This element prescribes the locations of various land uses and sets out the standards
for future development and redevelopment. This element contains two major com-
ponents. The first part describes the Land Use Diagram and the land use classifica-
tion system and standards. The second part sets out goals, policies, and implementa-
tion programs for existing and future development.
The Land Use Element is divided into the following 15 sections:
  ♦ Land Use Diagram and Standards
  ♦ Growth Patterns
  ♦ Residential Development
  ♦ Commercial Development
  ♦ Downtown Development
  ♦ Industrial Development
  ♦ Mixed Use Development
  ♦ Villages
  ♦ Reserve Lands
  ♦ Airport
  ♦ Municipal Services
  ♦ Higher Education
  ♦ Community Character/Design
  ♦ Administration/Implementation
  ♦ Implementation Measures

LAND USE ELEMENT
1. Key Terms
 ♦ Airport Influence Area (AIA). The Airport Influence Area is an area around
    an airport that requires additional land use regulation to accommodate aircraft
    operations. The zone is identified in the Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan
    (ALUCP) by the Airport Land Use Commission (ALUC) and is subject to special
    use and development regulations including but not limited use, building height,
    low density residential uses, and other limiting factors. If an AIA that reflects
    current operations is not available, the AIA will be considered to be a two nauti-
    cal mile buffer as measured from the runway(s) centerline. The runway will in-
    clude helicopter take-off and landing zones if not on the primary runway.
 ♦ Buffer. An area established between potentially conflicting land uses, such as
    agricultural and residential uses, which, depending on the potential impact, may
    utilize landscaping or structural barriers such as setbacks or roads.
 ♦ Buildout. Development of land to its full potential, or theoretical capacity, as
    permitted under current or proposed planning or zoning designations.
 ♦ City Limits. The legal boundaries of the geographical area subject to the juris-
    diction of the City of Tulare’s government. For example, development applica-
    tions for properties located within the city limits must be reviewed by the City.
 ♦ Commercial. A land use classification which permits facilities for the buying
    and selling of commodities and services.
 ♦ Density. This term is applied to residential development in the Urban Devel-
    opment Boundary (UDB) and is defined as the number of units per gross acre
    (dwelling units per acre or DU/A) on a given site.
 ♦ Development. This is the physical extension and/or construction of urban land
    uses. Development activities include, but are not limited to: storm drainage;
    subdivision of land; construction or alteration of structures, roads, utilities, and
    other facilities; installation of septic systems; grading; deposit of refuse, debris, or
    fill materials; and clearing of natural vegetative cover (with the exception of agri-
    cultural activities).
 ♦ Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The size of a building in square feet divided by land
    area, expressed as a decimal number. For example, a 60,000 square foot building
    on a 120,000 square-foot parcel would have a floor area ratio of 0.50. The FAR
    is used in calculating the building intensity of non-residential development.

                                                             LAND USE ELEMENT
♦ Gross Acreage. This term refers to the total area of a site. This General Plan
   utilizes gross acreage in the definition of density and intensity.
♦ Industrial. The manufacture, production, and processing of consumer goods.
   Industrial is often divided into "heavy industrial" uses, such as construction
   yards, quarrying, and factories; and "light industrial" uses, such as research and
   development and less intensive warehousing and manufacturing.
♦ Infill Development. Development that occurs on vacant or underutilized land
   within areas that area already largely developed.
♦ Intensity. This term is applied to non­residential development in the UDB, in-
   cluding commercial and industrial uses. Intensity is defined using a floor area ra-
   tio.
♦ Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). A five- or seven-member
   commission within each county that reviews and evaluates all proposals for for-
   mation of special districts, incorporation of cities, annexation to special districts
   or cities, consolidation of districts, and merger of districts with cities. Each
   county’s LAFCO is empowered to approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve
   such proposals.
♦ Land Use. Land use is the occupation or utilization of land or water area for
   any human activity or any purpose defined in the General Plan.
♦ Land Use Classification. A system for classifying and designating the appro-
   priate use of properties.
♦ Mixed-Use. Properties on which various uses, such as office, commercial, insti-
   tutional, and residential, are combined in a single building or on a single site in an
   integrated development project with significant functional interrelationships and
   a coherent physical design. A "single site" may include contiguous properties.
♦ Office. The use of land by general business offices, medical and professional
   offices, administrative or headquarters offices for large wholesaling or manufac-
   turing operations, and research and development.
♦ Open Space. Open space is any parcel or area of land or water which is essen-
   tially unimproved and devoted to an open space use for the purposes of (1) the
   preservation of natural resources, (2) the managed production of resources, (3)
   outdoor recreation, or (4) public health and safety.

LAND USE ELEMENT
 ♦ Residential. Land designated in the Tulare City General Plan and Zoning Or-
    dinance for buildings consisting only of dwelling units. May be vacant or unim-
    proved.
 ♦ Specific Plan. Under Article 8 of the Government Code (Section 65450 et seq),
    a legal tool for detailed design and implementation of a defined portion of the
    area covered by a General Plan. A specific plan may include all detailed regula-
    tions, conditions, programs, and/or proposed legislation which may be necessary
    or convenient for the systematic implementation of any General Plan element(s).
    The contents are the same as those of a policy plan except they will be more
    comprehensive with respect to utilities and public facilities and their funding.
    (See also “Policy Plan” and “Planned Development”)
 ♦ Sustainable. Describes practices that meet the needs of the present without
    compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
 ♦ Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). Residential and commercial areas de-
    signed to maximize access by public transportation, such as trains and buses.
    TODs typically have a neighborhood center with a transit station, surrounded by
    relatively high-density development, with progressively lower-density spreading
    outwards.
 ♦ Urban Development Boundary. The UDB is identified in response to the re-
    quirements of the Tulare County Local Agency Formation Commission and
    identifies the amount of land needed to accommodate a 20-year development
    horizon.
 ♦ Urban Form. Urban form refers to the design and character of the built envi-
    ronment.
 ♦ Zoning. Zoning is the principal tool for implementing the general plan; it trans-
    lates general plan land use guidelines and standards directly into enforceable
    regulations. In its most elementary form, zoning is the division of a community
    into districts and the specification of allowable uses and development standards
    for each of the districts. Typically, the zoning ordinance consists of text and a
    map delineating districts for such basic land uses as residential, commercial, and
    industrial and establishing special regulations for parking, floodplains, and other
    specific concerns. For each of the basic land uses, the zoning ordinance text
    typically includes an explanation of the purpose of the zoning district; a list of
    principal permitted uses; a list of uses allowed by conditional use permit; and
    standards for minimum lot size, density, height, lot coverage, and setback.
2-6                                                  CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035

                                                            LAND USE ELEMENT
State law requires that zoning ordinances be consistent with the general plan. A zon-
ing ordinance is consistent with an adopted general plan only if the various land uses
authorized by the zoning ordinance “are compatible with the objectives, policies, and
general land uses and programs specified in such a plan” (Government Code Section
65860[a]). State law also provides that in the event that a zoning ordinance becomes
inconsistent with a general plan by reason of amendment to such a plan, the zoning
ordinance must be amended within a reasonable time so that it is consistent with the
general plan as amended (Government Code Section 65860 [a]).
2. Disadvantaged Communities
As required by Senate Bill (SB) 244 and codified in Government Code (GC) Section
65302.10(a), Cities and Counties are required to update their Land Use Elements
with information about nearby disadvantaged communities upon the next adoption
of their Housing Elements. The Tulare County LAFCO defines a disadvantaged
community, “as an area that has a median household income 80 percent or less of
the statewide average… and contains at least 20 dwelling units at a density not less
than one unit per acre.” Specifically, GC Section 56430 requires Cities and Counties
to:
 ♦ Identify and describe “island” and “fringe” communities within a City’s SOI.
 ♦ Analyze water, wastewater, stormwater, and fire protection needs or deficiencies
    for each identified community.
 ♦ Detail potential funding sources to improve any identified deficiencies.
Although the City of Tulare is not required to respond to the requirements of SB
244 until its year or year range of 2014-2022 Housing Element Update, the City is
taking advantage of this General Plan update to begin an initial response to SB 244.
The information presented below is based upon data included within the 2013 City
of Tulare Municipal Service Review (MSR) prepared by the Tulare County Local
Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). This summary does not include infor-
mation about stormwater infrastructure since the 2013 Tulare MSR lacks this data.
However, in general, many of these communities lack an established curb and gutter
network, which can cause stormwater drainage issues.

a. Unincorporated County Communities
The Tulare County LAFCO MSR identifies six unincorporated communities near
Tulare that meet the criteria described above. Four are considered disadvantaged and
two are considered non-disadvantaged unincorporated communities, as shown on
Figure 2-1. These communities are described as follows:
 ♦ Matheny Tract. The Matheny Tract, located south of the city limit between
    Pratt and I Streets, is considered a disadvantaged community, with approximately
    349 housing units and a population of 1,225 people (as of the 2010 Census). The
    County of Tulare’s General Plan designates this area as Suburban Residential.
 ♦ East Tulare Villa. The East Tulare Villa, located east of the city limit and north
    of Bardsley Avenue, is considered a disadvantaged community, with approxi-
    mately 201 housing units and a population of 737 people (as of the 2010 Cen-
    sus).
 ♦ Lone Oak Tract. The Lone Oak Tract, located west of the city limit, is a disad-
    vantaged community that includes approximately 27 housing units and 139 resi-
    dents (as of the 2010 Census). The County of Tulare’s General Plan designates
    this area as Suburban Residential.
 ♦ Soults Tract. The Soults Tract, located west of the city limit, is a disadvantaged
    community that includes approximately 20 housing units and 125 residents (as of
    the 2010 Census). The County of Tulare’s General Plan designates this area as
    Suburban Residential.
 ♦ Tract 396. Tract 396 is a non-disadvantaged community located north of the city
    limit and east of Mooney Boulevard. As of the 2010 Census, Tract 396 has ap-
    proximately 72 housing units and a population of 221 people. The County of
    Tulare’s General Plan designates this area as Suburban Residential.
 ♦ Tract 103. Tract 103 is a non-disadvantaged community located east of the city
    limit and north of Tulare Avenue. As of 2010, Tract 2013 includes 42 housing
    units and 95 residents. The County of Tulare’s General Plan designates this area
    as Suburban Residential.
b. Water
Multiple water service providers deliver water to the unincorporated communities
surrounding Tulare and are described as follows:
CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                  2-9

LAND USE ELEMENT
 ♦ Matheny Tract. Pratt Mutual Water Company serves the Matheny Tract. Wa-
    ter quality is an issue in the Matheny Tract due to arsenic levels off 15.7 mi-
    crograms per liter, which exceeds the State minimum of 10 micrograms per liter.
    The City of Tulare and Self-Help Enterprises, a local non-profit housing group,
    obtained State funding to improve the Matheny Tract’s water infrastructure so it
    can be connected to the City of Tulare’s water infrastructure.
 ♦ East Tulare Villa. CalWater’s Tulco system serves East Tulare Villa. Water
    quality in the area meets State standards. However, the system uses one func-
    tional well to serve the area which would be problematic should the well fail
    sometime in the future. To remedy this situation, CalWater is working to con-
    nect to the City of Tulare’s water system so the City can provide water service in
    an emergency situation.
 ♦ Lone Oak Tract. Lone Oak Tract relies upon the City of Tulare’s water distri-
    bution system for water service.
 ♦ Soults Tract. The Soults Mutual Water Company provides water services to
    residents of the Soults Tract. In 2008, the water distribution system was con-
    nected to the City of Tulare’s water system. However, the Soults system suffered
    water loss due to leakage or backflow as a result of the connection. To remedy
    the situation, the Soults Mutual Water Company has partnered with Self-Help
    Enterprises to secure State funding to resolve the connection issues. Additional-
    ly, in July 2011 the water system experienced nitrate contamination.
 ♦ Tract 396. CalWater’s Visalia system serves Tract 396. An overview of Visalia’s
    water system can be found in the City of Visalia’s Municipal Service Review.
 ♦ Tract 103. Residents in Tract 103 use individual water wells to secure their wa-
    ter.
c. Sewer
All of the disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities adjacent to the City of
Tulare use individual septic systems to dispose of wastewater. The County of Tulare
is currently working on a project, funded by a Proposition 84 planning grant, to con-
nect the Matheny Tract to the City’s wastewater system. Depending on the availabil-
ity of funding, the Soults Tract, Lone Oak Tract, and East Tulare Villa area are all
adjacent to existing City wastewater infrastructure and could potentially be connect-
ed to the City’s system. Tract 103 is approximately ½ mile from the closest City
2-10                                                 CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035

sewer line. In addition, Tract 396 would likely be served by the City of Visalia due to
its geographic proximity.
d. Fire Protection
Fire protection for the unincorporated communities is provided by City of Tulare,
City of Visalia, and County of Tulare fire stations. The City of Tulare and County of
Tulare operate under a mutual aid agreement to provide fire service. The nearest fire
stations to the unincorporated communities are as follows:
 ♦ Matheny Tract: County Fire Station #25 is approximately 2 miles from the
     Matheny Tract.
 ♦ East Tulare Villa. County Fire Station #25 is approximately 3 miles from East
     Tulare Villa.
 ♦ Lone Oak Tract. City of Tulare Fire Station #62 is approximately 2 miles from
     the Lone Oak Tract.
 ♦ Soults Tract. City of Tulare Fire Station #62 is approximately 2 miles from the
     Soults Tract.
 ♦ Tract 396. City of Visalia Fire Station #52 is approximately 3 files from Tract
     396.
 ♦ Tract 103. County Fire Station #35 is approximately 3 miles from Tract 103.
e. Potential Funding Sources
As mentioned, one of the requirements of SB 244 is to analyze potential funding
mechanisms to help remedy identified infrastructure deficiencies. As identified by
the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR), some of these financing
mechanisms could include bonds, development impact fees, taxes, and the formation
of assessment districts which levy an assessment on affected properties to pay for
infrastructure service improvements. In addition, OPR suggests the following po-
tential funding sources:
   ♦ California Department of Public Health Safe Drinking Water State Revolving
     Fund
   ♦ State Water Resources Control Board Revolving Fund Program
   ♦ State Water Resources Control Board Small Community Wastewater Grant Pro-
     gram

B. Goals, Policies, and Actions
1. Land Use Diagram and Standards
State planning law requires general plans to establish "standards of population densi-
ty and building intensity" for the various land use designations in the plan (Govern-
ment Code Section 65302(a). To satisfy this requirement, the General Plan includes
such standards for each land use designation appearing on the Land Use Diagram, as
shown on Figure 2-2. These standards are stated differently for residential and non-
residential development. Table 2-1 provides as summary of the land use designa-
tions and standards used in the City of Tulare. In addition, the land use designations
and standards guide the zoning ordinance and zoning categories for more detailed
development standards. Table 2-2 provides correspondence between the land use
designations and zoning categories. The following summary explains how the land
use designation standards operate.
a. Residential Development
Standards of development density for residential uses are stated as the allowable
range of dwelling units per gross acre. The term “gross acre” includes all land (in-
cluding streets and rights-of­way) designated for a particular residential use, while net
acreage excludes streets and rights-of­way. In urban areas, net acreage is normally 20
to 25 percent less for a given area than gross acreage. In rural areas and open space
areas, the difference between net and gross can be as low as 5 percent. Net acreage
is the standard typically used in zoning, while gross acreage is more commonly used
in general plan designations.
Standards of population density for residential uses can be derived by multiplying
the maximum allowable number of dwelling units per gross acre by the average
number of persons per dwelling unit assumed for the applicable residential desig-
nation. According to the State Department of Finance, in 2012 Tulare’s average
household size was 3.35 persons per household.

LAND USE ELEMENT
b. Non-Residential Development
Standards of building intensity for non-residential uses such as commercial and in-
dustrial development are stated as maximum floor-area ratios (FARs). A floor-area
ratio is the ratio of the gross building square footage on a lot to the net square foot-
age of the lot (or parcel).
For example, on a lot with 10,000 square feet of land area, an FAR of 1.00 will allow
10,000 square feet of gross building floor area to be built, regardless of the number
of stories in the building (e.g., 5,000 square feet per floor on two floors or 10,000
square feet on one floor). On the same 10,000-square-foot lot, an FAR of 0.5 would
allow 5,000 square feet of floor area, and an FAR of 0.25 would allow 2,500 square
feet. The diagram below shows graphically how various building configurations rep-
resenting a FAR of 1.0 could cover a lot.
 FAR 1.0 EXAMPLES
Goal LU-1         To ensure that Tulare’s future growth will proceed in an orderly

                   territory is not under the direct control of the City of Tulare,
                   this designation expresses Tulare's preference that these areas
                   remain in agricultural use and production during the timeline of
                   the current General Plan or until development to urban uses is

             provides for a mix of land uses centered on access to public
             transit. Key features of a TOD include a mix of housing types,
             businesses, and public uses at medium to high densities.
             The Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) designation is in-
             tended to create walkable and bikeable neighborhoods with
             easy access to bus service. Each of the TOD areas has a par-
             ticular existing context and tailored future vision, as identified
             in the Transit-Oriented Development Plan, which helps shape
             the general parameters for future development.
             The TOD designation, like the TOD Overlay and Village des-
             ignations below, is considered a “holding” category. The TOD
             designation promotes the development of a detailed specific or
             area plan that will provide the details needed to ensure a com-
             prehensive TOD area is developed. A specific or area plan is
             required to be submitted and approved to ensure a TOD con-
             cept and compliance with the TOD Plan’s design guidelines,
             and an approved specific or area plan is required prior to ap-
             proval of an annexation request. The specific plan or area plan
             will establish the range of allowable densities within the plan ar-
             ea.
             As part of the specific or area plan, a land use diagram will be
             prepared that delineates the land uses and facilities to be devel-
             oped within the TOD. On this diagram, land uses will utilize
             the designations shown on Table 2-1. This diagram will be

                ♦  Transit-Oriented Development Overlay (-TOD). An over-
                   lay is applied over an underlying land use designation. Overlays
                   provide more specific regulations than the underlying designa-
                   tion, or they identify the area for a future planning effort such
                   as an area plan or specific plan. The TOD overlay, like the
                   TOD designation, allows a mix of land uses focused on access
                   to public transit. When this overlay is applied, an area retains
                   its base General Plan land use designation but property owners
                   may choose to develop using either the underlying land use
                   designation or the TOD overlay designation. The TOD over-
                   lay allows different land uses and higher densities than that of
                   the base designation.
                   The TOD Overlay designation, like the TOD and Village des-
                   ignations, is considered a “holding” category. The purpose of
                   the TOD Overlay designation is to promote the development
                   of a detailed specific or area plan that will provide the details
                   needed to ensure a comprehensive TOD area is developed. A
                   specific or area plan is required to be submitted and approved
                   to ensure a TOD concept and compliance with the TOD
                   Plan’s design guidelines, and an approved specific or area plan
                   is required prior to approval of an annexation request. The
                   specific plan or area plan will establish the range of allowable
                   densities within the plan area.

             neighborhood commercial, higher density residential, schools,
             public and open space uses.
             The Village (V) designation is intended to promote a mixed-
             use village concept, incorporating the principles of smart
             growth and also recognizing the environmental and physical
             constraints of each village area. Each of the villages is as-
             signed a particular land use mix, which will set the general
             parameters of urban development.
             The Village designation is considered a “holding” category.
             The purpose of the Village designation is to promote the de-
             velopment of a detailed specific plan that will provide the de-

2. Growth Patterns
Goal LU-2     To grow in an orderly pattern consistent with the economic,
              social, and environmental needs of Tulare and taking regional
              impacts into account.
    Policies
    LU-P2.1     Adequate Land Supply. The City shall maintain sufficient devel-
                opable land within the UDB to avoid contributing to artificially in-
                flated land prices by helping to maintain a robust and competitive
                real estate market. Developable land is defined as:
                 ♦   Land that is undeveloped or otherwise vacant.
                 ♦   Parcels that are greater than 1 acre where the majority of the
                     parcel is undeveloped.
                 Sufficient developable land is defined as:
                 ♦   The developable land in each land use designation needed to
                     provide a 20-year supply of land using development rates for
                     the previous five years to project a 20-year demand.
    LU-P2.2     Compact Development. The City shall promote development
                patterns that are compact and use space in an efficient but aesthetic
                manner to promote more walking, biking, and use of public transit.
    LU-P2.3     Infill Development. The City shall encourage and provide incen-
                tives for infill development to occur within or adjacent to existing
                development in order to maximize the use of land within existing
                urban areas as well as downtown revitalization, and not focus solely
                on development of undeveloped areas. This policy will help to
                maximize the use of land within existing urban areas, minimize the
                conversion of existing agricultural land, and minimize environmen-
                tal concerns associated with new development.
    LU-P2.4     Self-Sufficient Community. The City shall establish a growth
                pattern that reduces reliance on areas outside of the city for shop-
                ping needs, and furthers the City's desire to be a self-sufficient, full-
                service community.

              tain a sphere of influence (SOI) line at Avenue 264 and including
              the Tagus Ranch area.
     LU-P2.7  Cooperative Urban Centers. The City shall continue to work
              with Tulare County to avoid urban development decisions for lands
              within the City's UDB without consultation with and affirmation
              by the City of Tulare.
     LU-P2.8  Regional Cooperation. The City shall maintain a cooperative re-
              lationship with other local governments (i.e. Tulare County, the
              City of Visalia) to address regional issues and opportunities related
              to growth, transportation, infrastructure, greenhouse gas emissions
              reductions, and other planning issues. Special consideration for
              cooperation shall be applied when reviewing peripheral develop-
              ment proposals within or adjacent to the City's UDB, especially
              along the Mooney Boulevard corridor. This includes continued
              support of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the
              County of Tulare regarding development impact fees within the
              City and City UDB.
     LU-P2.9  Maintain Urban Edge. The City shall maintain a distinct urban
              edge, while creating a gradual transition between urban uses, rural
              uses, and open space. The City shall maintain rural residential and
              residential estate designations, or utilize project design to incorpo-
              rate a distinct urban edge, along the city's edge to provide this tran-
              sition.
     LU-P2.10 Regional Planning. The City shall participate and assist in the
              development of regional plans, such as the Regional Blueprint Plan
              and the California Partnership for the San Joaquin Valley’s 2006
              Strategic Action Proposal.

                gional Blueprint.
    LU-P2.12    Innovative Development. The City shall promote flexibility and
                innovation through the use of planned unit developments, devel-
                opment agreements, specific plans, mixed­use projects, and other
                innovative development and planning techniques.
    LU-P2.13    Location of Support Services. The City shall encourage the loca-
                tion of ancillary employee services (including, but not limited to,
                child care, restaurants, banking facilities, convenience markets) near
                major employment centers for the purpose of reducing midday ve-
                hicle trips.
    LU-P2.14    Development Impact Fees. The City shall keep and maintain
                current development impact fee categories for new construction so
                that new construction adequately mitigates potential impacts to ex-
                isting levels of service of infrastructure and public services.
3. Residential Development
Goal LU-3     To designate, protect, and provide land to ensure sufficient
              residential development capacity and variety to meet
              community needs and projected population growth.
    Policies
    LU-P3.1     Neighborhood Housing Mix. The City shall encourage mixed
                use neighborhoods to have a variety of housing types and densities
                to help create an overall healthy, balanced community.
    LU-P3.2     Executive Housing. The City shall encourage the development
                of “upper end” housing to better accommodate the local market

8. Transit-Oriented Development
The City shall use the TOD concept as the primary basis for planning development
near transit areas, as designated on the Land Use Diagram. Key features of each
TOD neighborhood will include mix of housing types (such as apartments, town-
homes, and single-family homes), businesses (including retail, restaurants, and offic-
es), and public uses (such as parks, libraries, and schools) at medium to high densi-
ties.
Goal LU-8         To encourage a mix of housing types, businesses, and public
                  uses at medium to high densities near transit to create more
                  bikeable and pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods.

sities; development of a village center comprised of neighborhood commercial, high-
er density housing, schools, and public service uses (such as a fire station); bicycle
and pedestrian trails; and open space.
Areas subject to the policies, development criteria, and standards included in this
section are designated as Village (V) on the Land Use Diagram. The Village designa-
tion is considered a “holding” category. Unlike other designations, an applicant can-
not simply submit a development proposal for consideration. While a very low den-
sity residential use is allowed by the designation, a specific plan, as specified in Policy
LU-8.1, is required to be submitted and approved before higher intensity land uses
will be allowed.
CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                      2-35

LAND USE ELEMENT
The purpose of the Village designation is to promote the development of a detailed
specific plan that will provide the details needed to ensure a comprehensive mixed-
use proposal is developed in the Village-designated areas.
Goal LU-9       To organize new development areas into vibrant,
                neighborhoods characterized by a mix of land uses, pedestrian
                and transit accessibility, and neighborhood identity.
     Policies
     LU-P9.1      Village Specific Plans/General Plan Amendment. The pur-
                  pose of the Village designation is to promote the development of a
                  detailed specific plan that will provide the details needed to ensure
                  a comprehensive mixed-use proposal is developed in the Village
                  designated areas.
                   CRITERIA
                   Specific Plan. Each Village area designated on the General Plan Land Use
                   Diagram will require the preparation of a specific plan. Village areas may be
                   combined into one or more specific plans in order to achieve a feasible devel-
                   opment project. In combining Village areas into one or more specific plans no
                   remnant (unplanned areas) shall be created. Village areas may also be com-
                   bined with a Special Use District into one or more specific plans provided no
                   remnants (unplanned areas) are created by the combination. The City's objec-
                   tive in this criterion is to have whole, fully integrated land use plans.
                   General Plan Amendment. The required General Plan Amendment will be
                   done to modify the General Plan Land Use Diagram to reflect the land use
                   diagram from the approved specific plan, which will be based on the land use
                   designations shown on Table 2-1.
                  a. Specific Plan Content
                  All specific plans prepared for a village designated area must meet
                  the requirements of State law and be comprised of four planning
                  frameworks. Within each framework, the specific plan will provide
                  the goals and policies that will guide future decisions on projects
                  within the specific plan area. The frameworks will also include a
                  detailed implementation plan that will identify responsibilities, fi-
                  nancing requirements, and phasing/timing.

                                                           LAND USE ELEMENT
                The Land Use Framework will include the proposed land use pat-
                tern (using the designations listed on Table 2-1), actual develop-
                ment densities in each neighborhood, and development phasing.
                The framework will also include specifics on development stand-
                ards.
                The Specific Plan prepared will provide complete guidance on the
                land use provisions that will guide future development within the
                UDB. At a minimum, these provisions will address the following
                topics. In consultation with City staff, other topics may be required
                depending on site-specific needs.
                 ♦  Land Use Classification. A land use classification system
                    that clearly identifies the uses that may be allowed in each area
                    neighborhood. Based on the land use designations in Table
                    2-3, the specific plan will provide further details on develop-
                    ment standards for each neighborhood. This classification sys-
                    tem would use clear terminology to define and further describe
                    allowable uses. The classification system will employ up-to-
                    date terminology and an appropriate combination of specific
                    and generic land use types, instead of a lengthy “encyclopedic”
                    list of allowed uses that can quickly become obsolete. Both the
                    land use classification system and the uses allowed within the
                    various neighborhoods will provide for an overall mixed-use
                    development.
                 ♦  General Site Planning and Development Standards. These
                    standards will specify the requirements that would be applied
                    to all development and land uses regardless of the applicable
                    land use designation. These would address, as appropriate, site
                    access requirements and entry statements; energy efficiency;
                    fences, walls, soundwalls, hedges, buffers, and other screening;
                    noise regulations; outdoor lighting standards; performance
                    standards (e.g. air quality, glare, vibration, etc.), underground-
                    ing of utilities; and other similar topics. The City may require
                    the application of form-based zoning principles within a village
                    area.
                 ♦  Development Standards. Development standards for each
                    land use designation (e.g. building forms, design objectives,
                    land use objectives, height limitations, setback requirements,

LAND USE ELEMENT
               site coverage requirements, etc.) will be organized in tables and
               graphically illustrated wherever possible. Development stand-
               ards shall be implemented through the application of form-
               based zoning principles.
           ♦   Housing Mix. The specific plan will discuss the proposed
               mix of housing types within the village. In keeping with the
               City's Housing Element, affordable housing requirements and
               bonus density provisions and related incentives will be incorpo-
               rated as appropriate. A key to the housing component will be
               to incorporate a mix of housing types (as specified elsewhere in
               this section), and to provide phasing mechanisms that ensure to
               the City the development of this housing mix as a part of each
               phase of the project. For example, it will be undesirable to de-
               velop a village that leaves the majority of high density devel-
               opment (VHDR designations) to the final phases in the plan.
           The Design Framework will provide detailed design guidelines that
           will be used as the specific plan is implemented/developed. The
           purpose of these guidelines will be to establish the expected level
           of design within the village while still maintaining project flexibility
           and innovation. The objective of this framework is not to dictate
           a specific design, but to establish design expectations.
           The design guidelines provided will be illustrated to help explain
           the intent and expectations. This part of the Specific Plan will also
           incorporate detailed landscaping standards, including specific re-
           quirements for preliminary and final landscape plan submittal and
           review.
           The Design Framework will also provide guidance on the integra-
           tion of the streetscape into the overall project design. The frame-
           work will define building type requirements of each neighborhood
           and define how buildings address the street and interact with pub-
           lic improvements and the public rights-of-way to define the overall
           character of the streetscape (e.g. new urbanism principles and
           smart growth concepts). Design standards shall be implemented
           through the application of form-based zoning principles.

                 The Circulation Framework will include the proposed circulation
                 network, system elements, design standards, and system phasing.
                 This framework will address all components of the circulation sys-
                 tem, including vehicular traffic, bicycles, pedestrian movement,
                 and transit. This component will also address parking and loading
                 standards if different from the standard City requirements.
                 The Infrastructure/Public Facilities Framework will cover infra-
                 structure requirements (water, sewer, storm drainage, electricity,
                 natural gas, and communications) as well as parkland, schools, and
                 other public facilities. For infrastructure, the framework will ad-
                 dress the proposed trunk infrastructure system improvements and
                 system phasing necessary to support implementation of the land
                 use plan.
    LU-P9.2     Village Components. The City shall ensure that each village con-
                tains a mix of land use types. The following components will be
                required in each Village specific plan. The land uses allowed in
                each component are shown on Table 2-3.

                 ♦   Village Center. The Village Center is the heart of the village,
                     containing a mix of neighborhood commercial, office, medium
                     and high density residential, park/open space land, and public
                     uses. The commercial component could include uses such as a
                     supermarket, retail shops, restaurants, service commercial, and
                     entertainment. Office and residential uses can be mixed in with

LAND USE ELEMENT
              the commercial core as a second floor element. Other village-
              serving uses, such as a community center, day care center, fire
              station, and other similar uses are encouraged to locate in the
              Village Center.
              The overall village should be designed so that the Village Cen-
              ter is the focal point for transit, pedestrian, and bicycle travel.
            CRITERIA
            ♦ The Village Center will be located within the interior of the village and will
              not have direct access from roadways along the exterior of the village.
            ♦ The Village Center will be located along or in close proximity to a primary
              arterial street in the village to maximize access options, visibility, and transit
              orientation.
            ♦ The Village Center will be located only on one side of the arterial and shall
              incorporate design measures emphasizing pedestrian, bicycle, and public
              transit movements, convenience, and priority.
            ♦ Special consideration shall be given to sidewalk widths, planter strips, street
              furniture, automobile travel lane widths, neck-downs, curb radii, pedestrian
              crossing treatments, traffic-calming, and other enhancements.
            ♦ Each Village Center will have buildings that front directly on wide sidewalks
              with suitable deciduous trees on a regular spacing that will provide full can-
              opy shade at maturity. Off-street parking is encouraged to be located be-
              hind primary buildings. Where off-street parking abuts a public street, land-
              scape and other elements shall be provided to minimize visual impacts to
              the streetscape, and designated pedestrian access points shall be included to
              the primary buildings. On-street parking (diagonal and/or parallel) is en-
              couraged and may count towards the overall Village Center parking re-
              quirement.
            ♦ The Village Center will maximize pedestrian connectivity to parks, open
              space, and other public or quasi-public amenities.
            ♦ The Village Center will have a mix of compatible uses including residential,
              retail, business services, and/or public quasi-public services. The Village
              Center will allow for a mix in both a horizontal and vertical integration.
            ♦ Each Village Center will have unique identifying features such as paving,
              street furniture/amenities, lighting, and materials of construction that are
              used in a thematic manner throughout the village to create a unique sense
              of place.

                                                                 LAND USE ELEMENT
                CRITERIA
                ♦ Each Village shall utilize a form based zoning criteria to direct development
                  within the village. Within the Village Center, these criteria will allow for this
                  mix of compatible uses and allow flexibility to respond to evolving market
                  conditions over the life of the Village Center.
                ♦ The Village Center will not be located at an intersection of two or more
                  arterial streets.
                ♦ The Village Center will be located to take advantage of transit opportunities.
                ♦ Every Village must have a Village Center. Villages can have more than one
                  Village Center, but at least one center per 10,000 population is required.
                ♦  Village Center Neighborhoods. The Village Center Neigh-
                   borhoods will contain a mix of housing types and densities
                   (primarily VMDR and VHDR), but given the proximity of
                   these neighborhoods to the Village Center, this area will have
                   the highest overall residential density in the village. Profession-
                   al office uses (VBP designation) are allowed as the bottom
                   floor of mixed use buildings with a residential component.
                   From a design standpoint, these neighborhoods will focus on
                   pedestrian and bicycle circulation that provides easy access to
                   the Village Center. Roadways in the neighborhoods should
                   have a traditional grid system of streets, creating a formalized
                   structure. The streetscape will include a landscaped parkway
                   adjacent to curbs with landscaping that will provide a street
                   canopy.
                   Each neighborhood should contain small parks (neighborhood
                   and pocket parks), and small plazas that create neighborhood
                   amenities and a sense of place in the neighborhoods.
                CRITERIA
                ♦ Village Center neighborhoods will be located to surround the Village Cen-
                  ter.
                ♦ These neighborhoods should typically be within a ¼-mile (walking) distance
                  of the Village Center.
CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                             2-41

LAND USE ELEMENT
              ♦  Outer Village Neighborhoods. The Outer Village Neigh-
                 borhoods shall contain a mix of housing types and densities,
                 but residential uses will be dominated by VLDR uses. These
                 neighborhoods will also be used for land uses that will have a
                 higher dependence on automobile traffic, such as schools,
                 community parks, and other institutional and public land uses.
                 Land uses that are to serve both the Village Center Neighbor-
                 hoods and Outer Village Neighborhoods (such as schools)
                 should be located near the boundary of the two areas.
                 The design of these neighborhoods can have a more relaxed,
                 informal character. Each neighborhood should be organized
                 around a Neighborhood Center. The Neighborhood Center
                 can be comprised of a neighborhood park, elementary school,
                 and/or public facilities such as fire stations and libraries. When
                 present in a neighborhood, these facilities should be collocated
                 to the extent possible and located near the center of the neigh-
                 borhood. Pedestrian and bicycle trails shall be designed to
                 connect residential areas into the neighborhood center.
              CRITERIA
              ♦ The largest area within a village. These areas lie outside and adjacent to the
                 Village Center Neighborhoods.
              ♦  Transitional Neighborhoods. In some cases, villages may be
                 developed adjacent to sensitive areas such as environmentally
                 sensitive areas, agricultural areas, or rural areas. These neigh-
                 borhoods should reflect lower intensity residential uses that
                 provide a transition to the adjacent sensitive areas.
                 From a design standpoint, these neighborhoods should be de-
                 veloped as neighborhoods with a distinctly rural flavor.
              CRITERIA
              ♦ Neighborhood areas developed adjacent to sensitive areas such as environ-
                 mentally sensitive areas, agricultural areas, or rural areas.
     LU-P9.3 Village Land Use Mixes. The City shall ensure that each village
             area maintains a mix of residential types and densities, and that the

                 The above table shows targeted land use percentages. The specific
                 plans will define the exact land uses based on site-specific infor-
                 mation (e.g. topography, wetlands, and floodplains).
    LU-P9.4     Village Land Use Design. The City will look at the following de-
                sign concepts in the village areas:
                 ♦   Provide a variety of transportation choices.
                 ♦   Offer housing choices and opportunities.
                 ♦    Take advantage of compact development
                 ♦   Mixed land uses.
                 ♦   Preserve open space and natural beauty through natural re-
                     sources conservation, and preserve farmland in the surround-
                     ing unincorporated areas through design measures designed to
                     avoid land use conflicts.
                 ♦   Encourage distinctive, attractive communities with quality de-
                     sign.
                 ♦    Incorporate park and open space areas within the Village Cen-
                     ter.
                 ♦   A neighborhood commercial center should complement other
                     community areas within the Village Center.
CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                  2-43

LAND USE ELEMENT
               ♦   The Village Center shall provide a convenient hub for access-
                   ing transit services, and be supported by adequate parking and
                   trail access.
     LU-P9.5  Connectivity. The City shall require that new villages provide
              connectivity to the developed portions of the city. This connectivi-
              ty shall be in the form of roadways, transit connections, and bicycle
              and pedestrian linkages.
     LU-P9.6  Village Roadways. The City shall require that village roadways
              are designed to provide redundant connections to arterials in order
              to reduce their size, speed, travel times, and congestion.
     LU-P9.7  Roads Support Adjacent Land Use. The City shall require that
              road sizes reflect both their transportation and land use function.
              Road design and speed shall support village and neighborhood res-
              idential and commercial activities.
     LU-P9.8  Shared Parking. The City shall require parking for commercial
              portions of neighborhood centers to be shared among uses and
              have connected driveways, curb cuts, and pedestrian connections.
     LU-P9.9  Infrastructure Master Plans. The City shall require that new vil-
              lage development comply with the City's adopted infrastructure
              master plans and provide fair-share contributions towards existing
              and future improvements necessary to serve the development. If
              developments vary in intensity and distribution from that assumed
              in the existing infrastructure master plans, the City master plans
              shall be updated and approved with that development.
     LU-P9.10 Community Center. The City shall investigate providing a com-
              munity center in one of the village areas. The community center
              will provide common meeting space and recreational amenities for
              village residents and should be integrated with a park and/or
              school in the Village Center.
     LU-P9.11 Open Space. Within each village or specific plan area, the City

3 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION ELEMENT
  A. Background Information
  Transportation is the process by which people and goods move within, to and from
  the community. The ability to provide efficient and effective transportation services
  is one of the major determinants of the direction of growth and the physical form
  for the City of Tulare and the San Joaquin Valley. The community’s livability de-
  pends on a safe, efficient, and environmentally sustainable transportation system.
  Intertwined with land use and environmental implications, the city’s mobility net-
  work must be planned to optimize transportation choices and innovative community
  designs.
  This Transportation and Circulation Element is based on the following guiding prin-
  ciples:
  CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                  3-1

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION ELEMENT
 ♦ Local focus, regional perspective. Transportation is both a local and a region-
    al issue. Effective improvements to the transportation system depend on the
    multi­ jurisdictional cooperative efforts of multiple agencies beyond the City of
    Tulare, such as the State of California, the Tulare County Association of Gov-
    ernments, Tulare County, the regional transit providers, and adjacent cities.
 ♦ Improve safety and capacity of transportation facilities and implement a
    plan for enhancement. The city should focus on increasing the capacity of fa-
    cilities to improve mobility and reduce congestion, while protecting environmen-
    tal resources and fostering economic vitality. In addition gateway facilities, such
    as Highway 99, State Route 137, State Route 63, the “J”/”K” Street corridor, and
    other major thoroughfares should have featured identities. Improvements to
    these facilities should incorporate distinctive architecture and landscaping, along
    with state-of-the-art technologies. As one of the primary thoroughfares through
    the City of Tulare and other San Joaquin Valley communities, Highway 99
    should be a safe and efficient transportation route.
 ♦ Improve goods movement infrastructure and trade. Infrastructure should be
    improved to increase economic vitality, safety, and mobility while decreasing
    congestion and air quality issues.
 ♦ Promote the development of a multi­modal system. Transportation is both
    a local and a regional issue. Effective improvements to the transportation system
    depend on the multi-jurisdictional cooperative efforts of multiple agencies be-
    yond the City of Tulare. Land use and transportation are inextricably connected.
    They must be coordinated so that future development and transportation ser-
    vices will be balanced with each other. The land use and transportation policies
    in this Plan reflect this relationship.
 ♦ Support and complement regional initiatives. Policies for the City of Tulare
    should support the land use policies delineated in regional plans, such as the Re-
    gional Blueprint Plan. Collaborating with other regional entities will seek to min-
    imize land use changes encouraged by transportation infrastructure decisions.
 ♦ Link transportation improvements to economic development. Economic
    development should be planned in conjunction with transportation investments.
    The dominance of the agricultural sector and the need for the development of
    additional economic drivers provides incentives for the expansion of the regional
    economic base. Improving the vitality of region requires the development of

1. Key Terms
 ♦ Average Daily Traffic (ADT) or Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT).
    ADT volume is based upon traffic counts that record the number of vehicles
    (cars and trucks) that travel on the roadway on a typical weekday (Tuesday,
    Wednesday, or Thursday). These counts are typically conducted by using “hose”
    or “tube” counts, but can also be collected utilizing more advanced sensor devic-
    es. Both of these methods have the ability to collect heavy-duty vehicle classifi-
    cation counts and directional information. In this report, the total ADT is used
    for the LOS analysis. It should be noted that in the transportation industry ADT
    is an acronym that is interchangeable with AADT, or the annual average daily
    traffic.
 ♦ Class I Bikeway (Bicycle Path). Provides for bicycle travel on a paved right of
    way completely separated from any street or highway. This type of bike path is
    often located along waterfronts, railroad right-of-ways (active and abandoned),
    through parks, or stream or river channels.

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION ELEMENT
 ♦ Class II Bikeway (Bicycle Lane). Provides dedicated on-street space for bicy-
    clists (usually to the right of travel lanes) delineated by a white stripe, signs, and
    pavement markings.
 ♦ Class III Bikeway (Bicycle Route). Provides shared-lane use with motor ve-
    hicle traffic. As defined by Caltrans, Class III bicycle routes have signs but no
    striping and should direct cyclists to the superior through route. To achieve the
    best conditions for bicyclists and motorists to share the lane, a wide curb lane
    should be considered. Class III bike routes provide the least benefit to bicyclists
    and should be used in limited situations, such as to fill short gaps along Bike
    Lane corridors where inadequate space exists for short distances, or along resi-
    dential streets with low speeds and low traffic volumes.
 ♦ Functional Classification System. Functional Classification System identifies
    existing roadway classification based upon number of lanes, capacity, location,
    etc. Typically, functional classification refers to collectors, arterials, expressways,
    freeways, etc.
 ♦ Highway Capacity Manual 2000 (HCM). The Transportation Research
    Board’s (TRB) HCM provides a collection of state-of-the-art techniques for es-
    timating the capacity and determining the LOS for transportation facilities for in-
    tersections, roads, public transit, etc. Tulare County Association of Govern-
    ments (TCAG) has adopted the HCM methodology.
 ♦ Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE). ITE publishes the Trip Gener-
    ation Manual (7th Edition) which is used to estimate trip generation for many
    categories of residential and non­residential land uses.
 ♦ Level of Service (LOS). LOS is used to measure the operating conditions of an
    intersection or a roadway segment by considering many factors including traffic
    volume and capacity. LOS is a qualitative measure of traffic operating condi-
    tions, whereby a letter grade “A” through “F” is assigned to an intersection or
    roadway segment representing progressively worsening traffic conditions.
 ♦ Peak Hour. That hour during which the maximum amount of travel occurs. It
    is typically specified as the peak one hour of traffic experience during the morn-
    ing peak hour (between 7:00 and 9:00a.m.) and/or the afternoon peak hour (be-
    tween 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.). In some of the agricultural areas in the county, the
    peak hour may be earlier than the times above due to seasonal factors such as
    harvesting, picking, etc. Peak hour roadway counts are usually used in analyzing
    intersections and interchanges.

 ♦ State Routes (SR). State Routes are highway facilities owned and operated by
     the State of California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).
 ♦ Transit Hubs. Major transfer points where various transportation modes (e.g.,
     rail, bus, bicycle, pedestrians, and automobiles) facilitate passenger transfers be-
     tween the modes. These transfer points are on a fixed schedule as opposed to
     “major transfer points” which may be scheduled based on headways. These
     types of facilities typically have a building or other structure associated with them
     to provide travelers with schedules and other related information.
 ♦ Transportation Demand Management (TDM). Programs to reduce travel
     demand and improve vehicle flow by encouraging mode shifts (i.e., bus, carpool,
     rapid transit, bicycle, etc.), and by applying operational efficiencies (i.e., signal
     synchronization, bus turnouts, bicycle lanes, etc.) to highway systems. TDM is
     intended to emphasize improved transportation systems efficiencies rather than
     road expansion or construction.
 ♦ Transportation Systems Management (TSM). Programs to improve conges-
     tion, traffic flow, and efficiency by utilizing technology and road improvements
     such as signal timing, striping, signage, and turning lanes.
 ♦ Viper/TP+. Viper/TP+ transportation planning software package used to de-
     velop daily traffic forecasts.
2. Circulation Diagram and Standards
The City’s roadway network is designed to support the development of the land uses
shown on the 2035 Land Use Diagram and to reserve adequate rights-of-way for
development beyond 2035. The General Plan seeks to maintain the city’s relatively
free-flowing traffic conditions while allowing for future growth. The City’s most
important policy tool for ensuring upgrading and maintenance of its roadways to
provide for effective and efficient traffic movement is the Circulation Diagram and
its associated standards.
3. Circulation Diagram
The Circulation Diagram depicts the proposed circulation system needed to support
development under the Land Use Diagram. This circulation system is represented
on the diagram as a set of roadway classifications that have been developed to guide
Tulare’s long-range planning and programming. Roadways are systematically classi-
fied based on the linkages they provide and their function, both of which reflect their
importance to the land use pattern and traveler.
CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                        3-5

4. Roadway Classification
Roadways serve two functions: traffic movement, or mobility, and accessibility to
provide mobility and to provide property access. High and constant speeds are de-
sirable for mobility, while low speeds are more desirable for property access, particu-
larly in residential areas. A functional classification system provides for specialization
in meeting the access and mobility requirements of the development permitted under
the General Plan. Local streets emphasize property access; arterials emphasize high
mobility for through-traffic; and collectors attempt to achieve a balance between
both functions. The following roadway classifications are used in the City of Tulare:
 ♦ State Freeways and Highway. Freeways and highways provide for high vol-
     ume, high speed, and interregional travel with limited local access via widely
     spaced interchanges (1-mile minimum). Freeway access is limited to designated
     interchanges; no direct access to adjacent land uses is permitted for any use.
 ♦ Expressways. Expressways are highways that carry large volumes of traffic rela-
     tively long distances within or through an urban or rural area. They also often
     serve considerable local traffic traveling short distances. Intersections along
     these expressways can be at grade to accommodate traffic entering and exiting
     the roadway. Expressways should be continuous through the urban or rural
     community they serve and link to arterial routes. The designated right-of­ way
     for expressways varies dependent upon the needs of the specific facility. Addi-
     tional right-of­ way may be required at some intersection.
 ♦ Arterials (Major Arterials and Arterials). Arterials are intended to: (a) provide
     a high level of capacity in selected high volume corridors; (b) provide connec-
     tions between the freeway system and arterials and collector streets via inter-
     changes; and (c) provide access to major traffic generators. Arterials are moder-
     ate-speed through streets with average daily traffic over 10,000 vehicles per day.
     Access to an arterial should be primarily accomplished through primary collector
     and secondary collector streets. Limited direct access to industrial, commercial,
     and high density residential uses is permitted as approved through site plan re-
     view.
 ♦ Industrial Collector Streets. Industrial collector streets are intended to transfer
     truck traffic in industrial and heavy commercial areas to an arterial. Average daily
     traffic on a primary collector will usually average less than 10,000 vehicles per
     day. Direct access for commercial and industrial uses and developments should
     be permitted consistent with adopted improvement standards.

                      TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION ELEMENT
 ♦ Primary Collector Streets. Primary collector streets are intended to transfer
   traffic from collector and minor streets to an arterial. Average daily traffic on a
   primary collector will usually average less than 10,000 vehicles per day. Primary
   collector streets should provide direct linkages to neighborhood shopping areas.
   Primary collector intersections should be staggered to discourage their use as
   through access ways by-passing arterials. Direct access for low density residen-
   tial, commercial, and industrial uses and developments should be permitted con-
   sistent with adopted improvement standards.
 ♦ Secondary Collector Streets. Secondary collector streets are intended to carry
   moderate volumes of traffic from local streets to primary collectors and arterials.
   Average daily traffic on a secondary collector normally averages 500-4,000 vehi-
   cles per day. Direct access should be permitted consistent with approved stand-
   ards. Secondary collector streets are not delineated on the Circulation Diagram;
   instead they are located through the development and subdivision approval pro-
   cess.
 ♦ Local Streets. Local streets are intended as low capacity streets primarily serv-
   ing low-density residential uses. Average daily traffic on a local street averages
   less than 1,000 vehicles per day, although most local streets average less than 500
   vehicles per day. Direct access to local streets is permitted consistent with
   adopted improvement standards. Local streets are not delineated on the Circula-
   tion Diagram; instead, they are designated through the development and subdivi-
   sion approval process.
5. Roadway Standards
 ♦ State Freeways and Highways. Freeway and highway right-of-way widths and
   pavement standards in Tulare are established by the State of California Depart-
   ment of Transportation (Caltrans). State Highways 63, 99 and 137 all pass
   through the City of Tulare. All three are projected to play an important role in
   future local and regional travel. State Highway 63 (Mooney Boulevard) provides
   a critical intercity connection between Tulare and Visalia. The upgrading of this
   facility to six lanes is anticipated in the future by both the state’s Route Concept
   Report and the Tulare County Regional Transportation Plan adopted by the Tu-
   lare County Association of Governments.

Local Streets
All other existing or planned local streets in the Tulare Planning Area are deemed to be local
streets.
The most critical state highway with respect to local Tulare traffic is State Highway
137 (Tulare Avenue). Anticipated increases in traffic between downtown Tulare and
the eastern urban boundary will necessitate the expansion of this major east west
facility.
 ♦ Major Arterials. Major arterials provide high volume connections between
     freeways and collectors and are typically designed to accommodate up to eight
     through traffic lanes, a parking/transit/right turn lane, and a center median with
     dual left turn lanes at intersections. The right-of-way for these streets should
     range from 84 to 146 feet. A driveway spacing of at least 300 feet should be
     maintained wherever possible. Arterials are designated throughout the Planning
     Area, generally creating a one-mile grid pattern.
CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                                   3-9

TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION ELEMENT
 ♦ Arterials. Standard arterials provide for moderate volumes, moderate speeds
    over moderate distances with access to collectors at ½-mile intervals, and a lim-
    ited number of local streets. Arterials also provide access to major traffic genera-
    tors at ¼-mile intervals. Arterials are generally designed with two through lanes
    on each direction with either on-street parking or no parking with left turn lanes.
    Arterials are subject to the same access standards as major arterials.
 ♦ Primary, Secondary, and Industrial Collectors. Primary collector streets are
    designated throughout the Planning Area, generally creating a ½- to ¼-mile grid
    pattern. Both primary and secondary collectors generally have a two-lane con-
    figuration with a right-of-way of 64 to 84 feet. Industrial collectors are designat-
    ed in areas expected to generate a higher than normal percentage of truck traffic.
    They have a two-lane configuration and a right-of-way width of 68 to 72 feet to
    accommodate truck parking and turning movements.
B. Goals, Policies and Actions
1. General
Goal TR-1        To develop an integrated transportation system that provides
                 for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods.
     Policies
     TR-P1.1       Integrated Transportation System. The City shall continue to
                   work cooperatively with the various local, state, and federal trans-
                   portation agencies (i.e., Caltrans, TCAG, Tulare County, and re-
                   gional transit providers) to maintain a multi­modal transportation
                   system that is well-integrated and interconnected in terms of ser-
                   vice, scheduling, and capacity, and that effectively accommodates
                   planned land uses and related transportation needs, and that pro-
                   motes the safe movement of people and goods and the efficient
                   use of limited public resources.
     TR-P1.2       Road Improvements. Land use planning and transportation deci-
                   sions shall be correlated so that planned land uses are supported by
                   the appropriate types of circulation service, levels of service, and
                   the timing of transportation improvements. Wherever practicable,

4 CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
  A. Background Information
  Tulare’s natural resources (water resources, biological resources, and open space),
  agricultural resources, cultural and archaeological resources, and parks and recreation
  facilities are important elements in the quality of life for Tulare’s residents. The pur-
  pose of the Conservation and Open Space Element is to protect and enhance these
  resources as the City continues to urbanize and expand outward. The General Plan
  seeks to balance the need for growth with the need for the conservation and en-
  hancement of the area’s natural and cultural resources, frequently in cooperation
  with other agencies.
  This Conservation and Open Space Element is based on the following guiding prin-
  ciples:
  CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                      4-1

CONSERVATION AND OPEN SPACE ELEMENT
 ♦ Design and plan new development to reduce impacts to natural and cul-
    tural resources. The urban form and design of developments plays an im-
    portant role in sustaining the natural environment. To protect these areas from
    the adverse impacts of urbanization, the interconnectedness of natural systems is
    recognized.
 ♦ Ensure a reliable, adequate water supply to sustain a high quality of life,
    while protecting and enhancing the environment. Growth and expansion of
    the City of Tulare will require additional water resources to support all land uses
    while maintaining environmental sustainability. In addition, the Elk Bayou is a
    valuable natural asset that needs to be protected.
 ♦ Support the continued preservation of agricultural resources. Agriculture is
    a vital component of the economic base for the City of Tulare. Maintaining the
    viability and sustainability of this economic sector will be critical to both the city
    and the surrounding region. As one of the most industry driven industries within
    the region, the development, adoption and integration of new technologies pro-
    vides opportunities for expansion in regional economic drivers.
 ♦ Protect significant cultural and archaeological resources to ensure the
    preservation and maintenance of Tulare’s heritage. Cultural resources pro-
    vide the historical context for the city. The authentic remnants of the city’s cul-
    tural legacy provide an irreplaceable tangible link to the past. These assets serve
    as material anchors and their preservation is vital to connecting the present day
    community with its historical roots.
 ♦ Provide ample recreation opportunities for all residents. As Tulare contin-
    ues to grow, it will be vital to the quality of life in the City to ensure that park-
    land is available for all residents. The location of existing and future parks will
    be essential to the vitality of neighborhoods. In addition, the types of parks that
    are available to residents can be a key to resident’s happiness and well-being.
    Setting up an integrated system of local, community, regional, and specialized
    parks or facilities can provide residents with easy access to recreation choices.
 ♦ Promote efficient use of energy resources, including the adoption of clean,
    renewable energy technologies to ensure an adequate and reliable supply,
    economic growth, and improved air quality. Increasing the energy efficiency
    of buildings within the city will serve to conserve vital resources and promote re-
    sponsible stewardship. The land resources and agrarian strengths of the agricul-

2. Regulatory Setting
Regulation of air pollution is achieved through both national and state ambient air
quality standards and through emissions limits on individual sources of air pollutants.
Local Air Quality Management Districts (AQMDs) and Air Pollution Control Dis-
tricts (APCDs) are responsible for demonstrating attainment with state air quality
standards through the adoption and enforcement of Attainment Plans.
a. Federal
The Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA) requires the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (U.S. EPA) to identify National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
(national standards) to protect public health and welfare. National standards have
been established for ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, res-
pirable particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), and lead. These pollutants are called
CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                                             6-3

AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
“criteria” air pollutants because standards have been established for each of them to
meet specific public health and welfare criteria set forth in the FCAA. California has
adopted more stringent ambient air quality standards for the criteria air pollutants
(referred to as State Ambient Air Quality Standards, or state standards) and has
adopted air quality standards for some pollutants for which there is no· correspond-
ing national standard. Table 6-1 presents current national and state ambient air qual-
ity standards and provides a brief discussion of the related health effects and princi-
pal sources for each pollutant.
Pursuant to the 1990 Federal Clean Air Act Amendments) FCAAA), the U.S. EPA
classifies air basins (or portions thereof) as “attainment” or “nonattainment” for
each criteria air pollutant, based on whether or not the NAAQS had been achieved.
Table 6-2 shows the current attainment status of the project area.
The FCAA required each state to prepare an air quality control plan referred to as
the State Implementation Plan (SIP). The FCAA added requirements for states con-
taining areas that violate the NAAQS to revise their SIP’s to incorporate additional
control measures to reduce air pollution. The SIP is a living document that is peri-
odically modified to reflect the latest emissions, inventories, planning documents,
and rules and regulations of air basins as reported by the agencies with jurisdiction
over them. The U.S. EPA has responsibility to review all state SIPs to determine if
they conform to the mandates of the FCAAA and will achieve air quality goals when
implemented. If the U.S. EPA determines a SIP to be inadequate, it may prepare a
Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for the nonattainment area and may impose addi-
tional control measures. Failure to submit an approvable DIP or to implement the
plan within mandated timeframes can result in sanctions being applied to transporta-
tion funding and stationary air pollution sources in the air basin.
Regulation of Toxic Air Contaminants (TACs), termed Hazardous Air Pollutants
(HAPs) under federal regulations, is achieved through federal, State and local con-
trols on individual sources. The SN APCD regulates toxic air contaminants in Dis-
trict Policies 1905 and 1910, and in regulation VII. The district recognizes all TAC’s
as defined by the State. The district recognizes federal Maximum Achievable Con-
trol Technology {MACT) standards for HAP’s in District Rule 4002. The 1977
Clean Air Act Amendments required by the U.S. EPA to identify National Emission
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) to protect public health and
welfare. These substances include certain volatile organic chemicals, pesticides,
herbicides, and radionuclides that present a tangible hazard, based on scientific stud-

ies of exposure to humans and other mammals. Although these studies indicate tan-
gible health hazards to humans and other animals, the magnitude of the hazards are
unknown.
b. State
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) manages air quality, regulates mobile
emissions sources, and oversees the activities of county and regional Air Pollution
Control Districts and Air Quality Management Districts. CARB regulates local air
quality indirectly by establishing state ambient air quality standards and vehicle emis-
sions and fuel standards, and by conducting research, planning, and coordinating
activities. California has adopted ambient standards that are more stringent than the
federal standards for some criteria air pollutants (e.g., PM10, daily and annual average
standards), the California Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS), pursuant to
California Health and Safety Code (CH&SC) [39606(b)]. The State standards are
shown in Table 6-1.
Under the California Clean Air Act (CCAA), the patterned after the FCAA, areas
have been designated as attainment of nonattainment with respect to the state stand-
ards (see Table 6-2). The State must verify compliance with the District’s plan for
achieving attainment before inclusion in the SIP. Once the SIP is complete, EPA
must verify the SIP’s compliance with the FCAA. If EPA determines the SIP to be
inadequate in verifying compliance, EPA may prepare a FIP, as described earlier in
this section.
California State law defines toxic air contaminants (TACs) as air pollutants having
carcinogenic effects. The State Air Toxics Program was established in 1983 under
Assembly Bill (AB) 1807 (Tanner). A total of 243 substances have been designated
TACs under California law; they include the 189 (federal) hazardous air pollutants
(HAP’s) adopted in accordance with AB 2728. The Air Toxics “Hot Spots” Infor-
mation and Assessment Act of 1987 (AB 2588) seeks to identify and evaluate risk
from air toxics sources; AB 2588 does not regulate air toxics emissions. Toxic air
contaminant emissions from individual facilities are quantified and prioritized.
“High priority” facilities are required to perform a health risk assessment and, if spe-
cific thresholds are violated, are required to communicate the results to the public in
the form of notices and public meetings. Depending on the risk levels, emitting fa-
cilities are required to implement varying levels of risk reduction measures. San
Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD) implements AB 2588, and
is responsible for prioritizing facilities that emit air toxics.

AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
In August of 1998, CARB identified particulate emissions from diesel-fueled engines
(diesel particulate matter, or DPM) as TACs. CARB developed the Risk Reduction
Plan to Reduce Particulate Matter Emissions from Diesel-Fueled Engines and Vehicles (CARB,
2000). The document represents proposals to reduce diesel particulate emissions,
with the goal to reduce emissions and the associated health risk by 75 percent in
2010 and by 85 percent in 2020. The program aims to require the use of state-of-
the-art catalyzed diesel particulate filters and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel on diesel-
fueled engines.
CARB recently published the Air Quality and Land Use Handbook: A Community Health
Perspective (CARB, 2005). The primary goal in developing the handbook was to pro-
vide information that will keep California’s children and other vulnerable populations
out of harm’s way with respect to nearby sources of air pollution. The handbook
highlights recent studies that have shown that public exposure to air pollution can be
substantially elevated near freeways and certain other facilities. However, the health
risk is greatly reduced with distance. For that reason, CARB provided some general
recommendations aimed at keeping appropriate distances between sources of air
pollution and sensitive land uses, such as residences.
c. Local
The SJVAPCD is the primary local agency responsible for protecting human health
and property from the harmful effects of air pollution in the San Joaquin Valley Air
Basin, and has jurisdiction over most stationary source air quality matters in the
SJVAB, including the NSPS program. The SJVAPCD includes all of Merced, San
Joaquin, Stanislaus, Madera, Fresno, Kings, and Tulare counties, and the Valley por-
tion of Kern County.
The SJVAPCD is responsible for developing attainment plans for the SJV AB, for
inclusion in California’s SIP, as well as establishing and enforcing air pollution con-
trol rules and regulations. The attainment plans must demonstrate compliance with
federal and state ambient air quality standards, and must first be approved by CARB
before inclusion into the SIP. The SJVAPCD regulates, permits, and inspects sta-
tionary sources of air pollution. Among these sources are industrial facilities, gaso-
line stations, auto body shops, MSW landfills and dry cleaners to name a few. While
the state is responsible for emission standards and controlling actual tailpipe emis-
sions from motor vehicles, the SJVAPCD is required to regulate emissions associat-
ed with stationary sources such as agricultural burning and industrial operations. The
SJVAPCD also works with eight local transportation planning agencies to implement

                                                       AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
transportation control measures, and to recommend mitigation measures for new
growth and development designed to reduce the number of cars on the road. The
SJVAPCD promotes the use of cleaner fuels, and funds the number of public and
private agency projects that provide innovative approaches to reducing air pollution
from motor vehicles.
While all criteria pollutants are a concern of the SJVAPCD, a project’s air quality
impacts are considered significant if they would violate any of the State air quality
standards. Ozone precursors, PM10 emissions, and toxic air contaminants are em-
phasized in the review of applications for an Authority to Construct/ Permit to Op-
erate. Federal and State air quality laws also require regions designated as nonat-
tainment to prepare plans that either demonstrate how the region will attain the
standard or that demonstrate reasonable improvement in air quality conditions. As
noted, the SJVAPCD is responsible for developing attainment plans for the SJVAB
for inclusion in California’s SIP.
B. Planning Agenda
The air quality policies that following are designed to provide new requirements to
implement compact growth, increase residential densities and address AB 32, a
greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction plan and Blueprint provisions.
In addition, SB 375 was enacted to implement the goal of reducing GHG emissions
to 1990 levels by 2020. Further implementation measures will be developed through
the Sustainable Communities Strategy and Alternative Planning Strategy. These doc-
uments will be prepared by Tulare County Association of Governments (TCAG)
with assistance from incorporated cities of Tulare County.

              opments to be located, designed, and constructed in a manner that
              would minimize cumulative air quality impacts. Developers shall
              be required to present alternatives that reduce air emissions and
              enhance, rather than harm, the environment.
    AQ-P1.3   Air Quality Land Use Compatibility. The City shall consider
              industrial or other developments which are likely to cause undesir-
              able air pollution with regard to wind direction and circulation in an
              effort to alleviate effects upon sensitive receptors.
    AQ-P1.4   Health Risk Assessment. The City shall require a Health Risk
              Assessment where toxic air contaminants from industrial or service
              commercial projects may affect nearby sensitive receptors.
    AQ-P1.5   CEQA Compliance. The City shall ensure that air quality impacts
              identified during the CEQA review process are fairly and consist-

AIR QUALITY ELEMENT
     AQ-P2.3 Transportation and Air Quality. When developing the regional
             transportation system, the City shall work with TCAG to compre-
             hensively study methods of transportation which may contribute to
             a reduction in air pollution in the City of Tulare. Some possible al-
             ternatives that should be studied are:
             ♦ Public transportation such as buses and light rail, to serve be-
                tween communities of the valley, publicly subsidized if feasible.
             ♦ Intermodal public transit such as buses provided with bicycle
                racks, bicycle parking at bus stations, and park and ride facilities.
             ♦ Community bus or other public transportation systems, such as
                cycling or walking trails, with particular attention to high-density
                areas.
     AQ-P2.4 Transportation Management Associations. The City shall en-
             courage commercial, retail, and residential developments to partici-
             pate in or create transportation management associations that can
             assist in the reduction of pollutants through provisions to support
             carpooling, alternative transportation, etc.

7 NOISE ELEMENT
  A. Background Information
  1. Purpose and Scope
  The Noise Element of the General Plan is a planning document which is intended to
  provide a policy framework within which potential noise impacts may be addressed
  in the project review and long range planning processes. It is intended that this El-
  ement be the adopted Noise Element of the Tulare County Genera1 Plan, in con-
  formance with Section 65302(f) of the California Government Code.
  It is intended that the noise exposure information developed during the preparation
  of the Noise Element be utilized by Tulare County to implement the requirements of
  California Administrative Code (CAC) Title 24 by providing a basis for determining
  where noise-related land use conflicts presently exist or may occur in the future. It is
  also intended that the noise exposure in formation developed for the Noise Element
  CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035                                                    7-1
NOISE ELEMENT
be used to provide baseline levels for use in the development and enforcement of a
local noise control ordinance should the County determine that adoption of such an
ordinance is appropriate at some point. A local noise control ordinance may be used
to address noise levels generated by local industrial, commercial, agricultural, and
residential uses, which are not regulated by federal or state noise level standards.
The regulation of noise sources such as traffic on public roadways, railroad opera-
tions, and aircraft operations is preempted by existing federal and/or State regula-
tions, meaning that such sources generally may not be addressed by a local noise
control ordinance.
The Noise Element is a proactive document which is directed at minimizing future
noise conflicts, whereas a noise ordinance is a reactive document which is directed at
resolving existing noise conflicts. The adopted policies of the Noise Element should
generally be consistent with the noise level standards of a local noise control ordi-
nance (if one is adopted) to achieve consistency in the implementation of noise con-
trol programs, and to provide local industry with design criteria for future develop-
ment or expansion.
According to the Government Code requirements for Noise Elements and to the
California Office of Noise Control (ONC) Guidelines, noise exposure information
should be developed for the following major noise sources:
 ♦ Highways and freeways.
 ♦ Primary arterials and major local streets.
 ♦ Railroad operations.
 ♦ Aircraft and airport operations.
 ♦ Local industrial facilities.
 ♦ Other stationary sources.
Noise-sensitive areas to be considered during the development of noise exposure
information should include areas containing the following noise-sensitive land uses:
 ♦ Residential development.
 ♦ Schools.
 ♦ Hospitals, rest homes, and long-term medical or mental care facilities.
 ♦ Churches.
 ♦ Other uses deemed noise sensitive by the local jurisdiction.

2. Authority
The contents of a Noise Element and the methods used in its preparation have been
determined by the requirements of Section 65302(f) of the California Government
Code and by the “Guidelines for the Preparation and Content of Noise Elements of
the General Plan” adopted and published by the California Office of Noise Control
(ONC) in 1976. The ONC Guidelines require that certain major noise sources and
areas containing noise-sensitive land uses be identified and quantified by preparing
generalized noise exposure contours for current and projected conditions within the
community. Contours may be prepared in terms of either the CNEL or the Ldn,
which are descriptors of tota1 noise exposure at a given location for an annual aver-
age day. CNEL and Ldn are generally considered to be equiva1ent descriptors of the
community noise environment within plus or minus 1.0 dB. Appendix A provides
an explanation of the acoustical terminology used in this document.
a. Relationship to Other Elements of the General Plan
This Noise Element supersedes the previous Noise Element adopted by Tulare
County in 1975. In order to provide for an integrated approach to the noise­ related
aspects of land use compatibility planning countywide, a coordinated approach to
implementing the policies of the Noise Element must be carried out by the County.
This will be especially important in areas of the County which are located within the
urban area boundaries of incorporated cities.
The Noise Element is most related to the Land Use and Circulation Elements of the
General Plan. Its relationship to the Land Use Element is direct, in that the
·implementation of either element has the potential to result in the creation or elimi-
nation of noise conflicts between land uses. The Land Use Element and the Noise
Element should be consistent in order to discourage the ·development of incompat-
ible adjacent land uses, thereby preventing impacts upon noise-sensitive uses and
encroachment upon existing noise-generating facilities.
The Circulation Element is linked to the Noise Element in that traffic routing and
volume directly affect community noise exposure. For example, increased traffic
volume may produce increased noise in a residential area so that noise control
measures are required to provide an acceptable noise environment. Similarly, re-

3. Noise and Its Effects on People
A separate Technical Reference Document has been prepared in support of this
Noise Element which provides discussions of the fundamentals of noise assessment,
.the effects of noise on people, criteria for acceptable noise exposure, and the tech-
niques available for noise control. It is intended that the Technical Reference Doc-
ument serve as a reference for Tulare County during the review of documents or
proposals which refer to the measurement and effects of noise.
B. Existing and Future Noise Environment
1. Overview and Sources
Based on discussions with Tulare County staff, on information provided through
questionnaires completed by the County and on field studies conducted during the
preparation of the Noise Element, it was determined that there are a number of po-
tentially significant sources of community noise within Tulare County. These
sources include traffic on State highways and major County road­ ways, railroad op-
erations, airport operations and industrial, commercial, and agricultural activities.
Figure 7-1 shows the locations of major noise sources selected for study, and for
which generalized Ldn or CNEL contours have been prepared. The Technical Refer-
ence Document includes detailed discussions of the noise levels produced by these
sources.
2. Methods and Noise Exposure Maps
Analytical noise modeling techniques in conjunction with actual field noise level
measurements were used to develop generalized Ldn or LNEL contours for major
sources of noise within the incorporated cities and unincorporated areas of Tulare
County for existing (1986) and future (2010) conditions.
Analytical noise modeling techniques generally make use of source-specific data,
including average levels of activity, hours of operation, seasonal fluctuations, and
average levels of noise from source operations. Analytical methods have been
deve1oped for many envir.onmenta1 noise sources, including roadways, railroad line
operations, railroad yard operations, industrial plant, and aircraft/airport operations.
Such methods will produce reliable results as long as data inputs and assumptions are
valid for the sources being studied. The analytical methods used in the development
of this Element closely follow recommendations made by the State Office of Noise

Control, and included the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Traf-
fic Noise Prediction Model for roadway sources, the Wyle Laboratories method for
determining railroad noise exposure and the Federal Aviation Administration's
(FAA) Integrated Noise Model (INM) for the assessment of aircraft/airport noise
sources. For industrial, commercial, and other stationary sources identified for
study, a combination of source-specific noise level data and accepted calculation
procedures was used to characterize noise emissions based upon operational data
obtained from source operators. The noise exposure information developed during
the preparation of the Noise Element does not include all conceivable sources of
industrial, commercial, or agricultural noise within the County, but rather is a repre-
sentative sampling of typical sources. The noise exposure information developed for
the sources identified for study should be used only as an indicator of potential noise
impacts when other, similar sources are considered.
Noise exposure contours for major sources of noise within Tulare County are con-
tained within Appendix B of this document. It should be noted that these contours
are generally based upon annual average conditions (unless otherwise noted), and are
intended to be representative of “typical” conditions for the types of noise sources
being characterized. It is intended that the noise exposure information presented in
Appendix B be used by Tulare County during the project review and long-range
planning processes to identify areas which are potentially noise-impacted. It should
be noted that site-specific studies would generally indicate that the noise exposure
information presented in Appendix B represents a conservative (worst-case) assess-
ment of noise exposure, and that local topographical features, vegetation or interven-
ing buildings may significantly affect noise exposure at a given receiver location.
3. Community Noise Survey
As required by the Government Code and ONC Guidelines, a community noise
survey was conducted to document noise exposure in areas of the County and the
incorporated cities of the County containing noise-sensitive land uses. Noise moni-
toring sites were selected to be representative of typical conditions in areas where
noise-sensitive land uses are located. A total of 70 monitoring sites were selected, as
shown in Figure 7-2. A combination of short-term and continuous noise monitoring
was used to document existing noise levels at these locations during the month of
November, 1986. At 60 of the community noise survey sites, noise levels were sam-
pled for approximately 15 minutes during each of three periods of the day and night
so that reliable estimates of Ldn could be prepared. The data collected during the
short-term sampling program included the Leq maximum noise level, minimum noise

level and a description of noise sources which were audible at the monitoring sites.
Continuous noise monitoring was conducted at ten of the community noise survey
sites to document fluctuations in noise levels over a typical 24-hour period in areas
which are representative of the different types of noise environments within the
County (urban, small town, rural area, mountain area, etc.). Noise 1evel data
co11ected during continuous monitoring included the Leq, maxi mum noise level, and
the statistical distribution of noise levels for each hour of the sample period. The
hourly fluctuations of noise levels at the sites where continuous noise monitoring
was conducted are depicted in graphic form in the Technical Reference Document.
Noise level data collected during the community noise survey are summarized in
Table 7-1.
The community noise survey results indicate that noise levels in areas containing
noise-sensitive land uses in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of Tulare
County ranged from 29 to 65 dB Ldn. As would be expected, the quietest areas were
those which are removed from major transportation-related noise sources and local
industrial or other major stationary noise sources. Good examples of these quiet
areas are rural valley and mountain residential areas such as Alpaugh, Springville,
Panorama Heights, Johnsondale, and Ponderosa and recreational areas such as Balch
Park. It is anticipated that noise levels in recreational areas would be somewhat
higher than measured during the survey during the summer season, when such areas
receive greater use. The noisier locations monitored during the survey were in areas
located near State highways and major County roadways (Pixley, Earlimart, etc.) or
major industrial noise sources (Lindsay, Site #6). Noise levels in some areas were
higher than would normally be expected, such as in the rural area near Pixley Site
#63), where cotton picking machines were in use during the survey period. Maxi-
mum noise levels observed during the survey were generally caused by local automo-
bile traffic or heavy trucks. Other sources of maximum noise levels included occa-
sional aircraft overflights, railroad operations, barking dogs and nearby industria1,
commercia1, and agricultura1 equipment or machinery. Background noise 1eve1s in
the absence of the above-described sources were caused by distant traffic, wind in
the trees, running water, birds and distant agricultural, industrial or other stationary
noise sources.
In the foothill and mountain areas of Tulare County, background noise levels are
generally very low. Exceptions to this occur near major roadways or along

rivers or streams where running water may be a significant source of sound. One
factor that is difficult to quantify, but is often mentioned by persons who reside in
rural or mountain areas, is the greater expectation for a quiet living environment by
persons who have made the choice to live away from urbanized areas. This factor,
coupled with the quiet existing background noise levels, greatly increases the likeli-
hood that noise from a new noise­ generating land use will be perceived by residents
of these areas as a significant intrusion over existing conditions.
C. Goals, Policies, and Actions
The goals of the Noise Element may be realized by pursuing the policies and imple-
mentation measures outlined in this chapter.
Figure 7-3 is provided as a reference concerning the sensitivity of different 1and uses
to their noise environment. It is intended to illustrate the range of noise levels which
will allow the full range of activities normally associated with a given land use. For
example, exterior noise levels in the range of 50 to 65 dB Ldn (or CNEL) or below
are generally considered acceptable for residential land uses, since these levels will
usually allow normal outdoor and indoor activities such as sleep and communication
to occur without interruption. Industrial facilities, however, can be relatively insensi-
tive to noise and may generally be located in a noise environment of up to 75 dB Ldn
(or CNEL) without significant adverse effects. Specific noise compatibility criteria in
terms of Ldn or CNEL for residentia1 and other noise sensitive 1and uses in Tulare
County are defined in Figure 7-3 of this chapter.
Specific noise level criteria are based upon the recommendations of the State of Cali-
fornia, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, and the results of field studies conducted during the preparation
of this Element.

       made and needed noise insulation features included in the
       design. Conventional construction, but with closed windows,
       and fresh air supply systems or air conditioning will normally
       suffice.
Notes: Consideration in determination of noise compatible land use.
A. Normalized Noise Exposure Information Desired. Where sufficient data exists, evaluate land use suitability
    with respect to a “normalized” value of CNEL or Ldn. Normalized values are obtained by adding or subtract-
    ing the constraints described in Table 7-1 to the measured or calculated value of CNEL or Ldn.
B. Noise Source Characteristics. The land use noise compatibility recommendations should be viewed in rela-
    tion to the specific source of the noise. For example, aircraft and railroad noise is normally made up of high-
    er single noise events than auto traffic but occurs less frequently. Therefore, different sources yielding the
    same composite noise exposure do not necessarily create the same noise environment. The State Aeronautics
    Act uses 675 dB CNEL as the criterion which airports must eventually meet to protect existing residential
    communities from unacceptable exposure to aircraft noise. In order to facilitate the purposes of the Act, one
    of which is to encourage land uses compatible with the 65 dB CNEL criterion wherever possible, and in or-
    der to facilitate the ability of airports to comply with the Act, residential uses located in Community Noise
    Exposure Areas greater than 65 dB should be discouraged and considered located within normally unac-
    ceptable areas.
7-14                                                                            CITY OF TULARE GENERAL PLAN 2035

                                                                                      NOISE ELEMENT
C. Suitable Interior Environments. One objective of locating residential units relative to a known noise source
   is to maintain a suitable interior noise environment at no greater than 45 dB CNEL of Ldn. This requirement,
   coupled with the measured or calculated noise reduction performance of the type of structure under consid-
   eration, should govern the minimum acceptable distance to a noise source.
D. Acceptable Outdoor Environments. Another consideration, which in some communities is an overriding
   factor, is the desire for an acceptable outdoor noise environment. When this is the case, more restrictive
   standards for land use compatibility, typically below the maximum considered “normally acceptable” for that
   land use category, may be appropriate.

     NOI-P1.8  Public Transit Noise. Coordinate with transit service providers
               in the planning and design of proposed transportation projects to
               incorporate noise-reduction technologies and operations processes
               both on a system-wide and vehicle-specific basis. Technologies
               and processes should minimize noise impacts from public transpor-
               tation systems, including existing and future bus service(s) and the
               proposed Visalia Light Rail system.
     NOI-P1.9  Railroad Noise. Actively coordinate with Union Pacific, neigh-
               boring jurisdictions, and other transportation service providers dur-
               ing the planning and design of proposed rail-related projects so that

                “Quiet Zones” in existing and planned residential areas along the
                UP right-of-way per Federal Rail Administration rules and proce-

                exceed the Federal Transit Administrations vibration annoyance
                criterion shown on Table 4.10-6), additional requirements, such as
                use of less-vibration-intensive equipment or construction tech-
                niques, should be implemented during construction (e.g., drilled
                piles to eliminate use of vibration-intensive pile driver).
     NOI-P1.19 Pavement Conditions.            Strive to keep pavement on City

                use permits, zone changes, subdivision maps, parcel maps) will not
                be permitted in noise-impacted areas unless effective mitigation
                measures are incorporated into the specific design of such projects
                to reduce noise levels to 60 dB Ldn (or CNEL) or less within out-
                door activity areas and 45 dB Ldn (or CNEL) or less within interior
                living spaces. No noise-sensitive land uses which require approval

    NOI-P2.2    Land Use Planning and Noise Compatibility. Use the noise
                compatibility guidelines in Figure 7-3 and the future-conditions
                noise contour map in Figure 7-4 to plan for appropriate land uses
                near existing uses that generate noise. Noise mitigation should be
                included to ensure that new residential areas and other noise-
                sensitive uses are appropriately buffered from significant noise
                sources.
    NOI-P2.3    Noise Compatibility Strategies. Where land use noise compati-
                bility conflicts currently exist, explore the need for mitigation
                measures on noise sources that may be adjacent to sensitive recep-
                tors. In planning for future developments, promote the use of
                buffer zones, barrier/shielding measures, and/or sound insulation
                building techniques to preclude noise impacts to noise-sensitive
                land uses.
    NOI-P2.4    Reducing Exposure to Operational Noise. In new residential
                and mixed-use developments, require that stationary equipment
                (such as air conditioning units and condensers) be placed in sepa-
                rate spaces, rooftops, or other areas such that noise impacts to inte-
                rior living areas will be reduced. Similarly, potentially noisy com-
                mon spaces, such as trash collection areas and loading zones,
                should be located away from residential units or other noise-

     Policies
     NOI-P3.1 Areas within the City of Tulare shall be designated as noise­ im-
              pacted if exposed to existing or projected future noise levels at the
              exterior of buildings which exceed 60 dB Ldn (or CNEL). Maps
              which indicate areas exposed to existing or projected future noise
              levels exceed 60 dB Ldn (or CNEL) for the major noise sources
              identified in Figure 7-1 are included in Appendix B of the Policy
              Document.
     NOI-P3.2 New development of residential or other noise-sensitive land uses
              may not be permitted in noise-impacted areas unless effective miti-
              gation measures are incorporated into the specific design of such
              projects to reduce noise levels to 60 dB Ldn (or CNEL) or less with-
              in outdoor activity areas and 45 dB Ldn (or CNEL) or less within
              indoor living areas. Where it is not possible to reduce exterior
              noise levels within outdoor activity areas to 60 dB Ldn (or CNEL)
              or less after the practical application of the best available noise re-
              duction technology, an exterior noise level of up to 65 dB Ldn (or
              CNEL) may be allowed.
     NOI-P3.3 New development of industrial, commercial, or other noise­ gener-
              ating land uses (including roadways, railroads, and airports)may not
              be permitted if resulting noise levels will exceed 60 dB Ldn (or
              CNEL)at the boundary of areas containing or planned and zoned
              for residential or other noise­ sensitive land uses, unless it can be
              shown through acoustical analysis that the noise generated would
              be mitigated to levels compatible with the adjacent sensitive uses.
     NOI-P3.4 Noise level criteria applied to land uses other than residential or
              other noise-sensitive uses shall be consistent with the recommenda-
              tions of the State of California General Plan Guidelines.
     NOI-P3.5 Tulare County and its incorporated cities shall enforce the State
              Noise Insulation Standards (California Administrative Code, Title
              24) and Chapter 35 of the Uniform Building Code (UBC). Title 24
              requires that interior noise levels not exceed 45 dB Ldn (or CNEL)

                multi-family dwellings, condominiums, hotels or motels. UBC
                Chapter 35 requires that common wall and floor/ceiling assemblies
                within multi-family dwellings comply with minimum standards
                concerning the transmission of airborne sound and structure-borne
                impact noise. Title 24 requires that conformance with the above-
                described standards be documented by the submission of an acous-
                tical analysis whenever new multi-family dwellings, condominiums,
                hotels or motels are proposed for areas within the 60 dB Ldn (or
                CNEL)contour of a major noise source as determined by the local
                jurisdiction.
    NOI-P3.6    Acoustical Study Requirement. Require acoustical studies for
                new developments in areas where the noise levels exceed the ‘nor-
                mally acceptable’ levels for the proposed land use; based on Table
                EH-2. For residential uses, the analysis should include mitigation
                measures to limit the noise exposure in interior living spaces to 45
                dB Ldn, consistent with California Title 24.
    NOI-P3.7    New equipment and vehicles purchased by the City of Tulare shall
                comply with noise level performance standards consistent with the
                best available noise reduction technology.
    NOI-P3.8    New development of industrial, commercial, or other noise-
                generating land uses will not be permitted if resulting noise levels
                will exceed 60 dB Ldn (or CNEL) at the boundary of areas planned
                and zoned for residential or other noise-sensitive land uses, unless
                determined to be necessary to promote the public health, safety,
                and welfare of the County.

                   tions of the California Office of Noise Control (Figure 7-3).
     NOI-P3.11 When purchasing new equipment and vehicles, Tulare County shall
                   strive to purchase equipment which complies with noise level per-
                   formance standards set forth in this Noise Element.
D. Implementation Program
In order to achieve compliance with the policies of the Noise Element, Tulare Coun-
ty and its incorporated cities shall undertake the following implementation program.
The implementation program focuses on the prevention of new noise­ related land
use conflicts by requiring that all relevant development plans, programs and pro-
posals be reviewed to determine whether such plans, programs and proposals be
reviewed to determine whether such plans, programs and proposals adequately ad-
dress noise and its potential effects.
Resource information available to Tulare County and its incorporated cities for use
in the review process includes the noise exposure maps contained within Appendix
B of this Policy Document and the information concerning the effects of noise on
people and techniques available for noise control contained within the Technical
Reference Document. The noise exposure maps are intended for use as a screening
device in determining when a proposed development of residential or the noise-
sensitive land uses may be exposed to excessive noise levels and to provide guidance
in the land range planning process. Generally, the noise exposure maps included in
Appendix B of the Policy Document provide a conservative (worst-case) assessment
of noise exposure for the major noise sources identified for study during the prepa-
ration of the Noise Element. It is likely that other major sources of noise will be
identified during the preparation of the Noise Element. It is likely that other major
sources of noise will be identified during the project review process. This will be
especially true of industrial or commercial sources, since only a representative sample
of such sources were evaluated during the preparation of this document.

The information contained within the Technical Reference Document should be
used as a guideline for determining whether or not proposed noise mitigation
measures are a reasonable application of the techniques available, and likely to
achieve the desired results. Control of noise at the source and through the thought-
ful location and orientation of receiving uses should be given preference over the
control of noise at the path of transmission through the use of noise barriers.
     Implementation Policies
     NOI-I4.1     Tulare County and its incorporated cities shall review all relevant
                  development plans, programs, and proposals, including those initi-
                  ated by both the public and private sectors, to ascertain and ensure
                  their conformance with the policy framework outline in this Noise
                  Element.

                  other noise-sensitive land uses in a noise-impacted area, or the de-
                  velopment of an industrial, commercial or other noise-generating
                  land use in or near an area containing or planned and zoned for
                  residential or other noise-sensitive land uses, an acoustical analysis
                  may be waived provided that all of the following conditions exist:
                  ♦ The proposed development is not subject to the provisions of
                     California Administrative Code Title 24.
                  ♦ The existing or projected future noise exposure at the exterior of
                     buildings which will contain noise-sensitive uses or within the
                     proposed outdoor activity areas (patios, decks, backyards, pool
                     areas, recreation areas, etc.) does not exceed 65 dB Ldn (or
                     CNEL).
                  ♦ The topography in the project area is flat, and the noise source
                     and receiving land use are at the same grade.
                  ♦ Effective noise mitigation, as determined by the reviewing
                     agency, is incorporated into the project design to reduce noise
                     exposure to the levels specified by the policies of the Noise El-
                     ement such measures may include the use of building setbacks,
                     building orientation and noise barriers. If a noise barrier is re-
                     quired for mitigation of exterior noise levels, it should be con-

              stucco, masonry, etc.) and should be of sufficient height to inter-
              rupt line-of-sight between the source and receiver. Line-of-sight
              should be determined by drawing a straight line between the ef-
              fective heights of the noise source and receiver. For traffic
              noise, and in instances where the number of heavy trucks ex-
              ceeds five (5) percent of the Average Daily Traffic (ADT), an ef-
              fective source height of at least eight (8) feet above the crown of
              the roadway should be used. For railroad noise, an effective
              height of ten (10) feet above the rails should be used for loco-
              motive and car noise, and an effective height of fifteen (15) feet
              above the rails should be used for horn noise. For industrial,
              commercial, or other stationary noise sources or for aircraft
              noise, a detailed evaluation of noise source spectra and effective
              height(s) should be conducted. Receiver height should be as-
              sumed to be five (5) feet above project grade for outdoor activi-
              ty areas such as backyards. The receiver height for small patios
              or upper floor decks should be assumed to be four (4) feet
              above the finished floor elevation. Interior noise levels may be
              assumed to be in compliance with the 45 dB Ldn (or CNEL)
              standard as long as the building construction complies with to-
              day’s more stringent thermal insulation requirements and win-
              dows and doors may remain closed. This will require the instal-
              lation of air conditioning or mechanical ventilation.
           When the above-described conditions do not exist and an acousti-
           cal analysis is required by the City of Tulare it should:
           ♦ Be the responsibility of the applicant.
           ♦ Be prepared by an individual or firm with demonstrable experi-
              ence in the fields of environmental noise assessment and archi-
              tectural acoustics.
           ♦ Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient
              sampling periods and locations to adequately describe local con-
              ditions.
           ♦ Include estimated noise levels in terms of Ldn (or CNEL) exist-
              ing and projected future (10 to 20 years hence) conditions, with

                    to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and standards
                    of the Noise Element.
               ♦ Include estimates of noise exposure after the prescribed mitiga-
                    tion measures have been implemented. If compliance with the
                    adopted standards and policies of the Noise Element will not be
                    achieved, a rationale for acceptance of the project must be pro-
                    vided.
    NOI-I4.3    Tulare County and its incorporated cities shall develop and imple-
                ment procedures to ensure that requirements imposed pursuant to
                the findings of an acoustical analysis are implemented as part of the
                project permitting process. The appropriate time for requiring an
                acoustical analysis would be as early in the project review or per-
                mitting process as possible, so that noise mitigation may be an inte-
                gral part of the project design rather than an afterthought.
    NOI-I4.4    Noise exposure information developed during the community
                noise survey described in this Noise Element may be used as a
                guideline for the development and adoption of a community noise
                control ordinance to address noise complaints, and to provide local
                industry with performance standards for future development
                and/or equipment modifications. If such an ordinance is adopted,
                it should be consistent with the “Model Community Noise Control
                Ordinance” prepared by the California Office of Noise Control in
                1977, with modifications made to reflect local concerns and condi-
                tions (a draft community noise control ordinance is contained with-
                in the Technical Reference Document).
    NOI-I4.5    The Noise Element of the Tulare County General Plan and the
