General Plan 2030 is purposely brief. It is meant to be a useful, easy-to-
read, everyday guide to the planning, development and preservation of
the city, answering who will do what and why, and where, when, and how.
Goals, policies, and actions
The Plan is built around a series of goals, policies, and actions. “Goals”
are end-state—the long-range answers to what the community wants to
accomplish to resolve a particular issue or problem. Each of the Plan’s
goals relates to fulfilling the City’s Vision and at least one of the Guiding
Principles.
     “Policies” and “actions” are medium-range or short-range. Together
they guide day-to-day decision-making so there is continuing progress
toward attaining the goals. Many of the actions in this Plan were pro-
mulgated in the 1990 Plan, and most of the actions continue programs
already in effect in Santa Cruz.                                                •	 Two or more related policies are listed in sequence, followed by one

Open Space and Coastline
State law requires the General Plan to include an open space element to
guide the comprehensive and long-range preservation and conservation

of open space lands. Open space lands are defined in statute as any parcel
or area of land or water that is essentially unimproved for the purpose of
(1) preservation of natural resources; (2) public health and safety; (3) man-
aged production of resources; and (4) recreational and aesthetic purposes.
Open Space land uses within and surrounding the city include agricul-
ture/grazing lands, natural areas, coastal recreation areas, and park lands.
     Next to Land Use, Open Space is the General Plan topic broadest in
scope. Because of this breadth, open space issues overlap those covered in
other sections of the Plan, and open space requirements are commonly
found among other chapters. See the cross-reference table, “Relation of
