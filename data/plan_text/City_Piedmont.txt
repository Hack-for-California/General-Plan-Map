T       he Land Use Element is the cornerstone of the General Plan and establishes Piedmont’s
        fundamental goals for the use of public and private property. The Element includes the
        City’s official Land Use Diagram—a map which shows the types of land uses envisioned
for the city over the coming years. It also includes policies to conserve Piedmont’s
neighborhoods, guide the development of vacant lots, preserve the city’s open spaces, and avoid
conflicts between adjacent uses.
Because Piedmont’s land use pattern is well-established, the focus of the Land Use Element is on
preserving the stability and integrity of the city’s residential areas. The Element anticipates a
limited amount of change, primarily on commercial land and publicly-owned sites. Policies and
actions to guide that change are included in this chapter. Policies in the Land Use Element are
complemented by those in other elements of the plan, ensuring that choices and priorities are
balanced.
The requirements for the Land Use Element are spelled out in Government Code Section
63502(a). By law, the Element must designate the general distribution, location, and extent of
land used for housing, business, industry, open space, recreational facilities, education, public
buildings and lands, mineral extraction, and waste disposal. It must also contain standards for
population density and building intensity. These standards must be coordinated with plans for
transportation and infrastructure, and must also reflect environmental constraints such as steep
slopes or unstable soils.
The Element is organized into three major sections. The first part includes a profile of existing
land uses in Piedmont. The second part presents the Land Use Diagram, including definitions of
the city’s land use categories. The final part contains goals, policies, and actions on an array of
land use topics, including:
        Residential character
        Commercial and mixed uses
        Public, institutional, and open space uses
        Special sites
        Coordination with Oakland
        Planning and building administration

                                 single family home each. About 100 lots include a legal second unit. Only
                                 21 lots are developed with multi-family housing. Some of the multi-family
                                 units are in structures that were built as single family homes and
                                 subsequently subdivided; others are in structures built as apartments. The
                                 City also contains several lots that contain two detached single family homes,
                                 each of roughly equal size.

                                 about 7 percent of the city’s area. The acreage includes 50 acres of parks and
                                 30 acres of “functional” open space associated with Mountain View

                          Civic, Educational, and Religious Uses
                          Civic, educational and religious uses in Piedmont comprise about 40 acres, or
                          4 percent of the city. Most of this acreage is associated with public schools,
                          including Piedmont High School (and Millennium High), Piedmont Middle
                          School, and three elementary schools (Beach, Havens, and Wildwood).
                          Other civic uses include City Hall and the Veterans Memorial Building, the
                          Corporation Yard on Moraga Avenue, and an EBMUD pump station on
                          Grand Avenue.

                          Vacant Land
                          There are approximately 70 privately-owned vacant lots in Piedmont,
                          totaling 21 acres. There is also one vacant building—a former PG&E
                          substation on 0.4 acres located at Linda Avenue near the Oakland Avenue
                          bridge.
                          Many of the vacant lots in Piedmont are unlikely to be developed in the
                          foreseeable future. Most are owned by adjacent homeowners (i.e., “double
                          lots”) and are actively used as landscaped backyards, side yards, or gardens.
                          Some include accessory uses such as pools. Others are very steep, and would
                          require a significant amount of grading and excavation for new construction.
                          Some are landlocked, and would require access easements or lot line
                          adjustments. A majority are considered non-conforming under the Piedmont
                          zoning ordinance, either because they are below the minimum lot size or
                          have inadequate street frontage.
                          Conversely, a few of the vacant lots are large enough to be subdivided. The
                          largest vacant properties are located in the area between Glen Alpine Road
                          and Sea View Avenue, north of the Hampton/ St. James intersection.
                          Access, steep terrain, and irregular boundaries present constraints to
                          development in this area, however.
                          An application for redevelopment of the PG&E property as a 7-unit

Piedmont or Oakland?             Beyond the Piedmont City Limits
                                 Conditions in Piedmont are influenced by what happens just across the

                                          Very modest increases in density may take place in the future due to the

                                          Most of the changes planned for the Civic Center are on the block bounded
                                          by Bonita, Vista, Hillside, and Magnolia. Proposed changes include

The 2008 Civic Center Master Plan
The Civic Center Master Plan (CCMP) was prepared to address the long-term need for new
recreational, social, and cultural facilities in Central Piedmont. The Civic Center area already
supports municipal and educational facilities, including City Hall, and Piedmont High School and
Middle School. The CCMP complements these uses with new activities, while at the same time
improving recreational space, applying consistent design principles, and building pedestrian
linkages through the area.
The planning process included a series of community workshops, engaging Piedmont residents in
visioning and design. Participants’ ideas were refined and tested, and ultimately combined into a
preferred alternative for the area. A scale model of the area was built, and color renderings of the
proposed improvements were prepared. Detailed traffic and parking studies were conducted to
address circulation and traffic safety in the area.
At the heart of the CCMP are a series of capital improvement projects, including a new swimming
pool complex, a 22,000 square foot swim and fitness club, a remodeled recreation center, a new or
remodeled community building at 801 Magnolia Avenue, and a reconstructed tennis court atop a
two-level sub-surface parking structure.
The cost of these improvements has been estimated at $35-$50 million, excluding some of the
roadway changes. Because a funding source has not been identified, the Plan is likely to be
implemented in phases. Environmental review will be required for all CCMP projects as they move
forward, and further refinements are likely.

                                   Cemetery. Some long-term change in this area is likely, although open space

                                   and drained in 2003 as part of EBMUD’s facility modernization program,
                                   and Piedmont’s water now comes from other large tanks in the Oakland
                                   Hills. EBMUD will retain a portion of the site to develop a new 4.1 million

                                   for other purposes.

                                    The commercial district along Grand Avenue between Linda and Wildwood
                                    Avenues has the potential for a small amount of additional development.
                                    Although there are no vacant lots, some of the commercial properties are
                                    aging and are not used as intensively as they might be. Private
                                    redevelopment of some of these properties is possible and is permitted under
                                    existing zoning. The five single family houses within the commercial district
                                    are in excellent condition and are not expected to be replaced; however,
                                    conversion to office, retail, or multi-family residential uses could occur.
                                    In the event that any property in the Grand Avenue commercial area is
                                    redeveloped, the city strongly supports mixed use projects which combine
                                    residential and commercial uses. Development which includes ground floor
                                    retail shops and upper story office or residential use is encouraged. The
                                    commercial district should not be expanded beyond its current boundaries,
                                    however, since such expansion would encroach on established, stable
                                    residential uses.

                                    feasible, any redevelopment of multi-family property in this area should
                                    avoid displacing tenants and result in a net gain of total housing units.
                                    Affordable housing units, as well as market rate units, are encouraged.

The Piedmont Zoning Code
The legislative document controlling land use in Piedmont is Chapter 17 of the Municipal Code,
(“Regulations Prescribing the Character of Construction”), more commonly known as the zoning
ordinance. Although Piedmont has had zoning since 1929, most of the present code dates to
1987. Periodic amendments have been made since then in response to new land use issues,
definitions, and state requirements.
The Zoning Code divides Piedmont into five zones, as noted in the Table below. Chapter 17
defines the allowable uses in each zone; sets development standards; defines on-site
improvement and parking requirements; includes standards for fences, walls, retaining walls,
landscaping, and signs; and establishes design review requirements. Chapter 17 also describes
the findings necessary for granting variances and conditional use permits, as well as the
procedures for hearings and appeals. It also addresses non-conforming uses and a range of
administrative issues.
Key development standards in the five zoning districts are summarized below. This is an overview
only; additional standards apply. Chapter 17 should be consulted for the full text of the
regulations.

This designation applies to public schools and municipal facilities, including
City Hall, the Corporation Yard, and the Veterans Building. It has been
applied only to land owned by the City of Piedmont and the Piedmont
Unified School District. Although the maximum FAR is 0.75, the actual
FAR on most parcels with this designation is considerably lower. Any
increase in square footage on public land is subject to environmental review,
and a public process which ensures resident participation. Consistent with
the Piedmont zoning code, housing is a permitted use within Public Facility

           Intensity: Not applicable.
           Any increase in intensity subject to public review.
The Parks, Recreation, and Open Space designation applies to public parks
and other public and private open space areas. These other open spaces
include EBMUD facilities, Tyson Reservoir, and the Piedmont portion of
Mountain View Cemetery. Permitted uses in these areas include recreation,
resource conservation, and facilities which support park and recreation
activities. Depending on site conditions, these facilities may include
recreation centers, swimming pools, tennis courts, sports fields, restrooms,
child care centers, parking areas, park maintenance and staging areas, and
similar uses. Because the primary activity in these areas is recreation, no
floor area ratio limit has been established. The intent is to maintain these
sites as open space to the greatest extent feasible. Areas with this
designation are generally in Piedmont’s Zone “B.”

Goal 2: Commercial and Mixed Use Areas
Provide for a limited range of commercial uses which serve the
basic needs of the community.
Policies and Actions
Policy 2.1: Local-Serving Emphasis
On the city’s limited commercial land supply, strongly encourage activities
that meet the needs of Piedmont residents rather than region-serving
activities. By supporting local-serving businesses in these areas, Piedmont
can advance its goals of reducing driving, promoting walking, and creating a
more balanced and well-rounded community.
Policy 2.2: Mixed Use Development
Within the Grand Avenue commercial district, encourage mixed use
development that combines ground floor commercial uses and upper story
residential uses.

T       he Transportation Element addresses mobility, accessibility, safety, and other issues
        related to travel in and around Piedmont. The Element looks beyond roads and
        automobiles and covers all modes of transport in the city, including buses, bicycles, and
walking. It recognizes the relationship between transportation and the city’s land use pattern, the
effects of transportation infrastructure on the city’s environment and quality of life, and the
importance of providing transportation choices for Piedmont residents. The Element covers
regional issues such as congestion management and commute patterns as well as local issues such
as parking, speeding, and accident hazards.
Piedmont benefits from excellent access to the regional transportation system. The City is just
minutes away from four freeways, the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) rail system, and even an
international airport. On the other hand, the city’s central location means that it experiences
“pass-through” traffic that originates and ends in other cities. Local residents face congestion on
a daily basis as they navigate local thoroughfares and East Bay highways.
Piedmont also benefits from being a walkable city. Most of its streets have sidewalks, and many
residents live within walking distance of schools, parks, and shopping areas. Walking is also one
of the most popular recreational activities in the city and contributes to the fitness of Piedmont
residents. But walking is not practical or even possible for all Piedmont residents. Most residents
drive to work alone in single passenger automobiles. Driving is also the norm for most errands
and trips around town. One of the goals of this Element is to make alternatives to driving more
convenient and attractive. This can help conserve energy, improve air and water quality, improve
public health, and reduce transportation costs.
Goals, policies, and actions in this element address the following major topics:
        Mobility and transportation choice
        Traffic flow
        Public transit and carpooling
        Walking and bicycling
        Parking
        Traffic safety

 ROAD NETWORK
 Functional Classifcation
 Piedmont’s road network is shown in Figure 4.1. The network consists
 of a hierarchy of arterials, major collectors, minor collectors, and local
 streets. Each type of street has different physical characteristics, carries
 different amounts of traffic, and has a different function. Table 4.1
 indicates the characteristics of each road type.

                                     The city’s arterials are Oakland Avenue, Grand Avenue, Highland
                                     Avenue, and Moraga Avenue. These four streets connect Piedmont with
                                     Interstate 580 and State Highway 13. They form the backbone of the
                                     city’s circulation system and each carry more than 8,000 vehicles per
                                     day. All of Piedmont’s signalized intersections are located along these
                                     streets.
                                     A system of lower volume major collector streets joins Piedmont’s

                                     Hampton. Linda Avenue is also a major collector, linking Grand Avenue
                                     to the Piedmont Avenue shopping district in Oakland.
                                     Connecting the arterials and major collectors is a system of minor
                                     collectors. These include streets in and around the Civic Center,
                                     Magnolia, Winsor, the remaining segments of Hampton and LaSalle, St.
                                     James and Estates Drives, and a series of linked road segments including
                                     Mountain/ Sea View/ Lincoln, and Upper Oakland Avenue/ Scenic/
                                     Upper Blair, connecting to Harbord Drive in Oakland.
                                     The remaining streets in Piedmont are local, meaning they have low
                                     volumes and generally do not carry through traffic.
                                     Piedmont’s arterials and collector streets must also function as local
                                     streets to some extent, since they provide access to individual residences
                                     at the same time they carry through-traffic. These streets were not
                                     initially designed to handle the volume of cars they carry today.
                                     Transportation planning in such cases must balance regional mobility
                                     needs with privacy, noise, aesthetic, and safety issues.

                                     Some of the city’s collector streets have parking on both sides, some
                                     have no parking at all. Some local streets are two lanes wide and some
                                     are just one lane wide.

TRANSPORTATION
The morning peak hour on most Piedmont streets is 8:00 to 9:00 AM. The
evening peak hour tends to have more traffic than the morning peak hour on
Grand Avenue, but the two are about equal on Oakland and Moraga
Avenues. Directional flows are predictable, with larger volumes headed out
of the city in the morning and back into the city in the evening.
The AM and PM peaks generally represent about 10 percent of average daily
traffic each. However, on streets like Magnolia (adjacent to Piedmont High
School), the combined AM and PM peaks represent almost 40 percent of the
average daily traffic.
Roadway Operations
The Piedmont Department of Public Works is responsible for maintaining the
city’s roads and ensuring their safe, efficient operation. The Department
implements a pavement repair and maintenance program that includes
periodic resurfacing. All streets are inspected annually, and priorities are
identified for maintenance and repair. Street signs, road markings (stop
signs, etc.), and traffic signals are all included in the maintenance program.
In the past few years, the annual allocation has ranged from $345,000-
$600,000. The City also provides regular street sweeping services.
The City Council provides direction on road operations, including the
management of commercial traffic, the installation of signals and traffic
control devices, and adoption of parking regulations. Piedmont’s Municipal
Code includes provisions designating Moraga Avenue, Grand Avenue, and
Oakland Avenue (below Grand) as truck routes, meaning that commercial
vehicles exceeding five tons in weight must use these routes when traveling
across the city. The provisions do not apply to garbage trucks, utility
vehicles, or buses. Trucks may use other Piedmont streets to access
individual properties for local deliveries.
Future Traffic Conditions
Although this General Plan anticipates no significant development or land
use change within Piedmont, local traffic is still likely to increase during the
next 10 to 20 years. Virtually all of the increase will be associated with
“pass-through” traffic from growth elsewhere in the East Bay, including
Oakland. Also, as the region’s freeways become more congested, drivers are
more likely to divert onto local streets.

Piedmont originated as a “streetcar suburb” of San Francisco and Oakland and was connected to the
business districts of these cities by trolley and ferry even before the Bay Bridge was constructed. Shortly
after the city incorporated, the B electric car line from Trestle Glen and the C line from 41st Street and
Piedmont Avenue provided connections to the ferry terminal in West Oakland. In 1924, the C line was
extended to the Piedmont rail terminus at Oakland Avenue and Latham Street. Following completion
of the Bay Bridge in 1938, the Key System provided direct rail service on both lines to San Francisco.
The transbay streetcars were supplemented by a network of local streetcars serving Piedmont,
Berkeley, Oakland, and Emeryville. Line 10 traversed Central Piedmont, originating near Hampton and
Seaview, passing through the Civic Center and along Highland to Park Way, then descending to
Grand (Pleasant Valley), and continuing down Piedmont Avenue to Broadway and Downtown
Oakland. Line 12 originated at Jerome and Oakland Avenue, continued down Fairview Avenue to
Grand, and followed Grand through Downtown to West Oakland. Line 18 originated near Mandana
Avenue, extending down WalaVista to the top of Lakeshore, then to Downtown Oakland before
looping back up Park Boulevard to Leimert. Line 11 orignated at Piedmont Avenue and Linda,
following Linda to Oakland Avenue, continuing to downtown Oakland, then out East 14th Street to
Fruitvale.
Transit ridership declined as automobile ownership increased and the freeway system was constructed.
The local streetcar lines were replaced by buses after World War II, with the right-of-way converted to
other uses (including parks and private homes in a few cases). The transbay trains to Piedmont
stopped running in 1958; transbay buses were substituted along their approximate routes.

                                Walking
                                Walking is part of the daily routine of many Piedmont residents. It is
                                important both as a recreational activity and as a practical mode of travel for
                                short trips, errands, trips to school, and trips to transit. Many residents cite
                                the city’s pedestrian-friendly layout as one of the things they like best about
                                living in Piedmont.
                                Most pedestrian travel in the city occurs on sidewalks and crosswalks.
                                Piedmont also has a system of pedestrian pathways that run between blocks,
                                particularly in steep areas where the paths serve as “short cuts”. The
                                pathway network is shown in Figure 4.4 and is inventoried in Table 4.4.
                                Paths are maintained by the Department of Public Works, although clearing

                                         Like Alameda County and the City of Oakland, Piedmont aspires to remain
                                        a safe, convenient, and attractive place to walk. Over the next 20 years, the
                                        City will work to increase the percentage of trips made by walking by
                                        improving the design and maintenance of pedestrian facilities, ensuring the
                                        safety of pedestrians, and providing connectivity between pedestrian routes.
                                        The City will continue to look for ways to make Piedmont safer and more
                                        comfortable for pedestrians. Median islands, new types of crosswalk paving,
                                        activated pavement lights, flashers, and other design changes have been
                                        explored on Oakland Avenue and may be explored elsewhere during the
                                        coming years. The city is particularly interested in changes which make it
                                        easier for Piedmont students to walk to school, and for residents to walk to
                                        local bus routes. Piedmont will also work with Oakland to ensure that the
                                        pedestrian networks between the two cities are connected.
Piedmont is a relatively safe place for
bicycling. The accident rate            Bicycling
between 2000 and 2005 was 1.3 per
1,000 residents, compared to 2.5 in
Oakland and 8.0 in Berkeley.
                                        Many Piedmont residents enjoy recreational bicycling, and some residents
                                        use bicycles for commuting and short trips. Although, there are no officially
                                        designated bike routes in the city, Piedmont will take measures to
                                        accommodate bicycling to a greater degree in the coming years. Bicycle
                                        travel provides a way to reduce vehicle emissions, promote public health,
                                        meet recreational needs, manage congestion, and reduce parking demand.
                                        There are a number of opportunities and constraints to expanding bicycle
                                        travel in Piedmont. On the positive side, the climate allows for year round
                                        bicycling. Shopping and employment areas in Oakland are relatively

                                        homes. The City is also relatively close to popular recreational trails such as
                                        the Bay Trail, as well as more rigorous world-class cycling routes in the
                                        Oakland Hills. On the negative side, most Piedmont streets are too narrow
                                        for dedicated bike lanes. Steep hills provide a constraint in some parts of the
                                        city. Blind curves and fast moving traffic may create hazards to bicyclists.
                                        Some destinations in the city do not have bike racks.
                                        Both Alameda County and the City of Oakland have bicycle plans that
                                        include Piedmont, and the East Bay Bicycle Coalition has prepared a route
                                        map that includes the city. Although Piedmont does not have its own
                                        Bicycle Plan, the City has incorporated some of the recommendations of
                                        these plans in this General Plan. Figure 4.5 shows a composite of mapped
                                        routes from existing bike plans. These routes have not been formally
                                        adopted by Piedmont, but provide a starting point for further discussion.

TRANSPORTATION
GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
Goal 7: Mobility and Choice
Provide a balanced transportation system that maximizes mobility
and choice for all Piedmont residents.
Policies and Actions
Policy 7.1: Balancing Travel Modes
Ensure that transportation planning balances the needs of motorists, transit
users, pedestrians, and bicycles. Where feasible, future land use and
transportation decisions should discourage driving in single passenger autos
and instead encourage alternative modes of travel.
Policy 7.2: Balancing Investments
Consider opportunities to improve provisions for pedestrians, bicycles,
transit, and alternative fuel vehicles whenever improvements to roads are
made. Streets should be regarded not only as circulation routes, but as public
spaces that define the character of the city.
Policy 7.3: Reducing Vehicle Miles Traveled
Support changes that would reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) by Piedmont residents, including enabling residents to conduct
business with City Hall on the internet, allowing home-based businesses,
supporting telecommuting, encouraging carpooling, improving public transit,
and upgrading facilities for bicycles and pedestrians.
Policy 7.4: Synchronizing Land Use and Transportation Decisions
Ensure that Piedmont’s transportation system complements the city’s land
use pattern, and that land use decisions complement and make the most
efficient use of the city’s transportation system.
Policy 7.5: Public Facility Access
Consider pedestrian access, bicycle access, and public transit access when
making investment decisions about future parks, schools, and other public
facilities. Also, ensure that new public facilities and commercial uses are
designed to include features that encourage walking, bicycling, and transit.
Policy 7.6: Regional Perspective
Recognize the relationship of local transportation decisions to broader
regional issues such as congestion management and environmental
sustainability.

                        Policy 8.3: Traffic-Generating Uses
                        Discourage development projects which would significantly increase
                        congestion on Piedmont streets or create substantially increased road

                        Improve vehicle circulation in problem areas, particularly school drop-off
                        and pick-up locations, and key intersections along the city’s arterials.
                        Policy 8.5: Truck Traffic
                        Minimize the effects of truck traffic on Piedmont streets by maintaining a

               Goal 9: Public Transit and Carpooling
               Provide safe, reliable, convenient alternatives to driving as a
               means of travel to other Bay Area cities.
               Policies and Actions
               Policy 9.1: Accessible Transit
               Strongly support the provision of safe, reliable, convenient public
               transportation service that is accessible to all Piedmont neighborhoods. AC
               Transit should be responsive to input from Piedmont residents and should
               increase service frequency to Piedmont as funds permit.
               Policy 9.2: Transit Stops and Routes
               Encourage AC Transit to provide a bus stop within walking distance (roughly
               1,000-2,000 feet) of all Piedmont residences. Bus routes should generally
               follow arterial and major collector streets.

               Encourage amenities that make bus travel a more appealing alternative to
               driving. These could include bus shelters and bus stops with real-time
               information on bus arrival times.
               Policy 9.6: Casual Carpooling
               Support casual carpooling as a viable form of transit from Piedmont to San
               Francisco during the peak hours. However, carpools should be regarded as a
               supplement to public transit, and not than a substitute for public transit.
               Policy 9.7: Carpool Parking
               Mitigate the parking impacts of casual carpooling. Non-Piedmont residents
               should be discouraged from all-day parking on streets near carpool pickup
               points.

                                               5 Natural Resources
                                                       and Sustainability
T        he Natural Resources and Sustainability Element addresses the protection and
         management of Piedmont’s earth, water, air, and biologic resources. It provides policies
         and actions on important issues such as creek protection, hillside grading, air and water
quality, and management of the city’s “urban forest.” These policies are essential not only to
protect the health of Piedmont’s natural environment, but also to protect the health and well-being
of its residents.
State law requires that the General Plan includes a Conservation Element addressing a variety of
environmental topics—from farmland preservation to fishery management. Many of the state
requirements do not apply to Piedmont since the city is urbanized and landlocked. However, the
city still has a unique ecology that requires careful, deliberate management. Piedmont’s natural
landscape is part of its beauty and identity. The city is also part of a larger East Bay ecosystem
that includes hundreds of species of plants and animals. Decisions made at the local level affect
the health of San Francisco Bay, the quality of the region’s air, and even the supply of water and
energy available to California residents.
The issue of climate change has made this element of the General Plan even more relevant to
Piedmont residents. The state of California has set an ambitious goal of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. Accordingly, this
element includes recommendations to make Piedmont more sustainable—in other words, a city
that consumes fewer natural resources and produces fewer environmental impacts. The Natural
Resources and Sustainability Element includes policies to encourage “greener” construction,
water conservation, energy conservation, alternative energy sources, and solid waste reduction.
Goals, policies, and actions in this element address the following major topics:
         Protection of natural features
         Management of Piedmont’s urban forest
         Air and water quality
         Sustainable development
         Resource conservation

                                       location of steep slopes. The city’s terrain rises gently from west to east, with
                                       the steepest slopes located along canyons and ravines. The combination of
                                       knolls, low ridges, and valleys creates scenic vistas throughout the city and is
                                       an important part of Piedmont’s character.
                                       Most of Piedmont consists of gentle slopes between zero and 20 percent,
                                       requiring a small to moderate amount of grading to support construction. The
                                       city’s vacant and undeveloped land is steeper, with slopes exceeding 50 percent
                                       in some cases. Development on such land may require extensive cutting and
                                       filling of hillsides, and special techniques to ensure the stability of structures.

                                       including homes and businesses as well as landscaping and gardens. Good soil
                                       management is essential to reduce erosion, sediment runoff and landslide
                                       hazards.
                                       There are two predominant soil types in Piedmont. The first consists of
                                       alluvial deposits created by hundreds of thousands of years of erosion from the
                                       East Bay Hills. These soils are found in the city’s lower elevations and on
                                       flatter terrain. They tend to be rich in nutrients and are relatively stable. The
                                       second type consists of residual material from sandstone and shale. These soils
                                       are shallower, less fertile, and more prone to erosion. These clay-like soils are
                                       also prone to “shrinking” during dry weather and “swelling” during wet
                                       weather, affecting design requirements for foundations.
                                       Piedmont has no agricultural land or land subject to the Williamson Act or
                                       Timberland Productivity Act. It is classified as “Urban and Built-Up Land” by
                                       the California Department of Conservation.

                                      Piedmont’s principal mineral resources are volcanic rocks. Basalt, andesite,
                                      and rhyolite were mined during the East Bay’s early development and were
                                      used for building roads, curbs, and foundations. During the early 1900s,
                                      stone quarries operated on the sites of what are now Davies Tennis Stadium,
                                      Dracena Park, and the Corporation Yard. A large sandstone aggregate
                                      quarry once existed just north of the city limits on Pleasant Valley Road—a

                                      parking lot.
                                      Piedmont’s quarries were converted to other uses as the land around them
                                      became urbanized. The dust, noise, vibration, water pollution, and landscape
                                      scarring made their operation infeasible. Quarrying is not expected to
                                      resume anywhere in the city during the life of this General Plan due to the
                                      city’s built up, residential character and the lack of suitable sites.
                                      Piedmont has no known oil, gas, or geothermal resources suitable for
                                      extraction. The State Mining and Geology Board has identified no regionally

The Stormwater Quality Management Plan
Piedmont is one of 14 cities responsible for implementing the Alameda County Stormwater Quality
Management Plan. The 2002 Plan is the third Countywide water quality plan prepared since 1991
when the Clean Water Program was initiated. The Plan includes the following eight components:
        Planning and Regulatory Compliance
        Watershed Assessment
        Monitoring and Special Studies
        Public Information and Participation
        Municipal Maintenance Activities
        New Development and Construction Controls
        Illicit Discharge Controls
        Industrial and Commercial Discharge Controls
The Plan established new standards called TMDLs (Total Maximum Daily Load) which limit the total
quantity of a pollutant that may be discharged to a water body during a specified time period. The
Plan also includes a watershed management program that focuses on cooperative solutions among
cities.
One of the most important aspects of the plan are recommended “Best Management Practices”
(BMPs) to reduce stormwater pollution. These include techniques to limit the amount of silt and sand
that runs off from construction sites, guidelines for litter control and road repair, and programs to
educate residents about the importance of clean water. The program also requires “Standard Urban
Stormwater Mitigation Plans (called SUSMPs) to control the effects of development projects on water
quality.

                           residents and businesses cannot be sustained. A 1989 mandate from the
                           California legislature required all cities to reduce the amount of landfilled
                           solid waste by 50 percent by 2000. Piedmont achieved this target; as of July
                           2008, 70 percent of its waste was diverted. Along with other cities in
                           Alameda County, the city has set a 75 percent waste diversion target for
                           2010.
                           Piedmont has an aggressive solid waste reduction and recycling program to
                           reach its 2010 goal. In 2007, the City signed a new 10-year agreement with
                           Richmond Sanitary Service to provide trash, recycling, and green waste
                           services. These services include backyard collection of garbage, green
                           waste, and recyclable materials (with the option of curbside service
                           provided), and four-times yearly bulk waste and e-waste collection. The
                           range of recyclables has been expanded to include plastic products and food
                           scraps. Improved recycling containers are also being provided. The City has
                           also implemented measures to increase the percentage of construction and

NATURAL RESOURCES
AND SUSTAINABILITY
As noted in the Transportation Element, Piedmont will also strive to reduce
energy consumption in the transportation sector. This could include
preferential parking for hybrid or electric cars, improved access to BART,
and even installing bio-fuel or other alternative fuel pumps at the city’s gas
stations.
Greening the Government
The City of Piedmont needs to set high standards for its own operations if it
expects others in the community to follow suit. It should be a role model in
recycling, green building construction, and environmentally sound
landscaping. It should lead the way by composting clippings from medians
and parks, procuring recycled materials, and deploying hybrid vehicles for
City use. These changes will not happen overnight—but they should be
implemented gradually as funds allow. During the annual budgeting cycle
and capital improvement process, the City will explore ways it can embrace
sustainable development and business principles.
Behavioral Changes
Some of the most basic steps to becoming a more sustainable city take place
in our own homes and backyards. Simple actions such as taking transit on
“spare the air” days, walking more, reducing pesticide use, planting home
vegetable gardens, and even using canvas grocery bags can make a big
difference when everybody participates. Again, the City can lead the way by
providing education and outreach on the steps Piedmont residents can take to
reduce their impacts on the environment around them.

City of Piedmont Sustainability Policy
It is the intent of the City of Piedmont to be a sustainable community - one which meets
its current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own
needs. I n adopting this policy, the City of Piedmont accepts its responsibility, through its
operations, programs and services, to:
 Continuously improve the quality of life for all Piedmont residents without adversely
   affecting others.
 Enhance the quality of air, water, land and other natural resources through
   conservation, reduced pollution, increased efficiency, and protection of native
   vegetation, wildlife habitat and other ecosystems.
 Reduce greenhouse gas emissions, specifically by reducing landfilled waste, energy
   consumption, and water consumption, and by encouraging walking, bicycling and
   other alternative travel modes.
 Encourage greener methods of construction.
 Support small local businesses that use sustainable practices in their own operations
 Promote public education and awareness of sustainability issues.
 Align and partner with community groups, businesses, residents, non-profits, and
   neighboring communities where appropriate to work toward these goals
The above policy is incorporated by reference into this General Plan and is intended to
complement the other goals, policies, and objectives in all Plan Elements.

NATURAL RESOURCES
AND SUSTAINABILITY
GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
Goal 13: Natural Features
Protect and enhance Piedmont’s natural features, including its
hillsides, creeks, and woodlands.
Policies and Actions
Policy 13.1: Respecting Natural Terrain
Maintain the natural topography of Piedmont by avoiding lot splits and
subdivisions that would lead to large-scale grading and alteration of hillsides.
Planning and building regulations should ensure that any construction on
steep slopes is sensitively designed and includes measures to stabilize slopes,
reduce view blockage, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts.
Policy 13.2: Erosion Control
Reduce soil loss and erosion by following proper construction and grading
practices, using retaining walls and other soil containment structures, and
development control measures on very steep hillsides.
Policy 13.3: Creek Protection
Retain creeks in their natural condition rather than diverting them into man-
made channels or otherwise altering their flow. Riparian vegetation and
habitat along the city’s creeks should be protected by requiring setbacks for
any development near creek banks. These setbacks should be consistent with
state and federal laws governing stream alteration. Figure 5.2 should be used
as a general guide for identifying creeks subject to this policy, but it is not
intended to be a comprehensive inventory of all watercourses in the city.
Policy 13.4: Conserving Native Vegetation
Require new development (including expansion of existing residences and
major landscaping projects) to protect native vegetation, particularly
woodland areas that support birds and other wildlife.
Policy 13.5: Protection of Special Status Species
Ensure that local planning and development decisions do not damage the
habitat of rare, endangered or threatened species, and other species of special
concern in Piedmont and nearby areas.

                                   6 Environmental Hazards
T       he Environmental Hazards Element incorporates two of the mandatory elements of the
        General Plan—Safety and Noise. The primary goal of this element is to minimize future
        loss of life, injury, and property damage resulting from natural hazards. A secondary goal
is to reduce exposure to hazardous materials, noise, vibration, and other dangers or nuisances
associated with the built environment.
Emergency preparedness is an important part of hazard mitigation. However, the City has
independent plans and programs for emergency response that are outside the scope of the General
Plan. The focus in this chapter is on prevention and mitigation. By integrating hazards into land
use decisions, Piedmont can reduce the risk of catastrophic damage when disaster strikes.
Accordingly, this element includes policies to limit development on unstable slopes, seismically
retrofit schools and older structures, maintain “defensible” space around homes on fire-prone
hillsides, provide roads that are adequate for emergency vehicles, and ensure that the city’s water
supply is adequate for fire-fighting.
The State Government Code (Section 65302(g)) identifies the specific hazards that must be
addressed by the general plan. These include seismically-induced surface rupture, ground failure,
tsunamis and seiches, dam failure, slope instability, subsidence, and liquefaction. The
Government Code also requires general plans to address evacuation routes, peakload water
supply requirements, minimum road widths, and clearances around structures. All of these topics
are covered in this chapter.
The Environmental Hazards Element also includes a proactive set of policies to address noise
issues in Piedmont. Piedmont residents value their peace and quiet, and enjoy a relatively calm
environment considering the city’s location in the center of a major metropolitan area. Policies in
this chapter strive to maintain that environment and mitigate activities and land uses that generate
noise.
Goals, policies, and actions in this element address the following major topics:
         Geologic hazards
         Wildfire and flooding hazards
         Hazardous materials management
         Emergency preparedness
         Noise control

                                  Piedmont is located in a geologically active part of the world. The region’s

                                        Earthquakes pose a substantial danger to property and human safety. Ground
                                        shaking is typically the greatest hazard and major cause of damage. The
                                        transmission of earthquake waves can cause buildings to collapse, streets to
                                        crack, and utility lines to rupture. Strong ground shaking can also cause
                                        damage due to falling objects such as bookcases or water heaters, chemical
                                        spills, and secondary effects such as fire or explosion.
                                        On any given site, the degree of shaking tends depends on the magnitude of
                                        the earthquake, distance to the fault, property of the underlying soils,
                                        building design and construction, and building materials. Shaking tends to
                                        be strongest on filled soils and in areas where soil depth and moisture content
                                        are high.
                                        Figure 6.1 shows projected ground shaking intensity in Piedmont in the event
                                        of a magnitude 6.9 earthquake on the Hayward Fault. Such a scenario would

slopes.                   Landslide Hazards in Piedmont
                          Landslides are the rapid movement of soil, rock, or mud down a slope. They
                          may be triggered by natural causes such as earthquakes and heavy rain, or
                          man-made causes such as broken water mains, improperly constructed roads,
                          and slopes that are undercut or overloaded during construction.
                          Landslides are relatively common in the East Bay Hills, especially during
                          high-intensity, long duration winter rains. They generally occur along the
                          sides of ravines where surface water and groundwater are concentrated, or on
                          deep-seated bedrock and steep slopes with weak or shallow soils. When such
                          soil becomes saturated with water, its weight increases and resistant forces
                          are reduced. The risk of landslides increases where certain conditions are
                          present, such as hillsides that have been denuded by fire.

                       There is no way to eliminate geologic hazards completely. However, the
                       potential for damage can be substantially reduced through construction
                       methods and materials. A majority of buildings in Piedmont are one- and
                       two-story early to mid-20th century wood-frame houses. While such
                       structures generally perform well in an earthquake, they pre-date the current
                       seismic requirements of the Uniform Building Code. Certain types of
                       construction, such as homes that are not bolted to their foundations or homes
                       with living areas over crawl spaces without substantial lateral strength, are
                       more vulnerable than others. Tall brick chimneys and unrestrained water
                       heaters are also a source of potential damage.
                       Over the last 50 years, many Piedmont residences have been retrofitted with
                       shear walls, cross-bracing, and foundation reinforcements. Structural
                       hazards in the city are also somewhat reduced due to the stability of the soil,
                       the absence of large multi-family buildings, the relatively small number of
                       commercial buildings, and the limited number of structures where large

                       All construction and rehabilitation projects in Piedmont must conform to
                       building codes which take seismic forces into account. The Building Code
                       assigns a seismic design category (SDC) to each type of structure based on
                       its occupancy, soil profile, acceleration parameters, and other factors. The
                       SDC affects the type of structure that may be developed on a given site, as

                         Reservoir is being decommissioned. Moreover, EBMUD Reservoir #1 on
                         Estates Drive is planned for replacement with two reinforced concrete water
                         tanks. In the event the Estates Reservoir (or the replacement tanks) collapsed,
                         water would follow the streambed between Glen Alpine and Sea View, cross
                         Hampton Road, and follow St. James to Indian Gulch. In the event the future
                         Piedmont Reservoir tank collapsed, water would flow into Moraga Canyon.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
Hazardous materials include substances that are flammable, corrosive,
explosive, radioactive, infectious, thermally unstable, and poisonous.
Although such substances are typically associated with industrial land uses,
they may also be found at gas stations, dry cleaners, medical offices, public
buildings, and many retail and office uses. Hazardous materials are also used
in most households, and include cleaning solvents, paint, motor oil, pesticides,
plastics, and common household chemicals. Common building materials and
appliances may also contain substances such as asbestos, lead, and mercury.
Naturally occurring hazards such as mold also may be an issue in some
structures.
The storage, handling, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials can create
health and safety issues. All Piedmont firefighters receive “first responder”
training to respond to spills and accidents. The Fire Department also
implements state and federal programs aimed at reducing exposure to
hazardous materials.
More recently, the disposal of electronic waste such as computers, televisions,
and fluorescent lamps has become a concern. The City of Piedmont
implements programs to reduce these hazards, including e-waste collection,
battery recycling, and stormwater controls. Household hazardous waste
disposal centers have been established in Oakland and Hayward. Information
on the location and hours of operation of these centers has been provided to
each Piedmont household.
The State Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) maintains data
bases indicating permitted hazardous material sites in California, as well as
clean-up sites and other sites where corrective actions have occurred. No
clean-up sites have been identified in Piedmont. DTSC also maintains
inventories of leaking underground fuel tanks. Two sites are noted in
Piedmont, both associated with gas stations. Groundwater quality at these sites
is monitored on an ongoing basis.

                        event of an emergency, the evacuation routes are designated by the Police
                        Chief and the Public Works Director based on the nature of the emergency
                        and the direction or movement of the threat. Evacuation would generally use

Piedmont’s emergency plan is formally known as the Multi-hazard Functional Plan (MHFP). It deals
with both wartime emergencies and peacetime emergencies, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, dam
failure, major accidents, hazardous material spills, storms, epidemics, critical pollution, and civil
disturbances.
The purpose of the Plan is to:
     • Provide a basis for the conduct and coordination of operations and the management of
         critical resources during emergencies;
     • Make widely known the authority, responsibilities, functions, and operations of civil
         government during emergencies;
     • Provide a means of incorporating into the City’s emergency organization any non-
         governmental agencies and organizations having the resources necessary to meet
         unforeseen needs; and
     • Establish emergency disaster containers with medical supplies, shelter, water, food, rescue,
         and communications equipment.
The MHFP becomes operative if there is a state of war, a proclamation of a state of emergency by the
Governor, or an order of the Mayor, Council, or City Administrator.
One of the objectives of the MHFP is to maintain a system of emergency supply containers. These are
located at Beach, Wildwood, and Havens schools, at Hampton Field, and at the Corporation Yard.
The city undertakes preventative container maintenance and periodic replacement of contents to
ensure that supplies are kept in functional condition. A back-up amateur radio system has been
placed in the container at Havens School and an organization of amateur radio enthusiasts has been
formed to operate the system in the event of an emergency.

ENVIRONMENTAL                        HAZARDS
NOISE
Noise is an environmental hazard with the potential to substantially impact
human health and well-being. It can interfere with sleep, disrupt
communication and relaxation, and even have harmful physical effects such
as hearing loss. In a relatively quiet residential city like Piedmont, even
small increases in noise may be perceptible. It is therefore important to
maintain standards which retain the city’s peaceful environment and mitigate
potential noise sources.
Noise Sources
The primary source of noise in Piedmont is vehicular traffic. The noise level
at any given location depends on a number of factors, including topography
and proximity to major arterial or collector streets. Ambient noise in the
western half of the city tends to be higher than the eastern half, given the
greater density, proximity to the I-580 freeway, presence of schools and other
non-residential uses, and less extensive tree cover.
Given the quiet character of the city, domestic noise sources are a greater
concern in Piedmont than they are might be in other cities. Noise from
sporting events at local parks and school playgrounds, leaf blowers and
gardening equipment, private parties, and construction is a concern in some
neighborhoods. Noise from air conditioning units, pool and spa filter
systems, exhaust systems, air compressors, wireless equipment cabinets,
pumps, and other mechanical equipment also may be an issue. Such noise
sources are regulated by the Piedmont Municipal Code and the Building
Code. Acoustical studies may be required when new sources of noise are
introduced.
Section 12.8 of the City Code declares that loud, unnecessary, and unusual
noise is a nuisance and is unlawful. The criteria for determining whether a
nuisance exists considers includes the ambient noise level, the sound level of
the objectionable noise, the intensity of the noise, whether the noise is
continuous or intermittent, the duration and tonal content of the noise, the
proximity of the noise to sleeping facilities, the zoning of the area, and the
nature of the source. The Code specifically prohibits construction noise
between 6:00 PM to 8:00 AM seven days a week, extending an extra hour (to
9:00 AM) on Sunday mornings. In addition, Chapter 5 of the City Code
requires machinery that generates perceptible noise to include mitigating
equipment which reduces the sound at the edge of the property to no more
than 50 decibels.

Measuring Noise
Three factors must be taken into consideration when measuring noise:
     (a) the magnitude of the sound
     (b) the frequency of the sound
     (c) the variation in sound level over time.
Sound is typically measured using decibels (dB). Decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale, which
means that each increase of 10 dB is equivalent to a doubling in loudness. The measurements are usually
taken on an “A-weighted” scale that filters out very low and very high frequencies.
Noise levels are usually expressed with an indication of the duration of the measurement period. For longer
periods, the measurement reflects the average noise level over the period. This accounts for the variations
in sound levels that occur during the day. For instance a fire truck with blaring sirens may produce a
sustained noise level of 90 dB during the 15 seconds it passes by. The average noise level for an hour at this
location would be much lower, since this noise level is not sustained the entire time. A single measure called
the equivalent sound level or Leq is used to describe average noise over a specified time period.
Noise measurements also make adjustments to reflect the greater sensitivity of people to night-time noise.
The term Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL) is used to describe the average noise level during a 24-
hour period, with a penalty of 5 dB added to sound levels between 7 and 10 PM, and a penalty of 10 dB
added to sound levels between 10 PM and 7 AM. The term Day-Night Average Level (Ldn) is similar but only
includes the 10 dB penalty for 10 PM – 7 AM noise.
The term “ambient noise” is used to describe the composite noise from all sources near and far—in other
words, the characteristic noise environment at a given location. The US Environmental Protection Agency
suggests an ambient exterior noise goal of 55 dB Ldn in residential areas. The US Department of Housing and
Urban Development’s minimum exterior standard is 65 dB Ldn. Most local governments use 60 dB Ldn as the
limit for exterior noise exposure in residential areas. This corresponds to the state requirement that all new
housing with noise levels exceeding this limit be insulated.
In general, increases in noise of less than 3 dB Ldn are not perceptible. A 5 dB increase can trigger a
noticeable change is sometimes used as threshold to identify a “significant” noise impact under the
California Environmental Quality Act.

                                     locations in Piedmont in June 2007 (see text box on the previous page for an
                                     explanation of how noise is measured). Figure 6-4 indicates noise contours
                                     in Piedmont. The contour lines follow the highest volume traffic arteries in
                                     narrow bands. Contours in the range of 65 dBA Ldn run along Grand,

routes.                    The path that noise travels between its source and receiver provides an
                           opportunity for reduction in volume. Typical noise barriers include sound
                           walls, fences, berms, or dense plantings of shrubs and trees. Because
                           Piedmont does not have freeways or high-volume arterials, sound walls have
                           been unnecessary in the city. Landscaping and fences are used on private
                           properties to absorb noise and provide buffering, effectively reducing sound
                           and providing privacy in many locations.
                           Noise Receiver Controls
                           Adjusting the noise receiver is typically done through building design, and
                           construction. Standard construction reduces noise levels from outside to
                           inside by 10 to 20 dB. Additional reduction can be achieved through site
                           planning—for example, by setting a building back from the street, placing
                           mechanical equipment away from sleeping areas, and limiting the use of
                           decks that face onto noisy streets. Noise levels can be substantially reduced
                           by increasing wall mass and thickness, adding acoustical blankets, sealing
                           cracks and edges, increasing glass thickness or using double glazed windows,
                           using solid core doors instead of hollow doors, and through interior finishes
                           such as carpeting, drapes, and acoustical ceiling tiles.

GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
Goal 18: Geologic Hazards
Minimize the loss of life, personal injury, and property damage
resulting from earthquakes, landslides, unstable soils, and other
geologic hazards.
Policies and Actions
Policy 18.1: Restricting Development on Unstable Sites
Permit development only in those areas where potential danger to the health,
safety, and welfare of Piedmont residents can be adequately mitigated.
Policy 18.2: Seismic Design Standards
Maintain and enforce seismic design and construction standards which meet
or exceed the standards established by the Building Code. Piedmont’s
Municipal Code should be periodically reviewed, updated, and amended to
incorporate the most current knowledge and highest standards of seismic
safety.
Policy 18.3: Infrastructure Reliability
Maintain road and infrastructure design standards which address geologic
conditions in Piedmont, including the potential for earthquakes and
landslides. Infrastructure should be retroffited where necessary to improve
reliability during and after an earthquake.
Policy 18.4: Soil and Geologic Reports
Require site-specific soils reports and geologic studies in instances where
development may be exposed to substantial geologic or seismic hazards,
including ground shaking and landslides. Ensure that any identified hazards
are appropriately mitigated.
Policy 18.5: Seismic Upgrades
Encourage the upgrading and reinforcement of homes, businesses, schools,
and other public buildings to protect against future damage, injury, and loss
of life in the event of a major earthquake. The City will encourage the
mitigation of seismic deficiencies through bolting of structures to their
foundations, lateral bracing of cripple walls, bracing of water heaters and
potential falling objects, and similar measures. Structural hazards in public
buildings should be mitigated based on the severity of risk and the type of
occupancy.

ENVIRONMENTAL                       HAZARDS
Policy 18.6: Siting of Critical Facilities
Design and locate new critical facilities, including schools, municipal offices,
disaster supply containers, and emergency shelters, in a manner which
maximizes their ability to remain functional after a major earthquake.
Policy 18.7: Earthquake Safety Education
Provide earthquake safety information to citizens, property owners, and
volunteer groups.
   Action 18.A: Soil and Geotechnical Reporting Requirements
    Require soil and geotechnical reports for any structure constructed on a
    slope exceeding 20 percent, any application for a tentative subdivision
    map, and any new residence on any lot, regardless of slope.
   Action 18.B: Data Base of Geologic Reports
    Maintain any soil and geologic reports completed for development
    applications as public records. Keep records of the location and extent
    of areas covered by such reports and refer to these records as needed
    when future applications for development are made.
   Action 18.C: Incentives for Seismic Retrofits
    Consider a variety of incentives that encourage Piedmont residents to
    retrofit their homes for seismic safety. Incentives might include reduced
    fees for households seeking permits to replace brick foundations, install
    shear walls, or perform other seismic upgrades.
   Action 18.D: Post-Earthquake Structural Evaluation
    Continue the program providing for evaluation of structures following a
    major earthquake, and take appropriate actions in the event a structure
    is determined to be unsafe.

                      way that reduces the potential for residents to be exposed to high levels of
- General Plan Survey noise. Development along busy streets such as Grand Avenue and Oakland
Response              Avenue should include effective noise insulation measures for interior
                      spaces.
                      Policy 22.2: Noise Reduction Measures
                      Require new development with the potential to create long-term increases in
                      noise volumes to mitigate potential impacts. Noise reduction techniques,
                      such as sound muffling devices, building orientation, buffers, landscaping,
                      and acoustical barriers, should be used as appropriate.
                      Policy 22.3: Transportation Noise
                      Support efforts to mitigate the sources of transportation noise in the city,
                      especially AC Transit buses and other motor vehicles.

 Action 22.A: Noise Compatibility Guidelines
  Follow the noise compatibility guidelines in Table 6.4 for future
  development. The table specifies the maximum noise levels that are
  normally acceptable, conditionally acceptable, and normally
  unacceptable for new development. If a project is in a “normally
  acceptable” noise contour, an increase in noise up to the maximum
  should not necessarily be allowed. The impact of a proposed project on
  existing land uses should be evaluated in terms of the potential for
  adverse community impacts, regardless. The noise compatibility
  guidelines are intended to apply to post-construction conditions and
  exclude construction-related noise.
 Action 22.B: Acoustical Study Requirements
  On an ongoing basis, require acoustical studies for projects which could
  potentially elevate noise levels above the “normally acceptable” limits
  specified in Table 6.4, or introduce noise-sensitive uses in areas where
  the existing noise levels presently exceed the normally acceptable levels
  described in Table 6.4. Such analyses should be prepared by a qualified
  acoustical consultant and should include sufficient sampling data to
  adequately describe existing and future conditions.
 Action 22.C: Playfield Hours of Operation
  Define and enforce hours of operation for Piedmont Sports Field,
  Coaches Playfield, Linda Playfield, Dracena Park, and any other
  athletic fields that may be developed during future years. Noise levels at
  city parks should be periodically monitored to ensure that limits on
  hours of operation are sufficient to maintain neighborhood peace and
  quiet.
 Action 22.D: Enforcement of Noise Regulations
  Enforce rules and regulations pertaining to noise, including the
  California Motor Vehicle Code and Chapter 12 of the Piedmont
  Municipal Code. Continue to implement the Title 24 noise standard of
  45 dBA Ldn in all habitable rooms.

T        his chapter combines the state-mandated open space element with an optional element on
         parks and recreation. Parks are vital civic necessities and make a significant contribution
         to Piedmont’s quality of life. The city’s recreational programs provide activities and
facilities that enrich the lives of Piedmont residents in many ways.
Although “open space” represents only 7 percent of Piedmont’s land area, it accommodates a
broad range of activities. Recreation is probably the most familiar, but the city’s open spaces also
include portions of Mountain View Cemetery, the Oakland Rose Garden, Tyson Lake, and East
Bay Municipal Utility District land. Piedmont’s parks likewise accommodate many activities and
include settings ranging from tranquil redwood groves to the bustling Piedmont Recreation
Center.
The State General Plan Guidelines recognize four types of open space: (a) Open space used for
the preservation of natural resources, which includes wetlands, endangered species habitat, and
other environmentally sensitive areas; (b) Open space used for the managed production of
resources, such as forests, fisheries, and mining areas; (c) Open space for outdoor recreation; and
(d) Open space for public health and safety, such as flood plains and earthquake zones. Most of
the open space in Piedmont falls in the third category on this list and consists of city parks.
The Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Element addresses the following topics:
         Park planning and management
         Park operations and maintenance
         Recreational programming
         Joint use of City and School District recreational facilities

                                   City Parks
                                   Table 7-1 presents a list of parks in Piedmont. Figure 7-1 shows this
                                   information graphically. Piedmont has about 59 acres of parkland, for a ratio
                                   of 5.4 acres per 1,000 residents. This compares to a National Recreation and
                                   Park Association standard of 10 acres per 1,000 residents, although the
                                   national standard includes large regional parks.
                                   The City’s park acreage includes 44 acres of City-owned and operated parks.
                                   In addition, Davies Tennis Stadium (owned by the City of Oakland) and a
                                   portion of the Oakland Rose Garden, together occupying about six acres, are
                                   located in Piedmont. School recreational facilities, including playgrounds at
                                   Havens, Wildwood, and Beach Schools, and Witter Field (Piedmont High
                                   School) encompass another 8.5 acres, and are an important community asset.
                                   The city’s parks can be grouped into the following categories:
Piedmont Park is the site of major
community events such as the
annual Harvest Festival.           •   Community Parks. Community parks are typically more than 10 acres
                                       and have a service area radius of one to two miles. Such parks have a
                                       full complement of recreational facilities. Piedmont Park is the only
                                       local park that serves this function and is the city’s “flagship” park.
                                   •   Neighborhood Parks. Neighborhood parks are typically 3 to 10 acres,
                                       with a service area radius of ¼ to ½ mile. They serve surrounding
                                       neighborhoods with a limited number of recreational facilities and
                                       usually contain a field or lawn area, basketball courts, children’s play
                                       equipment, and picnic tables. Dracena, Hampton, and Linda Park/ Beach
                                       Playfield are considered neighborhood parks.
                                   •   Mini-Parks. Mini-parks are an acre or less and serve as passive open
                                       spaces. They are landscaped, and usually have benches and walking
                                       paths. Examples in Piedmont are Crocker Park and the Hall Fenway.
                                   •   Special Use Parks. Special use parks do not conform to an acreage
                                       standard or menu of recreational facilities. They support special
                                       functions such as athletic fields or swimming pools. Special Use Parks
                                       in Piedmont include Blair Park, Coaches Field, and the Piedmont
                                       Recreation Center.

 Piedmont’s Parks In A Nutshell
 Piedmont Park. Piedmont Park is the City’s “crown jewel” and is the
 largest park in the city. The park’s formal entry near Highland and
 Magnolia Avenues includes Piedmont’s historic Excedra Plaza. Behind
 the plaza, large sloping lawns surround the Mediterranean-style
 Piedmont Community Hall. Nearby, there is a Japanese Tea House in
 a meditative setting.
 The park includes a children’s playground, with a climbing structure, a
 sand pit, swings, benches, restrooms, a drinking fountain and a historic
 oak tree. It includes large rolling lawns that are used for picnics,
 community gatherings, and town ceremonies. There are also two
 tennis courts, a meandering trail along Bushy Dell Creek, and a dog
 run area. The stream banks are lined with towering redwood trees,
 creating a dense forest just a block away from the Civic Center.
 The park holds an important place in Piedmont history. In the late
 1800s, it was the site of the Piedmont Springs Hotel and included a rock
 grotto and mineral springs. The park’s history was commemorated in
 2007 with the dedication of a Centennial trail.
 Blair Park. Blair is the second largest park in Piedmont, with over 8
 acres of land. It is a natural, unlandscaped linear park used mainly by
 dog owners. The park runs parallel to Moraga Avenue in a canyon
 setting.
 Dracena Quarry Park. Dracena is Piedmont’s third largest park, at 7.8
 acres. The park was created from a reclaimed rock quarry and still
 retains its “bowl-shaped” topography. It includes a children’s
 playground with swings, a play structure, a climbing wall, a sand area
 and waterfall faucet, and a cement slide built into a grassy man-made
 hill. The park includes lawns and pathways, as well as steeper hillside
 areas. At the north end, there is a redwood grove, a picnic table, and
 a dog run, with shaded paths leading up to Dracena Avenue.
 Coaches Field/ Kennelly Skate Park. Coaches' Field, off Moraga
 Avenue, features a grassy play field frequently used by local youth
 soccer and softball teams. The field includes 70-foot base paths and a
 200-foot outfield, along with a 120’ x 180’ soccer field. Kennelly Skate
 Park is located behind the field and up a flight of steps. The Skate Park
 opened in 2001 and includes specially designed concrete ramps and
 bowls. BMX bicycle use is permitted on a limited schedule.

 Hampton / Piedmont Sports Field. Piedmont Sports Field is the only park
 located in the eastern part of Piedmont and is an important
 recreational resource for the entire city. The 2.4-acre park has a high-
 quality (although small) baseball field, with an outfield that is also used
 for children’s football and soccer. It also has two tennis courts and
 tennis practice backboards, a volleyball court, and a basketball court.
 A new recreation center building was constructed in 2000 to replace
 an older storage structure on the site. The building is used for
 recreational programs and by the Piedmont Cooperative Playschool.
 Crocker Park/ Hall Fenway. Crocker is a one-acre landscaped park in
 the estate area of Piedmont. It is intended primarily for passive
 recreational use. The park features a shaded lawn and beds of
 rhododendrons, camellias, azaleas, and ferns. The park is located on
 property that was once the home of Wallace Alexander, one of the
 city’s founding fathers. A granite sculpture of a bear and her cubs by
 noted sculptor Benny Bufano is located in the park. Across the street,
 the one-quarter acre Hall Fenway provides another passive open
 space with similar qualities and ambiance.
 Linda / Beach Playfield. The Linda Playfield is adjacent to Beach
 School and includes two tennis courts, a soccer/baseball field, a little
 tots play structure and sand pit, and picnic tables. There is also a

The fee classes division publishes and mails a catalog three times a year with
a complete listing of classes and programs. Fee classes are divided into pre-
school, children’s art, children’s sports, children’s music, dance, carpentry,
day camps, sports camps, adult fitness, and tennis. All fee classes are
designed to be self-supporting and the department has consistently met that
goal. The division also operates the facility and hall rental program for the
Community Hall, the Veterans Hall, and the Excedra Plaza.
The special programs division administers Schoolmates, PLAY, the teen
center, and an array of early childhood development programs (see text box
on prior page). It also organizes special activities such as the 4th of July
parade and Easter egg hunt, as well as canoe and rafting trips, and trips to
theme parks and professional ball games.
Piedmont also has a number of recreational sports leagues organized by
residents. These include the Piedmont Baseball Foundation, the Piedmont
Basketball Foundation, Skyline Lacrosse, the Softball Foundation, the Soccer
Club, the Piedmont Ladies Tennis Club, the Piedmont Swim Team, and
community organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America. These groups
provide additional recreational outlets for Piedmont residents.
OTHER OPEN SPACE
In addition to the parks described above, open space in Piedmont includes:
   The 8.3-acre East Bay Municipal Utility District property at the top of
    Blair Avenue. The property includes a large water storage tank that has
    been decommissioned as part of EBMUD’s seismic improvement
    program. The edges of the property are heavily wooded and provide a
    buffer for surrounding residences. The site may be available for reuse
    during the coming years (see Land Use Element).
   An additional 1.2 acres on scattered sites owned by EBMUD elsewhere
    in the city. Although these sites are used for infrastructure, their visual
    profile consists of open lots with trees, shrubs, and other vegetation.
   Approximately 6.3 acres of Mountain View Cemetery is in Piedmont.
    The land consists of open hillsides covered with grass, scrub, and trees.
    A majority of the 226-acre cemetery property is in Oakland.
   Medians and traffic islands, which encompass more than four acres on
    scattered sites in the city. Many of these spaces are landscaped and
    contribute to the visual beauty of Piedmont’s streets.

GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
Goal 23: Park Planning and Management
Provide attractive, high-quality parks that accommodate a wide
range of recreational needs.
Policies and Actions
Policy 23.1: Balancing Active and Passive Recreation
Provide a mix of active and passive recreational areas within the City’s
parks. The balance between active and passive uses should vary depending
on the type of park, its physical shape and accessibility, and its location and
physical features.
Policy 23.2: New and Expanded Parks
Consider opportunities for developing new parks and for expanding existing
parks if appropriate sites become available.
Policy 23.3: Environmentally-Sensitive Park Design
Design parks, trails, and other recreational facilities in Piedmont’s parks to
be compatible with the natural environment, including habitat, views, and
other environmental resources. New recreational buildings and other park
structures and facilities should be sited in a way that minimizes their impacts
on useable open space, avoids conflicts with existing park activities, and is
compatible with the natural setting. Park design should also be compatible
with city policies to reduce fuel loads and wildfire hazards.
See also policies in the Natural Resources and Sustainability Element on
creek protection, and policies in the Environmental Hazards Element on
vegetation management.
Policy 23.4: Park Architectural Standards
Maintain a high standard of architectural and design quality for any
permanent structure constructed in Piedmont’s parks, consistent with the
standards applied to private development in the community.
Policy 23.5: Americans With Disabilities Act Compliance
Consistent with federal law, ensure that future recreational facilities are
designed to meet the needs of persons with disabilities.

                              8 Design and Preservation
T       he Design and Preservation Element addresses Piedmont’s character, appearance, and
        historic resources. Although the California Government Code does not require a General
        Plan element on these topics, they are matters of great concern to Piedmont residents.
Issues such as aesthetics, view preservation, architectural quality and integrity, building scale and
height, exterior materials, privacy, and buffering are the focus of many Planning Commission
hearings and the source of much public discussion. General Plan policies can provide a
framework for the City’s design review program and a foundation for future community design
decisions.
Piedmont has an extraordinary architectural heritage; protecting this heritage is one of the major
functions of the City’s Planning Department. Over the years, the City Council has adopted
guidelines and procedures which promote the compatibility of new construction with existing
homes and neighborhoods. The City’s commitment to architecturally sensitive design has
enabled Piedmont to retain its image as one of the most attractive and desirable cities in
California.
Piedmont’s character is also shaped by its landscapes, its views and vistas, its parks, and its
streets and public spaces. Protecting and enhancing this “public realm” is a top civic priority.
General Plan policies on the aesthetics of public space can help guide long-term decisions on
issues such as undergrounding of overhead utility lines, landscaping of public spaces, public art,
and view protection.
Historic preservation is another important aspect of community design. Older buildings and sites
provide a tangible link to history and can expand our understanding of the places we live. The
styles, materials, and tastes of past inhabitants place our own lives in context. Preservation
provides a tool for strengthening a city’s sense of identity. There are also practical benefits to
preservation, including economic value, environmental sustainability, and aesthetics.
The goals, policies, and actions in this element address the following key topics:
        City Identity and Aesthetics
        Residential Architecture
        Yards and Landscapes
        Archaeological Resources
        Historic Preservation
        Preservation Advocacy and Awareness

DESIGN AND PRESERVATION
ELEMENT
 Neighborhood Typologies in Piedmont
 Although Piedmont contains many different architectural styles, its
 neighborhoods can be broadly grouped into the following five
 typologies:
 Bungalow and cottage neighborhoods include areas west of Grand
 Avenue and areas just above Oakland’s Grand Lake district. They
 are characterized by small lots of less than 5,000 square feet. Much
 of the housing stock is over 90 years old. Housing is eclectic, and
 includes a mix of small one-story bungalows and cottages, larger
 brown-shingle homes, former farmhouses, Victorians, and a handful
 of small apartment buildings. Although these are Piedmont’s most
 urban areas, they still retain a small town ambience.
 Streetcar suburbs include most of the tracts developed between
 incorporation (1907) and 1930. This is the dominant neighborhood
 type in Piedmont. Neighborhoods are characterized by 5,000 to
 15,000 square feet lots and include many Mediterranean Revival,
 Brown Shingle, Tudor, Prairie Style, and Colonial Revival homes
 developed on a modified street grid. Some blocks are
 characterized by a single style; others are eclectic. Many homes
 were built with one-car garages or detached rear-yard garages.
 Estate neighborhoods are characterized by large lots with spacious
 homes. Included are the Sotelo-Glen Alpine “loop” and Seaview
 and King Avenues—streets lined with grand and elegant homes that
 convey an image of tradition. Many lots exceed ½ acre and are
 heavily wooded, creating a semi-rural feel. These areas contain
 some of Piedmont’s most memorable homes, and showcase some
 of the finest work of early 20th Century California architects.
 Hillside neighborhoods are located on the steep slopes of eastern
 Piedmont and are characterized by winding narrow streets and
 multi-level hillside homes. Many of the homes incorporate
 contemporary architectural styles and are designed to maximize
 views. However, the area also includes century-old homes that
 harken to the days when Piedmont was considered “the country”
 and was home to many artists and writers.
 Mid-century neighborhoods include St. James Wood and other
 areas of eastern Piedmont that were primarily developed after 1940.
 While these areas include some “traditional” pre-war architecture,
 they are characterized by more contemporary California ranch
 homes. Many of the homes were designed with open floor plans,
 post and beam construction, attached two-car garages, shake
 roofs, and other features and amenities associated with the 1950s
 and 60s. One-story construction predominates in these areas.

Trees vs Views
                                Visual landmarks are structures or landscape features that provide orientation
                                and identity. They may be located within the city or they may be on the
                                horizon. Important landmarks in Piedmont include the Oakland Avenue
                                Bridge, the Civic Center complex, the Excedra at Piedmont Park, Piedmont
                                Community Hall, the allee of trees along Oakland Avenue, and the city’s

                                identity are the Oakland and San Francisco skylines, the Golden Gate and

                                Views to these horizon features are an important part of the city’s character.

          DESIGN AND PRESERVATION
          ELEMENT
          PUBLIC REALM
          Piedmont’s “public realm” includes city streets, parking strips, sidewalks,
          parks and plazas, civic buildings, and other areas within the public rights-of-
          way. The appearance and physical condition of these areas shapes the city’s
          image in the same way that private properties do. Design details such as
          pavement, street lights, benches, trash receptacles, newspaper stands, bike
          racks, and street signs are all important public realm elements. Their style,
          color, and materials can help otherwise unremarkable areas stand out in a
          positive light. Their level of maintenance provides an indicator to residents
          about the quality of services and life in the community.
          The 2007 General Plan Resident Survey found that Piedmont residents take
          great pride in the quality of the city’s public spaces, particularly its parks,
          landscaped medians, and planted street islands and triangles. Aesthetics
          ranked fourth in the Survey’s query of what residents liked best about

City Hall effort is necessary to keep public space in top condition, while at the same
          time responding to fiscal constraints and meeting competing goals such as
          water conservation and a shift toward native landscaping.
          Specific elements of the public realm are highlighted below.
          Landscaping
          Landscaping is an important part of community aesthetics and complements
          the city’s architectural heritage. Piedmont’s parks and rights of way are
          maintained by the Department of Public Works, with assistance from
          volunteer organizations such as the Piedmont Beautification Foundation and
          the Piedmont Garden Club (see text box, next page).
          Piedmont’s ordinances also encourage, and in some cases require, the
          landscaping of private property. For residential uses, lots are required to
          have not less than 30% of the site devoted to landscaping (40% in the estate
          zone), and all required street setbacks must be landscaped. The requirement
          is 20 % for commercia1 uses, with at least 75 % of the requirement satisfied
          in the front setback. Applications for conditional use permits, new
          residences, and other large projects that substantially change existing
          vegetation must include landscape plans.

                        for undergrounding, 17 percent were “strongly opposed.” Many residents
                        were concerned about the additional tax burden and initial costs.

                           The Piedmont City Council adopted Residential Design Guidelines in 1988.
                           The Guidelines are intended for use by the Planning Commission, City
                           Planning staff, and the general public to ensure that construction projects are
                           properly related to their sites, surroundings, and broader community setting.
                           Five categories of construction are addressed:
                               New construction, which includes new homes, reconstructed homes, and

                           The guidelines consider aesthetic design, compatibility, and safety for each
                           feature. These attributes are evaluated at three different geographic scales:
                           (a) the neighborhood; (b) adjacent parcels; and (c) the site itself. Illustrations

             Conditions which substantially detract from the appearance of a
             neighborhood or which may impair surrounding property values are
             prohibited by Section 6.1 of the City Code. The City requires abatement of
             deteriorating structures, nuisances, and blight. City regulations address
             weeds and overgrown vegetation; exterior debris such as boxes and lumber;
             disabled or mothballed vehicles, boats, and trailers in yards; unsafe or
             unsightly buildings; and other property conditions which could diminish the
             enjoyment or aesthetics of adjacent properties. The City has the authority to
             abate such nuisances at the expense of the property owner, including the use
             of liens.
             The City is responsible for maintaining its own property, including city

                           (known as historic districts). Federally listed properties are eligible for tax
                           benefits. The State of California also has tax reduction programs for historic
                           properties. For example, the Mills Act involves a 10-year contract between a
                           City and a property owner to provide property tax relief in exchange for
                           restoration and maintenance of a historic structure.
                           Most preservation programs are based on standards for the treatment of
                           historic properties developed by the US Department of the Interior (see next
                           page). These standards distinguish between preservation, rehabilitation,
                           restoration, and reconstruction. In fact, Piedmont’s Residential Design

The US Department of the Interior has developed standards intended to promote responsible
preservation practices by local governments across the country. These standards identify four
possible “treatments” for historic resources, defined below:
Preservation places a high premium on the retention of historic fabric through conservation,
maintenance and repair. It reflects a building's continuum over time, through successive
occupancies, and the respectful changes and alterations that are made.
Rehabilitation emphasizes the retention and repair of historic materials, but more latitude is provided
for replacement because it is assumed the property is more deteriorated prior to work. Both
Preservation and Rehabilitation standards focus attention on the preservation of those materials,
features, finishes, spaces, and spatial relationships that, together, give a property its historic
character.
Restoration focuses on the retention of materials from the most significant time in a property's history,
while permitting the removal of materials from other periods.
Reconstruction establishes limited opportunities to re-create a non-surviving site, landscape, building,
structure, or object in all new materials.
A set of design principles has been developed by the Secretary of the Interior for each of the
treatments listed above. Choosing the most appropriate treatment requires an evaluation of a
building's historical significance, as well as other factors such as its relative importance in history, its
physical condition, its proposed use, and mandated code requirements.

                           These are the goals of the Piedmont Historical Society (PHS), a non-profit

DESIGN AND PRESERVATION
ELEMENT
GOALS, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS
Goal 27: City Identity and Aesthetics
Ensure that streets, parks, civic buildings, and other aspects of the
“public realm” contribute to Piedmont’s overall identity, beauty
and visual quality.
Policies and Actions
Policy 27.1: Streets as Public Space
Recognize that streets are important public spaces as well as transportation
routes. Sidewalks, street trees, landscaping, and other amenities should be
provided and maintained to keep these spaces attractive.
Policy 27.2: Sidewalks and Planting Strips
Manage sidewalk space and planting strips along Piedmont streets to
promote pedestrian safety and comfort, enhance visual character, and reduce
the impact of vehicle traffic on adjacent yards.
See also Transportation Element policies on sustaining a pedestrian friendly
city, and on siting parking lots to the rear of non-residential buildings rather
than in the front setback.
Policy 27.3: View Preservation
Recognize and protect significant views in the city, particularly Piedmont’s
characteristic views of the San Francisco and Oakland skylines, Lake Merritt
and San Francisco Bay, the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, and surrounding
hills, canyons, and geological features. Discourage the obstruction of such
views by upper level additions, tall structures, and devices such as
communication towers. Similarly, tree planting should avoid species or
locations that will lead to the obstruction of desirable views.
Policy 27.4: City Gateways
Create more distinctive and memorable points of entry into the city to
provide a stronger sense of arrival and define city edges.
Policy 27.5: Beautification Efforts
Support local beautification and median planting efforts by neighborhood
and community groups.

                                in important civic spaces and visitor areas. Such art should reflect the city’s
                                history, character, landscape, and people.
                                Policy 27.7: Street Lighting
                                Provide street lighting that improves public safety and assists travelers while
                                also enhancing neighborhood character. Street lights should complement the

             architecture of adjoining residences. Adverse visual effects of fences and
             walls on adjacent properties should be minimized.

             Minimize the visual prominence of retaining walls by requiring construction
             in a stepped or terraced fashion where feasible. Landscaping should be used
             as necessary to minimize the visual impact of larger walls.

             Locate driveways and off-street parking areas in a manner that minimizes
             their visual prominence and avoids front yards dominated by parked cars,
Olive Avenue paved surfaces, and garage doors. Driveways should also be located to
             minimize the need for grading, paving, and tall retaining walls.
             Policy 29.8: Exterior Lighting
             Discourage excessive or overly bright exterior lighting and lighting which
             could interfere with motorist safety. Exterior yard lighting should be
             designed to avoid spillover on to adjacent properties.

                     Ensure that planning and building decisions, including zoning and design
                     review approvals, are sensitive to historic resources and promote the
                     conservation of Piedmont’s historic neighborhoods. The demolition of
                     historically important structures shall be strongly discouraged.
                     Policy 31.3: Context-Sensitive Design
                     Ensure that the repair, maintenance, and expansion of Piedmont’s historically
                     important structures uses appropriate materials and architectural details and
                     respects historic context.
                     Policy 31.4: Restoration
                     Promote the restoration of original period details to older Piedmont homes
                     and where feasible, the modification of exterior alterations that were
                     unsympathetic to the original design of the home.
                     Policy 31.5: Older Public Buildings

                     Policy 31.6: Historic Landscapes
                     Preserve important historic landscape features, including parks, landscaped
                     traffic islands, and neighborhood entry pillars dating back to Piedmont’s
                     early subdivisions. Ensure that new public works such as street lights, street
                     furniture, and sidewalks are compatible with the historic context of
                     Piedmont’s neighborhoods.

                     Goal 32: Preservation Advocacy and Awareness
                     Raise public awareness of Piedmont’s history and historic
                     resources, both locally and throughout the Bay Area.
                     Policies and Actions
                     Policy 32.1: Documentation of Historic Resources
                     As resources allow, conduct surveys and inventories of Piedmont’s historic
                     resources, using criteria and survey methods that are consistent with state and
                     federal guidelines.
                     Policy 32.2: Preservation Education
                     Provide outreach to Piedmont residents on the cultural, physical, and social
                     history of the city. Promote understanding not only of Piedmont history, but

                     also of the community benefits of historic preservation.
                     Policy 32.3: Preservation Partnerships
                     Create partnerships between the City of Piedmont, the Piedmont Historical
                     Society, the Piedmont Unified School District, other community groups, and
                     the private sector to advance historic preservation activities in the city.
                     Policy 32.4: Historic Plaques and Markers
                     Support the identification of historically important properties through
                     plaques, markers, and heritage trails.
                     Policy 32.5: Historic Resource Media
                     Encourage the development of books, videos, brochures, display exhibits,
                     websites, and other media that increase awareness of historic sites and
                     structures.
                     Policy 32.6: Preservation Events
                     Promote preservation awards, festivals, conferences, walking tours and other

DESIGN AND PRESERVATION
ELEMENT
 Action 32.A: Roster of Historic Properties
  Work collaboratively with the Piedmont Historical Society to expand the
  locally maintained roster of historically important structures in
  Piedmont. The City’s historic surveys and on-line data base of Piedmont
  properties should be expanded as resources allow. Future surveys should
  utilize generally accepted practices for defining what is “historic” and
  for cataloguing historic resources.
 Action 32.B: Nomination of Additional Properties
  Consider the nomination of additional Piedmont structures to the
  National Register of Historic Places, and the listing of structures or sites
  as California Points of Historical Interest, California Historical
  Landmarks, or California Register of Historical Resources landmarks.
  Any proposals for designation should be done systematically and
  consistently, in consultation with property owners and the general
  public.
 Action 32.C: Certified Local Government Program
  Study the feasibility of becoming a “Certified Local Government” (CLG)
  to promote historic preservation at the grass roots level. Becoming a
  CLG would make Piedmont eligible for federal and state funds that
  support preservation activities, including education and surveying.
 Action 32.D: Historic Data in the GIS
  As resources allow, expand information on historic resources as a data
  layer in the city’s geographic information system (GIS).
 Action 32.E: Teaching Piedmont History
  Work collaboratively with the Piedmont Historical Society, the Piedmont
  Unified School District, and other community groups to maintain the
  history room at the Piedmont Recreation Center, and to continue efforts
  to teach Piedmont students about the history of the city.

T        he Community Services and Facilities Element addresses Piedmont’s municipal buildings,
         public safety services, educational facilities, and social services. It also covers
         infrastructure, including water, sewer, storm drainage, energy, and telecommunication
facilities. While state law does not explicitly require this Element, these topics are integral to
long-range planning. A commitment to providing superior police and fire services, exceptional
schools, excellent child care and senior services, and well maintained utilities is essential to
achieve Piedmont’s broader quality of life objectives.
Piedmont’s population is expected to be stable during the next two decades. Nonetheless,
continued investment in public facilities will be needed to sustain existing service levels,
incorporate new technology, and respond to changing demographics. Intergovernmental
coordination is essential to service planning, as the City of Piedmont is only one of several
entities involved. Other key agencies include the Piedmont Unified School District, the City of
Oakland Library system, East Bay Municipal District, Pacific Gas and Electric, and a myriad of
County agencies and non-profits.
The Community Services and Facilities Element addresses the following topics:
         City Facilities
         Public safety (Police and Fire)
         Educational services (Schools and Libraries)
         Social services (Child Care and Senior Care)
         Infrastructure (Water, Sewer, Storm Drainage, and Energy)
Major community facilities are identified in Figure 9.1.

                                equipment storage and vehicle maintenance.
                                Although Piedmont’s population has remained stable for the past 50 years, its
                                administrative space needs have increased. The addition of new staff and
                                new technology has strained City Hall’s capacity. The City has reconfigured
                                interior spaces and added offices in former storage areas in response. If the
                                Civic Center Master Plan is implemented as proposed (See Chapter 3), it is
                                possible that space now used for recreation may be freed up for other
                                purposes.

                                 criminal incidents, and includes an array of proactive services that keep
                                 residents safe. The Department responds to home security alarm calls,

                                             Crime is influenced by a number of factors, including the city’s proximity to
                                             higher-crime urban neighborhoods in the inner East Bay, and easy access in
                                             and out of the city. On the other hand, the small number of commercial uses
                                             and lack of major trip generators tend to limit the transient population, which
                                             keeps the crime rate low.
                                             The Piedmont Police Department works collaboratively with citizens to
                                             address public safety and law enforcement issues. It must constantly stay
                                             aware of trends in criminal activity (such as the rise in identity theft and
                                             internet-related crime) and the most effective crime prevention and response
                                             methods. Ongoing training and education is an essential part of the
                                             Department’s mission and is required of all personnel.
                                             The Police Department is space-constrained in its current quarters, which
                                             were not initially designed for law enforcement. Space needs have increased
                                             during the last 25 years due to the addition of personnel, technology, and
                                             communication equipment, but the floor area available has remained the
                                             same. Options for reconfiguring the existing space are being explored.

                      Fire and EMS
                      The Piedmont Fire Department was founded in 1909 as a volunteer
                      department. Today, its full-time professional staff of 25 includes a chief,
                      three captains, three lieutenants, three engineers, ten firefighter/ paramedics,
                      and five firefighters. The Piedmont Fire Station is located within City Hall at
                      120 Vista Avenue. Fire fighting equipment includes two engines, one 65’
                      aerial ladder truck, two ambulances (one front line and one reserve), one
                      utility truck, and one command vehicle. Equipment is periodically replaced
                      and updated through the General Fund.
Piedmont Fire Station
                      The Fire Department shares the 911 emergency calling and dispatching
                      system with the Police Department. The dispatch and business offices are
                      linked to the Oakland Police and Fire Department’s 800 MHz Computer
                      Aided Dispatch system.
                      In the event of an emergency or disaster, back-up is provided through mutual
                      aid agreements with surrounding communities. These agreements are
                      reciprocal, meaning that Piedmont firefighters may be called on to respond to
                      emergencies in Oakland and nearby cities. Mutual aid agreements are
                      periodically reviewed and updated.
                      The Piedmont Fire Department places a strong emphasis on training and
                      readiness, fire prevention and safety, and community emergency
                      preparedness. The Department conducts scenario-based training drills and
                      first responder hazardous materials training. Much of the continuing
                      education and training is mandated by State agencies. The Department also
                      answers fire prevention inquiries, interprets fire codes, and assists the
                      Building Department with plan checking.
                      The Fire Department provides many public safety services for Piedmont
                      residents. It offers guidance on the proper installation and operation of
                      smoke detectors and home fire extinguishers. It operates a battery recycling
                      program in conjunction with Alameda County, a bicycle licensing program, a
                      rapid entry lock-box program which enables firefighters and paramedics to
                      access homes in the event of an emergency, a Safely Surrendered Baby
                      Program for unwanted newborns, and a Vial-of-Life program for residents
                      with emergency medical needs. CPR and first aid programs are also offered
                      by request to all Piedmont residents age 12 or older. The Department also
                      sponsors special events such as Fire Prevention Week and operates public
                      school programs for Piedmont youth.

                         Trends and Issues
                         The Piedmont Fire Department responds to approximately 1,100 service calls
                         each year. Average response time is two minutes for EMS calls. The
                         number of calls per year has gone up by about 20 percent since the early
                         1990s, while the population has remained about the same. The increased
                         volume is the result of a number of factors, such as greater access to mobile
                         communication (e.g., cell phones), the aging of the population (more medical
                         emergencies), and changing public expectations and demands.
                         As of 2003, the most recent year of measure, the Insurance Services Office
                         gave the Piedmont Fire Department a rating of 3, an excellent score that has
                         resulted in favorable insurance costs. The ISO rating is based on a number of
                         factors, such as staffing, response time, training, fire alarm and
                         communication capacity, equipment, hydrants, and water pressure and
                         availability. Ratings range from 1 (highest) to 10 (lowest).
                         In a given year, approximately 70 percent of the calls to the Piedmont Fire
                         Department are medically-related, and 30 percent are fire or utility related.

                         losses due to fire. There were no losses in 2005 and 2006 and an estimated
                         $83,500 in losses in 2007. The annual loss has not exceeded $500,000 once
                         in the last 10 years. Over the last two decades, the Department has seen a
                         greater emphasis on prevention and education, including activities such as
                         CPR, wildfire prevention, and disaster preparedness.

Given the limited changes in projected population and employment in
Piedmont during the next 20 years, the existing Fire Station is expected to
remain adequate to serve local needs. However, the station was constructed
almost 100 years ago. Although it has been modernized, it would benefit
from updated offices and sleeping quarters and other improvements. There is
also a continuing need to replace vehicles and apparatus, and to modernize
the station and its communication systems to respond to technological and
operational changes.

EDUCATION

   Public Schools
   Piedmont is renowned throughout the Bay Area for its excellent public
   schools. The General Plan Survey found that “school quality” was one of the
   things residents liked best about Piedmont and that schools were the top
   reason people moved to the city. Local support has been consistently
   demonstrated through voter approval of parcel taxes and bond measures
   enabling an array of educational services, programs, and amenities.
   The Piedmont Unified School District (PUSD) had modest beginnings. At
   the time of the city’s incorporation in 1907, local schools were unable to
   cope with the demand for classroom space. Many pupils attended schools in
   Oakland for an annual fee of $25. When the Piedmont School District was
   formed, it adopted the same boundaries as those of the City, but with
   administrative and taxing power completely independent of the City Council.
   The PUSD remains a separate entity today.
   A five member Board of Education oversees District operations. The Board
   is responsible for developing educational policy and reviewing and
   approving the school budget. It also approves additions and alterations to
   buildings, determines what new buildings are built, and manages
   construction financing. Board members also serve as committee members
   and liaisons to other groups, including the Piedmont City Council.

Piedmont’s Public Schools
Piedmont Unified School District is one of the largest landowners in the City, and is Piedmont’s largest
employer. Its campuses encompass a total of 25 acres and employ over 360 highly experienced
teachers, support staff, and administrators. The District enrolls approximately 2,600 K-12 students and also
operates an adult school on the Piedmont High School campus. Facilities are profiled below.
                                Piedmont High School. PHS is located on Magnolia Avenue in the Civic
                                Center area. The school was originally built in 1921 and has undergone
                                several major reconstructions to accommodate expansion, earthquake
                                retrofitting, and structural repairs. Today the campus includes seven
                                buildings, along with Witter Field.
                                Millennium High School and the Piedmont Adult School operate from the
                                PHS campus. Millennium is an alternative high school for students with
                                special needs. The Adult School has operated from PHS for over 30 years
                                and offers more than 250 evening and weekend classes.
                                Piedmont Middle School adjoins the high school campus. The School was
                                built in 1973-1975, with a science building and multi-purpose building
                                added in 1994-1995. The original structure contains three wings: Buildings
                                A, B, and C. The mid-1990s additions more than doubled the school’s floor

                                Egbert W. Beach Elementary School is located on Lake Street at Linda
                                Avenue in the western part of the City. The school contains approximately
                                30,000 square feet of floor area and consists of a large main building
                                constructed in the mid-1930s and an addition built in 1995. Facilities
                                include classrooms, a library, a playground, and an auditorium.
                                Frank C. Havens Elementary School is located on Oakland Avenue at
                                Bonita. Havens is made up of five buildings with a total of almost 47,000
                                square feet, and includes a large playground. The school was constructed
                                in phases between 1935 and 1998 and will be largely reconstructed in
                                2009-2010. Havens includes the Ellen Driscoll Theater, built in 1940 and
                                used as a performing arts auditorium for almost 70 years.
                                Wildwood Elementary School is located at Wildwood Avenue at
                                Portsmouth. The school occupies 14,700 square feet on a 2.4-acre site.
                                Wildwood consists of a classroom wing originally built in the 1930s and a
                                new two-story addition built in 1995. Wildwood also includes an

                           higher than it was in 1984-85, when it dipped to 1,905 students. In 2008,
                           about 42 percent of the students were enrolled at the three elementary
                           schools (K-5), 23 percent at the middle school (6-8), and 35 percent at the
                           high school (9-12).
                           In Piedmont, shifts in enrollment are principally due to demographic changes
                           rather than residential development. The number of students in any given
                           year depends on birth rates, trends in the general population, and who is
                           moving in and out of the city. Enrollment is expected to be fairly constant in
                           the coming years, as household size in Piedmont is projected to be relatively
                           stable. Because Piedmont is built out, increases related to new housing are
                           expected to be minimal.
                           One of the major physical planning issues facing the District is the
                           modernization and upgrading of facilities. In 2000, PUSD began a
                           comprehensive review of the seismic safety of its schools. In 2005, two
                           independent structural engineering reports confirmed the potential for
                           substantial earthquake-related safety risks. Common deficiencies included
                           overstressed or insufficient shear walls, weak interior walls, and inadequate
                           column beam joints and roof diaphragm connections.

                                                 A $56 million bond measure (Measure E) was approved by Piedmont voters
                                                 in March 2006 to finance the repair, strengthening, and renovation of specific
                                                 facilities on all five PUSD campuses. Subsequent evaluations were
                                                 performed to prioritize improvements and develop a master construction
                                                 schedule. Measure E included a series of general obligation bond issues,
                                                 beginning in 2006 and ending in 2010. The School Board has formed a
                                                 Measure E Steering Committee, a Technical Advisory Committee, and a
                                                 Citizens Oversight Committee. Additionally, a public engagement effort has
                                                 been set up to educate the community about the project (see text box in the

                                                 Another major planning challenge is integrating technology into curriculum
                                                 and facilities. In 2007, the District adopted a three-year technology plan to
                                                 guide the acquisition of computers and the upgrade of telecommunication
                                                 systems. The Plan recognizes the power of technology to solve problems and
                                                 its importance in helping students communicate and learn.

                      Despite historic resident support for parcel taxes, the PUSD operates in a
                      fiscally constrained environment. Approximately 70 percent of its budget
                      comes from state funding. Parcel taxes alone do not make up the shortfall
                      required to fund school operations. Since 1975, the non-profit Piedmont
                      Educational Foundation has provided supplemental funds for operations, and
                      has offered grants and endowments for Piedmont students. The Foundation’s
                      focus is on educational enrichment, and maintaining standards of academic
                      excellence in the Piedmont school system.

Corpus Christi School In addition to Piedmont Unified School District facilities, there are two
                      parochial schools in the city. Corpus Christi School on Park Boulevard
                      enrolls approximately 275 students in Grades K-8. Also on Park Boulevard,
                      Zion Lutheran School enrolls about 170 K-8 students.
                      Library Services
                      The City of Piedmont does not have its own public library. Piedmont
                      contracts with the City of Oakland to provide library services through the
                      Main Library in Downtown Oakland and various Oakland branches. The
                      branches closest to Piedmont are on 41st Street (Piedmont Avenue) and on
                      Mountain Boulevard (Montclair). Piedmont pays an annual fee to Oakland
                      that is approximately equal to the per capita cost paid by Oakland residents.
                      On several occasions, the City has formally studied the feasibility of creating
                      its own municipal library. These studies have consistently resulted in the
                      decision to continue the current arrangement with the City of Oakland,
                      primarily because it was more economical. The existing library contract has
                      no term and can be canceled once a year.

                                                  children five years and under. This effort has included an assessment of

                                                  estimates are based on countywide multipliers, and that there may be factors
                                                  in Piedmont that reduce the magnitude (such as in-home child care
                                                  providers). Nonetheless, a slight increase in the number of infants, toddlers,
                                                  and pre-schoolers in Piedmont is projected during the coming years,
                                                  potentially leading to further increases in demand.
                                                  As noted in the Parks, Recreation, and Open Space Element, the Recreation
                                                  Department offers a wide range of child care programs, serving targeted age
                                                  groups ranging from infants to pre-teens. These programs meet an important
                                                  need in the city and will be sustained in the future.
                                                  There are also licensed private child care providers within Piedmont. The
                                                  City allows small family child care homes with up to 8 children and large
                                                  family child care homes with up to 14 children in any residence “by right.” 1  F F

Storm Drainage
Piedmont’s storm drainage system is owned and maintained by the City.
Prior to the 1940s, Piedmont had a combined storm sewer and sanitary sewer
system. With the completion of the EBMUD treatment plant, all cities were
required to separate the two systems. Although this was accomplished over
50 years ago, there are still some resident storm drains that are illegally
connected to the sanitary system. Any remaining illegal connections are
being removed as the sanitary sewers are being replaced.
Because of Piedmont’s hilly terrain, the storm sewer system relies on curbs,
gutters, and natural drainage to augment the piped system. Runoff generally
flows toward the city’s swales and creeks, ultimately reaching Lake Merritt,
the Tidal Channel, the Oakland Estuary, and San Francisco Bay.
Surface drainage has a number of negative impacts, including soil erosion
and water pollution associated with oil, grease, and other materials picked up
by runoff. The City participates in the County Clean Water Program to
mitigate these impacts and to meet Regional Water Quality Control Board
requirements. The City also works with the Lake Merritt Institute to address
stormwater runoff from Piedmont and Oakland.
Because flood hazards in Piedmont are minimal, the city is not part of the
Alameda County Flood Control and Water Conservation District. During
very heavy rains, localized street flooding may occur where storm drainage
flows exceed the capacity of an inlet or pipe. The City maintains these
facilities regularly and performs street sweeping to minimize such incidents.
Please see the Natural Resources and Sustainability Element for a discussion
of the Clean Water (stormwater quality) program, and the Environmental
Hazards Element for a discussion of flood hazards.

   Goal 33: Municipal Facilities and Governance
   Provide and maintain high-quality community facilities that allow
   the efficient delivery of City services.
   Policies and Actions
   Policy 33.1: Municipal Real Estate
   Ensure that the City of Piedmont owns and retains a sufficient amount of
   land to meet the long-term operational needs of municipal government.
   Policy 33.2: Co-location
   When constructing any new public facility or remodeling an existing facility,
   explore opportunities to co-locate multiple community services in that
   facility, provided the uses are functionally compatible. Given Piedmont’s
   small size and limited capital budget, this may increase the feasibility of
   particular types of facilities, such as a teen center or senior center.
   Policy 33.3: Sharing Municipal Services
   Where economies of scale and substantial cost savings are possible, partner
   with the City of Oakland or other nearby cities to provide services and
   address community needs.
   Policy 33.4: Operation and Maintenance of City Facilities
   To the greatest extent feasible, ensure that adequate funds are provided in the
   annual budget for the operation and maintenance of community facilities and
   infrastructure.
   Policy 33.5: Capital Improvement Revenue
   Consider the use of special elections for parcel taxes, bond measures, or
   other assessments necessary to generate revenue to improve public facilities.
   Policy 33.6: Customer Service
   Deliver city services in a manner that creates and reinforces positive
   relationships between City employees, residents, businesses, and other
   stakeholders.

                                                        INTRODUCTION
                                            LEGAL BASIS FOR THE ELEMENT
                                            This Housing Element has been structured to meet the requirements of the
                                            California Government Code. Article 10.6, Section 65583 of the
                                            Government Code provides specific guidelines for the topics to be covered
                                            and analyses to be performed. The 2015 Piedmont Housing Element has
                                            been formatted so that relevant sections of the Government Code appear in
                                            margin sidebars throughout the document. Broadly speaking, the
                                            Government Code requires the Element to evaluate the current housing
                                            market in the city and identify programs specifically tailored to local housing
                                            needs. The document must also evaluate the past Housing Element and
                                            consider its successes and shortcomings.
                                            Consistency With Other Elements of the General Plan
                                            The other Elements of the Piedmont General Plan are Land Use; Transport-
                                            ation; Natural Resources and Sustainability; Environmental Hazards; Parks,

                                            prior Housing Element was adopted in June 2011, but most work on the
local housing needs.                        document took place in 2009 and early 2010. This allowed the General Plan
                                            update and the Housing Element to be closely synchronized.
                                            State law requires that policies in the Housing Element do not conflict with
                                            policies in the other elements of the General Plan. Because the Housing
                                            Element was initially prepared as part of a continuing process that included
                                            these other elements, there is a high level of integration between the
                                            documents and they are fully consistent. The Housing Element helps
                                            advance the City’s land use policies, requires no changes to the City’s

                                            General Plan.1
                                            Although the Housing Element is part of the General Plan, it stands on its
                                            own as a separate document because of the State requirements for data and
                                            analysis. These requirements substantially increase the length of the Element

was determined that there would be no significant environmental impacts as
a result of adopting the Element.
Regional Housing Needs Allocation Process
The State of California has established a process to determine each
community’s “fair share” of the region’s future housing needs. In the Bay
Area, this process is managed by the Association of Bay Area Governments
(ABAG). ABAG represents 101 cities and nine Bay Area counties with a
combined population of 7.4 million residents. In 2012, the State determined
that 187,990 new housing units would be needed between 2014 and 2022 to
meet the Bay Area’s housing demand. During 2013, each jurisdiction in the
region was assigned a share of these units by ABAG. This assignment was
based on a formula that considered projected household growth, job growth,
land supply, infrastructure and environmental constraints, real estate market
conditions, and the availability of public transit. Piedmont’s assignment for
the 2014-2022 period was 60 new housing units. Although the assignment
covers 2014-2022, the State has identified a planning period extending from
January 31, 2015 through January 31, 2023 to meet this demand.
Under State law, each jurisdiction must use its Housing Element to show that
there are sufficient opportunities to accommodate their assignment within the
community. The RHNA process does not require the City to actually build
the housing units—rather, it requires that the City create the opportunity for
the private and non-profit sectors to build this quantity of housing. An
important part of the Housing Element is demonstrating that the City’s
zoning codes, fees, and other regulations do not stand in the way of meeting
its assignments.
The RHNA assignment for each city is further broken down by income type.
In other words, the 60 units assigned to Piedmont include a specific number
of units that should be affordable to very low, low, moderate, and above
moderate income households. ABAG has structured the allocation of units by
income to more evenly balance lower income housing across the region.
This means that more affluent communities get larger percentages of lower
income units in their assignments. In Piedmont’s case, the assignment
includes 24 very low, 14 low, 15 moderate, and 7 above moderate income
units. The definition of these income categories and the implications of this
assignment are described at length in Chapter 3 of the Housing Element.

          INTRODUCTION
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
In accordance with the Government Code, the City of Piedmont solicited
public input from all economic segments of the community throughout
preparation of the Housing Element. The Planning Commission was the
primary conduit for public comment. An introductory study session took
place in October 2013. Subsequent study sessions took place in January,
February, April, and May, 2014, with each session focusing on a different
chapter of the Element. A study session with the Piedmont City Council was
held in May 2014.
Housing Element study sessions were publicized through community
newspapers, posting of meeting notices at City Hall and on the City’s
website, and e-mails to an “interested parties” mailing list that was
maintained and expanded throughout the process. The interested parties list
included roughly 100 names, including several local architects, preservation
advocates, the Housing Consortium of the East Bay (a housing non-profit
representing the East Bay region), second unit owners, the Piedmont Civic
Association, and the local media. The City also reached out to
representatives of the City’s three churches and one synagogue to encourage
their involvement. Meetings were televised on local access cable (KCOM),
potentially reaching most Piedmont households. Meetings could also be
viewed on-line via streaming video, both in real-time and on-demand.
Piedmont residents and other interested parties were invited to attend each
Planning Commission work session, and were provided with opportunities to
review and comment on each working draft chapter of the element as it was
completed. Working drafts were posted on the City’s website throughout
2014. The City’s email notification list included Piedmont residents,
regional housing advocates, social welfare organizations, and local non-
profits, as well as members of the City Council.
On June 26, the City hosted a “Town Hall Meeting” on the Housing Element.
The meeting was widely publicized, with feature articles in both the
Piedmont Post and the Piedmonter (see Appendix). The City also mailed
letters to all addresses with a registered second unit, inviting both owners and
tenants to the meeting. In addition, the City mailed letters to each house of
worship in Piedmont, and encouraged members of the faith community to
attend. Notice of the meeting also took place via email and the posting of a
meeting announcement at City Hall. The City’s website was revised so that
an announcement of the meeting appeared as the top item on the home page
for a period of about 10 days.
The well-attended meeting included a presentation on the Housing Element,
housing needs, and existing policies and programs, followed by a facilitated
discussion.

                                          single family homes with multi-family development is not considered
                                          feasible, due to the excellent condition of the City’s housing stock and the
                                          potential for displacement of existing Piedmont residents.
 1 The 2010 Census reported 443 rental units in the City. The estimate of 250 to 300 private homes has been derived by subtracting
 the number of apartments and second units from this number. Because some property owners may not report rental income to
 the City, and because not all second units are occupied, the exact number of rented single family homes is not known.

units.
                          The City of Piedmont has a long tradition of regulating second unit housing.
                          Many of these units were initially created as living quarters for domestic
                          employees. Today, second units in Piedmont provide housing for
                          professionals, seniors, caregivers, child care employees, relatives, and young
                          adults entering the housing market, among others. In some cases, elderly
                          Piedmont homeowners have moved into second units on their own properties
                          in order to retain ownership and have a source of retirement income. Given
                          the single family character of the city and the absence of land available for
                          new development, second units are the most practical and prevalent form of
                          affordable housing in the city today.
                          Prior to 2003, the City had a process wherein second units were permitted in
                          residential zoning districts with a conditional use permit (CUP). The CUP
                          requirement included a public hearing before the Planning Commission,
                          which provided an opportunity for public input and establishment of
                          conditions of approval. Several different types of second unit permits were
                          established by the City in the 1990s, reflecting the different ways these units
                          were initially developed or approved.
                                                                                                 Page 2-4

                EVALUATION OF              THE 2007-2014HOUSING ELEMENT
                                   With the adoption of AB 1866 by the State legislature in 2002, cities in
                                   California were required to allow second units “ministerially” (i.e., without a
                                   conditional use permit) where the units complied with State standards
                                   relating to parking, square footage, and other factors. The City of Piedmont
                                   convened a Task Force in 2003 to develop a compliance strategy for AB
                                   1866. The strategy led to a new second unit ordinance, along with creation
                                   of a new category of second units which could be rent-restricted to low and
                                   very low income households. Second unit standards were substantially
                                   revised in 2012, with new incentives added to make them affordable (see
                                   Chapter 5).
                                   Table 2-1 defines the different types of second units that exist in Piedmont
                                   today. These units appear throughout the City in many different
                                   configurations. They include basement and attic units, garage apartments,
                                   detached cottages, and more. Some are over 80 years old, while others have
                                   been built within the past five years. Provisions of the City’s second unit
                                   ordinance are discussed in Chapter 5 of the Housing Element.

                                        What’s a “Second Unit?”
Second units are an essential part of Piedmont’s affordable housing stock. As Table 2-1 notes, there are
many different types of second units in Piedmont. These units share the following physical characteristics:
   A separate entrance
   A private bathroom, containing a sink, toilet, and shower or bath
   Basic cooking facilities, including a sink independent of the bathroom sink
   A sleeping area (not necessarily a separate room)
   A permanent heating system
   Ceiling heights of at least 7’6” in habitable rooms and 7’0” in hallways and bathrooms in new
    construction
   At least one operable window measuring 24” x 20” or larger, the bottom of which is no more than
    44" above the floor
   The space could potentially be used in a manner that is private and separate from the primary
    residence on the property
   The space is less than 700 square feet, unless it is rented to a low or very low income household or is
    classified as an “exempt” unit, in which case larger units are permitted (see Chapter 5 of the
    Housing Element for additional information)
A second unit may be attached to the main house, or it may be an independent structure on the
property. It can be a studio (e.g., a single room with a private bath) or it may contain one or more
bedrooms. Most Piedmont homeowners with spaces meeting the above physical criteria are not
actively using these spaces as rental units. Common uses include housing for domestic employees,
home offices, guest quarters, and sleeping quarters for family members.
                                                                                                           Page 2-5

                   EVALUATION OF                   THE 2007-2014HOUSING ELEMENT
                                          During the prior two Housing Element periods (1999-2006 and 2007-2014),
                                          second units played a crucial role in meeting local housing needs. Between
                                          1999 and 2006, 10 market rate second units were added. These units were
                                          generally rented at rates that were affordable to moderate income households,
                                          serving a segment of the city’s population that has limited housing options
                                          within Piedmont. Between 2007 and 2014, the City has actually approved
                                          more second units than primary units, indicating their continued importance
                                          in the City’s housing market. A total of 31 second units were approved
                                          during this period, including 17 with rent restrictions and occupancy
                                          limitations which ensure they are used for low and very low income
                                          households at affordable rents.
                                          Looking ahead to 2015-2022, second units will continue to be the most
                                          viable and effective way to meet Piedmont’s Regional Housing Needs
                                          Allocation for low to moderate households. Many Piedmont homes are large
                                          and could potentially support second units within their existing footprints.
                                          There are also significant numbers of Piedmont seniors and empty nesters
                                          who might find the concept of a second unit to be attractive. Moreover,
                                          given the high cost of market rate housing in the city and region, second
                                          units can provide a supplemental income source for Piedmont homeowners
                                          and make purchasing a home more affordable.

          REVIEW OF 2007-2014 OBJECTIVES POLICIES
          AND ACTIONS
          The following section of the Housing Element is specifically required by the
          Government Code. The goals, objectives, policies, and actions contained in
          the 2007-2014 Element are individually assessed and reviewed. The
          relevance of each policy or action to current housing conditions in Piedmont
          is noted. Where appropriate, changes to be reflected in the new Housing
          Element also are noted.
          To facilitate the evaluation, the information is presented using a series of
          tables. The statement from the previous Housing Element appears in the first
          column (abridged in some cases and without the narrative text that appeared
          in the actual document), and the evaluation is in the second column.
          Two particularly notable milestones were achieved in the 2007-2014 period.
          The first was a rewrite of the City’s second unit standards in 2011-2012. The
          rewrite clarified existing requirements, created more incentives for second
          unit production, and created a new category of rent-restricted units for
          extremely low income households (30% or less of areawide median). All of
          these actions were specifically called for by the 2011 Housing Element.
          The second was a series of amendments to Chapter 17 of the Municipal
          Code. These included allowing emergency shelters as a permitted use in the
          Public Facilities zone, clarifying requirements for renting of rooms in
          Piedmont homes, adding reasonable accommodations language to the Code,
          and reducing the parking requirements to one space per unit (from two) for
          units less than 700 square feet in the multi-family zone. The amendments
          also allow mixed use projects (multi-family over commercial) in the
          commercial zone, allow structure coverage of 50% for two-story structures in
          this zone (rather than 25%), and establish a minimum density requirement of
          12 units per acre in Zones C and D. The amendments also allow smaller lots
          (8,000 square feet) and street frontage (60’) in Zone A where the prevailing
          lot size within 500 feet is less than 8,000 square feet. All of the above
          changes were specifically called for by the 2011 Housing Element.
          The City also implemented many of its housing programs on an on-going
          basis, including promotion of greener buildings and solar panels (to reduce
          energy costs), support for various County programs assisting very low and
          extremely low income households, and continued public outreach and
          website improvements on the City’s planning and building processes. The
                                                                                  Page 2-9

EVALUATION OF      THE 2007-2014HOUSING ELEMENT
          City has continued to enforce Title 24, inform residents of energy assistance
          programs, provide fair housing referrals on discrimination complaints, and
          maintain competitive fees which do not unfairly burden applicants.
          Piedmont also completed an evaluation of the City Charter and concluded
          that the Charter is not constraining housing production or multi-family
          development opportunities.
          Areas where the City fell short of its 2011 objectives include the updating of
          the Piedmont Residential Design Guidelines. Because of limited staff
          resources, the abbreviated timeframe of the Housing Element (e.g, three
          years instead of eight years), and the importance of implementing the zoning
          changes (to remain compliant with Housing Element law), it was not possible
          to update the Design Guidelines during the planning period. This remains a
          priority action for the next period. Other Housing Element programs, such as
          the disbursement of CDBG funds to lower-income Piedmont households
          seeking to retrofit or repair their homes, continued through the period—but
          were curtailed due to a lack of funding from the County, state, and federal
          governments.
                                                                                Page 2-10

in all residential zones within the City, subject to dimensional
and size requirements, parking standards, and an owner-

T       his chapter of the Housing Element profiles demographic and housing
        conditions in Piedmont in order to assess the City’s future housing needs.
        Pursuant to State Government Code requirements, data on population,
household characteristics, income and employment, special needs groups, housing
stock characteristics, building condition, and housing value is presented.
This document was prepared in 2014 and relies on the most current available data
sources. In some cases, these sources are several years old. However, given
Piedmont’s stable, built out character and the slow rate of development in the city,
the data provides a fairly accurate portrait of demographics and housing needs.
Primary data sources include the decennial census of 2010, with comparisons
provided to the 2000 Census. Data from the American Community Survey (ACS)
also is used. The ACS estimates demographic conditions over a five-year period
(in this case, 2008 to 2012) using sample data and a computer model which
considers the 2010 Census and other demographic variables. Other important data
sources used in the Housing Element include the City of Piedmont, the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the State Department of Finance,
and various real estate statistical websites.
Following the demographic and housing analysis, this Chapter provides an
assessment of housing needs in Piedmont for the 2015-2022 period. This
assessment reflects the regional “fair share” allocation assigned to the City by
ABAG, along with general observations about housing needs and opportunities.

                                       during the 1980s and 1990s, largely due to increases in household size.
                                       The 2000 Census reported the City’s population at 10,952. In 2010, the
                                       population was 10,687, a decrease of about 3% from 2000.
                                       Annual estimates since 2010 are provided by the California Department
                                       of Finance (DOF) based on housing construction data and estimates of

                                       years. Most of this increase is due to changes in household size and

                              The Census classifies households as either “family” or “non-
                              family.” The Census defines a “family” as “a householder and
                              one or more other people living in the same household who are
                              related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption.”
                              “Non-family” households include persons living alone and
                              unrelated individuals sharing a home, with no children present.
                              The 2010 Census reported that 82% of all Piedmont households
                              (3,117 households) were “families”, while 18% (684
                              households) were “non-families.” The percentage of “families”
                              is substantially higher than in Alameda County as a whole,
                              where the figure is about 65%.
                              Chart 3.2 provides additional detail on the types of households
                              in Piedmont. In 2010, some 1,342 households—or about 35%
                              of the City’s total—consisted of married couples with children
                              under 18. About 4% of the City’s households consisted of
                              single mothers with children under 18 at home and 2%
                              consisted of single fathers with children under 18 at home. The
                              “non-family” households in the City include 578 persons living
                              alone and 106 households comprised of unrelated individuals
                              (including domestic partnerships).

                             25% of the population by 2035. In Piedmont, the large cohort of
                             residents in the 55-64 age group will reach retirement age in the

                             will continue to do so in the future.

        Length of Residency
        Length of residency data provides some indication of the
        stability of a community. The 2013 American Community
        Survey data for Piedmont indicated that 2,114 of the City’s
        households (58%) had lived in their place of residence for 12 or
        more years. This compares to a countywide average of 32%.
        Only 5% of Piedmonters had moved into their residence in 2010
        or later, compared to 12% countywide.
        As one would expect, the turnover rate was much higher for
        renters than for owners. About 15% of Piedmont’s renters had
        been in their place of residence for two years or less and only
        5% had lived in their homes since before 2000.
        Tenure
        Tenure refers to the ownership status of housing (e.g., rental vs.
        owner). Piedmont has had the highest percentage of owner-
        occupied housing in Alameda County for many years. In 2000,
        89.4% of the City’s dwelling units were occupied by owners
        and just 9.2% were occupied by renters (the remaining 1.4%
        were vacant). By 2010, the ownership rate had dropped to
        85.6%, the rental rate increased to 11.3%, and the vacancy rate
        increased to 3.1%. The percentage of units that are rented was
        virtually the same in 1990 and 2000 (approximately 356) but
        increased by 25% to 443 units in 2010.
        While there was some increase in rental stock due to the
        creation of second units, a majority of the increase is likely due
        to owners choosing to rent out their homes rather than selling
        them during the 2007-2010 market downturn. Prices in
        Piedmont declined slightly during this period, and those
        relocating out of the City may have postponed the sale of their
        homes until the market recovered. The 2013 American
        Community Survey indicated that approximately 70% of the
        rentals in the City are single family homes rather than
        apartments.
        Linguistic Isolation
        The 2000 Census reported that 82% of Piedmont’s residents
        spoke “English only,” while 18% spoke other languages at
        home. These numbers have not changed significantly in the last
        13 years. The 2013 American Community Survey indicates that
        83% of Piedmont residents speak English at home and 17%
                                                                  Page 3-9

DEMOGRAPHICS       AND      HOUSING NEEDS
        speak another language at home. As of 2013, 14% of the City’s
        residents were born overseas.
        Of those speaking another language, 63% were also fluent in
        English while 37% (about 650 people) spoke English “less than
        very well.” The principal other languages spoken in Piedmont
        homes were Chinese (852 persons), Spanish (225 persons),
        Korean (166 persons), and Japanese (130 persons). Among
        those who spoke English “less than very well,” 60% (388
        persons) spoke Chinese, 10% spoke Spanish, and about 5%
        each spoke Korean and Japanese. Other languages spoken in
        the City included Portuguese, Hindi, Urdu, Persian, Thai,
        Russian, and Vietnamese.
        The percentage of non-English speaking residents is much
        lower in Piedmont than in surrounding communities and in the
        County and state as a whole. Approximately 86% of Piedmont
        residents were born in the United States— 56% of the city’s
        residents are native Californians.
        INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT
        Piedmont is an affluent community, with a median household
        income that is substantially higher than the County as a whole.
        In 2000, the US Census reported that the median household
        income in the City was $134,270. This was 140% higher than
        the Year 2000 income for Alameda County. In 2013, the
        American Community Survey reported the median household
        income in Piedmont was $206,392.
        Approximately 79% of the City’s households had annual
        incomes of over $100,000 in 2013. This compared to 36% in
        the County as a whole. The median income for families
        (excluding single persons and unrelated individuals living
        together) was even higher, with 91% of all Piedmont families
        earning more than $100,000 a year.
        The highest income earning cohort in the city was the 45 to 64
        age group, with a median household income of $236,800. The
        25 to 44 age group had a median income of $207,200. House-
        holds over 65 had a significantly lower median income of
        $108,400.
        Despite the relative affluence of Piedmont residents, there are
        households in the City earning substantially less than the City-
                                                               Page 3-10

DEMOGRAPHICS        AND     HOUSING NEEDS
        wide median. The 2013 American Community Survey reported
        that 190 Piedmont residents (1.8% of the City’s population)
        were below the United States poverty level. However, ACS
        data indicates a different profile for persons below the poverty
        line than in the County as a whole. The ACS reported no
        children below the poverty line, and only 7 seniors. More than
        three-quarters of Piedmont residents below the poverty line
        were female. Among adults over 25 living below poverty,
        nearly 60% had a college degree. It is important to keep in
        mind that the ACS poverty data is based on annual income,
        rather than net wealth, so the results may not provide an
        accurate metric for evaluating local housing needs.
        Other indicators of income are available from the American
        Community Survey. In 2013, there were 15 households with
        Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and 874 households
        receiving Social Security Income. The ACS indicated there
        were no residents receiving food stamps or public assistance.
        The 2013 ACS further estimated that there were 370 Piedmont
        households (about 10% of the City’s total) with incomes below
        $65,000 a year. This was the approximate threshold for the
        HUD definition of “low income” in 2013. About 56% of these
        households are headed by senior citizens. In fact, the Census
        indicated that 81% of Piedmont households with incomes of
        $35,000 or less were headed by seniors (78 out of 96
        households).
        Most state and federal housing programs are benchmarked to
        specific income thresholds. These thresholds are updated
        annually by the State of California, in accordance with
        procedures established by the U.S. Department of Housing and
        Urban Development (HUD). They vary depending on the
        number of persons per household, since different sized
        households have different spending needs. HUD uses the
        following categories:
            “Extremely Low Income” households earn less than 30% of
             the areawide median.
            “Very Low Income” households earn less than 50% of the
             areawide median.
            “Low Income” households earn between 50 and 80% of the
             areawide median (some housing programs use 60% as the
             threshold)
            “Moderate Income” households earn between 80 and 120%
             of the areawide median.
            “Above Moderate Income” households earn more than
             120% of the areawide median.

                                         Table 3.4 shows the income ranges for Alameda County
                                         effective in 2014. A family of four earning less than $67,600 a
                                         year would be considered “low income.” A family of four
                                         earning less than $46,000 a year would be considered “very
                                         low income.”

                                         Among the data collected by the Census is the percentage of
                                         household income that is spent on housing costs, including
                                         utilities. A household that spends more than 30% of its gross
                                         income on housing is said to be “overpaying.” The 30%
                                         threshold is used as the basis for a number of federal housing
                                         assistance programs. Households spending more than 50% of
                                         their gross income on housing are said to be “severely
                                         overpaying.”
                                         Overpayment data for 2008-2012 is shown in Table 3.5. During
                                         that time, some 31% of all owner-occupied Piedmont
                                         households paid more than 30% of their income on housing (the
                                         corresponding figure for Alameda County was 47%). These
                                         statistics have inched up slightly in the last 20 years; 1990 data
                                                                                                   Page 3-12

        indicates a homeowner overpayment rate of 28%, while 2000
        Census data indicates a rate of 29%.
        Among Piedmont renters, only 20% paid more than 30% of
        their income on housing during 2008-2012 (American
        Community Survey, 2013). The figures are down substantially
        from 2000, when 36% of the City’s renter households paid
        more than 30% of their incomes on rent. According to the
        2013 American Community Survey (ACS), most Piedmont
        renters pay 20 to 29 percent of their incomes on housing. The
        trend in Piedmont is the reverse of the trend in the rest of the
        Bay Area, where a growing number of renters are overpaying.
        The data for Piedmont reflects the relatively high incomes of
        Piedmont renters relative to renters in other parts of the Bay
        Area.
        The 2013 ACS reported that 81% of all Piedmont homeowners
        with a mortgage had housing costs exceeding $3,000 a month.
        Homeowners with mortgages were the group most likely to be
        “overpaying” for housing during 2008-2012. The 2013 ACS
        indicated the median mortgage payment in the City exceeded
        $4,000 a month, which is above the top interval recorded by the
        Census. Approximately 38% of homeowners with mortgages
        spent more than 30% of their incomes on housing (including
        14% --or about 360 households-- spending more than 50% of
        their incomes on housing).
        Not surprisingly, the incidence of overpayment is highest
        among homeowners earning less than $75,000 a year. This
        income group represents just 7.6% of all Piedmont homeowners
        with mortgages (or about 185 households), with 93% spending
        more than 30% of their annual incomes on housing.
        The 2013 ACS reports that 27% of all Piedmont homeowners
        had no mortgages and owned their homes outright.
        Homeowners with no mortgage still had monthly housing costs
        which exceeded $1,000 a month, attributable to property taxes,
        homeowners insurance, utility bills, and similar expenses.
        However, the incidence of overpayment was low among
        homeowners with no mortgages. Just 11% of these owners
        spent more than 30% of their incomes on housing.
        Approximately 76% of Piedmont homeowners without
        mortgages reported incomes of over $75,000 a year and 51%
        reported annual incomes over $150,000.

                                      As noted above, most renters in Piedmont have incomes
                                      exceeding $75,000 and pay less than 30% of their incomes on
                                      rent. However, the ACS indicates that there are 24 renter
                                      households with incomes of less than $50,000 a year, and all of
                                      these households are paying more than 30% of their incomes on
                                      rent. Among the 69 renters in the $50-75,000 income bracket,
                                      about 26% are estimated to be paying 30% or more of their
                                      incomes on rent
                                      Employment
                                      Employment in a community can affect the demand for housing
                                      and can influence the type of housing that is needed. This is
                                      less true in Piedmont than in larger communities because of the
                                      small, residential character of the City and the limited number
                                      of local jobs. Piedmont has never been a major employment
                                      center. In fact, the City has the smallest ratio of jobs to housing
                                      in Alameda County. Whereas the nine-county Bay Area as a
                                      whole has about 1.5 jobs for every household, in Piedmont,
                                      there are more than two households for every job.
                                                                                               Page 3-14

                              were primarily associated with local government, service

secretaries, clerks,          domestic workers, and home child care providers. Collectively,

                              The employment characteristics of Piedmont residents also may
                              influence housing demand. In 2013, about two-thirds of all
                              Piedmont residents over 16 (5,300 residents) were in the labor
                              force. Only about 14% of these residents worked within the
                              City of Piedmont (mostly from their homes). Nearby
                              employment centers include Berkeley, Downtown Oakland, and
                              Downtown San Francisco, while Silicon Valley is about an hour
                              away.
                              In November 2013, the California Employment Development
                              Department reported that 200 Piedmont residents were
                              unemployed, a rate of 3.5%. Piedmont’s unemployment rate
                              was significantly lower than that for Alameda County, which
                              was 6.8% in November 2013. Unemployment rates have been
                              declining since 2010, when they were 5.9% for the City of
                              Piedmont and 11.3% for Alameda County.

                                      SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
                                      Several types of households have been identified by the State of
                                      California as having special housing needs. Such households
                                      may have a harder time than most finding suitable housing
                                      within the community. Special needs populations include
                                      seniors, persons with disabilities, large low-income families,
                                      single mothers, farmworkers, extremely low income
                                      households, and the homeless. The Census provides some
                                      indication of the presence of such groups within Piedmont.
                                      Data cited below is taken from the 2010 Census, the 2013
                                      American Community Survey (for 2008-2012), and other

DEMOGRAPHICS       AND      HOUSING NEEDS
        Seniors
        As mentioned earlier in this Chapter, about 15% of the City’s
        residents are 65 or older. The 2013 American Community
        Survey indicates that most Piedmont seniors were well
        established financially, with 69% reporting annual incomes of
        over $75,000. However, 5% of the City’s senior households
        reported an annual income of less than $25,000 and 10% had
        incomes between $25,000 and $50,000. Some of these
        residents may find it difficult to make monthly mortgage (or
        rent) payments on fixed or limited incomes. Others may find
        the day-to-day costs of home maintenance and improvement to
        be prohibitively expensive.
        A disproportionately large number of Piedmont’s seniors live
        alone and are owner occupants. Although seniors only
        comprise 14% of the City’s residents, they own 30% of the
        City’s single family homes. The 2010 Census indicated that
        there were 318 seniors living alone in owner-occupied
        Piedmont homes. Most of these residents were over 75.
        Even Piedmont seniors who are well positioned financially may
        have special housing needs. Many Piedmont homes are not
        designed to meet the needs of mobility-impaired residents, with
        living spaces on multiple levels and bathrooms and kitchens
        that are not wheelchair accessible. The City has established
        special permitting and design review rules to facilitate “aging in
        place” and has worked with many senior residents to retrofit
        their homes.
        There are limited options for Piedmont seniors seeking to
        “downsize” or move into smaller units without moving out of
        the City. The City’s second unit program provides an important
        resource. It provides senior homeowners with the potential for
        additional income, and the chance to relocate from the main
        house to the smaller (and usually one-story) unit without giving
        up their home. It also provides the opportunity for an on-site
        caregiver or tenant who can assist with home maintenance and
        household chores. Other options (such as shared housing for
        single seniors, or new units designed to meet the needs of
        seniors) could be explored in the future.

DEMOGRAPHICS        AND      HOUSING NEEDS
        Persons with Disabilities
        Although the 2010 Census does not provide data on disability
        status for Piedmont, the American Community Survey (ACS)
        provides a profile based on a sample of the population. The
        2013 ACS indicates that there are 600 Piedmont residents, or
        5.6% of the population, with a disability. Almost half of these
        residents are over 65. Roughly 2.9% of the adult population
        indicated a cognitive disability, while 2.1% indicated a
        “sensory” (hearing or sight) disability, and 2.1% indicated an
        ambulatory (movement-related) disability. Among residents
        over 65, roughly 9% had an independent living disability—
        some of these households require assistance in their day to day
        activities.
        California Senate Bill 520 (SB 520), passed in October 2001,
        requires local housing elements to evaluate constraints for
        persons with disabilities and develop programs which
        accommodate the housing needs of the disabled. The City of
        Piedmont has taken a number of proactive steps to remove
        barriers to mobility in the community. These include
        implementation of ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act),
        improvements to most municipal facilities (including City
        Hall), and the design of all new public buildings (including
        schools) to be ADA-compliant.
        As a small community, Piedmont’s planning and building
        functions are personalized and customer-focused. Requests to
        modify homes to meet the needs of disabled residents are
        handled on a case by case basis, with staff working closely with
        applicants to accommodate their needs. The City routinely
        issues building permits for wheelchair ramps, wheelchair lifts,
        elevators, and bathroom grab bars. There are no restrictions on
        lowered countertops, widened doorways, adjustable
        showerheads, or other adaptations which meet the needs of
        those with mobility limitations. The City has relaxed design
        review requirements for exterior wheelchair ramps. The City
        Council has the authority and discretion to grant fee waivers for
        such improvements.
        There are no requirements in the Piedmont Zoning Ordinance
        which conflict with the ADA, nor has the City adopted any
        amendments to the Building Code which conflict with the
        ADA. The City fully enforces State Title 24 provisions, which
        ensure access for persons with disabilities. It also has adopted
        reasonable accommodations provisions for persons with
        disabilities in the Municipal Code.

                    DEMOGRAPHICS                 AND      HOUSING NEEDS
                                     As required by the Fair Housing Act, group homes of 6 persons
                                     or less are permitted in the City’s residential districts. The
                                     City’s Zoning Ordinance does not specifically address the siting
                                     of such homes, and no local standards or restrictions have been
                                     developed. There are no standards limiting the number of
                                     unrelated adults in a home, and there are no minimum
                                     separation requirements for group homes. Group homes and
                                     other forms of supportive housing are treated the same as other
                                     residential uses of the same type in the same zone, as required
                                     by state law.
                                     The City is also fully compliant with state laws regulating the
                                     definition of “family.” Chapter 17 of the Municipal Code
                                     defines a family as “an interactive group of persons jointly
                                     occupying a single dwelling unit including the joint use of and
                                     responsibility for common areas, sharing household activities
                                     and responsibilities such as meals, chores, household
                                     maintenance and expenses.” There are no requirements for
                                     occupants to be related nor are any there limits on family size.
                                     Developmental Disabilities
                                     In 2010, the California legislature adopted SB 812, requiring
                                     local housing elements to include an evaluation of the needs of
                                     persons with developmental disabilities. Developmental
                                     disabilities occur before an individual reaches 18 years of age
                                     and typically constitute a lifetime handicap. They include
                                     mental retardation, cerebral palsy, autism, and epilepsy, among
                                     others.
                                     Services to persons with developmental disabilities are
                                     coordinated by a network of “regional centers” around
                                     California. The Regional Center of the East Bay (RCEB)
                                     served 16,000 persons in the East Bay area during 2012.
                                     Approximately 55% of their clients were under age 21 and
                                     approximately 73% lived with a parent or guardian. According
                                     to the RCEB, there are 26 Piedmont residents who are
                                     considered eligible clients for RCEB services. Of this number,
                                     11 are age 14 or under, 12 are 15-22, and 3 are 23-54.1 Since
                                     participation is voluntary, there may be other disabled
                                     individuals living in Piedmont who are not eligible or who are
                                     eligible but choose not to participate. Housing Consortium of
                                     the East Bay estimates that there are 58 persons in Piedmont
                                     with developmental disabilities, 50 of whom are 22 or younger.

DEMOGRAPHICS        AND      HOUSING NEEDS
        Based on information provided by the Regional Center, it is
        likely that a majority of the persons served by RCEB in
        Piedmont live with a parent or guardian. Supportive housing
        and group living opportunities for persons with developmental
        disabilities can be an important resource for those individuals
        who can transition from the home of a parent or guardian to
        independent living. The City supports and encourages such
        housing, and accommodates it through zoning and other
        sections of the Municipal Code.
        Large Low Income Families
        Large families are defined by the U.S. Census as having five
        persons or more. In Alameda County, such families would have
        met the definition of “low income” if their total household
        income for the year 2013 was less than $73,050.
        In 2000, there were 420 large family households in Piedmont.
        By 2010, this figure was 399 and represented 10.5% of the
        City’s total households. Of these households, 310 had five
        members, 70 had six members, and 19 had seven or more
        members. Among the 399 large households, 47 (12%) were
        renters and the remainder were owners.
        Most large families in Piedmont have high incomes. The
        American Community Survey indicates the median household
        income for Piedmont households with over five members is
        over $250,000. Anecdotal evidence suggests that large
        families may buy or rent in Piedmont in part to gain access to
        high-quality public schools and other community amenities.
        Piedmont’s supply of homes with five or more bedrooms is also
        attractive to large families with high incomes.
        Single-Parent Households
        Single parent households may have a difficult time finding
        suitable housing in the Bay Area due to child care costs and
        responsibilities, and limited income-earning potential (e.g., only
        one parent working). The 2010 Census reported 227 single
        parent households in Piedmont with children under 18 living at
        home, including 155 female-headed households and 72 male-
        headed households.
        The 2013 American Community Survey indicated that single
        parents in Piedmont had household incomes that were
        significantly lower than other families. For example, the
        median income for female-headed households with children

        under 18 and no husband present was $85,300. This compared
        to a median of over $250,000 for households with a husband,
        wife, and children under 18.
        Farmworkers
        The City of Piedmont is entirely urbanized and is not proximate
        to agricultural land. No farmworkers are known to live in the
        City. City provisions for employee housing are addressed in
        Chapter 5.
        Extremely Low Income Households
        In 2006, the legislature passed Assembly Bill 2634 (AB 2634)
        requiring Housing Elements to include an evaluation of the
        housing needs of extremely low income (ELI) households. ELI
        households are a subset of “very low income” households and
        are defined as earning less than 30 percent of the areawide
        median income. The thresholds for ELI vary based on
        household size. In Piedmont (and the remainder of Alameda
        and Contra Costa counties), the following thresholds apply as of
        January 1, 2014:
                Persons in            Extremely
                Household             Low Income
                1                     $19,350 or less
                2                     $22,100 or less
                3                     $24,850 or less
                4                     $27,600 or less
        A family of four earning less than $27,600 would be considered
        extremely low income. A one-person household working full
        time at the California minimum wage of $8.00 an hour
        ($16,640/year) also would be considered extremely low income.
        There is no market-rate housing available to these households in
        the Bay Area advertised at an affordable price.
        Table 3.6 provides an estimate of the number of ELI households
        in Piedmont today. According to the 2013 American
        Community Survey (ACS), only 1.9% of the City’s households
        earn less than $27,600 a year. Most of these households are
        headed by senior citizens. The ACS also reports that all nine
        households in Piedmont headed by persons under 25 have
        incomes less than $27,600. Based on anecdotal evidence, it is
        surmised that these households are college students or adult
        children of Piedmont families, living in separate quarters at the
        homes of parents or other relatives (e.g., in in-law units).

DEMOGRAPHICS        AND      HOUSING NEEDS
        The City recently amended its Municipal Code to formally
        allow the renting of bedrooms to individual tenants. City
        regulations on renting rooms were ambiguous before, with
        some assuming that such homes would be considered “boarding
        houses” under the Code. The recent changes provide an
        important resource for extremely low income households,
        including those seeking a place to live and those already living
        in the City needing supplemental income.

        Although the ACS is based on sample data and has a relatively
        high margin of error, it appears that the number of ELI
        households in the City has declined dramatically since the 2000
        Census. At that time, there were 263 ELI households in
        Piedmont, including 116 senior (over 65) households with
        annual incomes of less than $20,000 and 147 adult (age 25-64)
        households with annual incomes of less than $25,000. In 2000,
        this represented 6.9% of all households in the city—roughly
        four times more than the percentage today. Based on ACS data,
        most ELI households in Piedmont are homeowners (or do not
        pay for their own housing), rather than renters. In fact, the ACS
        reports that there are no renters in Piedmont with incomes less
        than $25,000.
                                                                   Page 3-22

DEMOGRAPHICS       AND       HOUSING NEEDS
        The 2013 ACS indicated that there were 21 senior households
        with incomes of less than $15,000 and 26 senior households
        with incomes of $15,000 to $25,000 in Piedmont. The City
        may include extremely low income households with children,
        although such households represent a very small percentage of
        the total. The ACS identifies only nine adult (25 to 64)
        households with annual incomes of less than $25,000 a year,
        which is less than four-tenths of one percent of the total
        households in this age cohort. Some of these households may
        be in the special needs categories described above, including
        persons with disabilities. While some of the City’s extremely
        low income households may receive various forms of public
        assistance, they may still struggle to cover their housing costs,
        face hunger or medical problems, and are at risk of becoming
        homeless. There are currently no housing units in Piedmont
        specifically earmarked for extremely low income households.
        Homeless Persons
        A homeless person is defined as someone who lacks a
        permanent, regular, and adequate residence. The homeless
        include persons living on the street, in parks, in cars, in
        emergency shelters, and in encampments. Various factors
        contribute to homelessness, including unemployment, a lack of
        affordable housing, health problems, and reductions in mental
        and social service programs. Homeless persons typically
        require supportive services to deal with the immediate causes of
        homelessness, which may include job loss, substance abuse,
        eviction, domestic violence, family break-up, and medical
        problems.
        Despite the absence of a visible homeless population, Piedmont
        is located in a dense urban area where homelessness is
        recognized to be a significant issue. Additionally, there may be
        residents “at risk” of homelessness in the city, including persons
        facing future eviction, foreclosure, or loss of income. Other
        Piedmont residents may be staying with family and friends
        because they have no place else to go.
                                                                 Page 3-23

                                       Alameda County conducts a bi-annual Homeless Count Survey,
                                       consistent with federal (HUD) requirements. The County also
                                       maintains a Homeless Management Information Systems
                                       (HMIS) data base, which estimates the total homeless
                                       population in the County and disaggregates these estimates to
                                       the cities through field counts and interviews. The most recent
                                       published information is from 2013.2 Countywide, there were
                                       4,264 homeless residents in 2013, which was a 2% increase
                                       from 2011 but an 11% decrease from 2007.
                                       The 2013 HMIS survey counted seven homeless persons in
                                       Piedmont on January 30, 2013. Two were female and five were
                                       male. Six were between the ages of 41 and 60 and one was 25-
                                       40. Two indicated it was their first episode of homelessness,
                                       two indicated they had been homeless 2-4 times, and three were
                                       noted as chronically homeless. All seven indicated they were
                                       unemployed; five indicated long-term disability, including three
                                       with mental health conditions.
                                       Anecdotal data, including interviews with the City’s Police and
                                       Fire Chiefs, and the Directors of Public Works and Parks,
                                       confirms that there are fewer than 10 transient persons in
                                       Piedmont. This is not to discount the need for proactive
                                       solutions, but rather an observation that homelessness in
                                       Piedmont may take on different dimensions than in Oakland or
                                       Berkeley. The City does not have a visible street population or
                                       residents living in parks or commercial districts. Because
                                       Piedmont is encircled by Oakland, which has the highest
                                       homeless population in the County, there are transient residents
                                       present. Homelessness is a regional issue that does not
                                       recognize city boundaries.
                                       The regional nature of homelessness means that each
                                       community in the County is obligated to help develop solutions.
                                       There are a number of resources that Piedmont can draw upon,
                                       including an extensive network of charitable and community
                                       service organizations. The City is also home to three churches
                                       and a synagogue, potential partners in efforts to assist persons
                                       in need. In 2004, the City amended its zoning code to allow
                                       emergency shelters in the Public Facilities Zoning District
                                       (Zone B) with a conditional use permit (CUP). In 2013, the
                                       zoning code was further amended to remove the CUP
                                       requirement. Emergency shelter is now permitted by right in
                                       Zone B.

DEMOGRAPHICS        AND      HOUSING NEEDS
        Additionally, the City participates in the Alameda County
        EveryOne Home Program. EveryOne Home was adopted in
        2006 as a 15-year Plan to end chronic homelessness in Alameda
        County through multi-jurisdictional solutions. The Plan seeks
        to provide supportive housing units for 15,000 homeless
        households by 2020, and seeks to improve the safety net for
        those at risk of becoming homeless. The Plan includes
        provisions for better integration of homeless services with other
        services such as mental health, HIV/AIDS care, and acute
        medical services. The Piedmont City Council adopted the
        EveryOne Home Plan as official City policy in October 2009
        and continues to provide annual financial support to the
        program.
        HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
        Number of Units
        The 2000 Census reported that Piedmont had 3,859 housing
        units. In 2010, the Census reported 3,924 units, an increase of
        65 units. Most of the increase is attributed to better accounting
        of second units in the City, as well as the production of new
        second units between 2000 and 2010. The net increase in single
        family homes (excluding teardown and replacements) during
        this period is estimated to be about ten units.
        Intercensal housing unit estimates are prepared by the
        California Department of Finance (DOF) based on certificate of
        occupancy data reported by cities and counties. DOF indicates
        that there were 3,935 units in Piedmont in 2013, a net increase
        of 11 units since 2010. According to the DOF, seven of these
        units were single family homes and four were in a “2-4 unit”
        building (presumably second units). Since City records do not
        indicate a net addition of seven new single family homes since
        2010, it is presumed that some of these also reflect second units
        (tallied as single family homes by the state).
        Table 3.7 provides U.S. Census and DOF data on housing units
        from 1940 to 2013. The data parallels the household data
        presented in Table 3.2. The Table reflects the fact that almost
        all of the City’s vacant land was developed by 1980, resulting in
        a very slow growth rate during the last 30 years. As noted
        above, the jump in units between 2000 and 2010 is largely due
        to second unit production and better accounting of existing
        second units.

          Vacancy Characteristics
          At the time of the 2000 Census, 55 of Piedmont’s dwelling
          units were vacant. This equates to an overall vacancy rate of
          just 1.4%, which was significantly lower than the countywide
          vacancy rate of 3.1%. Vacancy rates increased following the
          real estate downturn in 2008-2010. By 2010, 123 units were
          vacant, equivalent to a 3.1% vacancy rate. Countywide, the
          vacancy rate in 2010 was 6.4%.
          Not all of the City’s vacant units are available for rent or sale.
          The 2010 Census indicated that Piedmont’s vacancies included
          17 units that were used for seasonal, recreational, or occasional
          use, while 58 units were vacant and not on the market. The
          Census further indicated that the vacancy rate for rental units
          (including both apartments and houses) was 3.7%, while the
          vacancy rate for owner-occupied (e.g., for sale) units was 0.4%.
          Table 3.8 compares the 2010 vacancy rate with the rates
          reported by previous censuses. Vacancies in Piedmont have

          now closer to the Year 2000 rate of 1.4%.

        Structure Type
        Piedmont’s housing stock is dominated by single family
        residences. Table 3.9 provides a breakdown of the types of
        residential structures in the City, based on California
        Department of Finance (DOF) data from January 2014.
        The data in Table 3.9 does not align with the City’s own records
        of structure type, which indicate that there are no buildings with
        more than nine units in Piedmont, and 35 units in buildings with
        5-9 units. The City’s records, which are based on parcel level
        data, also indicate that there are only 36 units in duplex, tri-
        plex, or four-plex buildings in Piedmont and not 95 units as
        indicated by the State (and the US Census). Based on the City’s
        detailed parcel-based records, Piedmont’s housing stock
        includes two buildings with nine units each, two buildings with
        six units each, one building with five units, four buildings with
        four units each, and five buildings with three units each, for a
        total of 66 multi-family units. As noted earlier, some of the 95
        units shown on the third row of Table 3.9 may be single family
        homes with second units. In addition, the City has no single
        family attached homes (e.g., townhouses), suggesting that all 48
        units listed on Row 2 of the table are homes with second units.

          Notes: (*) May include homes with second units
        Based on Piedmont’s own records, approximately 98% of the
        developed residential properties in the city contain single family
        detached homes. Approximately 3% of these properties include
        legal second units. The remaining developed residential
        properties consist of small 5-10 unit apartment buildings and 2-
        4 plexes, typically built before 1960. All multiple dwelling
        units in Piedmont are rental apartments; the City has no
        condominiums.
        Number of Rooms
        Piedmont homes tend to be larger than homes in nearby
        communities. The 2013 American Community Survey reported
        that the median number of rooms in Piedmont’s residences was
        7.7. Over 1,400 homes in the City (36% of the total) had more
        than nine rooms. In Alameda County as a whole, the median
        number of rooms per home was 5.0 and only 6.1% of the homes
        had more than nine rooms.
        Chart 3.4 illustrates the composition of Piedmont’s homes by
        number of bedrooms as of 2013. The table excludes 12 units
        noted as having “zero” bedrooms (e.g., studio second units).
        The 2013 ACS indicated that 87% of the City’s dwelling units
        had three bedrooms or more. Only 3% of the City’s units were
        identified as one-bedroom dwellings. Most of these were rental
        apartments and second units.

                                 The U.S. Census defines an “overcrowded” housing unit as one
                                 with more than one person per room. Given the relatively large
                                 size of Piedmont residences, there are very few homes in the
                                 City which meet this definition. The 2000 Census identified
                                 only 12 overcrowded units in Piedmont, representing less than
                                 0.3% of the City’s housing stock. The 2013 ACS indicates
                                 there are no housing units in the city with more than 1.0 persons
                                 per household today, indicating there are no overcrowded units.

DEMOGRAPHICS        AND      HOUSING NEEDS
        HOUSING VALUE
        Housing in Piedmont is expensive. The 2000 Census reported
        the median value of a Piedmont home as almost $800,000. Real
        estate prices in Piedmont appreciated rapidly after 2000, with
        the median asking price for a new home peaking at over $1.5
        million in November 2005. Like the rest of the Bay Area,
        Piedmont’s home prices fell during 2006-2009, but the decline
        was not as steep as in the county or region as a whole. The real
        estate website Zillow.com reports that the median home price in
        Piedmont “bottomed” out at $1.1 million in 2011-2012. Prices
        have risen rapidly since Spring 2012. The median was
        $1,565,000 in September 2013, which was a 16% increase over
        September 2012. By May, 2014, Zillow.com reported a further
        increase to $1,750,300, an 11.8% increase in just 8 months.
        A November 2013 review of various industry sources
        (realtor.com, Zillow, and redfin) indicated that inventory in
        Piedmont is very limited. Only nine homes in the city were
        listed for sale, with a median price of $1.7 million.
        Assuming a 20% downpayment, a 5% interest rate, and a 30-
        year fixed rate mortgage, the monthly principal and interest
        payment on a $1,565,000 Piedmont home would be $6,721.
        Adding property taxes, homeowners insurance, and utility
        expenses would push monthly housing costs to over $8,500.
        Assuming housing costs represent no more than 30% of
        household income, a family would need to earn $340,000 a year
        to afford such a residence. Although this may be within the
        reach of some Piedmont households, many longtime Piedmont
        residents could not afford the very homes they live in if they
        had to purchase them again today.
        The City is particularly unaffordable for first-time buyers,
        including residents who rent Piedmont apartments or young
        Piedmont adults who wish to stay in the community after
        leaving their parents’ homes. Given the high housing costs, the
        City generally attracts residents with equity from previous
        residences. Many Piedmont buyers are rolling over the
        proceeds from the sale of former homes, resulting in high down
        payments and more manageable monthly costs.

                                  The number of foreclosures in the United States tripled between
                                  the first quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2008 as home
                                  prices fell, unemployment rose, and a growing number of sub-
                                  prime loans and adjustable rate mortgages were made to higher
                                  risk borrowers. While foreclosures have declined with the
                                  economic recovery and rise in real estate prices, the high cost of
                                  housing in Piedmont means that foreclosure is still a risk for
                                  some households. As of December 2013, the
                                  foreclosureradar.com website lists seven properties in “pre-
                                  foreclosure” and two slated for auction. Foreclosure rates in
                                  Piedmont were very low relative to other East Bay cities during
                                  the foreclosure “crisis” of 2007-2011.
                                  HOUSING AND ENERGY COSTS
                                  One way to make housing more affordable is to reduce the
                                  percentage of household income spent on natural gas and
                                  electricity. Energy costs may be a significant part of the
                                  household budget for low and moderate income families.
                                  Reducing home energy costs and switching to more sustainable
                                  energy sources is also an important goal of Piedmont’s Climate
                                  Action Plan, (CAP) adopted in 2010. The CAP includes a

DEMOGRAPHICS        AND      HOUSING NEEDS
        Piedmont presently enforces the California Energy
        Commission’s Title 24 standards for wall and ceiling insulation,
        thermal mass, and window to floor area ratios (to reduce heat
        loss). A report indicating conformance with the energy
        standards is usually performed by an energy consultant
        following methods approved by the State. These requirements
        only apply to new construction and major remodeling. Other
        homeowners can realize significant cost savings through
        weatherization, the use of energy-efficient appliances, and the
        installation of solar heating systems and alternative energy-
        generation systems.
        PG&E offers a number of programs to assist low income
        households with their energy costs. These include CARE
        (California Alternate Rates for Energy), which provides a 20
        percent gas and electric bill discount for qualifying low income
        households; FERA (Family Electric Rate Assistance), which
        offers a 131-200 percent reduction on electric rates; a Medical
        Baseline Allowance for persons with high medically-related
        electric bills; an Energy Partners Program offering free
        weatherization, and the REACH (Relief for Energy Assistance
        for Community Help) program for low income owners who
        cannot pay their bill due to sudden financial hardship. PG&E
        also offers conservation measures that are not income-based,
        such as tax incentives for alternative energy use, free energy
        audits, and rebates for old appliances.
        Piedmont is also a participant in East Bay Energy Watch, a
        collaboration between PG&E and local governments, non-
        profits, and for-profit energy service providers in the East Bay.
        The program aims to increase awareness of energy efficiency
        and its benefits while delivering high quality retrofit services
        and technical assistance. It provides free energy assessments
        and solar energy assessments (SmartSolar), with the intent of
        helping residents lower their energy bills and make their homes
        more energy efficient.
        The City also participates in the Energy Upgrade California
        program, which includes rebates of up to $4,000 from PG&E
        and other utilities for energy efficiency retrofits. For a limited
        period, Piedmont allocated grants from the US EPA to
        subsidize refunds for property owners participating in this
        program. The program also offers Piedmont residents Home
        Energy Analyzer, an on-line home energy management tool.

Government Code Sec. 65583 (a)(1)   The ABAG forecasts indicate the addition of 90 housing units
                                    in Piedmont between 2010 and 2040, or about 3 housing units a
                                    year. Because the City is fully built out, it is expected that most
                                    of this growth will consist of second units. The ABAG
                                    forecasts indicate an increase of 480 jobs in the City between
                                    2010 and 2040, which is a 25% growth rate over the 30-year
                                    period. Since the City has no available commercial land and is
                                    fully built out, it is presumed that this growth represents an
                                    increase in self-employment and persons working from home.
                                    Given technological changes of the last decade and the trend
                                    toward telecommuting and home offices, it is expected that a
                                    growing number of Piedmonters may work from their homes in
                                    the future. Since the self-employed and telecommuting
                                    population already has housing, employment growth in
                                    Piedmont creates a different dynamic than in other cities. It
                                    reduces pressure on the regional housing market, rather than

DEMOGRAPHICS        AND      HOUSING NEEDS
        Regional Housing Needs Allocation
        As mentioned in Chapter 1, the Government Code requires each
        community in the region to provide for its “fair share” of the
        region’s housing needs. The “fair share” determinations are
        made approximately every seven years by ABAG. In July
        2013, the ABAG Executive Board adopted the final fair share
        allocations for Bay Area cities and counties for the period
        January 31, 2015– January 31, 2023. The total allocation for
        the nine Bay Area counties was 187,990 units. The Alameda
        County allocation was 44,036, which was very close to the
        allocation of 44,937 units for the prior eight year period (2007-
        2014).
        Piedmont’s allocation was 60 units, or less than 0.2% of the
        County total. It is worth noting that Piedmont’s RHNA
        allocation for 2015-2022 is 50% greater than the allocation for
        2007-2014. The City’s allocation also represents two-thirds of
        the 90 new housing units forecast for Piedmont by ABAG for
        the 30-year period between 2010 and 2040. ABAG’s
        expectation is that the City will provide more capacity for
        housing than its projected growth rate during the next eight
        years, thereby providing market flexibility and multiple options
        for housing construction.
        The fair share allocations for each City and County have been
        stratified by income group. The ABAG methodology includes
        weighting factors intended to reduce income disparities between
        Bay Area cities. Thus, more affluent cities receive larger
        allocations of low and very low income units. Table 3.11
        indicates the distribution for Piedmont. The City’s assignment
        includes 24 very low income units, 14 low income units, 15
        moderate income units, and 7 above moderate income units.
        Chart 3.5 compares the RHNA allocation for 2015-2022 with
        the allocations for the previous two cycles (referred to as Cycles
        3 and 4). Piedmont’s current RHNA is not only higher than it
        has been in the prior cycles, the number of low and very low
        income units in the allocation has increased by 280% since
        1999-2006. Given that the City is fully built out, it must seek
        new and creative ways to meet its fair share allocation.
                                                                Page 3-35

                     The RHNA does not include an explicit allocation of
                     “extremely low income” (ELI) households, which are a subset
                     of “very low income” (VLI) households. However, the
                     Government Code requires cities to set numeric objectives for
                     projected ELI needs as well as VLI needs. Piedmont has
                     determined its ELI need based on the existing proportion of ELI
                     households to VLI households in the City. The data source is

                     Piedmont households with incomes below $46,000. These
                     income thresholds roughly correspond to the upper limits of

                                   While the City does not have traditional “subsidized” housing,
                                   it does have a small inventory of second units which are rented
                                   at affordable rates and which are subject to deed restrictions
                                   limiting occupancy to low or very low income tenants. These
                                   units were created voluntarily by property owners pursuant to
                                   Piedmont’s affordable second unit program, which was
                                   established by ordinance in 2004. The affordability limits
                                   become eligible for termination after the 10-year contract period
                                   ends.
                                   The first of the rent restricted units will be eligible for
                                   termination in 2017. In all, there are 13 units with affordability
                                   limits that will expire between 2017 and 2022. This Housing
                                   Element includes a program to reduce the loss of units at the
                                   end of the contract period, thereby minimizing the risk of
                                   displacement and the loss of affordability.

                                   S      tate law requires each city and county to include an inventory
                                          of potential housing sites in their housing elements. The
                                          inventory must demonstrate that the community can meet its
                                   fair share of the region’s housing needs, as defined by the local
                                   Council of Governments (ABAG). As noted in previous chapters of

                                   development, since such development is usually more affordable (or
                                   easier to make affordable) than single family development. AB 2348
                                   indicates that in communities such as Piedmont, housing is more
                                   likely to be affordable on land that is zoned for at least 20 units per
                                   acre. That is referred to as the “default density” for sites deemed to
                                   be viable for affordable housing.
                                   The analysis in this chapter evaluates housing opportunities in seven
                                   major categories: (a) approved projects; (b) vacant land, (c) lot split
                                   potential; (d) underutilized multi-family properties; (e) underutilized
                                   commercial properties; (f) public land; and (g) second units.

                                            APPROVED PROJECTS
                                            The first category of housing opportunities is associated with
                                            projects that are approved but not yet built. This includes a 7-unit
                                            townhome development at 408 Linda Avenue, and one new single
                                            family home on a currently vacant parcel.1 All of these units would
                                            meet the “above moderate” income criteria, essentially satisfying
                                            Piedmont’s share of the RHNA for this income group for the entire
                                            planning period.
                                            Because the RHNA period begins on January 1, 2014 (even though
                                            the “planning period” does not begin until January 31, 2015), the
                                            City is also allowed to count units approved after January 1, 2014
                                            toward the RHNA. Between January 1 and June 30, four market-rate
                                            second units were approved. These are all presumed to meet
                                            “moderate” income criteria, based on prevailing rents for second
                                            units.
                                            Table 4-1 summarizes approved projects which may be “credited”
                                            against the RHNA.

  There were three other single family homes approved on vacant lots in 2007-2014, but the entitlements for these
homes have expired. Thus, these parcels are counted as “vacant” lots in Table 4-2 rather than approved projects.
                                                                                                           Page 4-2

                                 ANALYSIS              OF     HOUSING CAPACITY
                                              SITES FOR NEW HOUSING
                                              Vacant Lots
                                              Table 4-2 presents a list of vacant residentially zoned lots in
                                              Piedmont. These sites are also identified on Figure 4-1. There are
                                              47 vacant lots in Zone “A”; 46 of these have the capacity to support
                                              one single family home (plus second unit) each, and one may have
                                              sufficient lot area to be subdivided. The subdividable site is a 60,432
                                              square foot parcel (three potential lots).2
                                              As indicated in Table 4-1, there are also 11 vacant lots in Zone “E”;
                                              10 have the capacity to support a single family home (plus second
                                              unit) and one has sufficient lot area (although inadequate street
                                              frontage) to be subdivided into two lots. If the vacant land supply
                                              were to fully develop, 61 new homes and 61 second units could be
                                              produced, or a total of 122 new dwelling units.
                                              The actual development potential of the City’s vacant land
                                              supply is smaller than 122 units, however. Twelve of the 58
                                              lots listed in Table 4-1 are landlocked and have no street
                                              access. They would require a driveway easement across an
                                              adjoining property or a lot line adjustment to create a “flag lot”
                                              before they could be developed. These lots would also require
                                              water and sewer lateral extensions from the nearest street. The
                                              remaining 46 lots have water, sewer, storm drainage, and
                                              electrical service available at the curb.
                                              About two-thirds of the lots listed in Table 4-1 are owned by
                                              adjacent property owners and are effectively “double lots” (or in
                                              a few cases, triple lots). In other words, a primary residence sits
                                              on an adjacent lot while the subject lot is vacant. In such cases,
                                              the “vacant” lot may be partially improved with lawns, gardens,
                                              trellises and pergolas, swimming pools, and other features that
                                              make it functionally integrated with the primary lot.
                                              Other lots in Table 4-1 have constraints that have precluded their
                                              development to date. These include very steep topography,
                                              awkward or irregular configurations, and small size.
2 Theoretically, this site could support 6 units, but site geography, access, and topography make such a yield very
unlikely.

ANALYSIS OF HOUSING CAPACITY

                                 ANALYSIS            OF     HOUSING CAPACITY
                                          Once these factors are considered, the number of unconstrained
                                          developable vacant lots is closer to 20 or 25. This is the number of lots
                                          that have adequate road and utility access, are not encumbered by
                                          existing structures or landscape improvements, and have sufficient depth
                                          and width to support a new home. Although each new home could
                                          theoretically include a second unit, based on recent development practice
                                          it is more likely that only 10 to 20 percent of the new homes actually
                                          will.3 Thus, the realistic yield on these lots is estimated at between 25
                                          and 30 units (including second units).
                                          Given the cost of developing individual single family lots in Piedmont,
                                          these sites are not viable locations for affordable housing projects.
                                          However, the city strongly encourages the inclusion of second units in
                                          new residences, creating an opportunity for moderate, low, and very low
                                          income units whenever a new home is constructed
                                          Lot Split Potential
                                          New residential development may also occur through lot splits. The City
                                          presently requires 10,000 square feet (SF) per lot in the Single Family
                                          Residential Zone (Zone A) and 20,000 square feet (SF) per lot in the Estate
                                          Zone (Zone E). As a result of a program in the 2011 Housing Element, an
                                          exception to the Zone A minimum lot size requirement was created. If the
                                          prevailing lot size within a 500 foot radius is less than 8,000 square feet, then
                                          new lots as small as 8,000 square feet may be created.
                                          In theory, a lot which is twice the minimum could be divided to create two
                                          parcels. In practice, lot splits would be most feasible for properties with
                                          more than 180 feet of street frontage (enabling both lots to have at least 90
                                          feet of frontage, which is the City standard). Lot splits would also be more
                                          feasible on properties where the existing residence sits to one side of the
                                          property rather than in the center, and on lots which are relatively flat.
3 The assumption that 10-20 percent of future new homes might contain a second unit is based on actual production during the
last two Housing Element periods. Excluding “teardowns,” seven new market-rate homes were built between 1999 and 2014 and
one of these homes included a second unit (1/7 = 14%).
                                                                                                                     Page 4-7

ANALYSIS       OF    HOUSING CAPACITY
   There are currently 129 developed lots in Zone A with more than 20,000
   square feet and 17 developed lots in Zone E which exceed 40,000 square
   feet. Of this total, at least ten lots have been identified as having the practical
   potential to be divided into two lots, each with sufficient street frontage.
   There are approximately 120 developed lots between 16,000 and 20,000
   square feet in the City. A few are located in areas where the prevailing lot
   size is less than 8,000 square feet. Thus, these lots could potentially be
   divided under the new zoning provision adopted in 2013. However, the
   position of the house in the center of the lot would make lot splits difficult in
   most instances.
   Again, second units would also be possible on developed lots with “split”
   potential if new homes were added on the new parcels. Additional lots could
   be created if lot frontage variances were more liberally granted, or if the city
   permitted new “flag lots” (e.g., rear yard lots with panhandles extending to
   the street).
   The City has not identified potential “split” lots in its Housing Opportunity
   Site data base, but acknowledges that such lots exist and could supplement
   those that have been quantified in Table 4-2.
   Underutilized Multi-Family Zoned Properties
   Piedmont’s multi-family zone (Zone C) encompasses 27 parcels, most of
   which are located in a contiguous area along Linda Avenue between Grand
   Avenue and Oakland Avenue. Zone C also includes a handful of individual
   scattered sites around the city developed with small 2-9 unit buildings during
   the early 20th Century. Zoning in this district permits 22 units per acre,
   which meets state “default density” standards for sites that could potentially
   support housing affordable to low and very low income households.
   Not all of the sites in Zone C are developed with apartment buildings. Some
   of the sites in the Linda Avenue area are developed with single family homes
   and a few were initially built as single family homes but have been divided
   into two and three unit structures. Replacement of the single family homes
   with multi-unit buildings is allowed by zoning, but is unlikely given the
   small size of the properties and good condition of the housing. Because the
   sites are in multiple ownership, and because the City does not have a
   redevelopment agency to facilitate land assembly, the aggregation of small
   parcels to create large redevelopment sites is not feasible. Moreover, these
   properties already contain some of Piedmont’s most affordable units. Their
   redevelopment could conceivably decrease—rather than increase—overall
   affordability, since new units would likely rent (or sell) for more than the
   existing older units.
                                                                             Page 4-8

ANALYSIS      OF     HOUSING CAPACITY
   To confirm that these sites are unlikely to redevelop with apartments, the
   City undertook an analysis of assessed property values in Zone C. Of the 27
   parcels, there were five where the assessed value of the land was higher than
   the assessed value of the improvements on the property. The ratio of
   improvement to land values is often used as a metric for determining a
   property’s redevelopment potential. Of the five parcels, three were already
   developed as multi-family properties and two were single family homes (113
   Sunnyside and 415 Linda). Both of the single family homes are on lots that
   are smaller than 4,000 square feet and could only support a single unit in any
   case. Thus, there is very little chance they would be reused. A visual
   inspection of properties in Zone C likewise indicates low potential for
   redevelopment.
   Zone C includes the site of a vacant PG&E substation building at 408 Linda
   Avenue. As noted in the earlier section on “Approved Projects,” this 15,375
   square foot site has been approved for development with seven market-rate
   townhomes.
   Underutilized Commercial Properties
   Piedmont’s commercial zoning district (Zone D) includes 18 parcels which
   total approximately 3.3 acres. All parcels are currently developed. Six
   parcels totaling one acre are located in the Civic Center area; the remaining
   12 parcels are located on Grand Avenue. Of the 12 parcels, 11 are located
   on the west side of the Avenue and one is located on the east side.
   In June 2014, the City conducted an inventory of its commercial properties to
   determine which, if any, had the potential for redevelopment with housing.
   Again, an evaluation of assessed land value and assessed improvement value
   was conducted. Nine of the 18 parcels had assessed land values that
   exceeded their assessed improvement values. Of these, one was a 3,300
   square foot portion of a parking lot (the only parking available for
   Mulberry’s Market) and another was a 1,600 square foot landscaped plaza
   adjacent to the Wells Fargo Bank in Central Piedmont. Neither of these are
   viable development sites.
   The assessed value of the land at the Ace Hardware store at 1221 Grand
   Avenue is just slightly higher than the value of the improvements on that site.
   The parcel is nearly 30,000 square feet and could support 15 units above
   ground floor commercial uses under current zoning. However, this is the
   largest commercial property in the city and an important source of sales tax
   revenue. Its redevelopment as a mixed use project combining ground floor
   retail and upper story housing could potentially occur in the future, but there
   are no plans for such reuse at this time. The building is in active use and is a
   viable retail business.
                                                                          Page 4-9

ANALYSIS       OF     HOUSING CAPACITY
   To the immediate south of 1221 Grand Avenue, a small building at 1201
   Grand Avenue straddling the Oakland/Piedmont city limit line has an
   improvement value that is roughly one half its land value. This property
   contains a small one-story 1920s-era storefront building. Although the
   interior space is being used for storage for the adjacent hardware store, the
   property could potentially support a second story addition with two multi-
   family units. Parking is extremely limited, however, and could not be
   provided on-site. However, a precedent for such development exists on a
   similar parcel on the other side of the hardware store where a ground floor
   specialty store faces Grand Avenue and two apartments are located above
   and behind. This development took place during the 1990s.
   Two of the potentially underutilized parcels contain gasoline stations. One is
   located in the Civic Center area (340 Highland) and the other is located on
   the east side of Grand Avenue (29 Wildwood) just north of the Oakland
   border. Both stations are in active use. A review of the State Department of
   Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) “Envirostor” data base was conducted to
   determine the potential for contamination at these sites. The Shell station at
   29 Wildwood completed its leaking underground storage tank remediation in
   August 2010 and the DTSC case for this site is closed. The Valero/ Chevron
   station still has an open DTSC file, but is eligible for closure.
   The potential for four housing units has been assumed on the 29 Wildwood
   site. The property owner has already expressed interest in alternate uses for
   the site and the possibility of a mixed use project with housing on the upper
   floor(s) has been raised at Planning Commission meetings. The units could
   potentially be affordable and could potentially serve a special needs group,
   such as seniors or persons with disabilities. The site is located on a major
   transit line and is one block from a large supermarket in Oakland and
   numerous other services. The gas station at 340 Highland is not being
   counted at this time but could be considered in the future.
   The remaining three properties where land values exceed improvement
   values are single family homes on Grand Avenue. In fact, there are five
   single family homes on the block between Ace Hardware and Sunnyside
   Avenue. Under existing zoning, all of these homes could legally be

   commercial uses and one or two apartments above (or to the rear of the

   owner-occupied and all five are in excellent condition. No additional multi-
   family units have been assumed in the inventory below.

             Based on the analysis conducted as part of the 2015-2023 Housing
             Element, rezoning of parcels from Zone A (e.g., the single family zone)
             to Zones C or D would be unlikely to generate additional housing. As
             noted earlier, there are very few vacant parcels in Zone A, and those that
             do exist are scattered individual infill lots on residential streets. On the
             developed parcels in Zone A, the value of improvements on almost all
             sites far exceeds the value of the land, creating little incentive for
             redevelopment. The “highest and best use” of Zone A properties is
             single family housing, and the use of such sites for multi-family housing
             would not be economically productive or practical. This is further
             evidenced by the fact that the single family homes that do exist in Zones
             C and D have not “turned over” to multi-family uses, despite being
             zoned in that manner for more than 75 years.
             Public Land
             There are no public sites in Piedmont available for future development. The
             City does own 2.14 acres on Maxwelton Road adjacent to Mountain View
             Cemetery which was identified as a potential housing site in the 1992
             Housing Element, but this land is no longer considered a viable development
             site. A proposal for 18 units of market-rate senior housing was considered
             on this site in the mid-1990s but was dropped because of community
             opposition. Extensive hillside grading would have been required and the
             visual and environmental impacts of the project would have been significant.

                                           to housing in the future.4 Similarly, the 6.3 acre part of Mountain View

  National Recreation and Park Association standards call for 10 acres per 1,000 residents.

ANALYSIS       OF    HOUSING CAPACITY
   SECOND UNIT POTENTIAL
   Development Prospects
   Considering the lack of underutilized commercial land and vacant multi-
   family sites, the greatest potential for affordable housing in Piedmont is in
   second units.
   Second units may be created in a number of ways:
    they may be incorporated in brand new homes
    they may be added on to existing homes as net new floor space,
        including detached structures
    they may be created within the footprint and already habitable floor
        space of an existing home.
   In the latter case, second units may be developed by adding new bathrooms
   and kitchens and configuring a separate entrance within an existing home.
   Due to Piedmont’s topography, there are a number of houses on down-
   sloping lots with existing lower level spaces that could be converted to
   second units, without the capital required for additions or new detached
   structures. In some instances, it may be as simple as improving existing
   spaces that already have a kitchen, bathroom and separate entrance, but are
   not currently used as independent dwelling units.
   The latter category of facilities is sometimes referred to as “unintended
   second units.” These spaces already possess the physical characteristics of a
   second unit (i.e., a separate entrance, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a living/
   sleeping area that is separate from the main residence) but they are integrated
   into the primary residence and are not occupied by a separate household.
   Such spaces are often used as domestic quarters, au pair quarters, home
   offices, or living space for extended family (children, elder parents, etc).
   “Unintended” second units may also include pool houses (with kitchens and
   baths), guest cottages, and similar detached structures.
   As of 2014, the City Planning Department had identified 134 “unintended”
   second units which could potentially be upgraded and made available for
   habitation as separate dwellings. Most of these units were registered with
   the City in 1987 with the condition that they not be used as independent
   rental apartments. The City’s second unit requirements have changed since
   that time, and owners may now apply to use these units for rental housing. In
   addition, as called for by the 2011 Housing Element, the City has been
   expanding the list of unintended units as building permits and other planning
   applications are reviewed and as information is provided by residents,
   realtors, contractors, and others in the community.
                                                                          Page 4-13

ANALYSIS      OF     HOUSING CAPACITY
   The City has also begun compiling a data base of “suspected” second units,
   including addresses where units are not registered but may be rented (based
   on information provided by neighbors, real estate ads, etc.). As of 2014,
   roughly 25 suspected units have been identified. In addition, the City has
   reviewed Alameda County Tax Assessor records to identify parcels recorded
   as having two units on the property. Through this process, another 17
   addresses have been identified where an unintended or unregistered second
   unit may be present.
   Under the current second unit ordinance, the owners of unintended and
   suspected units could convert the spaces to active rentals “by right” provided
   that certain conditions are met. These conditions include various
   dimensional and size standards (see Chapter 5), the provision of off-street
   parking, and owner-occupancy of either the primary or secondary unit.
   The City has also created incentives to convert unintended and suspected
   second units into affordable units. The “unintended” units represent the best
   prospect for housing serving low and very low income households because
   they already have baths and kitchens, and could be converted at relatively
   low capital costs.
   The potential for brand new units in the city also is significant. The City’s
   Affordable Second Unit Program, established in 2005, has created a strong
   incentive for rent restrictions that make these units affordable to lower
   income renters.
   Viability of Second Units as Affordable Housing
   AB 2348 requires local governments that are meeting their RHNA
   requirements through means other than high-density zoning to demonstrate
   that their proposed approach is viable. Although Piedmont could
   theoretically accommodate 38 units of low and very low income housing on
   land zoned at 20 units per acre or more (gas stations and older commercial
   properties, and demolition and replacement of homes in the multi-family and
   mixed use zones), such an outcome is extremely unlikely—and not
   necessarily desirable. The high cost of land, absence of suitable sites, and
   dynamics of the Piedmont real estate market make the development of
   traditional “apartment” projects impractical. Less than one percent of the
   city’s housing units are in buildings with five dwellings or more, and these
   units were constructed more than 50 years ago. An affordable housing
   strategy that relied on traditional multi-family development would ultimately
   be less effective (and less productive) than one which was tailored to the
   unique characteristics of Piedmont’s land supply and housing stock.
                                                                          Page 4-14

ANALYSIS      OF     HOUSING CAPACITY
   Second units that are not rent-restricted are permitted “by right,” consistent
   with the Government Code requirements. Although these units are rented at
   market rates, they help meet the city’s affordable housing needs by providing
   a housing resource for seniors and small low and moderate income
   households. The City collects data annually on second unit rents as part of
   its business license program. Based on data for 2012, the median rent for
   second units in Piedmont was $980. There were 9 market rate units that were
   renting for less than $800 a month, which would make them affordable to
   small, very low income households. Even the more expensive units, which
   were in the $1,500 to $2,000 a month range, meet HUD affordability criteria
   for two person “moderate” income households. Such units provide an
   important alternative for those who cannot afford to purchase a Piedmont
   home.
   To meet its RHNA, the City would need to produce approximately four rent-
   restricted units a year through 2023. This would result in 32 units affordable
   to low and very low income households. The City would also need to
   produce approximately 2 market rate second units a year. Although not rent
   restricted, these units would likely be affordable to moderate income
   households based on prevailing market rents. A few would probably be
   affordable to low income households based on their small floor area.
   Reaching these targets is attainable, and has been achieved in Piedmont
   before. For example, in 2010 and 2011, the City approved four rent-restricted
   units each year. In 2012, the City approved three rent-restricted units and five
   market rate units. In the first six months of 2014 alone, four second units
   have been approved. During September 2014, applications for two more
   units were received, including a very low income unit and an exempt unit.
   The City has identified programs in this Housing Element to encourage
   production of both market rate second units and rent-restricted second units.
   The potential for second units in Piedmont homes is documented on Page 4-
   13. As noted, there are at least 134 homes in the city that have existing floor
   space with the potential for conversion to a legal second unit (i.e., homes
   with two kitchens, pool houses with bathrooms, etc.). Another 42 addresses
   have been identified as having “suspected” second units or unreported units
   based on County assessor data
   About half of the city’s homes have four or more bedrooms, including more
   than 500 homes with five or more bedrooms. The architecture and
   configuration of many Piedmont’s homes is also conducive to second unit
   production. Many of the city’s homes were built with multiple entrances,
   carriage houses and other outbuildings, space for domestic employees,
   bedrooms and bathrooms on multiple levels, and other physical attributes that
   lend themselves to second unit creation. Many of the lots are large and could
   support a second unit without a Zoning Variance.
                                                                          Page 4-17

ANALYSIS      OF     HOUSING CAPACITY
   The demographics of the city are also conducive to second unit production.
   The city includes a large population of seniors who would benefit from the
   availability of second units (for their own occupancy or to rent to tenants for
   extra income). There are also a large number of young adults who were
   raised in Piedmont but have limited options for staying there (other than
   continuing to reside in their parents’ homes). Second units in Piedmont are
   also an extremely attractive option for one- and two-person households,
   single parents with young children, and others who seek to enjoy the
   amenities and high quality of life in the city but are unable to purchase a
   home there. Given that the median price of a home in the city is over $1
   million, and given the absence of vacant land for multi-family housing, the
   need for second units in the city is substantial.
   ABILITY TO MEET THE ABAG FAIR SHARE
   HOUSING ASSIGNMENT GIVEN THE AVAILABLE
   LAND SUPPLY
   The City of Piedmont presently has a sufficient supply of land to meet the
   ABAG Regional Housing Needs Allocation of 60 units. Table 4-4 indicates
   the residual RHNA after committed units are subtracted out. Table 4-5
   identifies the opportunities to meet the RHNA for each of the income types
   described in the ABAG allocation.
   The table assumes that the combined assignment of 38 units for low and very
   low income households will be met through a combination of rent-restricted
   second units (32 units), and mixed use development on the two commercially
   zoned sites identified in this chapter (6 units). The table also recognizes that
   some of the small “market rate” second units may serve lower income
   households based on prevailing market rents. However, for analysis
   purposes, the market-rate second units are assumed to serve moderate income
   households.
                                                                          Page 4-18

                             CONSTRAINTS             TO    HOUSING          PRODUCTION
                                         The Land Use Map identifies three categories of residential use:
                                             “Estate Residential” areas have densities of 1 to 2 units per acre.
                                             “Low Density Residential” areas have densities of 3 to 8 units per acre.
                                              This designation applies to 75 percent of the city.
                                             “Medium Density Residential” areas have densities of 9 to 20 units per
                                              acre.
                                         The City’s Zoning Ordinance parallels these designations, and the Zoning

“Low Density Residential” uses of 3 to 8
units per acre.
                                         In addition, the 2009 General Plan created a “Mixed Use” designation.
                                         Mixed Use is defined as an area where commercial uses predominate, but
                                         where housing is expressly encouraged “above any new retail or office uses.”
                                         Residential densities in these areas may be 20 units per acre.
                                         There are no policies, programs, or other statements in the General Plan
                                         which impede housing construction. The Land Use Element encourages the
                                         continued development of housing on the remaining vacant lots in the City.
                                         It strongly encourages the conservation and maintenance of the existing
                                         housing stock, and the protection of the City’s residential neighborhoods
                                         from incompatible uses. Policies in the Plan explicitly encourage mixed use
                                         development (ground floor retail with upper floor housing) on Grand
                                         Avenue, redevelopment of the former PG&E substation (408 Linda) with
                                         multi-family housing, and ongoing investment in the existing housing stock.
                                         The Community Design Element of the Plan includes a goal to integrate new
                                         construction in a way that is physically compatible with existing structures.
                                         Policies in this Element discourage overpowering contrasts in scale and
                                         height, and encourage home additions and alterations which compliment the
                                         primary residence and surrounding neighborhood. The Element also
                                         includes a policy to encourage well-designed multi-family housing and
                                         discourage “motel-style” buildings. An action item calls for multi-family
                                         and mixed use design guidelines. Nothing in this Element discourages or
                                         constrains housing production. To the contrary, the Element is very
                                         supportive of infill and conservation of residential uses.
                                         Other elements of the General Plan address transportation, natural resources
                                         and sustainability, environmental hazards, parks and recreation, and
                                         community services and facilities. Nothing in these elements constrains
                                         housing development or inhibits investment in and maintenance of the
                                         housing stock.

                                             Zoning
                                             The Zoning Ordinance (Chapter 17 of the Piedmont Municipal Code)
                                             includes standards for lot size and frontage, building setbacks, height, floor
                                             area ratio, lot coverage, hardscape surface coverage, and parking.1 The
                                             Ordinance also identifies those uses which are permitted outright and those
                                             which are permitted with a conditional use permit. Single family residences
                                             are permitted outright on every parcel in the City.
                                             The Zoning Ordinance establishes five zones, including three residential
                                             zones, one commercial zone, and one public and open space zone. The three
                                             residential zones are:
                                              Zone A (single family), with a 10,000 square foot minimum lot size2
                                              Zone C (multi-family) which allows up to one dwelling unit per 2,000
                                                 square feet of lot area
                                              Zone E (estate) with a 20,000 square foot minimum lot size.
                                             Table 5-1 summarizes the development standards in each zone.

                          Approximately 85 % of the City’s residential land area is in Zone A. Some
have standards which      78 % of the lots in this Zone are less than 10,000 square feet. The 10,000
                          square foot standard has not constrained development, since the zone is

                          on existing lots. The City recently amended its Code to allow 8,000 square
construction. By capping  foot lots with 60 feet of frontage (instead of 90’) when the prevailing lots

                          with an opportunity for home expansion but are stringent enough to maintain
                          the overall scale of Piedmont’s neighborhoods and provide for a range of
                          housing sizes.
                          Neither Zones A nor E have standards which constrain housing construction.
                          By capping home size and lot coverage, the standards actually improve
                          affordability by discouraging teardowns and preserving smaller homes.
                          Single family height and setback allowances are more generous in Piedmont
                          than in nearby Oakland and facilitate the improvement of the city’s lots.
                          Requests for height and setback variances are relatively uncommon,
                          considering the large volume of planning applications received.
                          Multi-Family Residential Zone (C)
                          In the multi-family zone (Zone C), standards for lot area, frontage, height, lot
                          coverage, hardscape surface coverage, and setbacks apply. The minimum lot
                          area is 10,000 square feet and the minimum parcel frontage is 90 feet.
                          Neither of these standards is a development constraint, in part because all of
                          the City’s multi-family land has already been fully subdivided and
                          developed. The height limit in the multi-family zone is 35 feet. This
                          corresponds to three-story construction, which is compatible with the 21.8
                          unit per acre density (one unit per 2,000 square feet of lot area) allowed in
                          Zone C. Thus, height limits are not a constraint.
                                                                                                  Page 5-4

CONSTRAINTS       TO     HOUSING           PRODUCTION
      There are no floor area ratio limits in the multi-family zone. However, there
      is a 50 percent lot coverage limit and a 70 percent hardscape surface
      coverage limit. For projects in which at least 20 percent of the units are
      affordable, the hardscape limit increases to 80 percent, creating an incentive
      for such development.
      Setbacks in Zone C are 20’ in the front yard, 4’ in the side yard, and 4’ in the
      rear yard. Larger setbacks apply for corner lot side yards and through-lot
      rear yards (e.g., lots with frontage on two streets). These standards are not
      development constraints and have helped maintain design continuity in the
      City’s multi-family district.
      Multi-family buildings with up to 8 units are permitted by right in Zone C.
      Buildings with 8 units or more require a conditional use permit. Since there
      are no sites in the multi-family zone that exceed 16,000 square feet (i.e., with
      the potential for 8 or more units), and since the likelihood of land assembly is
      very low, this standard is not a constraint. The City provides density
      bonuses for multi-family projects that include affordable housing, creating an
      incentive for such development in the event sites ever become available.
      Commercial Zone
      Zone D, the commercial zoning district, applies to just 18 parcels in the city
      and totals 3.3 acres. The only uses permitted by right in Zone D are single
      family homes. Churches, retail, office, and service uses require conditional
      use permits, subject to findings relating to local benefits, land use
      compatibility, community impacts, and similar concerns.
      The Zoning Ordinance was amended in 2013 to allow mixed use
      development. Mixed use is defined in the Code as a development containing
      ground floor commercial uses and multi-family residential uses at a density
      that ranges from one unit per 3,600 square feet to one unit per 2,000 square
      feet of lot area (e.g., 12 to 21.8 units per acre). Structures combining
      commercial uses and single family homes are also allowed in Zone D (with a
      CUP), subject to a 50 percent lot coverage limit, 80 percent hardscape
      surface limit, and 35-foot height limit. Setbacks are typically half of those
      required in the single family district. These standards would not be
      constraints to mixed use development. The City is planning to develop
      design guidelines for mixed use developments, which could necessitate
      changes to the zoning standards to facilitate appropriate development in the
      future.
                                                                              Page 5-5

CONSTRAINTS       TO     HOUSING           PRODUCTION
      Parking Requirements
      The City requires two off-street, covered, non-tandem parking spaces for a
      house with up to four bedrooms, and three spaces for a five or six bedroom
      house. Spaces must be 9’ x 20’ or more. The parking standard is rarely an
      obstacle when a new home is constructed. None of the new homes built in
      Piedmont during the past 15 years has requested a variance for parking.
      The greater impact of the city’s parking requirements is on the expansion of
      existing homes. The Zoning Ordinance requires that current parking
      standards are met when bedrooms are added to existing residences. Many
      Piedmont homes were built in the 1910s and 1920s with one off-street
      covered parking space. Thus, the addition of a bedroom may trigger an
      accompanying requirement to expand or replace the garage. Because the
      expense of providing off-street parking is usually very high, many
      homeowners have opted to make do with their existing homes rather than
      adding on. Like the FAR requirements, this has not been an impediment to
      housing affordability, but rather an extremely effective tool for conserving
      the City’s inventory of smaller homes.
      On the other hand, parking requirements do present a potential constraint for
      the development of new market-rate second units. Unless they are income-
      and rent-restricted, such units require the provision of an off-street non-
      tandem parking space outside the front setback. Some lots are not well
      configured for additional off-street parking, making this standard difficult to
      meet. The City has leveraged this constraint to its advantage, allowing
      residents to create second units without parking if they agree to rent-restrict
      the unit. This has significantly expanded the potential for affordable (i.e.,
      rent-restricted) second units in the city. Some have argued that relaxation of
      the parking standards for market-rate units would provide an even greater
      benefit by increasing the total number of rental units, albeit at higher prices.
      However, this would seriously undermine the rent-restricted program, as
      most property owners only participate in the program because their lots are
      not well configured for additional off-street parking.
      Parking requirements for multi-family units vary by unit size. One space per
      unit is required if the dwelling is less than 700 square feet and two spaces are
      required if it is more than 700 square feet. The City also allows up to 25
      percent of the required spaces in multi-family development to be compact
      (7.5’ x 16’).
                                                                              Page 5-6

                                  CONSTRAINTS         TO     HOUSING           PRODUCTION
                                          While the City does not require a parking variance for rent-restricted second
                                          units, it does require a variance if the primary residence lacks the required
                                          number of parking spaces at the time the second unit application is being
                                          considered (for instance, if only one space is available for the primary unit).
                                          This presents a potential constraint for rent-restricted second units. An
                                          action in this Housing Element recommends a Code amendment to remove
                                          this constraint.
                                          Density Bonuses
                                          A 2005 amendment to the Zoning Ordinance added provisions for density
                                          bonuses. Section 17.7.2 stipulates that the Planning Commission may grant
                                          bonuses consistent with state law for projects with affordable units. As of
                                          2014, this translates to a range of 5 to 35 percent over the density allowed by
                                          zoning, depending on the total number and percentage of affordable units and
                                          their target population (i.e., very low income, seniors, etc.).
                                          Mobile and Manufactured Housing
Standards for residential landscaping are
evolving in response to concerns about
drought and greenhouse gas emissions      A 2005 amendment to the Zoning Ordinance added provisions for mobile
                                          and manufactured housing to the Zoning Ordinance. These uses are defined
                                          to be equivalent to single family homes and are thus permitted on all lots in
                                          the city, subject to design review.
                                          Landscape Requirements
                                          An application for a new home in Piedmont—and an application for any
                                          project which the Director of Public Works determines will significantly
                                          impact existing vegetation—requires submittal of a landscape plan to the
                                          Planning Commission. Landscaping must conform to various standards,
                                          including 15 percent minimum lot coverage and a requirement to landscape
                                          street-facing yard areas. This may add to the cost of a market-rate single
                                          family home in Piedmont, but it is not an impediment to affordable housing
                                          since such housing tends to be located within existing homes (e.g., second
                                          units).
                                          The City encourages the use of bay-friendly landscaping as a means of
                                          improving water quality and reducing potable water consumption. In
                                          addition, Countywide Clean Water Program Requirements call for best
                                          management practices (BMPs) to contain and treat urban runoff. BMPs
                                          include pervious pavement, rain gardens, directing runoff onto vegetated
                                          areas, and similar measures to reduce runoff to creeks and the Bay.
                                          Although the intent of each measure is to improve water quality, a secondary
                                          effect is to reduce potable water use, which should ultimately result in
                                          savings on utility bills.
                                                                                                                  Page 5-7

      Second Unit Regulations
      Second units in Piedmont are regulated by Section 17.40 of the City Code.
      Consistent with state law, the City allows second units by right (e.g., “minis-
      terial review,” with no review by the Planning Commissioners or neighbors)
      in all residential zones provided they meet the following requirements:
          The unit is less than 700 square feet
          Addition of the unit complies with zoning standards for floor area ratio,
           height, lot coverage, and setbacks
          An off-street, covered, non-tandem parking space is provided outside of
           the required front setback
          The owner lives on the property
      New second units are subject to design review if they modify the exterior of
      a structure. The architectural style, architectural elements, exterior materials,
      and color of the second unit must be consistent with the primary unit. Staff
      makes this determination, and may require modifications to achieve
      compliance. A second unit that proposes only interior remodeling with no
      exterior changes is exempt from design review.
      Second units which do not conform to the above standards may be approved
      through two methods: (a) the owner can apply for a zoning variance (for
      setbacks, floor area ratio, number of parking spaces, etc.), in which case
      discretionary review by the Planning Commission is required; or (b) the
      owner can apply under the provisions of the Piedmont City Code for rent-
      restricted second units. As noted in Chapter 2 of this Housing Element,
      second units may be as large as 850 square feet if they are rent restricted to
      low income households, or 1,000 square feet if they are rent restricted to very
      low income households.
      Moreover, a second unit may be permitted with no off-street parking if the
      unit is rent restricted to a very low income (VLI) household. In 2012, a Code
      amendment added an “extremely low income” second unit category. Such
      units may be provided with no off-street parking but they must be 300 square
      feet or less. The ELI units must be rented to a household earning less than
      30% of Areawide Median Income (AMI) at a rent deemed affordable to that
      household (e.g., less than 30% of household income). The VLI units must be
      rented to a household earning less than 50% of AMI at a rent deemed
      affordable to that household. Permitting a rent-restricted unit with no
      parking requires that the Planning Commission make the following findings:
          In looking at the totality of circumstances, there is sufficient street
           parking available to accommodate the parking exception, including
           proximity to public transit services; and
                                                                              Page 5-8

CONSTRAINTS      TO     HOUSING          PRODUCTION
         The exception will not negatively impact traffic safety or emergency
          vehicle access to residences, or create hazards by obstructing views to
          or from adjoining sidewalks, driveways and streets.
      The net effect of these regulations has been a significant increase in second
      unit applications since 2005, with approximately the same number of
      applications for market-rate units as rent-restricted units. The regulations
      have not constrained second unit production—if anything, they have
      stimulated their development. More importantly, the regulations have
      stimulated the development of rent-restricted units—a novel form of
      affordable housing that did not exist in Piedmont prior to 2005. As of 2014,
      16 rent-restricted second units have been approved in Piedmont, including 14
      very low income units and two low income units. Of this total, 13 of the
      very low income and one of the low income units have actually been
      constructed.
      Consistent with the recommendations of the 2011 Housing Element, an
      evaluation and status report on the second unit program was completed in
      2011. The status report found a marked change in public attitudes toward
      second units since the 1980s, with much greater acceptance toward second
      units and recognition of their value to the community. The shift in public
      opinion may be attributed to a number of factors, including:
             An increase in households with two working parents who wish to
              have private living quarters for an au pair.
             An increase in extended families, including aging parents or adult
              children returning home following college or living at home after
              graduation.
             Security for residents who are frequently away from home.
             Need for extra income for middle income or senior households with
              high housing costs.
             Perceived increase in resale value.
             A way for seniors to age in place, downsize without giving up their
              properties, or move into a second unit so that their children and
              families may occupy the primary unit.

                             administration, the low rental tax (typically about $200/yr per unit), and the

CONSTRAINTS       TO     HOUSING           PRODUCTION
      As part of the 2014-2015 Housing Element Update, the City completed
      another assessment of the second unit program and identified the following
      issues:
         The City should seek incentives for renewal of the affordability
          restrictions on rent-restricted units when they expire. Presently, the units
          must be rent-restricted for 10 years. At the end of the 10 years, the
          owner may raise the rent to market rates, potentially creating a hardship
          for low income tenants. The City believes that requiring a longer term
          (i.e., 20 or 25 years) rental deed restriction at the time of second unit
          approval would not be an effective solution. A longer contract could be
          a disincentive, as most of the owners participating in the program are
          attracted to the flexibility of a 10-year term. Other incentives for longer
          term rentals should be explored. Incentives for “rollovers” of expiring
          contracts may be needed to avoid the loss of affordable units.
         The City cannot “require” that a rent-restricted unit is actually occupied
          after it is permitted. Anecdotally, the City is aware that a number of
          registered second units, including a few of the rent-restricted units, are
          vacant. Some owners may have applied for the second unit permit to
          increase the value of their home or to give them the flexibility to rent the
          unit out at some point in the future. An action program in this Element
          recommends incentives to encourage owners to actually rent their units,
          rather than just maintain them as empty space.
         The City prohibits occupancy of rent-restricted units by non-dependent
          family members (such as aging moderate and above moderate income
          parents who wish to allow their children to live in the primary residence).
          It has been suggested that the City expand allowances for units without
          off-street parking to accommodate more households with extended
          families. This would eliminate the “trigger” that enables the City to
          create new affordable units. Thus, the priority at this point is to focus off-
          street parking exceptions on units that will be occupied by unrelated very
          low income tenants.
         The City prohibits second units (rent restricted and market rate) from
          being rented for less than 30 days. Thus, the use of such housing as “Air
          BNB” type vacation rentals is not permitted. However, the City has
          observed at least one instance in which a unit was being advertised in
          this manner. This could become a bigger enforcement issue in the future,
          in the event more households seek to rent their units in violation of city
          codes. Additional public education on this issue may be needed.
                                                                              Page 5-11

CONSTRAINTS     TO     HOUSING           PRODUCTION
       Piedmont has a large inventory of “unintended” second units that are not
        being used as separate rental apartments. These include pool houses,
        basements or attics with second kitchens, finished rooms over garages,
        home offices, and numerous other configurations which make these
        spaces suitable for conversion into in-law apartments. There are also a
        large number of homes on down sloping lots with lower levels that could
        potentially be converted to second units with no street visibility. One of
        the aspirations for the rent-restricted second unit program has been to
        incentivize the use of these spaces as separate dwellings. This will
        continue to be the case in the future.
        The City is continuing to amass a data base of “suspected” second units
        (e.g., units that are not registered that may be illegally rented). It has
        also taken note of County assessor records which list at least 17 single
        family parcels without registered second units that are assessed as two
        unit buildings. There may be opportunities to create new registered units
        through an amnesty program, on the condition that the newly legalized
        units are rent-restricted and income-restricted. In such cases, waivers
        from Planning Code requirements could be considered. To the extent
        public health and safety is ensured, certain Building Code waivers also
        could be considered. However, the City also must ensure the well-being
        of tenants who may be occupying spaces that do not meet basic standards
        for habitation (e.g, basements with no windows or inadequate ventilation,
        etc.)
       To discourage the use of rent-restricted units by family members, the
        City prohibits such units from having an interconnecting interior door to
        the main house. The prior Housing Element suggested that this be
        revisited, as it could be discouraging some households from applying for
        rent-restricted units. However, the City believes this design standard
        should be maintained. In its absence, it would be much more likely that
        the units would serve extended families, which is not the intent of the
        rent-restricted program,
       Additional methods should continue to be explored to retain the existing
        stock of second units, including illegal units. Several actions have been
        added to this Housing Element to encourage the preservation and active
        use of existing units.
       Additional incentives for second units serving moderate income
        households should continue to be explored. An example would be the
        2012 Code amendment that provided a floor area ratio exemption for the
        floor space associated with second units in brand new homes.
                                                                            Page 5-12

CONSTRAINTS       TO     HOUSING          PRODUCTION
          There are still opportunities to expand public awareness of the value and
           benefits of second units, and the opportunities to create them in
           Piedmont. During the 2014 Town Hall meeting on housing, several
           residents suggested a multi-media outreach campaign aimed at raising
           the public’s appreciation for second units. This could newspaper
           interviews with second unit owners and tenants, as well as facts and
           figures about second unit regulations.
      The City is continuing to work proactively to promote second unit
      development. Application fees for second units have not been raised since
      the adoption of the last Housing Element. Business taxes for second units
      remain relatively low. Significantly, only three applications for second units
      have been denied since the program was created in 2005.
      Emergency Shelter
      The City of Piedmont amended its zoning code in 2005 to permit emergency
      shelter and transitional housing in Zone B with a conditional use permit.
      Pursuant to a State law approved in 2008 (SB2), the City amended its Code
      in 2013 (effective 1/1/14) to remove the CUP requirement for emergency
      shelter altogether. It is now permitted by right in Zone B.
      Properties with this designation include most of the Piedmont Civic Center
      complex. There is sufficient capacity in this zone to accommodate the need
      for shelter, as determined by EveryOne Home and the Alameda County
      Department of Housing and Community Development. As noted in Chapter
      4 of this Housing Element, the County of Alameda estimated Piedmont’s
      homeless population at 6 residents in 2013. It is possible to meet the need
      for a shelter for this population in Zone B.
      Zone B includes more than 80 acres of land, or about 7 percent of the city.
      Of this total, about 50 acres consists of parkland. The remaining 30 acres
      includes a mix of land owned by the City, the School District, and the private
      sector. Excluding the parkland, the zone includes 13 parcels. These parcels
      range in size from 2,500 square feet to 18 acres, with a median size of 13,626
      square feet. Typical parcel sizes are one-half acre or larger, as the sites
      correspond to schools and other public buildings. The areas most suitable for
      emergency shelter are in the Civic Center area and at the Corporation Yard.
                                                                             Page 5-13

CONSTRAINTS       TO    HOUSING            PRODUCTION
      During the past three years, the Piedmont Civic Center has been the subject
      of a master planning effort that has underscored the potential for new and/or
      expanded community facilities. City Hall itself sits on a 36,000 square foot
      parcel that also includes the Fire Department and the Veterans Memorial
      Building (a separate structure including the Police Department and
      community recreation rooms). The Civic Center Master Plan identified the
      potential to retrofit portions of the Veterans Building for other community
      uses. Demolition and replacement of the Veterans Building with a structure
      that is more architecturally compatible with the rest of the Civic Center
      complex also has been discussed, raising the possibility for additional uses
      and more floor space.
      Adjoining this complex and also in Zone B is 801 Magnolia Avenue, a
      13,600 square foot parcel containing the former Christian Scientist Church.
      The 12,600 square foot structure was acquired by the City several years ago.
      About two-thirds of the structure is now used as the Piedmont Center for the
      Arts while the remainder is vacant and being renovated for a future use that
      has yet to be determined.
      West of this block (and also in Zone B) is the Piedmont Recreation Center,
      occupying almost an entire city block and including the Piedmont
      Community Pool, the Recreation Center building, a carriage house, tennis
      courts, and parking areas. This area includes two parcels totaling about
      81,000 square feet. The focus of the Civic Center Master Plan was the
      reconfiguration of this space, potentially expanding total buildable area by
      closing Bonita Avenue and redeveloping existing recreation facilities with
      larger multi-purpose structures. A May 2008 feasibility study commissioned
      by the City identified the potential for a complete renovation of the 11,400
      square foot recreation building (including the potential for new activities),
      addition of a new 9,000 square feet wing, development of a new 18,900
      square foot swim center, and a 132 space parking structure. In 2008, the City
      commissioned a scale model showing how new buildings might be
      accommodated in this area. The project has not moved forward, but the
      capacity for additional activities and facilities has been clearly demonstrated.
      The Civic Center area is well served by public transportation, including a
      local bus line providing frequent connections to BART and Downtown
      Oakland, and two trans-bay bus lines to San Francisco. It is centrally located
      within Piedmont and is large enough to accommodate multiple activities
      without conflicting with adjoining uses (which are primarily schools, parks,
      and a small commercial district).
                                                                            Page 5-14
CONSTRAINTS       TO    HOUSING           PRODUCTION
      The other major opportunity area in Zone B is the City’s Corporation Yard.
      This site occupies several acres on Moraga Avenue and is used for
      maintenance and public works activities. In the past, the City has considered
      reconfiguring the site to accommodate community facilities, but no specific
      proposals have been made. Action 33.E of the Piedmont General Plan
      Community Services and Facilities Element (adopted in 2009) calls for a
      study of the property to determine its long term use potential.
      Development standards in Zone B are likewise conducive to the construction
      of emergency shelter. The Zone has a 35 foot height limit, and no maximum
      lot coverage limit or floor area ratio limit. The General Plan designation that
      corresponds to this zone has a floor area ratio standard of 0.75. This would
      allow a substantial structure even on a relatively small lot.
      Transitional/ Supportive and Employee Housing
      The Municipal Code was amended in 2013 (effective 1/1/14) to add
      definitions of transitional and supportive housing. The code was further
      edited to state that transitional and supportive housing are considered
      residential uses and are subject only to the same permitting processes as
      other housing in the subject zone. There are no special regulatory
      requirements applied to either use.
      California Health and Safety Code Section 17.021.5 includes a similar
      requirement for employee housing. The Code states that any
      employee housing for six persons or fewer shall be deemed a single
      family residential structure and shall not require permits beyond those
      required for single family homes. Piedmont does not have employee
      housing, nor does it have major employers who might develop such
      housing in the future. However, an action has been included in
      Chapter 6 of this Housing Element to amend the Municipal Code to
      incorporate this provision.
      Cumulative Impacts of Land Use Controls
      State law requires the City to consider not only the impact of individual
      development standards, but also the cumulative effects of these standards on
      the cost and supply of housing. For example, it is possible that a particular
      setback requirement may appear reasonable on its own, but may limit
      development opportunities when combined with height and lot coverage
      limits. Sometimes, the combined effect of different development controls
      can require more expensive construction (such as two-story buildings instead
      of single story buildings) or result in frequent zoning variances.
                                                                            Page 5-15

CONSTRAINTS       TO    HOUSING           PRODUCTION
      In Piedmont, single family zoning standards do not create an adverse
      cumulative impact on development costs or the housing supply. Side and
      rear setbacks are just four feet on most lots (compared to five feet on
      adjacent Oakland properties), creating an ample building envelope, and
      providing many choices for siting a home or an addition on a property. Lot
      coverage limits tend to favor two-story construction over single story
      construction on small (less than 4,000 square feet) lots, but the limits are
      generous enough to provide plenty of space on almost all lots for a modest
      one-story home.
      Floor area ratio limits, coupled with the other standards, still leave ample
      opportunities for construction and home expansion. The use of a sliding
      standard for FAR rather than a fixed limit ensures that even small lots still
      can support a substantial home. The 35-foot height allowance for all
      residential lots provides flexibility in design, particularly compared to nearby
      communities with more restrictive single family heights. Moreover, the 35-
      foot standard is an average height and some portions of a structure may be
      even taller.
      The single family zoning standards also support the achievement of the
      maximum densities prescribed by the Piedmont General Plan. The General
      Plan indicates that “Low Density Residential” areas may have densities of up
      to 8 units per acre. While the 10,000 square foot lot standard would preclude
      that density from being attained on raw land, virtually all of Piedmont was
      subdivided more than 50 years ago. Prevailing lot patterns are already in the
      8 unit per acre range in much of the city, and the General Plan density is
      achieved and even exceeded in some locations.
      The development standards in single family areas are particularly conducive
      to the production of rent-restricted second units. In particular, the parking
      exception provides a strong incentive to create an affordable second unit.
      Variances are rarely required for such units, given the FAR, lot coverage,
      height, and setback allowances for single family lots.
      The multi-family zone (Zone C) contains 27 parcels. Existing single family
      homes in this zone could conceivably be replaced by multi-family residences.
      In such instances, zoning does not constrain redevelopment. However,
      because the existing structures are mostly owner-occupied single family
      homes in excellent condition, there is little economic incentive to replace
      them or divide them into multi-family flats.
                                                                              Page 5-16

CONSTRAINTS       TO     HOUSING          PRODUCTION
      On a 60 x 100 foot lot in Zone C, the zoning density standards would permit
      construction of a three-unit building. After required setbacks are subtracted,
      the buildable area of the lot would be 3,952 square feet. The 50% lot
      coverage limit would mean that only 3,000 square feet of this 3,952 square
      foot envelope could be covered by structures. There are no FAR limits, and
      there is a 35’ height limit, so conceivably, the parcel could support a three-
      story 9,000 square foot structure (3,000 square feet of floor space per unit).
      These standards provides ample opportunities for larger (three-bedroom)
      multi-family units as well as smaller 1-2 bedroom units. The opportunity for
      an even larger building is provided by offering a density bonus (in the form
      of added lot coverage and an additional dwelling unit) for affordable
      housing.
      As noted in the text, new housing units in Zone C require one or two parking
      spaces per unit, depending on unit size. The spaces must be outside the front
      setback and they must be covered and non-tandem. Given the 50% lot
      coverage and 20’ front setback requirements, this would typically require
      ground level garages or carports in any new multi-family construction. An
      apartment complex with three one-bedroom units would need to provide
      three off-street parking spaces, which is achievable on most lots in Zone C.
      The requirement would be somewhat more challenging for two or three
      bedroom units.
      City Charter
      Piedmont is a charter city, and its municipal charter contains special
      requirements for the rezoning of property. Section 9.02 of the Charter
      specifies that:
               “No existing zones shall be reduced or enlarged…and no
               zones shall be reclassified without submitting the question to
               a vote at a general or special election…. No zones shall be
               reduced or enlarged and no zones reclassified unless a
               majority of the voters voting upon the same shall vote in
               favor thereof…”
      This requirement—that a citywide vote be held to rezone property—makes it
      difficult to increase the supply of land for higher density housing in the City.
      Given the City’s single family character, it is unlikely that voters would
      approve the rezoning of land from single family to multi-family use.
                                                                            Page 5-17

CONSTRAINTS       TO     HOUSING          PRODUCTION
      The Charter requirements apply only to zoning map changes, and not to
      zoning text changes. This gives the City the flexibility to modify the lists of
      permitted and conditionally permitted uses, and to alter development
      standards, without a citywide vote. When a vote is required, the City abides
      by the Election Code of the State of California, as required by Charter
      Section 8.03. The assistance of the Alameda County Registrar of Voters is
      requested in the designation of polling places, counting of ballots, and so on.
      A rezoning measure would most likely be placed on the same ballot as the
      general election, although the charter does allow for a special election.
      General municipal elections are held every other year. It is unlikely that the
      City would hold a special election for a zoning change alone, but if it did this
      would represent a municipal cost since fees could be required for polling
      place rental, counting of ballots, and public information about the measure.
      The city’s most recent experience with a zoning-related ballot measure was
      in 2006. The City acquired the former Christian Scientist Church at 801
      Magnolia Avenue and sought to rezone the property from “Single Family
      Residential” to “Public Facilities.” The measure was placed on the same
      ballot as the regular municipal election (including City Council and School
      Board members). The incremental cost of adding this measure was minimal,
      since it appeared on a general election ballot and did not require
      informational mailers or other “campaign” expenses. The measure was
      approved by 89.5 percent of the voters.
      Based on actual experience, the Charter requirement has had no impact on
      housing production in the last 50 years. The Charter could indeed be a
      constraint if the city included large vacant or redevelopable areas, but
      Piedmont does not. In fact, it appears that all land in the City is already
      zoned to its highest and best use, which on 99 percent of Piedmont’s
      privately-owned parcels is single family housing. There has been no
      pressure to rezone single family zoned land for multi-family housing in the
      city, even on parcels that are currently developed with apartments. The
      handful of legal, non-conforming apartments that exist in the single family
      zone are considered “grandfathered” structures. Zoning precludes their
      expansion, but it does not preclude continued investment in these properties
      or their use as rental apartments.
                                                                              Page 5-18

CONSTRAINTS       TO     HOUSING          PRODUCTION
      In fact, single family homes even appear to be the highest and best use in the
      multi-family zoning district. About half of the parcels in this district are
      developed with single family homes, and there have been no proposals to
      demolish these homes and replace them with multi-unit buildings. To the
      contrary, there have been proposals (not approved) to convert existing multi-
      unit structures in this zone into single family homes. The City has adopted
      policies through its Housing Element to encourage the preservation of multi-
      family structures regardless of location and discourage their conversion into
      single family homes. The condominium conversion provisions of the
      Piedmont Subdivision Ordinance further restrict the conversion of existing
      multi-family rental apartments to other uses.
      Despite these factors, the requirement for a citywide vote to rezone property
      could influence the supply, cost, and timing of housing production at some
      point in the future. Through this Housing Element, the City has added an
      action program to monitor the Charter’s impact on housing production in
      Piedmont.
      Design Review
      Most exterior alterations to Piedmont homes require Design Review. A
      three-tiered system is used for design review applications:
          Administrative Design Review (ADR) is an expedited process for minor
           projects that replace an existing feature with a new feature that is
           different in some way, including changes in materials, function, or
           design. Examples are window replacements (not involving a change in
           size or location) and new deck handrails. ADR also covers new features
           that have no impact on neighbors or the public.
          Staff Design Review (SDR) is a process for projects with exterior
           improvements valued at under $75,000 that do not require a variance or
           involve construction of a front-yard fence. Examples are new decks,
           new porches, dormers, and small additions. Adjacent neighbors are
           notified of the application and are given a chance to comment on the
           plans.

                            Over the years, the City has taken a number of steps to remove design review
                            constraints and streamline the design review process. A relatively large

                            neighborhood character and housing conservation.

CONSTRAINTS       TO    HOUSING          PRODUCTION
      There may be additional steps the City can take to expedite design review
      and create additional categories of exemptions. In 2007, a citywide General
      Plan Survey was conducted, including questions about Design Review.
      About 25 % of the respondents (over 300 out of 1,200 households) believed
      that the requirements were too strict. Many residents offered ideas for
      improving the process. The most common suggestions were:
          Provide more exemptions for small projects, especially those not visible
           to neighbors.
          Provide clearer rules and more consistent decision making.
          Simplify the process and make it faster and less expensive, potentially
           reducing fees for smaller projects such as fences and gates.
          Limit the ability of neighbors to influence design outcomes.
      An action item in this Housing Element recommends that City staff work
      with the Planning Commission to consider these kinds of changes in the
      coming years. An overhaul of the City’s Design Guidelines is recommended
      to ensure that they remain relevant, user friendly, and are formatted to
      contemporary standards.
      Subdivision Ordinance
      Chapter 19 of the City Code regulates the division of property in Piedmont
      and establishes standards for the design of improvements such as roads and
      utilities. The Code does not pose constraints to development. Because
      virtually all new housing in Piedmont takes place on existing lots, the
      provisions of the subdivision ordinance rarely apply when a new home is
      built.
      Chapter 19 was revised in 2005 to ensure compliance with the Government
      Code. One outcome of the revision was a streamlined process for lot line
      adjustments. Another outcome was a “no net loss” provision for apartment
      conversions which stipulates that any apartments converted to condominiums
      must be replaced in kind by an equivalent number of rental units. This
      reduces the likelihood of condo conversions in the city and protects the rental
      housing supply.
      Growth Control
      The City of Piedmont has no City-imposed or voter-imposed growth control
      measures.
                                                                            Page 5-21

CONSTRAINTS       TO    HOUSING           PRODUCTION
      Building Code Requirements
      Piedmont has adopted the 2013 California Building Code of Regulations and
      the 2013 California Residential Code. The City has also adopted the 2013
      California Energy Code, Mechanical Code, Plumbing Code, and Green
      Buildings Code. In each case, a number of amendments to the state code
      have been incorporated to reflect issues of local concern. For example, the
      City requires building permits for parking pads located in the front yard
      setback, stairs with four or more risers, and public sidewalks. In addition, the
      City requires one hour fire-resistant construction for the underside of floors
      and decks under certain conditions. Additional requirements also have been
      adopted for fire sprinklers, spark arresters, and fire-retardant roof materials.
      The City’s codes also require soils reports for new homes, drainage plans for
      large construction projects, a minimum driveway width of 12 feet and a
      maximum driveway slope of 20 percent. These standards do not impede
      housing development, but may result in slightly higher construction costs for
      new homes.
      The City only imposes requirements that have been deemed necessary to
      maintain public health, safety, and welfare. The City is close to the Hayward
      Fault and is immediately adjacent to the site of the most destructive urban
      wildfire in California history, in the Oakland Hills. Most of the locally-
      adopted building code amendments are necessitated by seismic concerns, fire
      safety, and emergency access considerations.
      Piedmont has adopted specific Building Code standards for second units.
      One-hour fire separation is required between the second unit and the primary
      residence. Staircases accessing the unit must be at least 36 inches wide.
      New construction of habitable rooms must have ceiling heights of at least
      7’6”, and bathrooms and hallways must have ceiling heights of at least 7’0”.
      In existing structures, for instance, in existing second units, ceiling heights
      are not required to meet the 7’6” standard and may be lower. Proper
      ventilation and window openings must be provided, and adequate electrical
      service must exist.
      Although these requirements are all based on the California Building Code,
      there are some Piedmont homes with separate living quarters that do not
      meet these standards. Converting these spaces to legal second units which
      meet all Code provisions could require a significant investment by the
      property owner and make some projects infeasible. Allowing exceptions to
      the building code (for instance, allowing a 30” staircase instead of a 36”
      staircase) under certain conditions could make it easier for some property
      owners to convert unintended units into rental properties.
                                                                              Page 5-22

      Fees have not changed since 2009, despite increases in administrative costs
      and construction values. The City has placed many of its fees on a sliding
      scale based on project value, so fees for smaller projects are less burdensome
      for owners. In addition, new fee categories such as “Fence Design Review”
      have avoided the need to pay Planning Commission caliber fees for relatively
      low value projects. In addition, the City has not increased fees for second
      units since 2002, despite increased administrative costs.
      Building permit fees represent a larger share of application costs than
      planning fees. These fees are calculated on a sliding scale depending on the
      value of the project (value includes labor and overhead costs s well as
      material costs). The fees include Permit and Inspection fees, a Plan Check
      fee, a SMIP (Strong Motion Instrumentation Program) fee, and a Title 24
      energy compliance fee, among others. Piedmont’s building permit fees are
      comparable to those in other cities.

CONSTRAINTS       TO    HOUSING           PRODUCTION
      If a new home with a project value of $750,000 were to be proposed in the
      City today, the city planning fee would be $3,540 if no variance were
      required. The building permit fee would depend on the number of fixtures,
      outlets, plumbing connections, and so on, and would be in the range of
      $9,150, bringing the total cost to about $12,700. For brand new homes, there
      are also water connection and system capacity fees associated with
      connecting to the EBMUD water system. Such fees would not apply if the
      project involved tearing down and rebuilding an existing home.
      Total permitting fees vary depending on the characteristics of each project,
      but typically represent 1 to 2 % of total costs in Piedmont. By contrast, fees
      equal to 7 or 8 % of project value have been reported by the fast-growing
      communities of Southern and Eastern Alameda County.
      The same fee schedules shown above also apply to multi-family construction.
      As noted earlier, there are 27 parcels in Piedmont zoned for multi-family
      development. The recently approved 7-unit townhome project at 408 Linda
      Avenue (the former PG&E site) had a Design Review fee of $3,000 and a
      Variance fee of $710. This amounted to just $530 per dwelling unit, which is
      less than 20 percent of the planning fee that would be required for a new
      single family home. There were no school, park, transportation, or other
      impact fees. Utility connection fees are set by the various water and sewer
      providers and are consistent with those charged in other jurisdictions.
      Assuming a hypothetical construction cost of $200,000 per multi-family unit,
      the building permit cost for a 6-unit structure would be $11,803. The cost
      per unit cost would be $1,967, which is less than one percent of construction
      cost.
      Since multi-family projects are typically larger than single family projects
      and are subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA),
      environmental assessment is usually necessary. The City collects CEQA
      related fees to recover the cost of consultants and administrative handling. In
      the case of the most recent proposal for the former PG&E site, the project
      was subject to a CEQA Initial Study and Scoping fee of $23,465. This
      resulted in a determination that an EIR was required. An additional $78,136
      was expended for this purpose, for a total of $101,600, or about $14,500 per
      dwelling unit.
                                                                           Page 5-25
CONSTRAINTS       TO    HOUSING          PRODUCTION
      This relatively large expense was somewhat unique to this particular site,
      however, as it would involve demolition of a historically significant building
      and former electric substation that required hazardous materials remediation
      prior to sale. Replacement of a single family home with a three or four unit
      building would likely require a smaller CEQA fee, or could require no
      CEQA fee at all. When possible, the City seeks to apply the CEQA
      exemption for infill projects from Public Resources Code 21159.23 and .24,
      thereby further reducing development costs.
      Permit Processing
      All planning applications are processed in accordance with the Permit
      Streamlining Act (PSA), which allows 60 days between the submittal of a
      complete application and a formal action on that application. Most planning
      applications are processed in less than 40 days. Planning Commission
      applications require a 30-day lead time before the hearing, during which time
      a determination is made that the application is complete. If it is, applications
      can be appealed for up to 10 days after the Commission hearing date.
      Building permits are processed in a timely fashion. Simple applications are
      typically reviewed within one to five days, and more complex applications
      may take several weeks.
      A majority of planning applications are for Design Review. Applications for
      General Plan Amendments or projects which require environmental impact
      reports or subdivision tract or parcel maps typically take several months to
      process, but are very infrequent. Lengthy processing times are most likely to
      be associated with incomplete submittals or projects which do not meet the
      City’s Design Guidelines.
      Due to the high level of citizen participation in the City, new homes
      sometimes require multiple Planning Commission hearings before receiving
      approval. With only one to two new homes proposed in a given year, it is
      not uncommon for such projects to take a year or more from pre-application
      planning conferences to issuance of a building permit.
                                                                            Page 5-26

      Typical Procedures for Single and Multi-family Projects
      Building a single family home or a multi-family project in Piedmont usually
      begins with one or more pre-application conferences with City staff. This
      provides an opportunity to identify issues of concern, discuss the City’s
      permitting requirements and application process, and review relevant Design
      Review requirements and zoning rules. Pre-application conferences often
      involve the property owner and project architect, but may also include
      contractors, landscape architects, and other design and construction
      professionals. The City encourages these “no fee” meetings, as they can save
      the applicant time and money in the long run by making sure all parties are
      aware of the City’s standards and procedures. The City’s zoning regulations
      and design guidelines are on the City’s website, as are “Frequently Asked
      Questions” (FAQs) about planning and building permits.
      Large projects such as new homes or multi-unit buildings are subject to
      Design Review by the Planning Commission. If Zoning Variances are
      necessary, the applications may be submitted concurrently. Applications
      must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the Commission meetings, which
      occur on the second Monday of each month. Applicants are required to
      submit two copies of their plans, an application form, a worksheet showing
      calculations (of floor area ratio, lot coverage, height, setbacks, etc.), and an
      affidavit which verifies that immediate neighbors have been notified of the
      plans. Prior to the Commission hearing, the City makes a determination that
      the application is complete and places it on the Planning Commission
      agenda. If the application is incomplete, the missing materials are requested
      and the item is not agendized.
      Two weeks before the hearing, the City notifies persons within a fixed radius
      of the property and invites them to review the plans. The notification radius
      varies from 100 feet to 300 feet depending on the scope of the project, with
      new homes subject to the 300 foot requirement. Applicants must then
      provide eight reduced scale copies of their plans, six of which are distributed
      to the Planning Commission. A staff report is prepared, including proposed
      conditions of approval.
      The Commission then holds a public hearing, at which time the project is
      either approved, approved with modifications or conditions, or denied. A 10-
      day appeal period follows the Commission’s decision. Following the appeal
      period, an applicant may apply for a building permit by submitting
      construction drawings, calculations, permit fees, and an application form.
      An applicant has one year to apply for the building permit following
      Planning Commission approval, although the City has established a process
      for a six-month extension to this limit.
                                                                               Page 5-27

CONSTRAINTS       TO     HOUSING           PRODUCTION
      Other Potential Regulatory Constraints
      All contractors and design professionals working on Piedmont properties are
      required to have a business license. These costs are typically passed on to
      property owners in the contractor’s fees, increasing remodeling costs.
      However, the fees are low compared to other communities and are not
      regarded as a constraint to housing development or improvement.
      Owners renting property in Piedmont are required to pay a tax of $200 a year
      or 1.395 % of gross rental receipts, whichever is greater. The tax is relatively
      low and has not been an impediment to the development of rental housing. It
      has not increased since the last Housing Element was adopted in 2011, nor
      since the prior Element was adopted in 2002. In the event the City raises the
      rental tax in the future, it could consider a graduated rate, with higher rates
      levied on single family rental homes and lower rates (or tax waivers) for rent
      restricted units.
      Housing costs also may be impacted by the City’s sidewalk inspection and
      replacement policy. This policy requires a sidewalk inspection prior to the
      issuance of any building permit with a value of over $5,000. If the sidewalk
      is found to be deficient, it must be repaired before the permit is issued.
      Although the program has not slowed the pace of home improvements, it
      could represent a potential cost burden for low and moderate income
      homeowners. On the other hand, the alternative approach would be to assess
      all property owners in the City for the cost of sidewalk repair—placing a
      potentially even greater burden on lower income owners.
      A potential constraint identified by the 2011 Housing Element related to
      bonding requirements for new homes. However, changes to these
      requirements since the adoption of the 2011 Element have reduced bonding
      requirements and substantially eliminated that constraint.
                                                                             Page 5-30

CONSTRAINTS       TO    HOUSING            PRODUCTION
      PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING
      PRODUCTION
      One of the greatest constraints to housing development in Piedmont is its
      physical setting; the city is entirely surrounded by Oakland and has no
      potential for annexation. Piedmont has been built out since 1960 and its
      single family residential land use pattern has precluded traditional
      redevelopment. If redevelopment did occur in the city, it would likely result
      in a loss of affordable units rather than a gain, given the dynamics of the
      market and local zoning patterns.
      Virtually every undeveloped property in Piedmont has one or more physical
      constraints, particularly steep slopes. Some of the remaining vacant single
      family lots have slopes in excess of 60 percent. Extensive grading is a
      necessity on such sites and foundations must be engineered and constructed
      in ways that substantially increase costs.
      Piedmont is not affected by flooding, and the city is not crossed by any
      Special Studies Zones (demarking active fault lines). However, the City is
      less than ½ mile from the Hayward Fault and would be subject to severe
      groundshaking in a major quake. As is the case with all other cities in the
      seismically active Bay Area, earthquake hazards may translate into higher
      construction costs.
      Piedmont does not have any hazardous materials sites. None of the
      properties identified in Chapter 4 would require soil clean up or remediation
      prior to development. The City has two gasoline service stations, each with
      underground storage tanks. As noted in Chapter 4, one of these stations has
      been identified as a potential housing site, but underground tank issues have
      been completely remediated on that property.
                                                                            Page 5-32

                            Availability of Financing
                            Housing affordability is affected by interest rates, mortgage lending
                            practices, and the availability of credit. Between 2002 and 2006, the practice
                            of sub-prime lending and adjustable rate mortgages enabled many
                            households to “buy up” into more expensive homes. When housing prices
                            tumbled in 2007 and 2008, a growing number of homeowners found
                            themselves “underwater” —owing more on their homes than they were
                            worth. This occurred throughout the East Bay, including Piedmont.
                            Between 2012 and 2014, home values in Piedmont recovered from the losses
                            experienced between 2007 and 2011 and now exceed their 2006 peak.
                                                                                                     Page 5-33

CONSTRAINTS       TO    HOUSING           PRODUCTION
      Lending terms are more restrictive now than they were in the early 2000s,
      before the global financial crisis and temporary decline in real estate prices.
      Higher down payments are typically required for mortgages and higher
      incomes are required to qualify for loans. Credit history on new loans is
      more rigorously investigated. Based on anecdotal evidence from local
      realtors, some Piedmont homeowners responded to the real estate downturn
      by deferring the sale of their homes between 2007 and 2011. Vacancy rates
      rose during this period, and the percentage of renters in the City increased.
      More recent evidence suggests this period has passed. Between January and
      the end of March, 2014, staff reports that 61 homes were offered for sale in
      the City, a marked increase from previous years. Moreover, the average
      number of days on the market (from listing to sale) has decreased while
      median prices have increased substantially.
      Piedmont remains a difficult market for first-time buyers. A 20 percent
      downpayment on the median priced home in the city equates to over
      $300,000. While this may be doable for an established homeowner who is
      rolling over equity from a prior home, it is challenging for a renter relying on
      personal savings. Local government programs which assist first time
      homebuyers (such as Downpayment Assistance or “Silent” Second
      Mortgages) can be effective for first time buyers in more moderately priced
      markets, but the depth of subsidy that would be required in Piedmont makes
      such programs infeasible.
                                                                             Page 5-34

    Implementing Actions
        Program 1.A: Vacant Land Inventory
         Prepare a regular update of the City’s vacant land inventory, indicating
         the status and availability of each site in Table 4-2 for potential
         development.
    Description:
    A vacant land inventory has been prepared as part of this Housing Element
    update (see Table 4-2). This inventory should be updated regularly, with an
    indication of the ownership, availability for sale, and status of any pending
    construction projects. Information about potential new parcels should be
    added, in the event that lot standards or subdivision regulations change.

        Program 1.B: Redevelopment of the former PG&E Site
         Support the redevelopment of the former PG&E site on Linda Avenue
         with housing developed at the maximum density permitted by zoning.
    Description:
    This 15,375 square feet site was entitled for seven townhomes in September
    2011 and received a building permit at the end of 2013. The seven units
    equate to a density of 20 units per acre, which is the maximum permitted by
    zoning. It is anticipated that the development will serve above moderate
    income households.

        Program 1.C: Market Rate Second Units
         Maintain zoning regulations that support the development of market rate
         second units in Piedmont neighborhoods.
    Description:
    This Housing Element includes program recommendations for two types of
    second units. The first recommendation, listed here, relates to market rate
    second units. These units have no limit on the rent that may be charged and
    no restrictions on the income of the occupants. The second set of
    recommendations, listed under Goal 3, addresses rent-restricted second units.
    These units are subject to deed restrictions which limit the rent that may be
    charged and the income of the occupants. The rent-restricted units may only
    be occupied by qualifying low, very low, or extremely low income
    households.
    Since 2005, the City of Piedmont has allowed market-rate second units by
    right in all residential zones provided they meet certain criteria. Such units
    are permitted through “ministerial review,” meaning they require no review
    by the Planning Commissioners or neighbors. As noted in Chapter 5, the
    criteria are:
        The unit must be less than 700 square feet
        Structures on the property must comply with zoning standards for floor
         area ratio, height, lot coverage, and setbacks
        An off-street, covered, non-tandem parking space must be provided
         outside of the required front setback
        The owner must live on the property
    Prior to 2005, a conditional use permit (CUP) was required for second units.
    The removal of this requirement has increased the volume of applications
    and created important new housing opportunities. The City will continue to
    actively promote second unit construction in the coming years. To the extent
    the City budget will allow, this will include keeping second unit application
    fees at their current levels as a way to encourage second unit production.

                                             Description
                                             Although the City maintains a list of all licensed second units, it does not
                                             regularly survey these properties to determine if they are being rented.
                                             Rental data is summarized on an annual basis based on business license
                                             taxes. Based on this data, it appears that some units are only rented on an
                                             intermittent basis, some are not rented at all, and some are rented without
                                             reporting the income to the City. In addition, some units are being occupied
                                             “rent free” by family members, house guests, and domestic employees.
                                             Better documentation of second unit rents and occupancies would serve the
                                             following purposes:
                                              A better understanding of market rents and the degree to which second
Piedmont’s commercial zone includes
                                                 units are meeting the needs of different income groups in the City
a handful of retail and office buildings
with the potential for second story           Greater equity in tax collection (e.g., to make sure that all unit owners
residential units.                               are paying the required business tax)
                                              Assurance that rent-restricted units are charging rents that meet HUD
                                                 guidelines for the income groups served, as defined by the deed
                                                 restriction
                                              An understanding of the extent to which second units are providing
                                                 housing for different populations, such as elderly relatives, adult
                                                 children, low income and very low income wage earners, and domestic
                                                 employees
                                              Identification of unlawful use of second units and the need for code
                                                 enforcement activities (for example, the use of a rent-restricted second
                                                 unit as a home office or vacation rental)
                                             This program would produce a bi-annual report with data on median rents,
                                             number of units occupied (and vacant), characteristics of the households
                                             being served, and relevant conclusions about how registered second units are
                                             being used. It would not report data by address, but would focus instead on
                                             summary information. If feasible, the report could be supplemented with data
                                             provided from a survey of second unit owners.

G O A L S, P O L I C I E S, A N D     ACTIONS
        Program 1.E: Allowances for Housing in the Commercial Zone
         Work with the owners of properties in Zone “D” to facilitate proposals
         for mixed use development, including new mixed use projects on
         underutilized commercial sites and the addition of residential units to
         existing commercial structures.
    Description:
    The Piedmont Zoning Ordinance was amended in December 2013 (effective
    1/1/14) to allow multi-family housing in the Commercial zone when
    incorporated as a component of a mixed use project. Densities may be up to
    one unit per 2,000 square feet of lot area, or 21.78 units per acre. This
    amendment created an opportunity for second story residential additions
    above stores or offices on Grand Avenue and longer-term opportunities for
    mixed use projects in the event the City’s two service stations or two retail
    businesses (Mulberry Market and Ace Hardware) are ever redeveloped. It
    also creates an opportunity to convert the six single family homes in Zone D
    to mixed use structures, potentially including new rental housing units.
    The parking requirements for multi-family housing in Zone D are the same
    as those applying elsewhere in the city, with one space required for small
    units (less than 700 SF) and two spaces required for larger units. The City
    would consider requests for parking variances on a case by case basis,
    depending on the conditions at each site, the availability of on-street parking,
    and opportunities for “shared parking” agreements with adjacent commercial
    uses. As with second units, opportunities for parking exceptions could be
    considered for units with rent restrictions. As required by state law, density
    bonuses would be allowed for projects incorporating affordable units.
    The City has set a target of producing at least six multi-family or mixed use
    units by the close of the planning period (January 31, 2023).

       Program 1F: Facilitating Multi-Family Development
        Continue to develop and implement incentives to facilitate multi-family
        development on land zoned for multi-family or commercial uses in
        Piedmont. The City will also implement recent CEQA exemptions for
        infill projects so that environmental review costs are reduced for multi-
        family development.
    Description:
    The City of Piedmont will continue to explore ways to encourage or
    incentivize multi-family development in Zoning Districts C and D. The City
    already provides rapid processing of development applications and has
    modified the development standards (i.e., reducing parking requirements for
    units less than 700 square feet and allowing greater hardscape coverage) in
    Zone C to facilitate affordable housing development. Provisions for fee
    reductions for multi-family projects that incorporate affordable units should
    continue to be explicitly provided in the Zoning Regulations.
    As noted in Program 2.E, the City intends to update the Residential Design
    Guidelines following adoption of the Housing Element. The update will
    include new guidelines for multi-family and mixed use development. As part
    of preparing these guidelines, the City will consult with local architects on
    the need for revisions to the zoning standards. Reductions to front yard
    setbacks and increases in lot coverage allowances will be considered.
    As noted in Program 1.E, the City has set a target of producing six multi-
    family or mixed use units by the close of the planning period.

                                             program in the past and will continue to participate in the future.
                                             During the 2014 Housing Element update, it was observed that many
                                             Piedmont households are unaware of this program. If the City is successful
                                             in obtaining funds, a public information campaign should be initiated to
                                             solicit applications for grants/loans by Piedmont households, with an
                                             emphasis on extremely low income households. This should include feature

                                             measures to facilitate housing production, such as reduced permitting and
                                             environmental review costs. The City will also seek input from developers to

        Explore other incentives to protect small homes, including design awards
        for exemplary small home improvement projects.
    Description:
    The City’s existing supply of small homes is currently protected by:
       Floor area ratio and lot coverage requirements which limit the square
        footage and coverage of structures.
       Requirements to provide conforming off-street parking in the event that
        bedrooms are added (creating a disincentive to the expansion of two and
        three bedroom homes with one-car garages).
       Design Review Guidelines which strive to maintain the scale and mass of
        existing homes.
    All of these provisions should be retained. In addition, the City should
    continue to study measures that other cities are taking to retain smaller
    homes, and determine if any of these measures might be transferable to
    Piedmont. One concept to be explored is to include a category in the City’s
    annual design awards program in which outstanding remodeling projects for
    small homes and second units are specifically acknowledged.

       Program 2.C: Use of Original Materials and Construction Methods
        Maintain Planning and Building standards which allow the use of
        original materials and construction methods in home remodeling.
    Description:
    The City’s Design Review, Plan Checking, and Building Inspection
    processes currently allow the use of original materials and methods of
    construction when remodeling projects are proposed. These provisions can
    mean significant cost-savings for property owners, who might otherwise
    need to use more expensive materials. They also help support the City’s
    Climate Action Plan objectives, including increased use of recycled building
    materials and fixtures. Additional measures could include the application of
    the State Historic Building Code to structures that qualify as “historic.” This
    Code allows the relaxation of certain UBC standards (such as staircase
    width) in order to preserve historic buildings.

        Program 2.D: Condominium Conversions
         Maintain the existing requirement that the removal of any multi-family
         rental apartment must be matched by the creation of a new rental
         apartment elsewhere in the city.
    Description:
    The City’s Subdivision Code includes a “no net loss” provision for apartment
    conversions. Section 19.63 (C) of the code states that any apartments
    converted to condominiums must be replaced in kind by an equivalent
    number of equivalently priced rental units. If the units currently rent for very
    low, low, or moderate income rents, the replacement units must remain rent-
    restricted for at least 55 years. This requirement reduces the likelihood of
    condo conversions in the city and protects the multi-family rental housing
    supply.

        Program 2.E: Update of Design Guidelines
         Update the 1988 City of Piedmont Residential Design Guidelines,
         consistent with Action 28.E of the Piedmont General Plan. The update
         process should include public input, which should be facilitated by one
         or more Planning Commission study sessions.
    Description:
    Piedmont’s Residential Design Guidelines have not been comprehensively
    updated in 26 years. The document should be given a more contemporary
    look and should be reformatted to reflect current graphic design standards.
    The content also should be assessed, and changes should be made to make
    the Guidelines more relevant and descriptive where necessary. In addition to
    the drawings in the Guidelines, photos should be incorporated to illustrate
    desired outcomes and provide greater certainty to applicants. Consistent with
    the General Plan, a specific section of the Guidelines should address
    development of small (less than 5,000 square foot) lots.
    Also as noted in the General Plan, the scope of the City’s Design Guidelines
    should be expanded to address mixed use and multi-family residential
    development. This could expedite the processing of such development if
    future proposals are received, and would ensure that multi-family
    development is not evaluated using standards intended for single family
    homes.
                                                                          Page 6-11

G O A L S, P O L I C I E S, A N D      ACTIONS
    The process of updating the Design Guidelines should be transparent and
    inclusive. Piedmont residents should be encouraged to participate and share
    their thoughts about how requirements and procedures can be improved.
    One or more study sessions of the Planning Commission should be convened
    as the Guidelines are being updated. Among the specific proposals that
    could be considered by the Commission would be:
        Additional categories of exemptions from design review, especially for
         small rear yard projects that are not visible to neighbors or from the
         street.
        Changes to the notification requirements, and the extent to which
         comments from neighbors may change a project’s design and materials.
        Clearer rules for decision making.
        Potential modifications to the fee schedule, to further discount certain
         types of projects or raise the fees for other types of projects.
        Potential changes to the mixed use standards in Chapter 17.

    Policy 3.8: Regional Dialogue
    Work with housing advocates, non-profits, community groups, nearby cities,
    the real estate industry, and appropriate regional agencies to address
    affordable housing issues in the San Francisco Bay Area. Although
    Piedmont is fully developed, meeting regional housing needs is an issue of
    crucial importance to its residents and to the future quality of life in the city.
    Implementing Actions
       Program 3.A: Second Unit Ordinance Assessment and Revisions
        Within three years of Housing Element adoption, complete an
        assessment of Piedmont’s Second Unit regulations, with a focus on the
        incentives that are being used to promote rent-restricted units and the
        steps that can be taken to increase second unit production and
        occupancy rates.
        Description:
        In 2004, the City of Piedmont undertook a year-long process to revise its
        Second Unit Ordinance. The process was guided by a Citizens Advisory
        Committee (CAC) and focused on ways to more effectively use second
        units to meet the City’s affordable housing needs. In March 2005, the
        Municipal Code was revised to incorporate the CAC recommendations.
        As noted earlier in this Housing Element, the new Code created a new
        incentive-driven category of “rent-restricted” second units which may
        only be occupied by low or very low income households.
        As recommended by the 2011 Housing Element, an assessment of the
        second unit regulations was completed in 2011-2012. This led to
        additional changes to the second unit regulations, as documented in
        Chapters 2 and 5 of this Housing Element. Periodic assessments of the
        regulations are recommended to ensure that they are achieving their
        desired purpose and producing the number of units needed to meet the
        RHNA, and to identify corrective measures in the event the targets are
        not being met.
        Future changes could include:
            Elimination of the variance requirement for the primary dwelling
             unit when a rent-restricted unit is provided without parking and
             conforming parking for the primary unit also does not exist. The
             current regulations allow the rent-restricted second unit to be
             approved with a parking exception (a simpler process than a
             variance), but still require a parking variance for the primary unit.
             Section 17.40.6(e) of the Municipal Code should be amended to
             eliminate the variance requirement for the primary unit in such
             instances.
                                                                            Page 6-14

G O A L S, P O L I C I E S, A N D      ACTIONS
           Additional tools to incentivize the use of existing legal second units
            as rentals, including graduated business tax rates. For example, a
            three tiered rate structure could be considered which includes higher
            tax rates when entire single family homes are rented out, more
            moderate rates for second units, and very low rates (or waivers) for
            rent-restricted second units.
           Additional tools to encourage the conversion of “unintended” second
            units to active rental units. “Unintended” units are not considered
            legal second units, but have the physical characteristics to be easily
            converted. These spaces are particularly well suited for rent-
            restricted units because the capital cost to create them is minimal.
            One possible incentive would be reductions of planning and building
            fees if the units are rent-restricted.
           Additional steps to “match” rent-restricted second units with local
            employees, particularly low and very low income City and School
            District employees.
           A zoning provision that would allow a second unit within an existing
            residence to be moved to a different location within the residence
            without obtaining a new second unit permit. This could be an
            incentive to retain existing second units in properties that are being
            remodeled.
           The addition of a standard section in every staff report for a second
            unit permit indicating the City’s progress toward meeting its
            Regional Housing Needs Allocation. By incorporating such data in
            the staff report, the Planning Commission and general public would
            be regularly reminded that the City has adopted quantified targets
            and is continually working to achieve those targets through the
            approval of rent-restricted and market rate second units.
           Lengthening Administrative Extensions. Administrative extensions
            of Planning Commission approvals of rent-restricted second units are
            currently available if the applicant does not pull a building permit in
            the first year. The current allowance is for a six month extension,
            subject to a fee equal to half the initial fee paid by the applicant. The
            City should extend the administrative extension for rent-restricted
            units to one year, and should consider allowing the initial approval to
            remain valid for 18 months rather than 12 months. Fee waivers for
            administrative extensions for rent-restricted units also should be
            considered.
           Additional incentives for new homes to include second units,
            including a waiver of second unit fees and reduced building permit
            fees for new homes that agree to include a rent-restricted unit.
                                                                            Page 6-15

                                              their construction, and the various incentives offered by the City to
                                              create rent-restricted units. The campaign should add a “human
                                              interest” dimension by focusing on the stories of actual second unit
                                              owners and tenants in Piedmont.
                                          Description:
                                          This program would use a variety of media to inform the community about
                                          Piedmont’s second unit program. This would include a dedicated page on
                                          the City’s website informing residents of what second units are and why they
                                          are an essential part of the City’s housing stock. The website could describe
                                          the different types of second units in the City, the regulations that govern
                                          them, and the application process.1 Additionally, the City would continue to
                                          use FAQs, brochures, and other print media to explain the steps for applying
                                          for a second unit, with special attention given to the homeowner benefits of
                                          applying for a rent-restricted unit. The City’s local access cable station
                                          (KCOM) should also be used to convey this information.
                                          Further positive news coverage about second units could be generated
                                          through press releases and articles in the Piedmonter and Piedmont Post.
                                          This should include human interest stories about second unit owners and
                                          tenants in the City. Second unit occupants should be contacted by the City
                                          and invited to tell their stories to local reporters in a way that illustrates the
                                          “real world” benefits of having second units in the community. In addition,
                                          the City should establish a category in its annual design awards for
                                          outstanding second units. The City should also seek input from applicants
                                          who considered adding a second unit, but ultimately decided not to—and
                                          applicants who received approval for a unit but then opted not to rent it.
                                          Their perspectives would be informative and could lead to changes in the
                                          program which would encourage more households to participate.
                                          An important part of the City’s outreach strategy should be to target owners
                                          of “unintended” second units, including single family homes that have been
                                          reported by Alameda County as having two on-site units despite City records

       Program 3C: Monitoring Affordable Second Unit Opportunities
        Monitor the supply of unintended second units, illegal or suspected
        second units, and vacant second units. A confidential data base listing
        the addresses of such units shall be maintained for administrative
        purposes. Recognize the potential for such properties to help meet the
        City’s affordable housing needs, and take proactive steps to realize this
        potential in the coming years.
    Description:
    As noted in Table 2.1 of the Housing Element, the City maintains an address
    data base of second units, noting the year they were created, the way they
    were permitted, and comments on their current status. The data base
    provides a mechanism for monitoring second unit development opportunities,
    and the supply and status of legal and illegal second units. As noted in
    Program 1.D, the City is currently monitoring data on second unit rents,
    providing an additional source of information on this component of the
    housing supply.
    Program 3.A describes the City’s intent to pursue additional development
    opportunities in “unintended” second units. These are spaces that are not
    used for habitation as separate living quarters, but have the potential for
    conversion to second units based on their physical characteristics. Examples
    include pool houses with indoor cooking facilities; basements with kitchens,
    bathrooms, and separate entrances; and finished rooms over garages. There
    were 134 unintended second units counted in the city in 2014. As noted in
    Program 3.B, the City intends to remind owners of these units of the
    opportunity to apply for legal second unit status. The City has set a target of
    converting at least five unintended second units into registered second units
    during the planning period. These units are included in the totals shown in
    Table 7-1 and could include both market rate and rent-restricted units.
    The address data base of “suspected” second units is an important resource.
    The potentially illegal status of such units provides leverage to convert them
    into rent-restricted units. The City will work with the owners of such units in
    to convert them into legal apartments, on the condition that they either
    provide conforming parking or be rent-restricted to a low or very low income
    household. The latter option provides a “win-win” for all parties, since it
    provides the owner with a legal second unit and legitimate source of rental
    income, the City with an affordable unit, and a low income tenant with a
    secure place to live.
                                                                          Page 6-17

G O A L S, P O L I C I E S, A N D      ACTIONS
    As noted in Program 1.D, the City also collects annual business license taxes
    (generally around $200 annually) from second unit rentals. The owners of
    many legal units are not paying these taxes, suggesting that the units are
    vacant or are being used for guest quarters, family members, home offices,
    etc. These legal units are a housing resource for the City, and steps should be
    taken to incentivize their use as rental apartments. Even though they are not
    rent-restricted, such units are affordable to most moderate income and some
    low income households.
    Finally, it is acknowledged that the City’s data base of “unintended units”
    represents only a portion of the potential for second units in the city. There
    are many other homes in Piedmont that contain physical features conducive
    to second unit creation. This includes homes on down sloping lots with built
    out lower levels. The City will make an ongoing effort to expand its data
    base of such spaces in the future as planning and building permit applications
    are received and as plans are reviewed. Part of the plan checking process
    should include an evaluation of whether the property contains an unintended
    second unit (i.e., does it have two kitchens? is there habitable space over the
    garage or in the basement or attic?) Properties should be added to the
    unintended unit data base over time, so that when the City does periodic
    mailings on second unit opportunities, these addresses are included.

        Program 3D: Monitoring Additional Second Unit Development
         Opportunities
         Monitor potential opportunities for second units within new homes and
         on existing homes located on larger lots that are conducive to second
         unit creation.
    Description:
    While Program 3.C addresses opportunities for second units through the
    conversion of existing floor space, Program 3.D focuses on lots which
    are conducive to second unit creation due to their large size, location, or
    ability to accommodate additions or new structures. This includes vacant
    lots, lots in the Estate Zone, and lots in Zone A that are larger than
    20,000 square feet. These lots are more likely to have space for a new
    second unit, as well as room to meet the off-street parking requirements
    for market-rate units. As development applications for new homes or
    major home additions are received on these properties, the City will
    advise applicants of the opportunity to add a second unit. The City has
    set a target of accommodating 5 second units in new homes or homes
    that are expanded with major additions during the planning period.
    These would generally be market-rate (rather than rent-restricted) second
    units.
                                                                           Page 6-18

    Program 3E: Incentives for Renewal of Expiring Rent Restrictions
    Develop incentives for the owners of rent-restricted second units to renew the
    affordability restrictions for their units upon expiration of the 10-year deed
    restriction.
    Description:
    Because the affordability terms on rent-restricted second units expire after 10
    years, the City could potentially lose units even as it is adding units to the
    rent-restricted inventory through new applications. The first rent-restricted
    unit will reach the end of its affordability term in 2018. By the end of 2017,
    the City will develop a strategy for conserving these units and reducing
    potential impacts on tenants who may be affected by sudden rent increases.
    Opportunities for long-term tax abatements should be explored, if the City
    can identify a grant funding source or other non-local funding source to
    cover the loss in property tax revenue. Such abatements could also provide
    an incentive to keep the units occupied, since they would be contingent on
    proof of occupancy by a low income tenant. Local funding sources also
    could be considered, depending on fiscal impacts. One possible funding
    source could be an increase in the rental tax on single family homes.

    would encourage creation of second units in the City. There may be
    instances where exceptions to the Code could be considered (for instance,
    lower ceiling heights) to make it easier for property owners to convert
    unintended units into rental properties. The current second unit regulations
    provide such flexibility as an incentive to create rent-restricted units.

    departments and services. The City should continue efforts to use a “sliding
    scale” for planning and building fees based on project value to reduce the
    cost burden on applicants for minor home improvements. Fees should also
    be structured to provide incentives for rent-restricted second units and other
    projects which provide opportunities for lower income households.

       Program 4.E: Temporary Staff Additions
        Add contract staff as needed to ensure prompt processing of all
        applications.
    Description:
    As a small city, Piedmont is susceptible to fluctuations in the volume of
    planning and building applications. With only one building inspector, one
    plan checker, and a small planning staff, processing all applications at the
    same speed throughout the year can be a challenge. Vacation schedules, staff
    absences, and staff turnover add to this challenge. Because the City is

    Description:
    The CIP update provides assurance that City-maintained facilities such as
    streets, sidewalks, and storm drains are kept in excellent condition, thereby
    avoiding deferred maintenance expenses for Piedmont residents. The City
    has created a CIP Committee to provide citizen input in this process. At least
    once a year, the CIP Committee should be briefed on the Piedmont General
    Plan and the requirement that CIP decisions be consistent with Plan policies
    and priorities. Funding for the maintenance and replacement of City facilities
    also occurs through the Facilities Maintenance Fund. The Fund was
    established per City Council directive in FY 2007-08. It identifies annual
    maintenance needs for all buildings owned by the City as well as parks and
    recreational facilities.

G O A L S, P O L I C I E S, A N D     ACTIONS
       Program 4.G: Monitoring the Effects of the City Charter
        Piedmont’s rent-restricted second unit program has been successful in
        accommodating and achieving the City’s share of the regional housing
        need, including producing housing for very low income households.
        However, the Charter requires a citywide vote for zoning map changes,
        which constrains the development of a variety of housing types,
        particularly high-density multi-family housing. To address this
        constraint, the City has allowed multi-family density housing in the
        commercial zone and created new incentives for multi-family uses. This
        Program supplements these two programs by monitoring and annually
        evaluating and reporting on the effects of the City Charter on: (a) the
        cost and supply of housing, particularly multifamily housing and (b) the
        effectiveness of City strategies to mitigate related impacts. Based on the
        outcome of the evaluation, the City will adopt strategies to address and
        mitigate identified constraints.
    Description:
    City Planning and Building Staff will continue to track annual housing
    production and permit activity as they have in the past, and will prepare
    annual reports to the Council evaluating housing and building permitting
    trends and the effects of the Charter as described above. These reports will
    specifically evaluate the Charter for impacts on multi-family housing
    production and costs based on various criteria such as:
       the failure of a citywide ballot measure associated with a proposed
        Zoning Map change to multi-family housing.
       a multi-family development proposal which has been endorsed or
        approved by the Planning Commission or City Council but does not
        proceed because a citywide ballot measure to change the zoning would
        be required.
       conclusions of research done by a third party finding that the City
        Charter constrains the ability to do multi-family housing.
       lack of multi-family development proposals.
       input from the development community, including non-profits, property
        owners, stakeholders and advocates on behalf of lower income
        households such as the Non-Profit Housing Association of Northern
        California (NPH), EBHO and the League of Women Voters.

G O A L S, P O L I C I E S, A N D    ACTIONS
    Based on the outcomes of the evaluation, the City will implement program
    and zoning changes within 12 months including, if necessary, a Charter
    amendment or other appropriate remedies not requiring voter approval.
    These remedies could include streamlining multifamily permit procedures
    and identifying and designating, additional sites for multifamily development
    within 12 months.

    Description:
    The California Legislature has established that cities must allow the
    development of employee housing commensurate with local needs. State
    Health and Safety Code (Section 17021.5) requires that cities treat employee
    housing for six or fewer employees as single family residential uses.
    Employee housing may not be defined as “a boarding house, rooming house,
    hotel, (or) dormitory.” This action would amend Piedmont’s Municipal
    Code to ensure compliance with this statute.

    Implementing Actions
       Program 5.A: Shared Housing Publicity and Media Initiative
        Increase awareness of Piedmont’s newly modified shared housing
        regulations, and encourage single seniors and other small households in
        the City to participate in the program.
    Description:
    In 2012, the City adopted Municipal Code amendments that clarified the
    rules for renting rooms in Piedmont homes. There had previously been a
    lack of clarity between the rules for “rooming or boarding houses,” which
    were prohibited, and “rented rooms,” which were neither expressly allowed
    nor prohibited by Code. The new rules allow a householder to rent out
    multiple rooms, as long as they are covered by a single lease. Thus, a senior
    homeowner (or any homeowner) may rent part of their house to a low
    income family, a single parent with child, or another household comprised of
    multiple persons (as well as to a single person).
    Renting of rooms is subject to a business license tax. As of 2012, only nine
    Piedmont homeowners were reporting rental income from rented rooms,
    suggesting the practice is limited and potentially not widely known. A public
    information campaign, including web-based information and news articles, is
    recommended to encourage additional room rentals during the planning
    period. The target audience for such a campaign would be persons living
    alone in large single family homes—as of 2010, 16% of the City’s
    households consisted of one person only. Roughly 315 households in the
    City consist of seniors living alone. Home sharing can enable a live-in
    caregiver, or simply provide for added security and assistance for a senior
    householder. It also provides potential affordable housing opportunities for
    very low and extremely income households.

G O A L S, P O L I C I E S, A N D      ACTIONS
        Program 5.B: Shared Housing Matching Services
         Consider participating in ECHO Housing’s shared housing program as
         a way to improve housing opportunities for lower income seniors and
         extremely low income households.
    Description:
    Some of Piedmont’s “empty nesters” or other residents who have surplus
    space in their homes may wish to rent that space in return for income or care,
    but may be reluctant to rent to strangers. The non-profit Eden Council for
    Hope and Opportunity (ECHO Housing), which serves residents throughout
    Alameda County, operates a shared housing program which could potentially
    benefit these residents. The program matches persons needing housing with
    homeowners who have available space.
    Shared housing programs can also provide a resource for extremely low
    income households, including families as well as seniors. The ECHO
    program includes counseling on shared living, supportive services, and in-
    formational and referral, as well as educational workshops on home sharing.
    Any shared housing program in Piedmont should be designed to include
    extremely low income families, as well as empty nesters and other seniors.
    The City has set a target of achieving shared housing arrangements for at
    least 10 persons during the planning period. In the event the City determines
    that participating in the ECHO Housing program is feasible, this target will
    be communicated to them.

         as their physical capabilities change.
    Description:
    Section 17.20.5(a)(vii) of the Piedmont Code creates exemptions for
    temporary home improvements such as wheelchair ramps. Other exemptions
    could be explored in the future. For example, the City could permit the
    addition of a first floor bathroom or bedroom without conforming parking—
    or the addition of a temporary second unit for a nurse or live-in aide. The
    construction might be permitted with the condition it be removed (or
    approved with a variance or CUP) when the occupancy of the home changes.

        Provide assistance to nonprofit entities interested in developing housing
        for low and moderate income Piedmont residents, including the elderly
        and others with special needs.
    Description:
    There are several nonprofit entities in the East Bay who are actively engaged
    in developing housing for low and moderate income households. These
    builders make an important contribution to the region’s housing market and
    have been the largest producers of affordable housing units in the area during
    the past decade. Although there are very few vacant or redevelopable sites in
    Piedmont, the City is committed to working collaboratively with the
    nonprofit sector in the event a viable development proposal is made. The
    City could also be a potential partner in the event such housing is proposed in
    a nearby community.
    Program 5.D will be implemented on an on-going basis. As development
    opportunities arise, the City will provide technical assistance to nonprofits in
    the completion and/or co-sponsoring of applications for state and federal
    housing funds and other grants. The City will also work with nonprofit
    applicants to identify and proactively address issues of concern in the
    community, such as traffic, parking, and design compatibility. Finally, the
    City will consider regulatory concessions, incentives, and other methods
    which reduce project costs and make the project more viable.

    Center for Independent Living) to provide an explanation of the process to
    retrofit a home to meet the needs of persons with disabilities, including dev-
    elopmental disabilities. Links to the websites of key service providers and
    advocacy organizations should be provided on the City’s website. Printed
    information (such as brochures or FAQ handouts) produced by these organi-
    zations should be available at City Hall. This information should identify the
    range of features that might be incorporated in a barrier-free home, and the
    steps an applicant would need to take to add these features to a residence.

    Description:
    Despite the absence of a visible homeless population in Piedmont, the City is
    located in an urban area where homelessness is a serious issue. Piedmont
    currently provides financial assistance to Alameda County to fund
    countywide programs which meet the needs of homeless persons and persons
    at risk of becoming homeless. The beneficiaries of these programs may
    include Piedmont residents as well as those in other cities. On an ongoing
    basis, the City will stay apprised of homelessness issues, work with homeless
    service providers, and offer referrals for any Piedmont resident faced with
    the risk of homelessness.

         Countywide planning effort to increase housing opportunities for
         extremely low income and disabled persons and strengthen the services
         the County provides to the homeless.
    Description:
    In October 2009 the City of Piedmont joined 13 other cities in committing to
    work with Alameda County to alleviate homelessness. The Countywide Plan
    has been prepared in response to federal requirements that mandate the
    development of subregional plans to end homelessness. It recognizes the
    regional nature of the problem and the need for regional solutions. The Plan
    was designed to end chronic homelessness and provide more secure and
    permanent housing for low-income people with mental illness, HIV/AIDS,
    and other disabilities or high risk of homelessness. It includes a 10-year
    action plan, within a broader 15-year implementation plan.
    Participating in EveryOne Home is an important part of Piedmont’s efforts to
    meet the housing needs of extremely low income households, as required by
    state law. Endorsement of the Plan by the City establishes general agreement
    with its strategies and provides a guide to address homelessness in a way that
    is consistent with other communities in Alameda County. It also represents a
    funding commitment by the City to countywide homeless services.

    Description:
    Piedmont’s churches and synagogue are potential partners in efforts to
    address the housing needs of extremely low income residents in Piedmont
    and nearby cities. Additional efforts should be made to coordinate local
    housing programs with the faith community. The City should continue to
    work with its congregations to promote charitable contributions and develop
    proactive solutions to avoid homelessness and help those at risk of becoming
    homeless. This includes not only housing-related programs, but those which
    help extremely low income persons with other needs, such as food, medical
    assistance, and access to supportive services.

         this inventory and encourage the development of additional extremely
         low income second units through the City’s affordable second unit
         program and other means.
    Description:
    The City of Piedmont has identified the need to assist eight extremely low
    income households during the 2015-2023Housing Element period, based on
    its Regional Housing Needs Allocation. Pursuant to Assembly Bill 2634,
    local governments are required to assist in the development of a variety of
    housing types to meet the needs of these households. In larger communities,
    this is usually done by accommodating single room occupancy hotels
    (SROs), providing multi-family developments with units set aside for
    extremely low income households, and facilitating supportive and
    transitional housing. In smaller communities, provisions for shelters and
    supportive and transitional housing are required by state law, but additional
    steps must still be taken to meet the diverse housing needs of extremely low
    income residents.
                                                                         Page 6-31

                                         Based on data from the 2010 Census, 81 percent of Piedmont’s
                                         households with incomes of $35,000 or less are headed by seniors
                                         (78 of 96 households). Programs 2.A, 5.A, and 5.B focus on these
                                         residents. As these programs are administered, the City will place a

                                         For extremely low income residents in Piedmont who are not seniors,

                                         housing needs. Data collected by the City of Piedmont indicates
                                         there were several second units in the city in 2014 with monthly
                                         rents of less than $483.2 Such units meet affordability criteria for
                                         extremely low income households and demonstrate that the City is
                                         already meeting a portion of its extremely low income housing needs
                                         with no public subsidy. Anecdotally, an unknown number of the
                                         city’s second units appear to be occupied by extremely low income
                                         households who live rent-free in second units in exchange for
                                         assistance with home repair and other household chores. Such units
                                         are an important resource for extremely low income households and
                                         should be sustained.
                                         In the future, the City will explore options to increase the inventory
                                         of extremely low income housing. This is already being done
                                         through allowances for such units to be created without off-street
                                         parking if they are 300 square feet or less. It could also be done
                                         through a waiver of the business license tax, fee reductions or other
                                         incentives so that some of the very low income units produced
                                         through the affordable second unit program are suitable for
                                         extremely low income households, including seniors and persons
                                         with disabilities. Other programs in this Housing Element, including
                                         the monitoring of second unit rents (see Program 1.D), will enable
                                         the City to gauge the extent to which second units are already
                                         serving extremely low income households.

2 $483 would be the affordable monthly rent for a one-person extremely low income household in 2014, based on HUD Income
data for Alameda County, e.g. 30 % of $19,350 annual income / 12 months = $483.

G O A L S, P O L I C I E S, A N D       ACTIONS
        Program 5.J: Housing for Extremely Low Income Families
         Develop incentives to meet the needs of Piedmont’s extremely low
         income households potentially including modified development standards
         for new multi-family buildings that include units for extremely low
         income families.
    Description:
    Piedmont presently allows second units to be as large as 1,000 square feet if
    the units are rent restricted to very low income households, including
    extremely low income households. The allowance for larger units if the unit
    is rented to a very low income household provides a strong incentive that
    benefits extremely low income families. A unit of this size would typically
    be associated with a two-bedroom apartment or carriage house, which could
    accommodate a three or four person extremely low income family. The City
    will pursue additional incentives to encourage the inclusion of units that are
    affordable to extremely low income households in new multi-family
    development. These incentives could include allowances for higher lot
    coverage and floor area ratios in Zone C for buildings that dedicate one or
    more units for extremely low income families.

         housing needs of developmentally disabled Piedmont residents and
         ensure that sufficient resources exist within and around the community to
         meet these needs.
    Description:
    Developmentally disabled residents include those with cerebral palsy,
    autism, epilepsy, and other conditions that typically appear before an
    individual reaches 18. Supportive housing is often required for such
    individuals to lead independent lives upon adulthood. As required by state
    law, the City will continue to work with social service providers to explore
    opportunities for such housing within Piedmont. The City will also maintain
    communication with the Regional Center of the East Bay to identify service
    needs within the City and to identify available resources for local residents.

                                  decision-making process. Specifically, the City should strive to create
                                  additional local housing opportunities for persons employed within Piedmont
                                  in order to reduce commuting and associated greenhouse gas emissions. A
                                  particular emphasis should be placed on housing for municipal and school
                                  district employees, since these are the largest employers in the city.

         Participate in Energy Upgrade California or equivalent programs which
         assist homeowners with renewable energy and energy efficiency
         improvements on their property.
    Description:
    In 2009, the City of Piedmont developed a Climate Action Plan (CAP) to
    help achieve local greenhouse gas reduction goals. Because it is a city of
    older single family homes, Piedmont must find ways to improve the energy
    efficiency of its existing housing stock in order to meet these goals. In
    December 2009, the City voted to join the California Statewide Communities
    Development Authority (CSCDA) and the California FIRST Program.
    More recently, the City has been participating in Energy Upgrade California,
    a statewide program that provides financial assistance for homeowners for
    select energy-saving home improvements. The program includes energy
    assessments and physical improvements that reduce energy loss and improve
    energy efficiency. It encompasses rebates and incentives, income-qualified
    assistance for energy bills, and financing assistance to households seeking to
    install renewable energy systems and similar improvements.
    Piedmont will continue to participate in such programs in the future,
    reducing the burden of utility costs on homeowners and renters, while
    advancing its climate action and sustainability objectives.

    These programs include:
     Energy audits, which may be provided by PG&E or private vendors
     Rebates (sponsored by non-City entities) for the use of energy efficient
        appliances, and for the recycling of less efficient appliances.
     The federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance program (LIHEAP),
        which offers qualifying low income households financial assistance to
        offset energy costs (through weatherization or assistance in paying
        energy bills)
     “REACH” (Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help),
        which is a PG&E program administered by the Salvation Army that
        provides energy assistance to low-income customers in the form of one-
        time payments for energy costs.
     CARE (California Alternate Rates for Energy) and FERA (Family
        Electric Rate Assistance), both programs which provide rate discounts
        for lower income households
     A Medical Baseline Allowance for persons with high medically related
        electric bills.
    Information on these programs should be kept at the Planning and Building

                                            The Implementation Program also identifies the proposed timing of each

                                            2015 and runs through 2023. Most of the actions should be implemented
                                            within the next three years or should be implemented on an ongoing and
                                            continual basis. Table 7-1 provides a summary of the numeric objectives to
                                            be pursued during this time period.
