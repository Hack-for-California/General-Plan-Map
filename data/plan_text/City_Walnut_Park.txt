1. Introduction
1.1      Community Context
The City of Walnut encompasses approximately 8.9 square miles and is
surrounded by the cities of West Covina to the west and north, Pomona
to the east, and Industry to the south. In addition, two County islands
are adjacent to the City's northern and southeastern boundaries.
Incorporated in 1959, Walnut has developed as a low-density, semi-rural
residential community, reflecting the presence of severe environmental
constraints. The City contains large hillside areas with slopes well in
excess of 25 percent, which are susceptible to unstable soils and geologic
conditions. Landslides have occurred in some of these steeper hillside
areas. Earthquakes also pose a danger to Walnut. The San Jose Fault
traverses the northern portion of the City and groundshaking, liquefac-
tion, and lurching are all possible hazards. In addition, two landfills are
located adjacent to the City's borders. Setback requirements have been
established along the City's western border due to hazardous materials
contained in the BKK Landfill. The Spadra landfill located on the eastern
border of the City is now closed. Walnut's character as a low-density
community has evolved in recognition of these limitations to develop-
ment.
During the 1980s, the City experienced an unprecedented population
growth of over 130 percent, increasing from 12,000 to over 29,000 resi-
dents. Even in light of these growth pressures, Walnut has maintained
its low density character, reflective both of residents' desires to maintain
the area's rural ambience and the presence of topographical and envi-
ronmental constraints to higher intensity development. Walnut’s growth
during the 1990s had slowed to just three percent. Between 2000 and
2010, the population in Walnut decreased to 29,172 residents, represent-
ing an approximately three percent decrease.
Average household size in Walnut was 3.71 persons per occupied hous-
ing unit in 1990. This figure has decreased to 3.41 persons per household
by 2010.
Demographic shifts are occurring in the City. In 1980, Asian/Pacific Is-
landers comprised only 10 percent of the City's population, but by 2010,
this Asian/Pacific Islanders comprise a majority of Walnut residents (63
percent).
                                                                           1

1.2      Purpose and Organization of the Element
The Housing Element is one of the mandatory elements of the General
Plan and is required by State law to be updated periodically. This up-
date fulfills the 2013 – 2021 update cycle for jurisdictions within the
Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) region. This
Housing Element covers the planning period from October 15, 2013
through October 15, 2021. The Housing Element is intended to ade-
quately plan for the existing and future housing needs of the Communi-
ty, including a “fair share” of the regional housing need. State law gen-
erally provides great flexibility in the content of a General Plan to reflect
the values and needs of a community. However, State law is more spe-
cific and clearly defines what must be addressed in Housing Elements.
The Housing Element identifies policies, programs, and objectives that
focus on the following:
           Conserving and improving existing affordable housing;
           Providing adequate housing sites to accommodate future hous-
            ing needs for all income segments of the community;
           Assisting in the development of affordable housing;
           Removing governmental constraints to housing development;
            and
           Promoting equal housing opportunities for all Walnut residents.
The Housing Element consists of the following major components:
           An analysis of the demographic, household, and housing charac-
            teristics and trends (Section 2);
           A review of potential market, governmental, and environmental
            constraints to meeting the identified housing needs (Section 3);
           An evaluation of the land, financial, and administrative re-
            sources available to address housing needs (Section 4);
           A statement of the Housing Plan, including goals, policies, and
            programs to address the identified housing needs (Section 5);
            and
           An evaluation of the accomplishments achieved under the
            adopted 2008 Housing Element (Appendix B).
Housing Element law also requires the State Department of Housing and
Community Development (HCD) to review Housing Elements for com-
pliance with State law and to report their findings to the local govern-
ment.

1.3      Data Sources and Methods
In preparing this Housing Element, various sources of data were con-
sulted, including, but not limited to:
           Bureau of the Census, 1990, 2000, and 2010 Census
           Bureau of the Census, 2009-2011 and 2007-2011 American Com-
            munity Survey (ACS)
           2013-2021 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) from
            the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG)
           City of Walnut General Plan and Zoning Code
           Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) pre-
            pared by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
            ment (HUD), 2006-2010
           Various real estate data from commercial data sources such as
            Dataquick and Craigslist
           Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data from Lend-
            ingPatterns
1.4      Community Participation
City Council Study Session – May 22, 2013
On May 22, 2013, the City conducted a study session with the City
Council to kick-off the Housing Element update. In this meeting, the
City Council was provided with a brief presentation that outlined the
State Housing Element law, update process, and key challenges facing
the City. City Council and the public discussed potential strategies for
meeting State requirements and provided direction to staff to proceed
with the update.
Community Workshop – September 5, 2013
A key challenge for the City in this Housing Element update is the need
to accommodate its share of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation
(RHNA), estimated at approximately 1,000 additional units through
2021. In this workshop, the City presented the rezoning strategy for
meeting this RHNA and responded to residents’ concerns. The meeting
was publicly noticed and property owners within a 500-foot radius of the
properties proposed for rezoning were notified. Comments received are
summarized in Appendix A.
Planning Commission Public Hearing – October 2, 2013
On October 2, 2013, the City conducted a public hearing to amend the
Zoning Code to add the Mixed Use/Housing Opportunity Overlay Zon-
                                                                       3

ing District (MU/HOO) to the underlying zoning for properties identi-
fied as MU/HOO-1, H=MU/HOO-2 and MU/HOO-3 located along the
north side of Valley Boulevard. The meeting was publicly noticed in the
San Gabriel Valley Tribune and posted on City website.
Planning Commission Study Session – October 22, 2013
On October 22, 2013, the City conducted a study session on the Draft
Housing Element with the Planning Commission. The meeting was pub-
licly noticed in the San Gabriel Valley Tribune and posted on City website.
Special invitations were sent to housing developers, neighboring juris-
dictions, business community, public agencies, and nonprofit agencies
that serve low and moderate income persons, as well as those with spe-
cial needs, such as the disabled and seniors. The list of agencies invited
is included in Appendix A. One property owner attended this study ses-
sion and spoke in support of the 2013-2021 Draft Housing Element.
1.5      General Plan Consistency
The City of Walnut General Plan is comprised of the following seven
elements: 1) Land Use; 2) Circulation; 3) Housing; 4) Environmental Re-
sources Management; 5) Public Safety; 6) Noise; and 7) Sewer.
This Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements and
is consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the Plan. Ex-
amples of inter-element consistency include: residential development
capacities established in the Land Use Element are incorporated within
the Housing Element, and the discussion of environmental constraints in
the Housing Element is based upon information from the Environmental
Resource Management and Public Safety elements.
Pursuant to SB162, the City will review and update, as necessary, its
Land Use, Safety and Conservation Elements upon completion of the
Housing Element to address flood hazards and management. No disad-
vantaged unincorporated communities are located within the City or
within its sphere of influence.

2. Community Profile
A successful strategy for improving housing conditions must be preced-
ed by an assessment of the housing needs of the community and region.
This section of the Housing Element discusses the major components of
housing need including the trends in Walnut's population, households,
and employment base and the type of housing available. Since these
changes have not occurred in a vacuum, the regional context is also pre-
sented.
2.1      Demographic Profile
Population characteristics affect the type of housing needs in a communi-
ty. Population growth, age composition, race/ethnicity, and employ-
ment trends help define the housing needs in a community.
2.1.1 Population Trends
Table 1 shows population growth in the City from 1980 to 2010. Between
1980 and 1990, the City of Walnut’s population more than doubled. This
growth can be attributed to the large number of planned residential de-
velopments constructed during the 1980s as well as the City's desirable
image as a family-oriented residential community. Since 1990, growth in
the City has slowed dramatically, which is reflective of the sluggish
economy during the first half of the 1990s and the relatively limited re-
maining land available for development. The slower rate of growth is
also typical of the region as a whole. Between 2000 and 2010, the City’s
population actually declined, by about three percent, to 29,172 residents.

   1990                                            29,105           137.2%

   2010                                            29,172            -2.8%
Sources: 1980-2010 Census.
Table 2 shows population changes between 1990 and 2010 for Walnut
and its neighbors. During the 1990s, Walnut experienced much less
growth than nearby communities and Los Angeles County as a whole.
The City was also one of the few cities in the area to experience an actual
decline in population between 2000 and 2010.
                                                                          5

2.1.2 Age Trends
The age distribution of a community is an important factor affecting fu-
ture housing needs. Traditionally, the younger adult population (ages 18
to 34) prefers low- to moderate-cost, smaller units. Persons between 35
and 54 years of age usually reside in large, more expensive units since
they typically earn higher incomes and have larger households. And,
seniors generally prefer smaller units that require less maintenance and
are close to public transportation.
Table 3 shows the changes in the age distribution of Walnut residents
from 1990 to 2010. This table groups residents according to their impli-
cations on household characteristics and associated housing needs. As
the City has matured, the population has also aged. The median age of
Walnut residents has increased significantly from 31.2 in 1990 to 43.1 in
2010.
The number and proportion of children, young adults and adults aged
35 to 54, all decreased. Residents in these age groups are typically mem-
bers of young families. The changes in Walnut’s age composition over
time indicate an exodus of young adults and families, possibly due to the
high costs of housing.
Older adults (aged 55-64) and seniors experienced large proportional
increases between 2000 and 2010. However, the housing stock in Walnut
has limited options appropriate to persons in these age groups. Smaller
units, such as condominiums/townhomes, senior apartments, or assisted
living facilities that require limited or no maintenance, are in short sup-
ply.

2.1.3 Race and Ethnicity
The nature and extent of a community’s housing needs can be affected
by the racial/ethnic composition of its population. The size and type of
housing preferred and the neighborhood desired often vary by a per-
son’s or household’s racial or ethnic background. Table 4 shows the
racial and ethnic composition of Walnut residents from 1990 to 2010.
Asian residents continue to make up the majority of Walnut residents (63
percent) and Asians were the only race/ethnic group to increase propor-
tionally during the 2000s. All other racial and ethnic categories experi-
enced proportional declines during this time period.

                  An individual’s level of education is closely related to their ability to
                  earn a living. The distribution of occupations held by Walnut residents
                  is shown in Figure 1. As of 2011, 14,115 persons were employed in the
                  civilian labor force in Walnut. Over one-half (51 percent) of residents in
                  the City held management, business, science, and arts occupations. Sales
                  and office occupations represented the second largest share of employ-
                  ment at 30 percent.

 2.2      Household Characteristics
 A household is defined as all persons occupying a housing unit. Fami-
 lies are a subset of households. Single households include persons living
 alone in housing units, but do not include persons in group quarters
 such as convalescent homes or dormitories. Other households are unre-
 lated people living together, such as roommates. Household characteris-
 tics play an important role in defining community needs. Household
 type, income and tenure can help to identify special needs populations
 as well as other factors that affect the housing needs of a community.

2.2.1 Household Types
Walnut is a family-oriented community. Table 7 illustrates the changes
in household composition (e.g. family household, non-family household,
or single household) in Walnut from 1990 to 2010. Of the 8,533 house-
holds that resided in Walnut in 2010, 90 percent were families. Approx-
imately 31 percent of Walnut households were married couples with
children and 43 percent were married couples without children. Since
2000, the proportion of married couples with children has decreased by
30 percent, while the proportion of married couples without children
increased by almost 38 percent. These shifts represent the largest changes
to household composition in Walnut during the last decade.

Non-family households, which include single persons and other unrelat-
ed persons living together, comprised only 10 percent of all households
in 2010. The number of single person households has increased signifi-
cantly (31 percent) since 2000, but this household type still only repre-
sents a very small proportion of total households in the City.
The 2010 census indicates that the average household size and average
family size in Walnut have decreased since 2000. However, the average
household size is still larger than the County’s (2.98), while the average
family size in the City is slightly less than the County’s (3.58).

2.2.2 Household Income
Income is one of the most important factor affecting housing opportuni-
ties because it affects the ability of households to balance housing costs
with other basic necessities.
Many people who work in Walnut do not live in the City and many
Walnut residents commute throughout the Greater Los Angeles Area for
work. As shown in Figure 2, the 2011 median household income in Wal-
nut was nearly twice the median income of Los Angeles County. Since
1990, the median household income in Walnut has increased from
$64,333 to $101,358.

Income by Household Type and Tenure
For planning and funding purposes, the California State Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) has developed the fol-
lowing income categories based on the Area Median Income (AMI) of a
metropolitan area:
           Extremely low income households earn up to 30 percent of the
            AMI
           Very Low Income Households earn between 31 and 50 percent
            of the AMI
           Low Income Households earn between 51 and 80 percent of the
            AMI

           Moderate Income Households earn between 81 and 120 percent
            of the AMI
           Above Moderate Income Households earn over 120 percent of
            the AMI
Combined, extremely low, very low, and low income households are
often referred to as lower income households.
The 2010 Census does not contain information on household income.
However, household income data was tabulated by the Southern Cali-
fornia Association of Governments (SCAG) using the 2005-2009 ACS
(Table 8).1 As shown, between 2005 and 2009, approximately 17 percent
of the City’s households earned lower incomes, while approximately 83
percent had earned incomes of moderate or above.

                              Certain groups have greater difficulty finding decent, affordable housing
                              due to special circumstances. Special circumstances may be related to
                              one’s income, family characteristics, and disability status, among others.
                              In Walnut, persons and households with special needs include seniors,
                              persons with disabilities, large households, single-parent households,
                              farmworkers, residents living in poverty, and the homeless.2 Table 9

                              2.3.1 Seniors
                              Seniors are those individuals aged 65 or older. The special housing
                              needs of seniors stem from several factors: their relatively low fixed in-
                              comes, high health care costs, and physical limitations. Being on a low,
                              fixed income makes it difficult for many elderly to afford adequate hous-
                              ing or maintain their homes. This is further compounded by rising health
                              care costs due to health problems that arise with older age. As persons
                              age and face reduced physical mobility, accessibility improvements are
                              often necessary to maintain safe and independent living.
                              14

According to the 2010 Census, 1,517 households in Walnut (approxi-
mately 18 percent of all households) were headed by seniors. Of these
senior-headed households, the vast majority (92 percent) owned their
homes and just eight percent rented their homes. The number of senior
households in Walnut has increased dramatically since 2000, when only
eight percent of households were headed by seniors.
Disabilities greatly impacted the City’s senior population. In 2011, ap-
proximately 27 percent of Walnut’s seniors suffered from at least one
disability. As shown in Table 10, over one-half of seniors with disabili-
ties had ambulatory and independent living difficulties. According to
CHAS data, a significant proportion of senior households were also af-
fected by housing problems. Specifically, over one-half (approximately
54 percent) of lower income owner-occupied senior households experi-
enced housing problems between 2006 and 2010.
Resources
The special needs of seniors can be met through a range of services, in-
cluding congregate care, residential care facilities, rent subsides, shared
housing, and housing rehabilitation assistance. For the frail or disabled
elderly, housing can also be modified with features that help ensure con-
tinued independent living arrangements. As of June 2013, eight licensed
residential care facilities provided assisted living, nursing care, and gen-
eral services to seniors in Walnut. These facilities have a combined ca-
pacity of 159 beds.
Senior residents can also benefit from programs and services available at
the City of Walnut’s Senior Citizens Center. Services provided include:
help in accessing various health and human services, nutrition programs,
support groups, and volunteer opportunities. The Center also offers a
wide array of educational and instructional classes, including, health and
wellness, socialization, recreation and leisure, arts and crafts, and per-
sonal development activities. A daily calendar of the Center’s programs
and special events can be found on the City’s website.
2.3.2 Persons with Disabilities
The living arrangement of disabled persons depends on the severity of
the disability. Many persons with disabilities live at home in an inde-
pendent fashion or with family. Independent living can be enhanced
2     Although the City of Walnut has no farming operations, State Housing Ele-
      ment law requires that the City examine the extent of farmworker housing
      needs.
                                                                           15

through special housing features for the disabled, income support for
those who are unable to work, and in-home supportive services for per-
sons with medical conditions, among others. Other persons with disabil-
ities live in group homes or other institutionalized settings.
Disabled persons have special needs. The most obvious is housing that is
adapted to the specific needs of a disabled person. State and federal leg-
islation mandate that a percentage of units in new or substantially reha-
bilitated multi-family apartment complexes be made accessible to indi-
viduals with limited physical mobility. Most single-family homes, how-
ever, are inaccessible to people with mobility and sensory limitations.
Housing may not be adaptable to widened doorways and hallways, ac-
cess ramps, larger bathrooms, lowered countertops, and other features
necessary for accessibility. Location of housing is also an important fac-
tor for many persons with disabilities, as they often rely upon public
transportation to travel to necessary services and shops.
The 2010 Census did not collect information on disabilities; however, the
American Community Survey (ACS) provides estimates on Walnut’s
disabled population. Table 10 presents the number of disabilities by type
for Walnut residents with one or more disabilities. According to the
2009-2011 ACS, approximately six percent of residents had one or more
disabilities. Among the disabilities tallied, independent living and am-
bulatory difficulties were the most prevalent; however, the frequency of
certain types of disabilities varied by age. Specifically, cognitive difficul-
ties were the most common among disabled persons aged 5-17, while
independent living difficulties were reported the most frequently by sen-
iors.

   Persons with Developmental Disabilities
   A recent change in State law requires that the Housing Element discuss
   the housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. As de-
   fined by the Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, “devel-
   opmental disability” means “a disability that originates before an indi-
   vidual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continue,
   indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual.
   As defined by the Director of Developmental Services, in consultation
   with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, this term shall include
   mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, and autism. This term shall
   also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental
   retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individu-
   als with mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping
   conditions that are solely physical in nature.”
   The Census does not record developmental disabilities. According to the
   U.S. Administration on Developmental Disabilities, an acceptable esti-
   mate of the percentage of the population that can be defined as devel-
   opmentally disabled is 1.5 percent. This translates to 438 persons in the
   City of Walnut with developmental disabilities, based on the City’s 2010
   Census population.
   According to the State’s Department of Developmental Services, as of
   November 2012, approximately 324 Walnut residents with developmen-
   tal disabilities were being assisted at the San Gabriel/Pomona Regional
   Center. Most of these individuals were residing in a private home with
                                                                                     17

their parent or guardian and 91 of these persons with developmental
disabilities were under the age of 18.
Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work inde-
pendently within a conventional housing environment. More severely
disabled individuals require a group living environment where supervi-
sion is provided. The most severely affected individuals may require an
institutional environment where medical attention and physical therapy
are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood,
the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is
the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appro-
priate level of independence as an adult.
Resources
As of June 2013, six adult residential care facilities, with the capacity to
serve 35 persons with disabilities, are located in Walnut. One group
home and one small family home, with a total capacity of eight beds, are
also available for disabled children in the City. Residents with disabili-
ties can benefit from various supportive services offered by the City, in-
cluding, the Greater La Puente Valley Meals on Wheels program and
Dial-A-Cab discount travel services.
Persons with disabilities can also benefit from the City’s Housing Reha-
bilitation Program, which provides financial assistance for the installa-
tion of special amenities in housing occupied by elderly and disabled
households, such as wheelchair ramps, support rail systems, and securi-
ty/safety devices.
2.3.2 Large Households
Large households are defined as households with five or more members
in the unit. A large household may be a large family (e.g., parents with
children and/or extended family members), two or more families shar-
ing the same housing unit, more than five unrelated individuals living
together, or any of these combinations.
Large households comprise a special needs group because of their need
for larger units, which often command higher prices that are not afford-
able to many large households. In order to save for other necessities
such as food, clothing, and medical care, it is common for lower income
large households to reside in smaller units, frequently resulting in over-
crowding.

The 2010 Census reported 999 households in Walnut with five or more
members, representing approximately 12 percent of total households.
Among the City’s large households, 85 percent were homeowners and 15
percent were renters. According to CHAS data, many of the City’s large
households reported experiencing housing problems. All of Walnut’s
(100 percent) lower income large renter households and 94 percent of the
City’s large owner households experienced housing problems between
2006 and 2010.
Resources
Large households can benefit from the general programs and services
available to all of the City’s lower and moderate income households.
Lower income large households are eligible to participate in the Section 8
Housing Choice Voucher program, which the City provides through a
cooperative agreement with the County of Los Angeles Community De-
velopment Commission.
2.3.3 Single-Parent Households
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance
because of their greater need for day care, health care, and other assis-
tance.
In 2010, 420 single-parent households with children lived in Walnut, rep-
resenting approximately five percent of all households. Of these single-
parent households, 77 percent were female-headed households with
children. In 2000, single-parent households accounted for eight percent
of the City’s households.
Female-headed households with children in particular are more likely to
earn lower incomes, thus limiting housing availability for this group.
Limited household income constrains the ability of these households to
afford adequate housing and provide for childcare, health care, and oth-
er necessities. Finding adequate and affordable childcare is also a press-
ing issue for many families with children. Overall, 303 households (four
percent of all families) in Walnut were living below the poverty level in
2011. By comparison, 18 percent of all female-headed families with chil-
dren were living below the poverty level.
Resources
Single-parent households can benefit from the general housing programs
and services available to all of the City’s lower and moderate income
households.
                                                                       19

In addition, these households can also benefit from programs and ser-
vices that support the City’s youth and teen residents. The Parks and
Recreation Department offers after school programs and seasonal day
camps for youth residents of all ages. The City’s Teen Center provides
teens with access to social events, recreational activities, assistance with
schoolwork, and various workshop and classes. Families can also benefit
from teen/parent counseling offered at the Teen Center. For households
with childcare assistance needs, the Salvation Army, Pomona Corps of-
fers three programs: Day Care, Kindergarten, and After School Programs
that are available for children age two to twelve.
2.3.4 Farmworkers
Farmworkers are traditionally defined as persons whose primary in-
comes are earned through permanent or seasonal agricultural labor.
Permanent farm laborers work in the fields, processing plants, or sup-
port activities on a generally year-round basis. When workload increases
during harvest periods, the labor force is supplemented by seasonal la-
bor, often supplied by a labor contractor. For some crops, farms may
employ migrant workers, defined as those whose travel distance to work
prevents them from returning to their primary residence every evening.
According to the 2007-2011 ACS, there were no farmworkers in the City
of Walnut. The City is mostly urbanized and there is no agriculturally
designated land or active farming operations in the City.
Resources
Because no farmworkers were recorded in the City of Walnut, no specific
programs and resources for this special needs group are necessary.
2.3.5 Residents Living Below the Poverty Level
Families with incomes below the poverty level, typically with extremely
low and very low incomes, are at greatest risk of becoming homeless and
typically require special programs to assist them in meeting their rent
and mortgage obligations so as to not become homeless. The 2007-2011
ACS classified approximately five percent of all Walnut residents and
four percent of all families as living below the poverty level. These
households need assistance with housing subsidies, utility and other liv-
ing expense subsidies, and other supportive services.
Resources
City households living in poverty can benefit from the services offered
by various non-profits located in neighboring communities. Assistance
is often provided in cases of financial emergencies by providing services
such as, food vouchers, gasoline vouchers, bus tokens, rental assistance,
20

utility payments, and referrals to other services. Agencies offering such
services include the Walnut Food Bank, ESGVHC Emergency Assistance
Center, Inland Valley Council of Churches, Pomona Neighborhood Cen-
ter, Catholic Charities, House of Ruth, and WINGS Pomona.
2.3.6 Homeless Persons
Assessing a community’s homeless population is difficult because of the
transient nature of the population. There are essentially three categories
of the homeless populations: the chronically homeless, migrant farm-
workers, and the situationally homeless. The chronically homeless often
have problems that led to their homelessness such as substance abuse
and mental illness. They opt to live on the streets rather than participate
in a case managed program.
Migrant farmworkers or day laborers live under difficult conditions in
encampments often adjacent to farming operations. Because of their
tenuous living conditions, it is very difficult to estimate their numbers.
Mostly single adult men from Mexico, migrant farmworkers are paid
minimum wage and often choose to send their earnings home to support
their families rather than using the money to obtain housing. They also
tend to travel from community to community according to the harvest-
ing schedules of crops.
The last category of homeless people, the situationally homeless, often
find themselves homeless due to a combination of factors beyond their
control, such as rent increases, medical bills or loss of employment. This
is also the segment that is most likely to seek help from service agencies
and best able to work toward becoming self-sufficient again.
As the cost of housing in Southern California continues to rise, home-
lessness has become more prevalent, even in affluent communities like
Walnut. According to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department,
who provides law enforcement services to the City under contract, the
number of chronic homeless in Walnut (those who are homeless more by
choice and often refuse shelter and service) is very limited. The Sheriff’s
Department states that they rarely, if ever, encounter chronic homeless
persons and estimate the number at fewer than ten.
However, there is another category of homeless in Walnut that does not
meet the stereotype of “homeless.” Persons in this category do not live
on the street as they have alternative housing arrangements. They may
live with relatives or friends, in nearby hotels, or other transitory hous-
ing. The Sheriff’s Department cannot provide an estimate of the persons
                                                                        21

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
that fall into this category. Their numbers are difficult to quantify, as
they are invisible in the community.
Resources
The City’s Community Development Department is responsible for di-
recting people in need to the appropriate resources. Families that are
displaced from their homes are referred to a number of shelters or tem-
porary housing services available in the local area. These include:
           Walnut Food Bank – Provides food assistance to individuals and
            families that are homeless or at-risk of becoming homeless.
           ESGVHC Emergency Assistance Center – Provides information
            and referrals, emergency food and clothing, transportation (bus
            tokens and taxi vouchers), counseling. Located in Hacienda
            Heights.
           Inland Valley Council of Churches - Provides a centralized lo-
            cation for service provision to homeless persons, as well as
            emergency shelter and services to homeless women with chil-
            dren and families. Located in Pomona.
           Pomona Neighborhood Center – Provides employment services,
            emergency food and clothing, information and referrals. Locat-
            ed in Pomona.
           Catholic Charities – Provides services to homeless and low-
            income families at risk of becoming homeless such as counseling
            and poverty services, food, shelter, vouchers, job training refer-
            rals. Located in Pomona.
           House of Ruth - Provides supportive services to women who are
            homeless as a result of domestic violence.
           WINGS Pomona – Provides emergency housing, food, clothing,
            and counseling to victims of domestic violence.
In addition, during the winter and inclement weather conditions, home-
less persons may be provided hotel vouchers or transported to a local
shelter, such as the National Guard Armory in Pomona or the East San
Gabriel Valley Coalition for the Homeless. Los Angeles County De-
partment of Mental Health also accepts referrals.

2.3.7 College Students
The largest college in the City of Walnut is Mt. San Antonio College, a
Community College serving approximately 40,000 students a year in
Walnut and surrounding cities. Most students live outside of Walnut in
cities like Pomona, Covina, West Covina, and Diamond Bar and com-
mute to Walnut. California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, is
immediately adjacent to the City of Walnut. The large student and facul-
ty population in the City and surrounding cities contributes to the local
economy and to housing demand. One of the difficulties for students
and faculty members is finding affordable housing in the City. Accord-
ing to the ACS, 3,785 college/graduate students resided in the City, rep-
resenting approximately 13 percent of the total population in 2011.
Resources
Students can benefit from the general housing services available to all
lower and moderate income residents of Walnut. In addition, the City
works with the colleges to encourage the provision of housing for stu-
dents, faculty, and staff on campus.
2.4      Housing Stock Characteristics
The Census defines a housing unit as any of the following: a house, an
apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of homes, or a single room
intended for use as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are
those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals
in the building, and which have direct access from outside the building
or through a common hall.
This section discusses various housing characteristics and trends that
affect housing needs in Walnut. Important characteristics include hous-
ing types, tenure, vacancy rates, housing age and condition, and housing
cost and affordability.
2.4.1 Housing Growth and Type
Table 11 shows the changes in the City’s housing stock by type of hous-
ing between 1990 and 2011. Housing growth in Walnut has been modest
over the past decade. The 2010 Census recorded 8,753 housing units in
the City. This represents an increase of approximately four percent be-
tween 2000 and 2010.
The majority of units in Walnut in 2011 were single-family detached
homes, which comprised approximately 95 percent of all units. Multi-
family units made up the remaining four percent of all homes. However,
                                                                       23

new housing units built since 2000 has been mostly multi-family hous-
ing, primarily as townhome developments.

2.4.2 Housing Tenure and Vacancy
Vacancy rates are often a good indicator of how effectively for-sale and
rental units are meeting the current demand for housing in a community.
Vacancy rates of five to six percent for rental housing and one to two
percent for ownership housing are generally considered optimum and
indicate that there is a balance between the supply and demand for hous-
ing. A higher than optimal vacancy rate may indicate an excess supply
of units and price depreciation, while a lower than optimal vacancy rate
may indicate a shortage of units and escalation of housing prices.
The tenure distribution (owner- versus renter-occupied units) and va-
cancy rates of the Walnut housing stock between 1990 and 2010 are pre-
sented in Table 12. In 2010, approximately 88 percent of housing units in
Walnut were owner-occupied—this proportion remains essentially un-
changed from 1990. Countywide, only 48 percent of all housing units
were owner-occupied.

Vacancy rates for both ownership and rental housing were significantly
lower in Walnut than the County as a whole in 2010. The City’s vacancy
rates of 4.4 percent for rental housing and less than one percent for own-
ership housing indicate high demand for housing in Walnut.
2.4.3 Housing Age and Condition
The age and condition of Walnut’s housing stock is an important indica-
tor of potential rehabilitation needs. Commonly, housing over 30 years
of age needs some form of major rehabilitation, such as a new roof,
foundation work, plumbing, etc. Due to high household income and
high housing values in Walnut, housing in the City tends to be better
maintained than in many other communities with an older housing
stock. However, despite having large equity in their homes, some
households (elderly households in particular) have limited incomes and
may have difficulty maintaining their homes.
Walnut’s housing stock is relatively newer. The age of the City’s hous-
ing stock as defined by the year the units were built is shown in Table 13.
As of 2011, only about 38 percent of all housing units in Walnut were 30
years old or older (built prior to 1980). A majority of units (62 percent)
were built between 1980 and 2011. Housing units in the City are general-
ly well-maintained. As of 2010, it was estimated that approximately ten
housing units in the City were in need of substantial rehabilitation, and
fewer than five units were deteriorated and in need of replacement. The
number of units requiring substantial rehabilitation or replacement is
likely the same.
                                                                            25

2.4.4 Housing Cost and Affordability
The cost of housing is directly related to the extent of housing problems
in a community. If housing costs are relatively high compared to house-
hold income, housing cost burden and overcrowding occur. This section
summarizes the cost and affordability of housing to Walnut residents.
Ownership Market
According to DataQuick, a company that collects real estate data, the
median home price in Walnut was the highest among neighboring juris-
dictions (Figure 3). As of April 2013, the City’s median home sales price
of $610,000 was significantly higher than the County median price of
$400,000.
Since 2011, home prices in the region and Los Angeles County as a whole
have increased steadily. Between 2012 and 2013, Walnut and many sur-
rounding jurisdictions experienced double digit increases in home pric-
es, including Los Angeles County as a whole, which experienced a 27-
percent increase (Table 14). This 2013 median price of $610,000 in Wal-
nut represents almost a full recovery to the City’s peak median price of
$650,000 in 2006.

       The advertised rents for apartments and single-family homes, based on
       an Internet search conducted in the summer of 2013, are summarized in
       Table 15. The majority of units advertised for rent were single-family
       homes. Generally, median rents increased as the size of the unit in-
       creased. In Walnut, median rents ranged from $1,088 for a one-bedroom
       unit to $2,795 for a five-bedroom unit. Apartments offer the most
       affordable rental option but the number of apartments available for rent
       was limited.

       Housing Affordability by Income
       Housing affordability is an important indicator of quality of life in Wal-
       nut. If residents pay too much for housing they will not have sufficient
       income for other necessities such as health care. Households that spend
       a substantial portion of their income on housing may also be at risk of
       becoming homeless in the event of unexpected circumstances such as
       illness or loss of employment. State law requires that the City facilitate
       provision of housing opportunities that are affordable to all economic
       segments of the community.
       Based on the California Department of Housing and Community Devel-
       opment’s 2013 income limits for Los Angeles County and current real
       estate prices, homeownership in Walnut is beyond the reach of most
       lower and moderate income households. Housing options for extremely
       low and very low income households are virtually non-existent unless
       public assistance is involved. As shown in Table 16, moderate income
       households can generally afford market rate rents for some of the City’s
       smaller apartments but appropriately sized affordable units may still be
       difficult to find.

2.5      Affordable Housing
2.5.1 Affordable Housing Inventory
The City of Walnut has assisted in the development of two affordable
housing projects within the last decade. These include the 108-unit Wal-
nut Grove, an affordable senior condominium project, and eight single-
family detached homes at Magnolia for seniors. The Walnut Grove pro-
ject was completed in 2004 and is affordable to very low, low, and mod-
erate income seniors. The eight single-family homes are affordable to
moderate income seniors.
2.5.2 At-Risk Housing
State law requires that the Housing Element evaluates the potential con-
version of publicly assisted rental housing from low-income use to mar-
ket-rate housing. The City of Walnut does not currently have any pub-
licly assisted rental housing complexes. Therefore, over the next 10 years
(between 2013 and 2023), no projects are considered to be at risk of con-
version to market rate housing.
2.6      Estimate of Housing Needs
Typical housing needs/problems include cost burden, overcrowding,
and substandard housing. Most lower and moderate income households
cope with the housing cost issues either by assuming a cost burden, or by
occupying a smaller than needed or substandard unit.
2.6.1 Overcrowding
Overcrowding occurs when high housing costs lead households to dou-
ble up or live in smaller units to meet other basic needs. It can also occur
when there is a lack of adequately sized housing units for large house-
holds. Overcrowding can potentially lead to rapid deterioration of the
City’s housing stock, additional traffic, and a shortage of on-site parking.
As defined by the State Department of Housing and Community Devel-
opment (HCD), overcrowding occurs when a household has more than
one person per room (excluding bathroom, kitchen). Severe overcrowd-
ing occurs when there are more than 1.5 persons per room.
A summary of overcrowding in Walnut between 1990 and 2011 is pre-
sented in Table 17. The number of overcrowded housing units has de-
creased dramatically in both the City and the County since 2000. In 2011,

Table 18 shows the extent of overcrowding in Walnut by tenure (owner
versus renter) from 1990 to 2011. The overall rate of overcrowding is
considerably higher among renter-occupied units (13 percent) than own-
er-occupied units (two percent). Furthermore, less than one percent of
owner-occupied units were severely overcrowded, but almost seven per-
cent of renter-occupied units were severely overcrowded.

2.6.2 Cost Burden/Overpayment
Housing cost burden is defined as a housing cost that exceeds 30 percent
of a household’s gross income. A severe cost burden is a housing cost
that exceeds 50 percent of a household’s gross income. Housing cost
burden is particularly problematic for low and moderate income house-
holds in that it leaves little resources for a household to pay for other
living expenses.
When a household spends more than 30 percent of its income on housing
costs, it has less disposable income for other necessities such as health
care. In the event of unexpected circumstances such as loss of employ-
ment and health problems, lower income households with a burdensome
housing cost are more likely to become homeless. Homeowners with a
housing cost burden have the option of selling the homes and become
renters. Renters, on the other hand, are vulnerable and subject to con-
stant changes in the housing market.
The 2006-2010 CHAS data estimated that 38 percent of owner-
households and 55 percent of renter-households in the City were over-
paying for housing. Because housing cost burden tends to concentrate
among the most vulnerable populations, reducing cost burden is an im-
portant housing goal for the City of Walnut.
Table 19 shows the proportion of households with housing cost burden
by income level, tenure, and household type. Overall, 39 percent of all
households in the City experienced a housing cost burden. Family
households, particularly large family households, were more likely than
other household types to have a housing cost burden.
The incidence of housing cost burden also varied by household income.
Among senior households, for example, extremely low income owner
households had the greatest cost burden and 67 percent of these house-
holds experienced a severe cost burden. Housing cost burden was gener-
ally the most prevalent among the City’s very low income households,
rather than in its extremely low income households, potentially because
more extremely low income households in Walnut were receiving some
form of housing assistance. In addition, extremely low income house-
holds in Walnut are more likely to be long-time residents that have
owned their homes for a long time.

3. Housing Constraints
Constraints to the provision of adequate and affordable housing are
posed by market, governmental, infrastructure, and environmental fac-
tors, among others. These constraints may increase the cost of housing,
or may render residential construction economically infeasible for devel-
opers. Constraints to housing production significantly impact house-
holds with lower and moderate incomes and special needs.
3.1      Market Constraints
3.1.1 Economic Factors
The effects of market forces on the construction industry may act as a
barrier to affordable housing. The forces of supply and demand can af-
fect the timing and level of housing construction. The California housing
market hit its peak in the summer of 2005. In the years following, how-
ever, home prices fell dramatically statewide in response to the credit
crunch. Fortunately, since 2011, home prices in Walnut and in Los Ange-
les County as a whole, have stabilized and even begun increasing. Medi-
an home prices in the City increased about 14 percent between April
2012 and April 2013. The City anticipates residential development activi-
ty and home values to continue to pick up as the economy continues its
recovery.
3.1.2 Land Costs
The majority of Walnut is built out, with the exception of the Hillsides,
which do not offer the kind of terrain necessary for high-density devel-
opment. Underutilized land offers additional opportunity for housing
development, but demolition of existing improvements may add to the
cost of development. According to listings for vacant residential land
available for purchase on Realtor.com in June 2013, land values in the
City averaged approximately $25 per square foot, or $1.1 million per
acre.
3.1.3 Labor and Construction Costs
The California Labor Code applies prevailing wage rates to public works
projects of a value exceeding $1,000, defining public works to mean con-
struction, alteration, installation, demolition, or repair work performed
under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds. For
example, public transfer of an asset for less than fair market value, such
as a land write-down, would be construed to be paid for in part out of
public funds and thus would trigger prevailing wage requirements.
State law exempts affordable housing projects assisted with only rede-
34

2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
velopment housing set-aside funds. If other public funds are involved,
prevailing wage rates may still be triggered.
While the cost differential in prevailing and standard wages varies based
on the skill level of the occupation, prevailing wages tend to add to the
overall cost of development. In the case of affordable housing projects,
prevailing wage requirements could effectively reduce the number of
affordable units that can be achieved with public subsidies.
Construction factors such as type of construction, custom versus tract
development, materials, site conditions, finishing details, amenities,
square footage, and structural configuration can increase the cost of
housing. An indicator of construction costs is Building Valuation Data
compiled by the International Code Council (ICC). The unit costs com-
piled by the ICC include structural, electrical, plumbing, and mechanical
work, in addition to interior finish and normal site preparation. The data
is national and does not take into account regional differences, and does
not include the price of the land upon which the building is built. The
national average for development costs per square foot for apartments
and single-family homes in February 2013 are as follows:
           Type I or II, Multi-Family: $128.12 to $145.89 per sq. ft.
           Type V Wood Frame, Multi-Family: $97.29 to $101.72 per sq. ft.
           Type V Wood Frame, One and Two Family Dwelling: $107.08 to
            $114.28 per sq. ft.
The unit costs for residential care facilities generally range between
$123.05 and $172.59 per square foot. These costs are exclusive of the costs
of land and soft costs, such as entitlements, financing, etc. The City's abil-
ity to mitigate high construction costs is limited without direct subsidies.
Another factor related to construction cost is development density. With
an increase in the number of units built in a project, overall costs general-
ly decrease as builders can benefit from the economies of scale. Although
construction costs are a significant portion of the overall development
cost, they are consistent throughout the region and therefore are not con-
sidered a major constraint to housing production.
3.1.4 Availability of Mortgage Financing
Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions
are required to disclose information on the disposition of loan applica-
tions and the income, gender, and race of loan applicants. In 2011, a total
of 278 households applied for conventional mortgage loans to purchase
                                                                          35

          homes in Walnut (Table 20). Few households utilized government-
          backed loans to purchase homes in Walnut.3 Approximately 73 percent
          of conventional mortgage applications were approved, 13 percent were
          denied, and 14 percent were withdrawn or closed for incompleteness.
          In 2011, applications for home refinancing were the most common in
          Walnut. Of the 1,806 applications for refinancing, approximately 69 per-
          cent were approved, 17 percent were denied, and 15 percent were with-
          drawn or closed for incompleteness.
          Though less common than loans for home purchase and refinance, there
          was a noticeable demand for home improvement financing in the City.
          A total of 78 households in Walnut applied for loans to make home im-
          provements and approval rates for this loan type were the highest at 76
          percent. About 17 percent of home improvement loan applications were
          denied.

          Foreclosures
          Foreclosure occurs when households fall behind on one or more sched-
          uled mortgage payments. The foreclosure process can be halted if the
          homeowner is able to bring their mortgage payments current. If pay-
          ments cannot be resumed or the debt cannot be resolved, the lender can
          legally use the foreclosure process to repossess (take over) the home. If
          the home is worth less than the total amount owed on the mortgage loan,
          a deficiency judgment could be pursued. The homeowner would lose
          their home and also would owe the home lender an additional amount.
          3     Government-backed loans include loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing
                Administration (FHA), Veteran Administration (VA), and Farm Service Agency
                (FSA)/Rural Housing Services (RHS).

Figure 4 illustrates the location of all the properties within the City that
were in the foreclosure process as of June 2013 according to foreclosure-
radar.com. As shown, foreclosures are not concentrated in any specific
neighborhoods.
Homes can be in various stages of foreclosure. Typically, the foreclosure
process begins with the issuance of a Notice of Default (NOD). An NOD
serves as an official notification to a borrower that he or she is behind in
their mortgage payments, and if the payments are not paid up, the lend-
er will seize the home. In California, lenders will not usually file an
NOD until a borrower is at least 90 days behind in making payments.
As of June 2013, 18 properties in Walnut were in this pre-foreclosure
stage.
Once an NOD has been filed, borrowers are given a specific time period,
typically three months, in which they can bring their mortgage payments
current. If payments are not made current at the end of this specified
time period, a Notice of Trustee Sale (NTS) will be prepared and pub-
lished in a newspaper. An NTS is a formal notification of the sale of a
foreclosure property. In California, the NTS is filed 90 days following an
NOD when a property owner has failed to make a property loan current.
Once an NTS has been filed, a property can then be sold at public auc-
tion. According to foreclosure records, 16 properties in Walnut were in
the auction stage of the foreclosure process.

3.2      Governmental Constraints
Actions by the City can have an impact on the price and availability of
housing in the City. Land use controls, site improvement requirements,
building codes, fees, and other local programs to improve the overall
quality of housing may serve as a constraint to housing development.
The following public policies can affect overall housing availability, ade-
quacy, and affordability.
3.2.1 Land Use Controls
The Land Use Element contains the primary policies that guide residen-
tial development in Walnut. These policies are implemented primarily
through the Zoning Code. The zoning requirements of the Code estab-
lish the amount and distribution of different land uses within Walnut,
while the subdivision ordinance regulates the division and improvement
of land.
The Zoning Code establishes the following designations that accommo-
date housing:
R-1 (One Family Residential) Zone
The R-1 Zone category is established to provide for residential areas to
be developed exclusively for one-family dwellings. Additional uses,
necessary and incidental to single-family development, are also permit-
ted. This zoning allows for a maximum of six units per acre. There are
various sub-categories in this zone that designate the required square
footage for each lot. These are: R-1 (7,200); R-1 (8500); R-1 (10,000); R-1
(15,000); R-1 (20,000); R-1 (30,000); and R-1 (40,000).
R-2 (Limited Multiple Residential) Zone
An R-2 zone is intended for one or more family dwelling units on lots
with a minimum area of 8,000 square feet. This zone allows for 10.89
dwelling units per acre.
R-3 (Multiple Family Residential) Zone
An R-3 zone is intended to provide for the development of multiple fam-
ily dwellings, apartment houses, group houses and other similar build-
ings. This zone allows for 14.5 units per acre.
                                                                        39
C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
Residential Planned Development Zone (RPD)
The intent and purpose of a Residential Planned Development Zone is
to:
       Promote the achievement of residential land use amenities than
            could otherwise be obtained under conventional development;
       Achieve greater design flexibility of residential acreage than
            could otherwise be possible through the application of conven-
            tional residential zone regulations;
       Encourage well planned developments through creative and im-
            aginative planning principles, practice and techniques;
       Reserve a greater proportion of open space land for recreation,
            conservation, parking and other similar uses than is otherwise
            required by conventional residential zone regulations;
       Provide for a more efficient, appropriate and desirable use of
            land which is sufficiently unique in its physical characteristics
            and other circumstances to warrant special methods of devel-
            opment; and
       Provide areas of natural scenic beauty, vistas, land marks, and
            promontories and other environmental features through inte-
            grated land planning, design and unified control of physical de-
            velopment patterns.
Zone C-1 (Light Commercial) Zone
Zone C-1 is established to provide for restricted neighborhood retail
commercial and residential needs. Business and professional offices and
limited retail stores and single-family residences are permitted. Provi-
sions are included to allow public educational institutions and the estab-
lishment of necessary public service facilities. The standards of devel-
opment in Zone C-1 are designed to protect adjacent zones, promote or-
derly development and avoid the creation of traffic congestion within the
neighborhood. This zone allows for up to six residential units per acre.
Table 21 summarizes the General Plan residential land use designations
and implementing residential zones.

3.2.2 Mixed Use Overlay Zones
In October 2013, the City adopted three Mixed Use Overlays that made it
possible for residential units to be developed in some of the City’s com-
mercial zones.
Mixed Use/Housing Opportunity Overlay (MU/HOO-1)
MU/HOO-1 applies to parcels identified within Site #1 (West Walnut) of
the Residential Sites Inventory (Table 27) shown later. This Overlay al-
lows for the development of housing up to 36 dwelling units per acre.
Mixed Use/Housing Opportunity Overlay (MU/HOO-2)
MU/HOO-2 applies to parcels identified within Site #2 (20931 Valley
Boulevard) of the Residential Sites Inventory (Table 27). This Overlay
allows for the development of housing up to 28 dwelling units per acre.
In addition, the Overlay restricts commercial development to a maxi-
mum of 20 percent of the total area covered by the MU/HOO-2.
Mixed Use/Housing Opportunity Overlay (MU/HOO-3)
                                                                            41

MU/HOO-3 applies to parcels identified within Site #3 (22059 Valley
Boulevard) of the Residential Sites Inventory (Table 27). This Overlay
allows for the development of housing up to 36 dwelling units per acre.
3.2.3 Residential Development Standards
Residential development standards established in the Zoning Code are
designed to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare
of residents, as well as implement the policies of the General Plan. These
standards also help preserve the character and integrity of existing
neighborhoods. The development standards summarized below and in
Table 23 can have an effect on the ability of property owners to construct
and maintain housing. Each of the standards is examined and its impact
on housing within Walnut discussed.
Development standards for the mixed use overlays will be developed as
specific plans are developed. The City will consult with residents and
the development community to ensure that appropriate standards are in
place to facilitate mixed use developments and minimize impacts on sur-
rounding neighborhoods.
Residential Density
The Walnut General Plan allows for base residential densities ranging
from less than one dwelling unit per acre up to 14.5 dwelling units per
acre.
Walnut has historically developed as a low-density single-family com-
munity primarily because of the area's severe environmental constraints.
A substantial portion of the City contains hillsides in excess of 25 per-
cent, permitting development in only portions of the community. De-
velopment on such severely sloped parcels requires substantial modifica-
tions to the natural terrain which significantly adds to the cost of devel-
opment. These areas are also subject to slope instability and landslide
hazards. Other constraints to development include earthquake related
hazards, such as groundshaking, lurching and liquefaction that are of
particular concern because of the close proximity of the San Jose earth-
quake fault.
As a result, the City is primarily built out with 96 percent of the residen-
tial units as single-family homes, and most in excellent condition. Given
the City’s market conditions (highest median price among neighboring
communities), opportunity for recycling of good quality single-family
homes into multi-family housing is limited. The City facilitates afforda-
ble housing development through its Specific Plan provisions (discussed
later).

2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
Lot Size and Area
The Zoning Code establishes minimum lot areas for single-family resi-
dentially zoned properties. The minimum lot area varies from 7,200
square feet in the R-1(7,200) to 40,000 square feet in the R-1 (40,000) Dis-
trict. Minimum lot dimensions range from 50 to 70 feet in width and 100
to 120 feet in depth, depending on the minimum lot size. These mini-
mum dimensions are similar to those of many neighboring communities
and do not pose a constraint to housing development.
Yards and Setbacks
For residences under 4,500 square feet of living area, minimum front
yard setback requirements are 20 feet to living area and 25 feet to a gar-
age. Minimum side yard setbacks are 5 feet one side and 12 feet on the
other side. The minimum rear yard setbacks are 15 feet to the first floor
and 25 feet to the second floor. These setback requirements are similar to
those of many neighboring communities and do not pose a constraint to
housing development.
Lot Coverage
The City imposes reasonable limits on building coverage. Structures and
parking may occupy up to 50 percent of the lot in the R-2 zone and up to
60 percent in the R-3 zone, which would permit sufficient square footage
to facilitate construction of a range of variously sized apartment units up
to the maximum allowable densities. Lot coverage requirements within
single-family districts allow structures to occupy up to 40 percent of the
lot.
Minimum Floor Area
Minimum floor area requirements are maintained within multiple family
and some single-family residential zone districts. Within the multi-
family districts, a minimum of 550 square feet for studio and 650 square
feet for one-bedroom units is required. These minimum floor area re-
quirements are necessary to maintain health and safety standards and do
not constrain the ability of projects to achieve the maximum densities of
these districts. Within the R1 districts, the minimum floor area is 1,500 to
1,700 square feet.
Building Height
Land use regulations establish a height limit of two stories or 35 feet in
all zones. The 108-unit Walnut Grove senior project at 18 units per acre
and the 86-unit Francesca senior project at 26.6 units per acre (average
density) are all accommodated within the City’s two-story building
                                                                         43

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T

height. Therefore, this height limit is able to accommodate higher densi-
ty development through the Specific Plan process.
Parking
The City of Walnut amended the Municipal Code in September 2012 to
establish off-street parking requirements for single-family dwellings that
better reflected the needs of the community. The newly adopted parking
standards are summarized below in Table 22:
Parking requirements for multiple-family dwellings are 2.5 spaces per
unit. However, through the Specific Plan process, the City could consid-
er alternative parking requirements to facilitate affordable housing de-
velopment provided parking demand could be accommodated. For ex-
ample, the Walnut Grove Condominiums include 1.5 parking spaces per
unit (one garage space and 0.5 open). The Francesca Mixed Use Specific
Plan provides for two spaces per unit in a semi-subterranean garage.
These reduced parking standards were achieved through the Specific
Plan process.

                   Density Bonus
                   Developers of affordable housing are entitled to a density bonus and/or
                   equivalent concessions or incentives under certain conditions. Senate
                   Bill 1818, which went into effect January 1, 2005, significantly reduces the
                   percentage of affordable units that a developer must provide in order to
                   receive a density bonus, and requires up to three concessions, depending
                   upon the percentage of affordable units in the development. Under the
                   new law, the maximum density bonus a developer can receive is 35 per-
                   cent when a project provides either 10 percent of the units for very-low-
                   income households, 20 percent for low-income households, or 40 percent
                   for moderate-income households. The legislation also imposes new
                   statewide parking standards and density incentives for developers that
                   donate land for affordable housing. In 2013, the City amended the Zon-
                   ing Code to establish density bonus provisions consistent with state law.

3.2.4 Specific Plan Provisions for Affordable Housing
In 1999, the City undertook an analysis of potential sites suitable for de-
velopment with affordable housing in part to address the former Im-
provement Agency’s outstanding affordable housing obligations. The
majority of the remaining vacant residential areas were (and still are)
smaller infill lots, with the most significant vacant properties in areas
designated for commercial use. The City did not want to simply rezone
certain commercial properties to allow for housing projects without an
affordable housing component. Therefore, in October 1999, the City
Council amended the Land Use Element to allow an option to process a
Specific Plan in the commercial zones provided at least 25 percent of the
units are made affordable to special needs populations. Targeted special
needs groups include seniors, first-time home buyers, and low and mod-
erate income renters:
           Senior - Detached (Affordable and Market Rate);
           Senior - Attached (Affordable and Market Rate);
           Detached Residential including an affordable component;
           Attached Residential including an affordable component; and
           Assisted Living, Skilled Nursing, Congregate Care and other
            similar facilities.
The Specific Plan process involves an applicant putting together a con-
cept master plan with a proposed density. Due to significant topograph-
ical constraints and high land costs around the City, the Specific Plan
process was left flexible in order to reach densities that would generate
the economies necessary to make housing affordable. The Specific Plan
process provides complete flexibility for establishing the allowed density
and development standards for the residential project separate from the
Zoning Code. The Francesca Mixed-Use, Snow Creek Village, and Wal-
nut Grove Specific Plans demonstrate that the Specific Plan process is
effective in producing affordable units, reducing minimum lot sizes, in-
creasing density, and reducing standards such as parking and setback
requirements without the requirement for a variance. For example, on
the Walnut Grove project, the Specific Plan process enabled the City to
provide reduced parking (1.5 spaces per unit), reduced setbacks (15 feet),
and higher densities (18 units per acre) than that achievable through the
R-3 zoning designation. In addition, 100 percent of the units (108) were
made available to affordable households.
The applicant can request to negotiate if the City’s Housing Authority, as
a successor agency to the former Improvement Agency, will enter into an
Owner Participation Agreement (OPA) to assist financially.
                                                                        47

                             3.2.5 Provisions for a Variety of Housing Types
                             The Zoning Code stipulates the residential types permitted, conditional-
                             ly permitted, or prohibited in each zone allowing residential uses. Resi-
                             dential types in Walnut include single-family dwellings, second dwelling
                             units, manufactured housing, residential care facilities, multi-family

                             Single-Family Dwellings
                             Detached, single-family dwelling units are permitted in the R-1, RPD, R-
                             2, and C-1 districts. This provision allows the development of small-lot
                             single-family homes that fall within the density range of the multiple-
                             family districts but offers a product type that may be more compatible
                             with surrounding uses.
                             Condominiums/Townhomes
                             Condominiums and townhomes are permitted by right in the R-2 and R-
                             3 districts, subject to meeting density requirements.

Apartments
Apartment units are permitted by right in the R-2 and R-3 districts where
multi-family housing is intended.
Accessory Housing (Second Units/Guest Houses)
The passage of AB 1866 (effective July 2003) requires cities to use a min-
isterial process to consider second units in effort to facilitate the produc-
tion of affordable housing state-wide. Walnut amended its Accessory
Housing Ordinance in October 2004 to make second units a permitted
use in all residential zoning districts except for the C-1 district. The City
of Walnut Zoning Code establishes specific use restrictions for second
units. These use restrictions are consistent with State law and include:
           One or two adults of minimum age 60;
           Persons who are court-appointed conservatees of a resident of
            the primary unit;
           Persons who are in home health care providers to one of the
            primary residents;
           Persons who are members of a very low-income household as
            specified in Section 50105 of the Health and Safety Code; or
           Persons who are disabled as specified in the Americans with
            Disabilities Act (ADA).
In addition, the City has established the following development stand-
ards for second units, consistent with State law:
           Minimum Lot Size: The minimum lot area required for the es-
            tablishment of a second unit shall be at least 15,000 square feet.
           Minimum Primary Residence Size: A legal, permitted primary
            residence that is at least 2,500 square feet in size, including the
            garage, shall be located on the lot. Any illegal conditions shall
            be corrected to the satisfaction of the city prior to the occupancy
            of any second unit.
           Setbacks and Lot Coverage: Second units shall conform to all
            applicable setback and lot coverage standards for the zoning dis-
            trict in which they are located. If the construction results in a to-
            tal of more than 4,500 square feet of living area on the property,
            the entire site shall be required to conform to the additional de-
            velopment standards for larger homes.
           Height: Second units shall not exceed the height of the primary
            residence.
                                                                             49

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           Size: Second units shall be a minimum of 500 square feet and
            shall not exceed 800 square feet in size.
           Attached/Detached: Second units shall be attached to the prima-
            ry residence.
           Location: Second units shall not be located in the areas from the
            lot line(s) abutting a street to a line parallel with the primary res-
            idence.
           Parking and Site Access: One additional garage parking space
            above the minimum requirement. The property must have direct
            vehicular access to and frontage upon an improved public street.
            No additional driveway approaches may be constructed for sec-
            ond units.
           Utilities: The property must have adequate water and sewer fa-
            cilities. No second unit shall be allowed on a property that is not
            connected to the public sewer system.
While second units represent a housing option for extended family
members, many households in Walnut have elected to expand the pri-
mary homes with additional bedrooms/suites on the first floor to ac-
commodate large families or extended family members.
Manufactured Housing
Manufactured homes meeting national standards and installed on a
foundation system pursuant to the California Health and Safety Code on
individual lots are treated as a standard single-family residential devel-
opment. No additional standards are required for approval or construc-
tion of units.
Mobile Home Parks
Mobile home parks are conditionally permitted in the R-1, RPD, and R-2
districts pursuant to requirements established in the Zoning Code for
this type of housing. The development standards for mobile home parks
are consistent with the health and safety needs of Walnut residents and
surrounding developments, and are not overly burdensome or restric-
tive. These restrictions are not considered a constraint to the develop-
ment of mobile home parks.

Residential Care Facilities
Residential care facilities serving six or fewer persons are considered a
regular residential use and are permitted in all residential districts pur-
suant to State Health and Safety Code and State Welfare and Institutions
Code.
Residential care facilities serving more than six persons are conditionally
permitted in the R-3, C-1, C-3, and C-P districts as “rest homes.” Rest
homes are defined in the Walnut Zoning Code as, “premises used for the
housing of and caring for more than six individuals who are aged, infirm
or ambulatory. There shall be only incidental convalescent care not in-
volving either trained nurse or physician residing on the premises. There
shall be no surgery, physical therapy, or other similar activities such as
are customarily provided in sanitariums and hospitals.” No unique dis-
tance requirements between facilities or other sensitive uses have been
established in the Zoning Code.
Transitional and Supportive Housing
Pursuant to SB 2 signed into law in October 2007, the City must address
housing for extremely low income households, such as transitional and
supportive housing.
In October 2013, the City amended the Zoning Code to add the following
definition of transitional housing: “Buildings configured as rental
apartment developments, that operate under program requirements
which call for the termination of assistance and recirculation of the as-
sisted unit to another eligible program recipient at some predetermined
future point in time, which shall be no less than six months, and no more
than two years. Appropriate sites for the transitional housing develop-
ment should include those close to public services and facilities includ-
ing transportation. Transitional Housing that is provided in single-, two-,
or multi-family dwelling units, group residential, residential care facili-
ties, or boarding house uses shall be permitted, conditionally permitted
or prohibited in the same manner as the other single-, two-, or multi-
family dwelling units, group residential, residential care facilities, or
boarding house uses under this code.”
The City also added the following definition of supportive housing:
“Housing with no limit on length of stay, that is occupied by the target
population, and that is linked to onsite or offsite services that assist the
supportive housing resident in retaining the housing, improving his or
her health status, and maximizing his or her ability to live and, when
possible, work in the community. Supportive Housing that is provided
in single-, two-, or multi-family dwelling units, group residential, resi-
                                                                         51

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
dential care facilities, or boarding house uses shall be permitted, condi-
tionally permitted or prohibited in the same manner as the other single-,
two-, or multi-family dwelling units, group residential, residential care
facilities, or boarding house uses under this code.”
Emergency Shelters
Pursuant to SB 2, the City must address the provision for emergency
shelters. Specifically, the City must identify a zoning district where
emergency shelters are permitted by right (i.e. without a discretionary
approval process). In October 2013, the City amended the Zoning Code
to permit emergency shelters in the M-1 zone. There are approximately
115 parcels (about 133 acres) within the City of Walnut zoned M-1. This
capacity is more than sufficient for accommodating the City’s homeless
population (estimated at less than ten). The amendment also established
the following operational and development standards for emergency
shelters:
           Number of Beds. An emergency shelter shall contain a maxi-
            mum of 50 beds.
           Hours of Operation. Emergency shelter operations are limited
            to the evening hours and shall open not earlier than 5:00 pm and
            close not later than 8 a.m. daily. All clientele shall vacate the
            premises upon closing. There shall be no in-and-out privileges
            for clientele using the shelter between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
           Floor Area per Occupant. The minimum floor area per occupant
            shall be at least 150 square feet and the maximum number of oc-
            cupants to be served at any given time shall not exceed 50.
           Interior Waiting Area. Interior onsite waiting and client intake
            area shall be a minimum of 200 square feet, including seating for
            25 clients at any one time.
           Exterior Waiting Area. A covered exterior onsite waiting area
            shall be provided, at a minimum of 100 square feet for seating
            for 50 clients at any one time, to protect clients from the ele-
            ments.
           Separation between Shelters. An emergency shelter shall be no
            closer than 300 feet from another emergency shelter, as meas-
            ured from the nearest property line.
           External Lighting. Adequate external lighting shall be provided
            for security purposes. The lighting shall be stationary and di-
            rected away from adjacent properties and public-rights-of-way.
           Parking. Off-street parking requirements shall be provided at a
            ratio of one space per 1,000 square-feet of gross floor area, or one
            space for each employee on the largest shift plus one space for
52

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T

            each agency vehicle plus three visitor spaces, whichever is great-
            er. All parking is required to be off-street and on-site.
           ADA Access. The shelter shall be compliant with the Americans
            with Disabilities Act.
           Amenities. The facility may include central cooking and dining
            areas, laundry area, recreation rooms, counseling centers, child
            care facilities, play areas, bike racks, and other support services
            for the exclusive use of the residents and staff.
           Annual Report. The operator of the facility shall provide, at the
            City’s request, an annual report of the use of the facility and de-
            termination of compliance with the City’s development stand-
            ards for the use.
           Deliveries. Deliveries of goods to the shelter shall only be made
            between 5:00 p.m. and 10 p.m.
           Noise or Lighting. The facility shall not generate noise or light-
            ing at levels adversely affecting surrounding properties.
Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
SROs are one of the most traditional forms of affordable private housing
for lower- income individuals, seniors, and persons with disabilities. An
SRO unit is usually small, between 80 and 250 square feet. These units
provide a valuable source of affordable housing.
In October 2013, the City amended the Zoning Code to allow SRO units
in the M-1 zone, subject to a Conditional Use Permit. The amendment
also established the following operational and development standards
for SRO housing:
           SRO Size Requirements. SRO units shall have a minimum size
            of 150 square-feet and a maximum of 400 square-feet.
           Occupancy. Each SRO unit shall accommodate a maximum of
            two-persons.
           Lighting. Exterior lighting shall be provided for the entire out-
            door and parking area of the property per the lighting standards
            of the Walnut Municipal Code.
           Laundry Facilities. Laundry facilities must be provided in a
            separate enclosed room at the ratio of one washer one dryer for
            every twenty units of fractional number thereof, with at least one
            washer and dryer per floor.
           Cleaning Supply Room. A cleaning supply room or utility clos-
            et with a wash tub with hot and cold running water shall be
            provided on each floor of the SRO unit facility.
           Lavatory. Each unit is required to provide a separate bathroom
            containing a water closet, lavatory, and bathtub or shower.
                                                                            53

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           Minimum Kitchen Requirements. Each unit shall be provided
            with a kitchen sink, functioning cooking appliance, a refrigera-
            tor, and each having a clear working space of not less than 30
            inches in front.
           Building Code Requirements. SRO units shall comply with all
            requirements of the California Building Code. All units shall
            comply with all applicable accessibility and adaptability re-
            quirements. All common areas shall be fully accessible. .
           On/Off Site Management. A SRO unit project with 10 or more
            units shall provide on-site management. A project with less than
            10 units may provide management off-site.
           Tenancy. Tenancy of SRO units shall not be less than 30 days
            and a maximum period of 12 months.
           Parking. A SRO unit project shall comply with all parking re-
            quirements of the Walnut Municipal Code and at a minimum
            shall have the following:
                 o One (1) uncovered parking space for every three (3) SRO
                     units.
                 o Two (2) uncovered parking spaces for an on-site manag-
                     er unit.
                 o Each SRO unit shall be provided at least one (1) lockable
                     bicycle parking space in a location that is adjacent to that
                     SRO unit.
Employee Housing
Pursuant to State Employee Housing Act, employee housing for six or
fewer employees are to be treated as a single-family structure and per-
mitted in the same manner as other dwellings of the same type in the
same zone. The City’s Zoning Code does not address employee housing
and will be amended to comply with State law.
3.2.6 Housing for Persons with Disabilities
Housing options for persons with disabilities are often limited. The
Americans with Disability Act (ADA) came into effect in 1990. Multi-
family housing built prior to 1990 does not typically include accessible
units on the ground floor. With limited rental housing construction in
the City, few rental housing units in Walnut are accessible. ADA also
does not cover single-family homes. Rehabilitation to accommodate the
accessibility needs of disabled residents is needed, particularly to the
older single-family housing stock.
Pursuant to SB 520, the Housing Element must evaluate the City’s codes,
policies, and regulations to ensure that they are free of constraints to the
development and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities.

Definition of Family
Local governments may restrict access to housing for households failing
to qualify as a “family” by the definition specified in the Zoning Code.
Specifically, a restrictive definition of “family” that limits the number of
and differentiates between related and unrelated individuals living to-
gether may illegally limit the development and siting of group homes for
persons with disabilities but not for housing families that are similarly
sized or situated.4
In October 2013, the City amended its definition of “family.” A “family”
is now defined as “any group of individuals living together as the
functional equivalent of a family. A family includes, for example, the
residents of residential care facilities and group homes for people with
disabilities. A family does not include larger institutional group living
situations such as dormitories, fraternities, sororities, monasteries or
nunneries.” This definition of family is not considered restrictive and
does not constrain the development of housing in any way.
Land Use Control
Pursuant to State law, Walnut permits state-licensed residential care fa-
cilities serving six or fewer persons in all of its residential zoning dis-
tricts by right. State-licensed residential care facilities serving seven or
more persons are conditionally permitted in the R-3, C-1, C-3, and C-P
districts. The procedural and substantive requirements for residential
care facilities are no more stringent than those for other conditional uses.
The City has not adopted a local requirement for proximity between two
special needs housing sites. The requirements of Health and Safety
Code, Section 1520.5 are enforced by the State Department of Social Ser-
vices, Health and Human Services Agency. The law requires that resi-
dential facilities be separated by a minimum of 300 feet to avoid over-
4     California court cases (City of Santa Barbara v. Adamson, 1980 and City of
      Chula Vista v. Pagard, 1981, etc.) have ruled an ordinance as invalid if it de-
      fines a “family” as (a) an individual; (b) two or more persons related by
      blood, marriage, or adoption; or (c) a group of not more than a specific
      number of unrelated persons as a single housekeeping unit. These cases
      have explained that defining a family in a manner that distinguishes be-
      tween blood-related and non-blood related individuals does not serve any
      legitimate or useful objective or purpose recognized under the zoning and
      land use planning powers of a municipality, and therefore violates rights of
      privacy under the California Constitution.
                                                                                 55

concentration. The City has a total of 16 residential care facilities, includ-
ing:
           Six adult residential facilities ranging in capacity from five to six
            persons
           One group home for six children/teenagers
           One small family home for two children with disabilities
           Eight residential care facilities for the elderly with a total capaci-
            ty of 159 persons
The City has no special zoning or land use restrictions that regulate the
siting of housing for persons with disabilities.
Building Codes
Building procedures within the City are required to conform to the In-
ternational Building Code, as adopted in the City's Municipal Code.
Standards within the Code include provisions to ensure accessibility for
persons with disabilities. These standards are consistent with the Amer-
icans with Disabilities Act. No local amendments that would constrain
accessibility or increase the cost of housing for persons with disabilities
have been adopted.
Reasonable Accommodation Procedures
Reasonable accommodation refers to flexibility in standards and policies
to accommodate the needs of persons with disabilities. The City’s build-
ing codes, as well as approach to code enforcement, allow for special
provisions that meet the needs of persons with disabilities.
Accessory uses such as wheelchair ramps are permitted within all resi-
dential zones as incidental structures related to the residence. Most rea-
sonable accommodation requests to increase accessibility of existing
properties are handled through the building permit process.
The City’s Building Official has the administrative authority to grant an
exception to regulations related to accessibility or adaptability when
such regulations create a hardship and equivalent provisions are provid-
ed. As part of the building permit application, an applicant can request
reasonable accommodation to the Building Code. The Building Official
will act upon the request. No formal hearing process before any board is
required.
In September 2013, the City amended the Zoning Code to provide a for-
mal reasonable accommodation procedure for the application of zoning
and development standards. For example, it may be a reasonable re-
56

quest to waiver the setback or encroachment requirement, or the oak tree
removal permit procedure in order to accommodate the timely construc-
tion of a handicap ramp. To accommodate a ground floor master suite
for a disabled family member, a homeowner may request an increase in
the maximum lot coverage. No fees are required for the application for
reasonable accommodation.
3.2.7 Site Improvements
Site improvements and property dedications are important components
of new development. These include:
           Reservation of sites for parks, recreation facilities, fire stations,
            libraries, or other public uses.
           Dedication for streets, highways, alleys, access rights, bikeways,
            walkways, equestrian trails, rights-of-way for drainage and ero-
            sion control facilities, open space and other public easements,
            and public utility easements.
Improvements required of new subdivisions include:
           Arterial highways and collector streets constructed according to
            the roadway classification identified in the Circulation Element
            of the General Plan. Local streets and alleys constructed as
            shown on an approved tentative map and/or as required by the
            tentative map conditions of approval.
           Each unit or lot within the subdivision served by a domestic wa-
            ter system and a sanitary sewer system approved by the City
            Engineer.
           Storm drain system designed for the subdivision and its water-
            shed, capable of collecting and conveying runoff according to
            the standards of the Los Angeles County Flood Control District.
           All utility lines to serve the subdivision, such as electric, com-
            munications, street lighting, cable television, and similar lines
            are required to be installed underground.
3.2.8 Development and Planning Fees
Development impact fees offset the costs of improvements serving the
development. Planning and processing fees cover administrative review
of the development by City Planning, Building, and Engineering de-
partments. The City's fee schedule is based on anticipated costs associat-
                                                                              57

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
ed with review and approval of proposed projects. Walnut’s planning
and development fee schedule for residential projects is summarized in
Table 25.
In terms of impact fees, the City has adopted in lieu fees for parkland
dedication. These fees apply to subdivisions that do not provide park-
land as part of the development. The fees do not apply to apartments.
The amount of the fee is calculated based on the value of the land pre-
scribed by the parkland dedication requirements allowed by the State
Subdivision Map Act. The only other impact fee that the City has adopt-
ed is the New Development Tax, which is $300 per new residence to be
used for open space, median, landscape parkway and trail maintenance
or improvements.
Overall, site plan and architectural review fees total approximately
$1,046 per single-family unit. For projects with more than one single-
family residence, including multi-family and mixed use developments,
the $1,046 fee is increased an additional $36 per lot and $135 per build-
ing. Plan check and permit fees are roughly the same and are based on a
set table that is computed using the building area and the valuation of
construction. The City has had only one application for a multi-family
project submitted in the last five years—the Francesca Senior Project.
Using the City’s current fee schedule, total fees (including both planning
and building permit fees) for this project would have been approximate-
ly $1,250 per unit. Fees charged by the City are reasonable and, based on
the Francesca Senior Project and past single-family projects, comprise
less than two percent of total development costs.
Furthermore, after reviewing the planning fees charged by neighboring
jurisdictions (Table 26), fees assessed by the City are some of the lowest
in the region and are not a constraint to housing development. Never-
theless, such fees add to the costs of housing development. The City has
the authority to waive planning, building, and other fees, and/or offer
expedited or priority processing for developments that provide afforda-
ble units.

3.2.9 Building Codes and Enforcement
The City adopted and enforces the International Building Code which
ensures that all housing units are built to specified standards. The code
is substantially determined by the International Conference of Building
Officials and the State of California. Code enforcement is implemented
on a complaint basis.
3.2.10 Processing and Permit Procedure
Development review and permit processing are necessary steps to en-
sure that residential construction proceeds in an orderly manner. How-
ever, the time and cost of permit processing and review can be a con-
straint to housing development if they place an undue burden on the
developer.
In Walnut, the review process takes approximately six to eight weeks for
a typical single-family project and three to four months for a typical mul-
ti-family project. Residential uses are permitted by right in residential
zones. However site plan and architectural reviews are required for all
new residential development.
Pre-Application/Application Review
As an option, the City offers pre-application conference and preliminary
Planning Commission reviews to help identify and address potential
issues. A 30-day staff review of an application for completeness and
compliance with zoning and development standards is required for all
applications.
Environmental Review
Individual single-family homes are generally exempt from environmen-
tal review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act. Other
residential projects are subject to varying levels of environmental clear-
ance depending on potential impacts. However, the environmental doc-
umentation can be considered concurrently with the land use or architec-
tural review hearing.
Land Use Review
City staff generally reviews site plan/architectural review projects for
room additions that are less than 50%, or 2,000 square feet in living area.
All other site plan/architectural review projects may be approved by the
Planning Commission. Conditional use permits, variances and subdivi-
sions require a public hearing and may be approved by the Planning
Commission. Approval times for the above applications vary from 30 to
90 days. General Plan Amendments, Zone Changes, and Specific Plans
require a public hearing and recommendation to the City Council by the
60
C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
Planning Commission and a public hearing and action by the City Coun-
cil. These approvals often require six to 12 months to complete.
Conditional Use Permit
Certain uses in the City require the approval of a Conditional Use Permit
(CUP). The principal objective of the CUP process is to provide for the
proper location of various types of land use. The reasons for requiring
such special consideration involving, among other things:
           Size of the area required for the full development of such uses;
           Nature of the traffic problems incidental to their operation;
            and/or
           Effect which such uses may have on adjoining land uses and on
            the growth or development of the community as a whole.
The Planning Commission, when reviewing an application for a CUP,
may grant the CUP if the use is found:
           Necessary or desirable for the development of the community;
           In harmony with the various elements or objectives of the Zon-
            ing Code; and
           Not detrimental to the existing uses or the uses specifically per-
            mitted in the zone.
In granting a CUP, the Planning Commission may impose conditions
determined to be necessary to safeguard and protect the public health,
safety and general welfare, and to mitigate or eliminate adverse impacts
on surrounding properties, residents or businesses.
Site Plan and Architectural Review Process
The City’s site plan architectural review process is applicable to all new
development in the City. The intent is to ensure new development is
properly designed, is a positive addition to the City’s physical environ-
ment, enhances Walnut’s cultural heritage, and has given consideration
to energy conservation. Since 2005, approximately 50 percent of the site
plan and architectural review applications submitted were for room ad-
ditions and approximately 5 percent of the applications were for new
residences. The remaining applications include commercial signs, new
non-residential, new multi-family residential and other miscellaneous
projects such as retaining walls and grading on private property.
The following criteria are used for all projects reviewed by the Planning
Commission (per the Walnut Zoning Code Section 25-248):
                                                                           61

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           The application should implement the goals and objectives of the
            General Plan to provide an attractive, high quality, residential
            environment with a rural character. Industrial, agricultural and
            commercial land uses should meet high quality development
            standards. To the extent possible, development should minimize
            alteration of the natural terrain.
           Applications should be reasonably compatible with surrounding
            buildings and uses in terms of use, function, size, shape, mass,
            scale, building materials, colors, facade articulation, and roof
            style and pitch.
           Vertical and horizontal articulation of building facades should
            be used to avoid long, uninterrupted exterior walls on all struc-
            tures. All structure walls should have relief (variance in vertical
            and horizontal planes) to create an interesting blend with land-
            scaping, building and the casting of shadows. The integration of
            varied texture, relief, and soften accents on building walls
            should be used to soften undesirable planar effects, and enhance
            the architecture.
           Roof lines should be reasonably compatible with the design and
            scale of surrounding structures. Vertical and horizontal roof ar-
            ticulation is encouraged to avoid monotonous, long, flat sections
            of roof.
           Building designs should be varied in tract developments to cre-
            ate variety and interest. A significant difference in the massing,
            composition, architectural style, building orientation, facade ar-
            ticulation and architectural style of each adjacent house should
            be achieved.
           Structural form, scale and mass should relate to the use of sur-
            rounding structures. The scale and mass should be within a hu-
            man scale so as not to overwhelm or dominate the lot or builda-
            ble pad area on which the structure is placed, the natural topog-
            raphy, or surrounding uses or structures.
           Colors should be reasonably compatible among various architec-
            tural design elements within the same structure and among ad-
            jacent structures. Color coordination is not required, but stark
            divergence of colors which is displeasing to the senses should be
            avoided.
           High quality materials, textures and construction should be
            used. Materials should be consistently applied and should be
            chosen to work harmoniously with materials and textures on
            surrounding structures. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent
            changes in materials and textures should be avoided.
           Any equipment, whether on the side of the building, on the
            ground, or on the roof, must be screened. The method of screen-
62

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
            ing must be architecturally compatible in terms of materials, col-
            or, shape and size. The screening design should blend with the
            building design.
           To the extent reasonably possible, viewshed should be protected
            from both public and private property. Viewshed includes the
            blockage of existing views and the creation of undesirable views
            such as unscreened roof equipment, unbroken roof lines, towers,
            poles, or flat wall surfaces.
           Landscaping should be used to assist the screening of service,
            loading and parking areas from public right-of-way and adjacent
            properties.
           Landscaping should promote proper vehicular and pedestrian
            circulation, creating a safe and pleasant environment.
           Landscaping should take into consideration local topographic
            and climate restrictions and proper irrigation, drainage and
            maintenance.
           Landscaping should be reasonably compatible with the character
            of adjacent landscaping, provided that the existing adjacent
            landscaping meets the above standards.
           The application shall not adversely affect the health, peace, com-
            fort or welfare of persons residing or working in the surround-
            ing area.
           The application shall not be materially detrimental to the use,
            enjoyment or valuation of property or other persons located in
            the vicinity of the application.
           The application shall not jeopardize, endanger or otherwise con-
            stitute a menace to the public health, safety or general welfare.
           The site of the proposed application shall be adequate in size to
            accommodate the yards, walls, fences, parking and loading facil-
            ities, landscaping and other development standards prescribed
            in this chapter, or otherwise required in order to integrate said
            use with the uses in the surrounding area.
           The site of the proposed application shall be adequately served
            by highways or streets of sufficient width and improved as nec-
            essary to carry the kind of traffic such use would generate.
These criteria were established to ensure quality development and the
health and safety of residents in the community. With these criteria, the
City works with the project applicants to craft developments that meet
the City’s housing needs and address community concerns. The 108-unit
senior project constructed during the last Housing Element cycle and the
Francesca project which is nearly ready for construction have both un-
dergone the same review criteria. As stated before, the Francesca project
density approaches 30 units per acre. As demonstrated, this process can
                                                                            63

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
be used as a vehicle to foster community acceptance to density and af-
fordable housing. Site plan and architectural review can occur concur-
rently with the land use review and therefore does not unnecessarily
lengthen the development review process.
Specific Plan
A Specific Plan is a regulatory plan authorized by Government Code
Section 65450 through 65457. It is one tool available to implement the
General Plan and carries the same weight as zoning. A Specific Plan al-
lows for the establishment of unique land uses and/or development
standards that may be more or less restrictive than the underlying zon-
ing designation.
As previously mentioned in Section 3.2.3, the City amended its Land Use
Element in 1999 to utilize the Specific Plan process to allow for residen-
tial uses in commercial areas provided that a minimum of 25 percent of
the units are made affordable. The City has successfully utilized the
Specific Plan process for three projects that have produced affordable
units, reduced setbacks and parking standards, and increased densities
that would have otherwise be allowed.
The Specific Plan has been processed concurrently with the site plan and
architectural review application to ensure efficient processing. One ad-
ditional public hearing is required by the City Council following the
Planning Commission action on the site plan/architectural application
which does not unnecessarily lengthen the development review process.
3.3      Environmental and Infrastructure Constraints
Environmental factors and a lack of necessary infrastructure or public
services can constrain residential development in a community by in-
creasing costs and reducing the amount of land suitable for housing.
3.3.1 Environmental Constraints
Hillsides
Walnut’s hillsides comprise a large portion of the land in the City. The
hillsides are an integral part of the community’s image and identity,
providing a stunning visual backdrop, an environmental sanctuary, and
a recreational resource. Preserving the hillsides represents an important
community goal. Policies relating to hillside development must balance
environmental protection, property rights, and community values.

Natural Hazards
Walnut is susceptible to many natural hazards, including wildland fires,
mudslides, and flooding. Other geological conditions of concern include
earthquake fault zones, liquefaction areas, landslide areas, and steeply
sloped hillsides, as these conditions present additional vulnerability to
the community. Development in areas with known hazards must ensure
that adequate precaution and mitigation are afforded to protect public
health and safety.
Restricted Use Open Space
There are areas of vacant land within the City that are designated as pri-
vate or public open space which cannot be developed. The use of these
areas is restricted due to environmental issues, land covenants, protec-
tion issues, and other factors.
3.3.2 Infrastructure and Public Service Constraints
Water Service
The Golden State Water, Suburban Water Systems, and Walnut Valley
Water District provide domestic water service to Walnut residents and
businesses. Due to the limited availability of local groundwater sources,
the District is primarily dependent on surface water imported from the
Colorado River and Northern California by the Metropolitan Water Dis-
trict of Southern California (MWD), the sole importer of water to this
area, through a wholesale member agency, Three Valleys Municipal Wa-
ter District (TVMWD). In 1955, the District, in concert with the City of
Pomona and the Rowland Water District constructed a joint pipeline
(Joint Water Line) for the purpose of delivering imported water to meet
the water supply needs of these communities. This pipeline varies in di-
ameter from 42 inches to 54 inches and transports potable water from
MWD's Weymouth Treatment Plant in La Verne and, when surplus wa-
ter is available, from TVMWD's Miramar Treatment Plant in Claremont
to the District's Edmund M. Biederman Terminal Storage Reservoir and
Hydroelectric Facilities in Walnut.
Based on communication with the local water districts, the City of Wal-
nut Engineering Division has indicated that there is sufficient water sup-
ply within the community for implementation of the proposed Mixed
Use Housing Opportunity Overlay (MUHOO-1, MUHOO-2, and
MUHOO-3); however, individual water supply studies and environmen-
tal assessments will be conducted for each specific plan that is proposed
for the Mixed Use Housing Opportunity Overlay.
                                                                       65
C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
Wastewater Service
Public wastewater lines, which exclude those connecting from private
properties, are maintained by the County of Los Angeles. Maintenance
of infrastructure in surrounding unincorporated areas also affects Wal-
nut. Unlike areas within the City limits, the county unincorporated areas
are not required to connect to a wastewater system but are facing tight-
ening discharge restrictions from Los Angeles County due to groundwa-
ter pollution concerns. These areas rely on septic tanks, which can con-
taminate groundwater supply. The City of Walnut requires annexation
in order to connect to the City’s wastewater system.
Future residential development on the three project sites could result in a
maximum of 1,594 residences. All three sited are within the sewer ser-
vice area of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District 21. Wastewater
generated by the proposed Mixed Use Housing Opportunity Overlay
would be conveyed to the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Facility
located in the City of Whittier. This facility processes 100 million gallons
of wastewater per day. Discharge from development on the proposed
project sites would total approximately 256,300 gallons per day. This
represents 0.25% of the capacity of the facility. Operational discharge
flows treated at the San Jose Creek Water Reclamation Facility would be
required to comply with waste discharge requirements (WDRs) identi-
fied for this facility by the Regional Water Quality Control Board
(RWQCB). Compliance with condition or permit requirements estab-
lished by the City as well as WDRs outlined by the RWQCB would en-
sure that wastewater discharges coming from the project site and treated
by the wastewater treatment facility system would not exceed applicable
RWQCB wastewater treatment requirements.

4. Housing Resources
The extent of housing needs in a community often far exceeds the re-
sources available. As a small city, the City of Walnut must utilize limited
resources in an efficient manner in order to address the current and pro-
jected housing needs of Walnut residents. This section of the Housing
Element provides an overview of resources available to the City.
4.1      Residential Development Potential
4.1.1 Regional Housing Needs Allocation
State Housing Element law requires that a local jurisdiction accommo-
date a share of the region’s projected housing needs for the planning pe-
riod. This share, called the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA),
is important because State law mandates that jurisdictions provide suffi-
cient land to accommodate a variety of housing opportunities for all eco-
nomic segments of the community. Compliance with this requirement is
measured by the jurisdiction’s ability in providing adequate land to ac-
commodate the RHNA.
The Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG), as the re-
gional planning agency, is responsible for allocating the RHNA to indi-
vidual jurisdictions within the six-county region.5 For the 2013-2021
Housing Element, the RHNA commences on January 1, 2014 through
October 31, 2021. The RHNA is distributed by income category. For the
2013 Housing Element update, the City of Walnut is allocated a RHNA
of 908 units as follows:
5     Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) covers a six-county
      region, including Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura,
      and Imperial.
                                                                            67

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           Extremely Low/Very Low Income (up to 50 percent of AMI): 246
            units (27.1 percent)6
           Low Income (51 to 80 percent of AMI): 144 units (15.9 percent)
           Moderate Income (81 to 120 percent of AMI): 155 units (17.1 per-
            cent)
           Above Moderate Income (more than 120 percent of AMI): 363
            units (40.0 percent)
The City must ensure the availability of residential sites at adequate den-
sities and appropriate development standards to accommodate these
units.
4.1.2 Pending and Approved Residential Projects
The City of Walnut has a number of recently approved and pending resi-
dential projects in the pipeline, none of which are expected to receive
building permits before January 1, 2014. Combined, these projects will
add a total of 91 units to the City’s housing stock, most of which will like-
ly be market rate.
Francesca Mixed Use Specific Plan
Originally conceived in 2008, this Plan proposes the development of 86
age-restricted senior residential condominiums and 3,810 square feet of
retail space on two properties totaling approximately 3.23 acres. The pro-
ject is being proposed on two unimproved parcels that are currently
zoned C-3. As of September 2013, the project is in plan check and build-
ing permits will not be issued until rough grading for the site is complet-
ed, which is unlikely to occur before January 1, 2014. The Specific Plan
calls for 25 percent of the total units to be affordable, but because the City
no longer has redevelopment set-aside funds to assist with this project,
the number of affordable units, if any, is still to be determined.
6     The City has a RHNA allocation of 246 very low income units (inclusive of
      extremely low income units). Pursuant to new State law (AB 2634), the City
      must project the number of extremely low income housing needs based on
      Census income distribution or assume 50 percent of the very low income
      units as extremely low. According to the CHAS data developed by HUD us-
      ing 2005-2009 Census data, the City had 8.3 percent very low income house-
      holds (5.2 percent extremely low income and 3.1 percent very low income)
      as shown in Table 8. Therefore the City’s RHNA of 246 very low income
      units may be split into 154 extremely low and 92 very low income units.
      However, for purposes of identifying adequate sites for the RHNA, State
      law does not mandate the separate accounting for the extremely low income
      category.

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
Second Units
The City has approved an application for the construction of one guest
house on Gartel Drive. Based on market rate rents for second
units/guesthouses in the City, this unit will likely be affordable to mod-
erate income households.
Single Family Residences
The City recently approved the construction of four single-family resi-
dences.
4.1.3 Residential Sites Inventory
In 2013, the City rezoned a number of properties in order to ensure that
adequate sites were available to meet the City of Walnut’s 2014-2021
RHNA. The rezoned properties will have a total capacity of 1,252 housing
units, the majority of which will be suitable for the development of hous-
ing affordable to lower-income households based on the allowed density.
Site #1: West Walnut
This site is located along the City’s West boundary and extends to the
Flood Control Channel just east of Bourdet Avenue. Approximately 26
single-family residences currently occupy the site, as well a number of
auto related uses. A portion of the site also contains currently vacant lots.
In 2013, the City adopted a General Plan Amendment changing the land
use designation of properties within this site from Commercial to Future
Specific Plan No. 2. The zoning on these properties remained C-1 and C-3,
but in 2013, the City also adopted an additional Mixed Use/Housing Op-
portunity Overlay (MU/HOO-1) for these parcels. The MU/HOO-1
Overlay allows for the development of lower- and moderate-income
housing up to 36 dwelling units per acre as well as all C-1 and C-3 permit-
ted uses.
The total site is approximately 21.4 acres; however, because the
MU/HOO-1 Overlay allows for mixed-use development, only one-half of
the total acreage is conservatively anticipated for residential development
(10.7 acres). Based on this assumption, Site #1 would yield approximately
308 units (assuming a realistic capacity of 80 percent of the maximum
density allowed in order to account for internal circulation, landscaping,
and parking/setback requirements). All of these units can be counted
toward the City’s lower income RHNA based on the allowable density of
the parcels.
                                                                         69

2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
Site #2: 20931 Valley Boulevard (Walnut Senior Housing, LLC)
This site is comprised of 10.2 acres located along Valley Boulevard east of
Pierre Avenue and west of Suzanne Road. Most of the properties compris-
ing this site are vacant lots; however, two of the parcels do contain some
commercial uses and a dental office.
In 2013, the City adopted a General Plan Amendment changing the land
use designation of properties within this site from Commercial and Gen-
eral Residential to Future Specific Plan No. 3. The zoning on these proper-
ties remained C-3, but in 2013, the City also adopted an additional Mixed
Use/Housing Opportunity Overlay (MU/HOO-2) for these parcels. The
MU/HOO-2 Overlay allows for the development of lower- and moderate-
income housing up to 28 dwelling units per acre. Commercial develop-
ment in the MU/HOO-2 Overlay is limited to 20 percent of the total area.
The total site is approximately 11.37 acres; however, because the
MU/HOO-2 Overlay allows for commercial development on 20 percent
of the total area, the residential acreage is estimated at 9.1 acres. Based on
this assumption, Site #2 would yield approximately 182 units (assuming a
realistic capacity of 80 percent of the maximum density allowed in order
to account for internal circulation, landscaping, and parking/setback re-
quirements). Based on the allowable density of these parcels, these 182
units can be counted toward the City’s moderate income RHNA.
Site #3: 22059 Valley Boulevard (Industrial Property)
This is comprised of a 49.2-acre industrial property located along Valley
Boulevard east of Grand Avenue and next to City Yard. This site is com-
prised entirely of vacant lots.
In 2013, the City adopted a General Plan Amendment changing the land
use designation of properties within this site from Hillside Single Family
Residential and Commercial to Future Specific Plan No. 4. The zoning on
these properties remained C-3 and RPD, but in 2013, the City also adopt-
ed an additional Mixed Use/Housing Opportunity Overlay (MU/HOO-
3) for these parcels. The MU/HOO-3 Overlay partitions the total site into
three areas:
           Area A encompasses approximately 8.0 acres and will allow for
            the development of low density residential units with a maxi-
            mum density of 2.2 units per acre.
           Area B encompasses approximately 26.0 acres and will allow for
            the development of high density residential units with a maxi-
            mum density of 36.0 units per acre.

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T
2 0 1 3 - 2 0 2 1 H O U S I N G E L E M E N T
           Area C encompasses approximately 15.0 acres and will be re-
            served for retail and commercial development
Based on the assumptions detailed above, Site #3 would yield approxi-
mately 762 units (assuming a realistic capacity of 80 percent of the maxi-
mum density allowed in order to account for internal circulation, land-
scaping, and parking/setback requirements). Based on the allowable
density of these parcels, most of these units (748 units) can be counted
toward the City’s lower income RHNA.
4.1.4 Adequacy of Sites Inventory
The City can realistically accommodate an additional 1,343 housing units
through recently approved/pending projects and its residential sites in-
ventory (Figure 5). This capacity is more than adequate to accommodate
the City’s 2014-2021 RHNA of 908 units (Table 27). While the City does
have a shortfall of sites for meeting its above moderate income RHNA,
the surplus of sites for lower and moderate income units more than
makes up for this deficit.

Availability of Infrastructure and Services
Infrastructure and public services are readily available on the parcels
identified in the residential sites inventory. Furthermore, based on the
City’s communications with water and sewer service providers, there is
sufficient water and sewer capacity to serve all of the sites identified by
the City in the inventory.
Site Constraints
The sites identified in this inventory are free of any major environmental
constraints that would limit residential development.

4.2      Financial Resources
4.2.1       Community Development Block Grant
As a small city, Walnut participates in the Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) program through the Urban County program ad-
ministered by the County of Los Angeles Community Development
Commission. The City anticipates receiving approximately $75,000 in
CDBG funds annually; however, this amount is highly variable. These
funds can be used for a variety of community projects, such as public
infrastructure improvements, social programs, and housing rehabilita-
tion programs. The City allocates CDBG funds annually for the opera-
tion of an owner-occupied Housing Rehabilitation Program for low in-
come households.
4.2.2       Housing Choice Vouchers (Section 8 Rental Assistance)
The Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program is a federal program
that provides rental assistance to very low-income persons in need of
affordable housing. The Housing Choice Voucher program offers a
voucher which pays the difference between the payment standard (an
exception to fair market rent) and what a tenant can afford to pay (e.g. 30
percent of their income). A voucher also allows a tenant to choose hous-
ing that may cost above the payment standard, with the tenant paying
the extra cost.
4.2.3 State Housing Funds
The State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
administers several housing programs:
           Affordable Housing Innovation Program – Golden State Ac-
            quisition Funds: Provides acquisition financing for the preserva-
            tion and development of affordable housing to developers that
            can demonstrate local support and leveraging capacity.
           Building Equity and Growth in Neighborhoods (BEGIN):
            Grants for cities and counties to adopt measures to encourage af-
            fordable housing, to make second mortgage loans to low and
            moderate income homebuyers.Housing Urban-Suburban-and
            Rural Parks: Grants for housing-related parks.
           Multi-Family Housing Program: Low interest loans for the de-
            velopment of affordable rental housing, supportive housing for
            persons with disabilities who are either homeless or at risk of be-
            coming homeless, and housing for homeless youth.

4.3      Administrative Resources
The following discussion describes active non-profit agencies that may
have the capacity to develop, acquire, and/or manage affordable hous-
ing, including housing projects that are at risk of converting to market-
rate housing.
Habitat for Humanity Greater Los Angeles Area: Since the organiza-
tion’s founding in 1990, HFH GLA has built and renovated more than
400 homes in the Los Angeles area. HFH GLA has been recognized as the
top-producing affiliate in California.
Jamboree Housing: Founded in 1990, Jamboree’s portfolio includes de-
velopment and/or ownership interest of nearly 6,600 affordable homes
in 67 California communities – topping a market value of $1 billion. Jam-
boree has completed a number of affordable projects in the nearby com-
munities of Rowland Heights and La Puente.
National CORE: National CORE is a nonprofit affordable housing de-
veloper that builds and manages affordable housing communities. CORE
developed and currently owns the 125 unit entirely affordable The
Promenade community in nearby West Covina.
Bridge Housing: BRIDGE’s steady stream of diverse development ef-
forts and pipeline activity exceeds 18,000 homes. Today the organization
manages over 8,000 rental and condominium homes. BRIDGE also be-
lieves that an apartment with an affordable rent should be a stepping
stone for advancement. Programs at BRIDGE properties expand resi-
dents’ educational opportunities and financial security, provide access to
health and wellness resources and services, build community and con-
nect them to safety net resources. BRIDGE is currently developing the
135 unit entirely affordable Ivy at College Park project in nearby Chino.
4.4      Opportunities for Energy Conservation
Residential energy costs can impact the affordability of housing in that
increasing utility costs decrease the amount of income that can be used
for rents or mortgage payments. Title 24 of the California Administra-
tive Code sets forth mandatory energy standards for new housing devel-
opment, and requires adoption of an “energy budget.”
                                                                       75

Housing Rehabilitation
In addition to ensuring compliance with Title 24 in new construction, the
City provides assistance to homeowners to make energy efficiency im-
provements as part of the Housing Rehabilitation Program. The City
also partners with utility companies to assist households in making en-
ergy efficiency improvements.
Mixed Use Development
The City promotes smart growth and jobs-housing balance as a means of
energy conservation. Specifically, the City amended the General Plan to
allow mixed use developments in its commercial areas.
Metrolink Subsidies
The City promotes the use of public transit to reduce energy consump-
tion and reduce air quality impacts associated with vehicle miles trav-
eled. Specifically, the City subsidizes the costs of Metrolink passes for
residents.

5. Housing Plan
The previous sections of this Housing Element provide an overview of
the community’s housing needs, an assessment of constraints to housing
development and preservation, and an inventory of housing resources.
This section establishes the City of Walnut’s strategy for addressing the
housing needs and mitigating the constraints with available resources.
5.1      Goals and Policies
GOAL 1: Provide adequate sites for residential development.
Policy 1.1: Facilitate the development of vacant and underutilized par-
                 cels identified in the Housing Element residential site inven-
                 tory.
Policy 1.2: Maintain an up-to-date inventory of sites suitable for resi-
                 dential development and provide this information to resi-
                 dential developers and the real estate community.
Policy 1.3: Encourage the development of affordable multi-
                 family/senior housing to address the needs of the City's
                 lower income households and increasing elderly population.
GOAL 2: Encourage the adequate provision of affordable
                 housing to meet the existing and future needs of
                 Walnut residents.
Policy 2.1: Provide a variety of residential opportunities in the City in-
                 cluding low density single-family homes, multi-family de-
                 velopments for families and seniors, and housing for per-
                 sons with disabilities (including persons with developmental
                 disabilities).
Policy 2.2: Facilitate the development of low and moderate income
                 housing through the Specific Plan process in commercial ar-
                 eas in order to provide flexible development standards con-
                 sistent with the character of the community.
Policy 2.3: Encourage the development of residential units that are ac-
                 cessible to or are adaptable for conversion to residential use
                 by persons with disabilities (including persons with devel-
                                                                            77

1. Provision of Adequate Sites
The City will ensure adequate sites are provided to accommodate the
City’s RHNA of 908 units (246 very low, 144 low, and 155 moderate in-
come units).
In 2013, the City amended the General Plan and Zoning Code to provide
three Mixed Use/Housing Opportunity Overlays for the development of
a variety of housing types and prices in the community. Specific Plans
will be developed to implement the new Mixed Use/Housing Oppor-
tunity Overlay zoning. In preparing the specific plans, the City will en-
sure adequate and appropriate development standards are available to
facilitate development of housing at the intended densities.
2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
       Consult with developers, property owners, and residents, within
            one year of Housing Element adoption, regarding appropriate
            development standards to facilitate higher-density development
            and minimize neighborhood impacts.
       Prepare and adopt specific plans to implement the Mixed
            Use/Housing Opportunity Overlays within three years of Hous-
                                                                             79

rental subsidies to very low income households that spend more than 30
percent of their income on rent. The subsidy represents the difference
between 30 percent of the monthly income and the actual rent up to the
Fair Market Rent established by HUD.
Walnut participates in the Section 8 program through a cooperative
agreement with the County of Los Angeles Community Development
Commission. This program represents one of the key programs for ex-
tremely low income households.

8. Homebuyer Assistance
The City will continue to promote the existing homebuyer assistance
programs offered by County of Los Angeles Community Development
Commission on their website, in brochures, and in newsletters. Specifi-
cally, the County offers three homebuyer programs:
           Mortgage Credit Certificate (MCC): This program offers first-
            time homebuyers a federal income tax credit. This tax credit re-
                                                                           83

C I T Y O F W A L N U     T

            duces the amount of federal taxes the holders of the certificate
            would pay. It can also help the first-time homebuyer qualify for
            a loan by allowing a lender to reduce the housing expense ratio
            by the amount of the tax savings.
           Home Ownership Program (HOP): This program provides as-
            sistance to low-income, first-time homebuyers in purchasing a
            home. The program provides loans up to $50,000 or 20 percent of
            the purchase price, whichever is less. The loans are shared equi-
            ty loans with no monthly payments.
           SCHFA Program: The Southern California Home Financing Au-
            thority is a joint-powers authority between Los Angeles and Or-
            ange Counties to issue tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds for
            low- and moderate-income First Time Homebuyers. The single-
            family program provides a 30-year below-market, fixed-rate first
            mortgage loan to increase affordability and homeownership op-
            portunities to qualified first-time homebuyers. Down payment
            assistance is also available for those who qualify.
2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
       Continue to publicize program information on City website, City
            Hall, and other public locations.
       Continue to assist in distributing homebuyer workshop infor-
            mation held by local realtors or by the Los Angeles County De-
            velopment Commission to potential homebuyers.

ing developmental disabilities. However, the Zoning Code does not cur-
rently address the provision of employee housing.
2013-2021 Objectives and Time Frame:
       Amend the Zoning Code to address the provision of employee
            housing by the end of 2014.

 Notes: The above properties that comprise “Site 1”are suitable for redevelopment due to a mix of older structures, underutilized parcels and inconsistent land uses
 that currently exist on the identified properties. Currently, the land uses in the “Site 1” area are a mixture of older single-family homes, commercial uses, profession-
 al offices, and institutional uses. There are a number of small, automotive repair garages located along Valley Boulevard, adjacent to single-family residences that are
 located along Camino De Rosa. Many of the existing residences on Camino De Rosa are small homes that were constructed prior to the City’s incorporation in 1959
 and these homes are located on narrow, deep lots. The rear portions of these lots are underutilized. The homes are relatively small for the lot size; however, expansion
 of the homes is often a major undertaking for the homeowners because an addition would require modifications to the existing structures to achieve required building
 setbacks and parking requirements. This deters potential buyers and many home owners from improving the homes. Since the homes are located in the C-1 (Light
 Commercial) zone, the homes are existing, non-conforming structures that do not comply with the underlying zone.
 In addition, many of the commercial uses in the Site 1 area are located on narrow lots that are 25-feet wide (single parcel) or 50-feet wide (double parcel). The exist-
 ing lots sizes and narrow lot widths, impact the refurbishment of existing commercial buildings and prevent the construction of new or larger developments unless
 lots are consolidated. The narrow lots also result in multiple driveways accessing Valley Boulevard and parking concerns.

 Furthermore, the assortment of land uses (single-family residential, commercial, institutional) also impacts redevelopment of this area. There are several parcels
 within the Site 1 area that have multiple land uses within the same parcel (residential, automotive services, and retail commercial). This has resulted in several dilap-
 idated structures within this area and, in some cases, poor property maintenance. The Mixed Use/Housing Opportunity Overlay provides another zoning layer that
 would allow for a mixed use project that would provide a transitional use between single-family residential land uses that are located in the surrounding neighbor-
 hoods and commercial uses that are located along Valley Boulevard. The Mixed Use/ Housing Opportunity Overlay also allows for the construction of multi-family
 residential units that may house employees of commercial businesses along Valley Boulevard and industrial businesses in the City of Industry. The construction of a
 new, multi-family residential development within the boundaries of Site 1 could result in the re-investment within this area which could spur economic development,
 attract business, deter crime, and have other benefits to the community.
 Site 1 offers a unique opportunity where rezoning for mixed-use would be extremely conducive to the area and encompass existing residential and commercial uses in
 a strictly commercial zone. The intent of rezoning for residential would be to attract mixed uses and to eventually revitalize the area. The proximity of Site 1 to Val-
 ley Boulevard (a major arterial street within the City of Walnut) creates an ideal location for potential mixed-use developments.
