EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Housing Element Update addresses the planning period from 2014-2021 in
accordance with applicable state law, and consistent with the City of Rolling Hills
General Plan and the community’s vision of its housing needs and objectives. As a
hillside community, Rolling Hills’ ability to provide housing is limited by its serious
geologic, topographic and environmental constraints. Within the framework of these
constraints, the City endeavors to promote housing opportunities for all households.
This Housing Element Update reflects the City’s continuing efforts to retain and expand
housing opportunities in the community. For the duration of this planning period, the
City of Rolling Hills commits to a series of actions to support affordable housing. These
actions continue from the last planning period and strive toward the following
accomplishments:
1. Provide housing service information to community senior citizens
2. Enforce code violations within residential neighborhoods
3. Facilitate new construction by working closely with housing developers and builders
4. Monitor the City land supply
5. Promote reasonable accommodations for the disabled
6. Support energy conservation and sustainable development measures
7. Support fair housing counseling and monitoring.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. COMMUNITY OVERVIEW
The City of Rolling Hills is a rural, equestrian residential community, consisting entirely
of large lot residential parcels of one acre or more. Physically, the community
encompasses 2.98 square miles of land on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in the County of
Los Angeles. (Refer to Figure 1, Vicinity Map.) The land use pattern was established
with the original subdivision and sale of parcels that began in 1936. The community is
comprised of single-story California ranch style homes with three-rail fences and
equestrian facilities in a wooded setting, developed around the hilly terrain and deep
canyons of the City.
                                                                                            Page 1

  Figure 1. Vicinity Map
From its inception in 1936, the emphasis in Rolling Hills has been to create and maintain
a residential community that would respect its unique land form constraints. The City’s
minimum lot size requirements were established in recognition of these constraints,
which include:
1.   Steeply sloping hillsides
2.   Landslide hazards
3.   Lack of urban infrastructure, specifically sewer
4.   Danger of wildland fires
5.   Sensitive animal habitats and species
6.   Restrictions of enforceable covenants, conditions, and restrictions of the Rolling
     Hills Community Association (RHCA), which existed prior to the City’s
     incorporation.
Geologic Constraints:
Expansive soils and geologic hazard conditions continue to place constraints on
development within the City. Portions of the City are located over ancient landslide
that from time to time reactivate and affect the land. It is impossible to predict when
and if a property will be affected. One of the reasons the City insists on minimal grading
is to minimize land disturbance and exacerbation of soils instability. Because of these
geologic conditions, the City has experienced recent major landslides, further limiting
the developable area within its boundaries.
In the past 7 years, three private properties experienced earth movement where a
portion of their slope slid, requiring the property owners to do extensive and expensive
slope restoration work. Last year, geological exploration on an 8 acre vacant property,
October 1, 2013                                                                           Page 2

where a home was being proposed, revealed unstable conditions and an ancient
landslide. Pursuant to the Los Angeles County Building Code, before the property
owner could be allowed to proceed with construction, extensive remediation of over 4
of the 8 acre lot was required.
Fire Safety Constraints:
According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, effective July 1,
2008, all land in the City of Rolling Hills was upgraded one level to “Very High Fire
Hazard Severity Zone” (VHFHSZ) (Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone). As a result,
several more restrictive fire safety standards were adopted in the City Building Code
that apply to all new development in the City. Examples of the new fire safety building
standards include requirements to box in eave projections (common to all ranch style
homes in Rolling Hills), to install double paned windows, heavy timber construction
materials and other construction materials approved by the California Fire Marshall
only. Professionally designed landscaping meeting the Fire Department fuel modification
zones requirements including fire-resistive plants around structures are also required.
The new fire zone designation and related standards are placing additional constraints
on new development, especially resulting in higher design and building costs.
In addition to the higher fire hazard rating, current firefighting capabilities in the City are
limited by the California Water Company due to their distribution system and aging
infrastructure and the City’s topography.
Infrastructure Constraints:
Only a few homes on the western periphery of the City are served by a sewer system.
Consequently, any new development must utilize septic tanks for disposal of sanitary
waste. Past experience suggests substantial care and restraint must be exercised in the
expansion of any existing systems or the addition of new systems to avoid possible
ground instability due to saturation of' the upper soil layers. This situation, in
conjunction with recent active landslide activity, continues to constrain development
densities in the City.
Environmental Constraints:
Environmental constraints that limit development in Rolling Hills include sensitive
animal habitats and species either listed or considered for listing by the U.S.
Department of Fish and Wildlife and/or the California Department of Fish and Game.
These species include the Palos Verdes Blue butterfly, the California Gnatcatcher, the
Pacific Pocket Mouse, the San Diego Horned Lizard, and Brackishwater Snail. The
community is also underlain with blue-line streams that are under the jurisdiction of
the Army Corps of Engineers.
Topographic Constraints:
October 1, 2013                                                                                Page 3

The Rolling Hills landscape is comprised of a system of rolling hills, steep canyons and
blue-line streams. It has been described as having the most severe terrain of any
jurisdiction in Los Angeles County. Slopes of 25 to 50 percent are present on virtually
every remaining undeveloped parcel in the City.
Contractual Constraints:
Rolling Hills has been largely built-out for the past thirty years. All of the developable
property in the City is subject to RHCA, a non-profit California Corporation,
enforceable covenants, conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs) that run with the property
in perpetuity. These CC&Rs were in place prior to the City’s incorporation, and
continue to restrict development based on the community’s unique constraints.
Within the context of these overwhelming constraints, the City has actively pursued
avenues to support residential development and facilitate affordable housing
opportunities. Specifically, the City has adopted amendments to its Zoning Ordinance to
allow for manufactured housing units and has reached out to adjacent communities to
address its regional affordable housing needs. The City has conducted these efforts in
compliance with State Housing Element Law as summarized below.
B. PURPOSE OF THE ELEMENT
The provision of adequate housing for families and individuals of all economic levels is an
important public goal. It has been a main focus for state and local governments. The
issue has grown in complexity due to rising land and construction costs, as well as
increasing competition for physical and financial resources in both the public and the
private sectors.
In response to this concern, the California Legislature amended the Government Code
in 1980. The amendment instituted the requirement that each local community include
a specific analysis of its housing needs and a realistic set of programs designed to meet
those needs. This analysis is to be set forth in a Housing Element and incorporated in
the General Plan of each municipality.
October 1, 2013                                                                            Page 4

The requirements of the law are prefaced by several statements of State policy set forth
in Section 65580 of the Government Code:
        “... The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early
        attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every
        California family is a priority of the highest order.”
        “... Local and State governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested
        in them to facilitate the improvement and development of housing to make
        adequate provision for the housing needs of all economic segments of the
        community.”
        “... The legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each local
        government also has the responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and
        fiscal factors and community goals set forth in the general plan and to cooperate
        with other local governments and the State in addressing regional housing
        needs.”
C. LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
State law requires each municipality to accomplish the following tasks:
   To identify and analyze the current and projected housing needs of all economic
    segments of the community.
   To evaluate the current and potential constraints to meeting those needs, including
    identifying the constraints that are due to the marketplace and those imposed by the
    government.
   To inventory and assess the availability of land suitable for residential use.
   To establish a series of goals, objectives, policies and programs aimed at responding
    to the identified housing needs, the market and governmental constraints, and the
    housing opportunities.
D. SCOPE AND CONTENT
The Housing Element consists of five major components:
   An analysis of the City’s demographic and housing characteristics and trends.
   A summary of the existing and projected housing needs of the City’s households.
   A review of the potential market, governmental, and environmental constraints to
October 1, 2013                                                                            Page 5

     meeting the City’s identified housing needs.
    An evaluation of the resources available to achieve the City’s housing goals.
    A statement of the Housing Plan for the years 2014 through 2021 to address the
     City’s identified housing needs, including the housing goals, policies and programs.
E. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN ELEMENTS
The Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of a
General Plan. Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the General Plan
and the parts and elements thereof shall comprise an integrated and an internally
consistent and compatible statement of policies.
The Rolling Hills General Plan contains the following six elements: 1) Land Use; 2)
Housing; 3) Circulation; 4) Open Space and Conservation; 5) Safety; and 6) Noise. The
City General Plan is internally consistent. Policy direction introduced in one element is
reflected in other plan elements. For example, residential development capacities
established in the Land Use Element and constraints to development identified in the
Safety Element and Open Space and Conservation Element are incorporated into the
Housing Element. This Housing Element builds upon the other General Plan elements
and is entirely consistent with the policies and proposals set forth by the Plan.
Pursuant to Government Code Section 65400, the City will annually review its progress
in implementing this Housing Element and ensuring consistency between this and the
City’s other General Plan Elements.
F. RELATIONSHIP TO PRIVATE LAND USE RESTRICTIONS
CC&Rs (covenants, conditions and restrictions) represent private contractual
obligations between homeowners and are usually established at the time a subdivision
or community is built. Development in Rolling Hills has been governed by CC&Rs since
the community was planned out in the 1930’s. Rolling Hills Community Association
(RHCA), composed of elected Rolling Hills community residents, oversees and enforces
implementation of the CC&Rs. The RHCA and the CC&Rs existed and were in force
prior to the City incorporation, which occurred in 1957.
These CC&Rs strictly limit development in the City, restricting residential density to
one residence per one-acre and two-acre lots. Any construction, remodel, and grading
for a building, fence or structure is required under the CC&Rs to adhere to traditional
or California ranch and equestrian architectural styles and aesthetics. The uses and
purposes of all easements around each property are required to be dedicated to the
RHCA and maintained for the purposes of ingress, egress, construction and
maintenance of all infrastructure constructed as roadways, bridle trials, storm drains,
utility access and drainage.
October 1, 2013                                                                           Page 6

The City of Rolling Hills has no jurisdiction over the RHCA or the content or
implementation of the CC&Rs.
G. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Section 65583(c)(5) of the Government Code states that:
        "The local government shall make a diligent effort to achieve public
        participation of all the economic segments of the community in the
        development of the housing element, and the program shall describe this
        effort."
To gain public input to its Housing Element Update, the City of Rolling Hills conducted a
public workshop before the Planning Commission on September 26, 2013 which was
open to all members of the community. At that meeting, the Commission with
assistance from City staff and the housing consultant, discussed the Housing Element
Update. The public was invited to comment, and offer suggestions for new housing
programs. Public comments received included questions from the Planning Commission
regarding feasibility of meeting the affordable housing goal given the City’s topographic
and infrastructure goals. The Commission also commented on the two new market
rate houses currently being proposed. These two units would satisfy the City’s RHNA
requirement for above moderate income housing. No members from the public
attended.
Additionally, the City of Rolling Hills will conduct public hearings before the Planning
Commission and City Council which will be open to all members of the community. At
these meetings, additional public comment from the community will be sought relative
to the Housing Element Update and the need for new housing programs.
Notices of the public meetings for the Planning Commission and the City Council are
posted at City Hall and published in the Palos Verdes Peninsula News and in the City bi-
weekly newsletter. In addition, the agenda for the City Council meetings is published in
the bi-weekly Newsletter, posted on City’s web-site and copy is emailed to those
residents who registered for the agendas. Rolling Hills is a relatively small community
and its residents are accustomed to the City’s noticing procedures. The City’s notices
are made equally available to all residents of all income levels. In addition, notices
regarding the Housing Element update were provided to the cities of Rancho Palos
Verdes, Rolling Hills Estates and Lomita, the County of Los Angeles, the Palos Verdes
Peninsula Unified School district, the Palos Verdes Peninsula Center Library District and
the Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation Commission.
H. SOURCES OF INFORMATION
A number of data sources were used to create the Rolling Hills Housing Element.
October 1, 2013                                                                          Page 7

II. HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT
A successful strategy for improving housing conditions must be preceded by an
assessment of the housing needs of the community and region. This section of the
Housing Element reviews the major components of housing needs including trends in
Rolling Hills’ population, households, and the type of housing available. These changes
reflect both local and regional conditions. Consequently, the regional context is also
presented.
The analysis that follows is broken down into four major subsections:
   Section A, Population Characteristics, analyzes the City of Rolling Hills in terms of
    individual persons and attempts to identify any population trends that may affect
    future housing needs.
   Section B, Household Characteristics, analyzes Rolling Hills in terms of households,
    or living groups, to see how past and expected household changes will affect housing
    needs.
   Section C, Housing Stock, analyzes the housing units in Rolling Hills in terms of
    availability, affordability, and condition.
   Section D, Assisted Housing At Risk of Conversion, analyzes housing units that have
    expiring use restrictions, such as project-based Section 8 contracts and early tax-
October 1, 2013                                                                         Page 8

     credit financing contracts. Such projects are at risk of losing those rent restrictions
     within the next few years, which can result in significant rent increases for their
     tenants.
This assessment of Rolling Hills’ housing needs is used as the basis for identifying
appropriate policies and programs in this Element.
A. POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS
Rolling Hills’ population characteristics are important factors affecting the type and
extent of housing needs in the City. Population growth, age, race/ethnicity and
employment characteristics are discussed in this section.
1. Population Change
Rolling Hills had a resident population of 1,860 according to the 2010 Census, and a
population of 1,884, according to the State of California Department of Finance,
City/County Population and Housing Estimates, January 2013. In terms of
population, Rolling Hills is the fourth smallest in Los Angeles County1. The City has
been largely built-out for the past forty years.
As illustrated in Table 1, the City had a 1970 population of 2,050 and a 1980
population of 2,049. By 1990, according to the Census, the City population had
dropped to 1,871. This decrease from 1980 to 1990 includes some population lost
as a result of the damage from previous landslides and fires, including the Flying
Triangle Landslide, in which ten homes were destroyed by fire in or near the Flying
Triangle Active Landslide Area in the southern portion of the City.
The City population remained stagnant from 1990 to 2000, and decreasing by 0.6
percent according to the 2010 census. The 2013 state of California Department of
Finance estimates a slight increase of 1.3 percent. By comparison, the County of
Los Angeles population increased from 9,519,330 in 2000 to 9,818,605 in 2010, by
3.0 percent.
Limited growth in the City's population demonstrates the diminishing supply of
parcels available for development. Opportunities for new residents to move into
Rolling Hills have occurred primarily through redevelopment of the City's original
housing stock and changes in ownership

2. Age Characteristics
The age structure of a population is an important factor in evaluating housing needs and
planning future housing development. For example, if a city is experiencing an
outmigration of young adults (ages 25-34), there may be a shortage of first-time
homebuyer opportunities and/or well-paying employment opportunities. If a city has a
substantial elderly population, special housing types or services may be needed, such as
assisted living facilities, housing rehabilitation programs, paratransit, meals on wheels,
and home health care services, in order to enable seniors to remain in the community.
Table 2 shows the number and percentages of Rolling Hills residents in each age group
according to data from the Census 2010. The table also shows the median age for the
City and County of Los Angeles.
Rolling Hills is a maturing community. During the past 20 years, its median age has
increased from a 1980 median age of 38.2 years, to a 1990 median age of 45.5 years to a
2010 median age of 53 years. By comparison, the 2010 Los Angeles County median age
was 35.9 years.

3. Race and Ethnicity
As shown in Table 3, the 2010 Census reported that 77.3 percent of Rolling Hills’
population was white, which compared to 50.3 percent for the County overall. Rolling
Hills’ Black or African American population at 1.6 percent was lower than the County
Black or African American population at 8.7 percent. American Indian or Alaskan Native
comprised very small percentages of the City and County population, 0.3 percent and
0.7 percent, respectively. Asians comprised 16.3 percent of Rolling Hills’ population,
compared to 13.7 percent for the County. Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander also
comprised very small percentages of the City and County population, 0.1 percent and
0.3, respectively. An estimated 1.3 percent of Rolling Hills’ residents indicated that they
are of “other race”; for the County, the percentage of people identifying themselves as
“other race” was notable larger, 21.8 percent. Rolling Hills’ residents who identified
themselves as Hispanic or Latino comprised 5.5 percent of the City population. For the
County, this percentage was much larger, with 47.7 percent of the population identifying
themselves as Hispanic or Latino.

4. Employment
The 2010 Census shows that 54 percent of Rolling Hills’ residents were in the labor
force. Of these workers, 89.1 percent commuted outside the City to work, while 10.9
percent worked from their homes.
Most of Rolling Hills’ workers (72.1 percent) were employed in management,
professional and related occupations. An estimated 16.6 percent worked in sales; 10.3
percent in service industries; 0.6 percent in natural resources, construction and
maintenance; and 0.4 percent in production transportation, and material moving
occupations.
There is no commercial or industrially zoned land in the City. City Hall is located on the
only institutionally zoned land in the City. Consequently, employment in the City is
limited to home-based occupations and jobs at City Hall and the Rolling Hills
Community Association office. No significant change in the number of jobs in Rolling
Hills is expected since no new source of employment is expected in the future.
B. HOUSEHOLD CHARACTERISTICS
Information on household characteristics is an important indicator of housing needs in a
community. Income and affordability is best measured at the household level, as are the
special housing needs of certain groups such as large families and female-headed
October 1, 2013                                                                                 Page 12

   households. As an example, if a community has a substantial number of young family
   households whose incomes combined with local housing costs preclude the option of
   home purchase, the city may wish to initiate a home-buyer assistance program or
   participate in or publicize the programs that are available elsewhere.
   The Bureau of the Census defines a "household" as “all persons who occupy a housing
   unit, which may include families, singles, or other." Boarders are included as part of the
   primary household by the Census. Families are households related through marriage or
   blood, and a single household refers to individuals living alone. "Other" households
   reflect unrelated individuals living together (e.g., roommates). Persons living in
   retirement or convalescent homes, dormitories, or other group living situations are not
   considered households.
   1. Household Type
   As shown in Table 4, there were a total of 663 households in Rolling Hills according to
   the 2010 US Census Report. Most of these households (81.3 percent) are family
   households, compared to 67.7 percent family households for the County.
   Rolling Hills’ average household size is 2.81 persons per household, and slightly lower
   than the 2.98 persons per household for the County. Family households are somewhat
   larger, 3.08 persons per household for the City and 3.58 persons per household for the
   County.

            Size
   2. Overcrowding
   Overcrowding is another indicator of housing affordability. Unit overcrowding is caused
   by the combined effect of low earnings and high housing costs in a community, and
   reflects the inability of households to buy or rent housing that provides sufficient living
   October 1, 2013                                                                             Page 13

space for their needs. The Census defines overcrowded households as units with
greater than 1.01 persons per room, excluding bathrooms, hallways and porches.
According to the 2010 Census, there is no overcrowding in Rolling Hills, with no
households reporting more than one person per room. By comparison, 4.9 percent of
Los Angeles County households reported incidences of overcrowding (more than 1.5
persons per room). A low incidence of overcrowding in Rolling Hills is expected to
continue through the current planning period.
3. Household Income
An important factor in housing affordability is household income. While upper income
households have more discretionary income to spend on housing, low and moderate-
income households are more limited in the range of housing they can afford.
State-Defined Income Categories
According to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and
the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD), the area
median income for a four-person household in Los Angeles County was $64,800 in
2013.2 California law and some federal housing programs define several income
categories based on a percentage of the area median income (AMI) determined by
HUD and HCD, as follows:
        Extremely Low Income - 30 percent of the area median income and below
        Very Low Income - between 31 percent and 50 percent of the area median
         income
        Lower Income - between 51 and 80 percent of the area median income
        Moderate Income - between 81 and 120 percent of the area median income.
These income ranges are used to determine eligibility for various subsidized housing
programs. The 2013 income limits for these categories by household size are presented
in Table 5, as follows:

   Census 2010 Estimates of Household Income
   According to Census 2010 estimates, median household income in Rolling Hills was
   $223,750, compared to $56,226 for the County. Rolling Hills’ higher median household
   income reflects the single family, large lot nature of the community. Table 6 shows the
   median income for Rolling Hills, neighboring cities and the County as reported by the
   2010 Census.

   Table 7, below, shows the percent of Rolling Hills’ households by income range. These
   income figures suggest that the Rolling Hills community does not have great disparities
   in income, and that the majority of the community can be considered upper income.
   This conclusion is further supported by the poverty status information for the City. No
   Rolling Hills families had incomes at or below the 2009 federal poverty level; for Los
   Angeles County, this percentage was 13.0 percent.

4. Special Needs Groups
Certain segments of the population may have more difficulty finding decent, affordable
housing due to special circumstances. These “special needs" groups include the elderly,
large families, disabled persons, female-headed households, farm workers, and the
homeless. Under State law, the housing needs of each group are required to be
addressed in the Housing Element. This information is summarized in Table 8. The
identified special needs groups are defined below:
Elderly and Frail Elderly
The special needs of many elderly households result from their fixed incomes, higher
rate of physical disabilities and common need for assistance from others. Elderly is
defined as age 65 or older. In 2010, 513 or 27.9 percent of Rolling Hills’ population
were 65 or older. As shown in Table 8, households with elderly persons comprised 340
or 51.3 percent of all Rolling Hills households. By comparison, countywide, 10.9 percent
of County persons were 65 or older households were headed by a person 65 years or
older, and 24.4 percent of County households had members 65 years or older.
Senior households are likely to be on fixed low incomes and at a greater risk of housing
over payment. In terms of housing, seniors typically require smaller, more affordable
housing options and/or assistance with accessibility and home maintenance. They often
require ramps, handrails, lower cupboards and counters to allow greater access and
mobility for wheelchairs or walkers. Because of their limited mobility, the elderly also
often need to live close or have transportation assistance to shopping and medical
facilities.
According to the 2000 Census, of those Rolling Hills residents that are elderly, 19.1
percent have disabilities, which include sensory, physical and mental disabilities.
October 1, 2013                                                                         Page 16

As discussed above, the median age for the City is much higher than the County, 53.0
years compared to 35.9 years. Although most of Rolling Hills elderly are expected to be
upper income, there is expected to be a continued need for accessible housing and
senior related services throughout the planning period.
        City Approach to Meeting Elderly Needs: In previous years, the City of
Rolling Hills has assigned a portion of its Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) allocation to the adjacent city of Lomita to support its senior center and senior
housing developmnets. In recent years, the City of Lomita has not requested Rolling
Hills’ funds for senior housing. Most recently, due to the administrative burden
associated with maintaining a CDBG program, the City no longer participates in the
program. To continue to assist its elderly residents find needed services, the City has
available at City Hall a list of local senior facilities. These facilities are listed below.

Disabled Persons
Physical and mental disabilities can hinder access to housing units of conventional design
as well as limit the ability of the disabled individuals to earn an adequate income. The
proportion of physically disabled individuals is increasing nationwide due to overall
increased longevity and lower fatality rates. Mentally disabled individuals include those
disabled by a psychiatric illness or injury, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease,
AIDS-related infections and conditions related to brain trauma. Disabilities tabulated by
the Census include sensory, physical and mental limitations.
A tabulation of disabled persons in Rolling Hills is not included in the 2010 Census.
However, according to the 2000 Census, 152 of all Rolling Hills residents (8.1 percent
of the City population) were identified as disabled. Disabilities of these residents
included each of the categories tabulated by the Census, with most persons having
physical disabilities.
Of Rolling Hills’ disabled residents (152 total), 15 (or 9.9 percent) were aged 5 to 20
years old, 58 (or 38.1 percent) were aged 21 to 64 years old, and 79 (or 52.0 percent)
were aged 65 years or older. Of the disabled adults aged 21 to 64, 88 percent were
employed outside the home, compared to 65 percent of non-disabled adults.
Countywide, 18 percent of the population is identified as disabled. Of these disabled
County residents, 10 percent were aged 5 to 20 years old, 67 percent were aged 21 to
64 years old, and 23 percent were aged 65 years or older. Of the disabled County
adults aged 21 to 64, 54 percent were employed outside the home, compared to 69
percent of non-disabled adults aged 21 to 64.
October 1, 2013                                                                           Page 19

Rolling Hills disabled residents are generally more active (employed) and older (elderly)
than County residents as a whole. However with the large percentage of City disabled
adults working (88 percent) and the upper income character of the community suggest
that disabled persons in Rolling Hills can afford to modify their housing to accommodate
special needs. This information indicates that in Rolling Hills disabled do not represent a
special needs group.
Pursuant to SB 812 (Lanterman Act), cities must include in their Housing Elements an
analysis of the special housing needs of the disabled including persons with
developmental disabilities. The Harbor Regional Center, located in Torrance, provides
services to Rolling Hills’ residents with developmental disabilities pursuant to the
Lanterman Act. The Harbor Regional Center is a private, not-for-profit corporation that
serves over 10,000 people with developmental disabilities, and their families, who reside
in the South Bay, Harbor, Long Beach, and southeast areas of Los Angeles County.
Within Rolling Hills, the Harbor Regional Center served 1 child aged 3-years old, 1 child
aged 4-years old, 1 child aged 5-years old, 3 children aged 7-years old, 1 child aged 8-
years old, 2 children aged 9-years old, 2 children 10-years old, 1 child aged 11-years old,
3 children aged 12-years old, and 2 children aged 13-years old.3
        City Approach to Meeting Disabled Needs: Although disabled persons are
not an identified special needs group in the Rolling Hills, the City recognizes that
regardless of income, disability can block adequate access to housing. The City has
adopted Resolution 699 that certifies its recognition of the American with Disabilities
Act and adopts necessary mitigation efforts to assist its disabled residents.
The City’s continued commitment to meeting the needs of the disabled is summarized
in Section V.C. Housing Implementation Plan (2014-2021).

Female-Headed Households
Single-parent households require special consideration and assistance because of their
greater needs for day care, health care, and other facilities. Female-headed households
with children in particular tend to have lower incomes, thus limiting housing availability
for this group.
According to the 2010 US Census Report, Rolling Hills has 3 female-headed households
with children 18 years or younger. These 3 households, which comprise 1 percent of all
Rolling Hills households, are expected to be upper income. Countywide, female-headed
households with children 18 years or younger also comprise 8 percent of total
households. Of these County households, 13 percent live in poverty.
Because the female-headed households in Rolling Hills are expected to be
predominately upper income, they are not expected to be constrained by the needs for
day care, health care or housing. This information suggests that in Rolling Hills female-
headed households do not represent a special needs group.
        City Approach to Meeting Female-Headed Households Needs: Because
female headed households are not an identified need in the Rolling Hills, the City does
not have active programs or policies to address this need.
Large Households
Large households are identified in State housing law as a “group with special housing
needs based on the generally limited availability of adequately sized, affordable housing
units.” Large households are defined as those with five or more members. As noted in
Table 4 above, Rolling Hills has a smaller average household and family size than the
County. Also, no City housing units meet the definition of overcrowded.
Rolling Hills has the housing stock to accommodate large households. According to the
2010 Census, the average number of rooms per housing unit in the City is 6.9
compared to 4.6 for the County. Large family households in Rolling Hills are expected
to be predominately upper income and adequately housed in the City's larger single-
family homes. This information indicates that in Rolling Hills large households do not
represent a special needs group.
        City Approach to Meeting Large Households Needs: Because large
households are not an identified need in the Rolling Hills, the City does not have active
programs or policies to address this need.

Farm Workers
The special housing needs of many agricultural workers stem from their low wages and
seasonal nature of their employment. An estimate of the "farm worker" population in
the City is extrapolated from individuals who categorize their employment as "farming,
fishing or forestry” in the 2010 Census.
Based on this estimate, there is one Rolling Hills’ worker who identified him/herself as
employed in this farming category. Because of the high median income in the City, this
worker is expected to be of above moderate income. There are no designated
agricultural uses in or adjacent to Rolling Hills. Consequently, farm workers are not a
special housing needs group in Rolling Hills.
          City Approach to Meeting Farmworker Needs: Because farm workers are
not an identified need in the Rolling Hills, the City does not have active programs or
policies to address this need.
Homeless
During the past decades, homelessness had become an increasingly reported problem
throughout the state. Factors contributing to the rise in homelessness include the
general lack of housing affordable to low and very low income persons, increases in the
number of persons whose incomes fall below the poverty level, reductions in public
subsidies to the poor, and the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill.
According to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) 2013 Greater Los
Angeles Homeless Count Executive Summary, there are 59,233 homeless persons in
Los Angeles County. There are currently over 80 homeless shelters and numerous
other emergency shelters, transitional housing facilities, hospital emergency rooms,
motels that assist Los Angeles County homeless.4 The homeless facilities closest to
Rolling Hills include Beacon Light Mission in Wilmington that currently provides 7
temporary beds for homeless men plus meals.5 While no one has been turned away
from the dining tables in over a year, the beds are usually full. The Mission finds that
the majority of its clients are people searching for work in the harbor area.
Other nearby homeless facilities include the American Family Housing (AFH), a
nonprofit organization that provides emergency, transitional and permanent housing.
AFH operates in Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino counties and is currently
helping 1,170 persons each day with shelter.6 In the South Bay area of Los Angeles, it
operates a 20-unit two-story apartment complex that features an outdoor play area and

indoor children's recreation room. Occupants can stay at the shelter for up to 90-days.
During that stay, the occupants meet with caseworkers and attend workshops on
various topics, including budgeting, parenting and nutrition. They receive assistance on
building a resume and seeking employment as well as free and reduced-cost childcare.
Harbor Interfaith Shelter in San Pedro provides housing to people each day in its
emergency, transitional and low-income permanent housing. In 2012, it provided
housing services to 18,000 persons.7 The shelter also provides meals, personal
counseling, and educational and vocational services. Toberman Settlement House is a
non-profit neighborhood center providing services to low-income residents of Los
Angeles. Its efforts are aimed at helping individuals and families move from poverty to
self-sufficiency. Founded in 1903 in the name of two-term Mayor James R. Toberman,
Toberman House is the oldest charity in the city of Los Angeles, and the oldest United
Methodist mission project in the Western U.S. It was originally located in Echo Park,
but moved to Boyle Heights in 1917, then San Pedro in 1937. Toberman House offers a
wide range of social services, ranging from state-licensed K through 5 childcare, and
afterschool care, to a senior's club.
Recent contacts with each of these agencies indicate that they are fully occupied, but
have no record of patrons who have listed Rolling Hills as their previous place of
residence. Part of the reason for this is that the City is not located along a major
street, with other services or businesses which would attract transient and homeless
persons. Additionally, Rolling Hills' gated entries, which are monitored by the Rolling
Hills Community Association and the rugged terrain provide a difficult environment for
the homeless.
          City Approach to Meeting Needs of Homelessness: Senate Bill 2 of 2007
requires that jurisdictions quantify the need for emergency shelters and determine
whether existing facilities are adequate to serve the need. If adequate existing facilities
are not available, the law requires jurisdictions to identify areas where new facilities are
permitted “by-right” (i.e., without requiring discretionary approval such as a use
permit), or to accommodate the need through a multi-jurisdictional agreement. No
homeless persons have been identified in or being from Rolling Hills. Consequently,
there is no quantified need for emergency shelters in Rolling Hills.
Because of its physical limitations of available accessible land, Rolling Hills has no feasible
or suitable sites for permanent emergency shelters or transitional housing. However,
there are over 80 emergency shelters plus numerous other facilities assisting homeless
persons in the Los Angeles area, with the Beacon Light Mission in Wilmington being the
closest to Rolling Hills.

Despite the lack of a quantified need for emergency shelters in Rolling Hills, the City is
committed to addressing homelessness in the region and to complying with SB 2.
Toward this end, the City is committed to coordinating with and directing any
homeless person(s) to local social service providers if the need arises in the future. A
list of nearby social service agencies and shelters is shown in the Housing Element and
is maintained by the City Clerk. In addition, the Sheriff Department directs homeless
individuals to local shelters.
In addition, pursuant to SB 2, the City recognizes transitional and supportive housing as
residential uses. However as discussed in Section V.B of this Element, none of the
reasonably available properties in the City of Rolling Hills could realistically develop at a
density greater than 1 unit per acre, making development of transitional housing
infeasible.
The City’s continued commitment to meeting these needs is summarized in Section
V.C., Housing Implementation Plan (2014-2021).
C. HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS
A housing unit is defined as a house, apartment, mobile home, or a single room
occupied as a separate living quarter or, if vacant, intended for occupancy as a separate
living quarter. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live and eat
separately from any other persons in the building and which have direct access from the
outside of the building or through a common hall. A community's housing stock is the
compilation of all its housing units.
1. Housing Growth
Rolling Hills has been largely built out for the last thirty years. The supply of buildable
land has become increasingly constrained by fires, landslides and identification of
biologically sensitive species. Since 1990, the City has gained a net of 10 units. Rolling
Hills’ housing supply has grown from a 1990 Census count of 674 units, to a 2000
Census count of 675 to a 2010 census count of 693 units. This represents an average
growth rate of 2 percent per year.
While the limited availability of land suitable for residential development has resulted in
only nominal increases in the City's housing stock, additional residential development
has been occurring through redevelopment of existing units. Much of the City's housing
stock was built in the 1950s, and is typified by 3,000 to 4,000 square-foot ranch style
homes. As in many communities with a strong market for residential development and
limited available land, Rolling Hills' older housing stock is being replaced with much
larger, expansive units averaging 6,000 to 9,000 square feet in size, according to City
building permit records. This trend of residential recycling can be expected to continue
and potentially increase as less vacant land is available for development.
October 1, 2013                                                                               Page 24

2. Housing Type
Rolling Hills is a community of single family houses. Some of these homes are expected
to include guest units. According to the 2010 Census, there are 693 single family units.
The RCHA prohibits renting such guest units because of the community’s limited sewer
and water capacity.
3. Age and Condition of Housing Stock
Most homes begin to exhibit signs of decay when they approach thirty years of age.
Common repairs needed include new roofs, wall plaster and stucco. Homes thirty years
or over with deferred maintenance require more substantial repairs, such as new siding,
plumbing or multiple repairs to the roof, walls, etc. As illustrated in Table 9, the
majority of Rolling Hills' housing (51 percent) was constructed before 1960. Due to a
diminishing supply of available land, development in Rolling Hills slowed significantly in
the past two decades.

The fact that the large majority of the City's housing stock is owner-occupied, combined
with the high quality of residential construction, has resulted in excellent upkeep of the
City's units. According to the City code enforcement files, no significant housing
condition problems have been identified.
Code enforcement in the City is the responsibility of the Planning Department. In
response to complaints, the City Planning Director makes site inspections in the
community. Any code enforcement violations noted by the Director or called in by a
resident is typically handled by a site inspection and phone call to the resident causing

the violation. If the phone call fails to resolve the violation, the Director will follow-up
with a letter. There are very few code violations regarding residential structural
deficiencies in the City of Rolling Hills, and during this planning period, all noted
violations have been resolved with a phone call or a letter.
                 City Housing Maintenance Efforts: Because housing maintenance is
not an identified need in the Rolling Hills, the City does not have active programs or
policies to address this need.
4. Housing Costs
Housing costs are driven by the price of raw land, infrastructure costs (e.g. sewer and
water), construction costs, supply relative to demand, and financing costs. The
diminishing supply of developable land in Rolling Hills and the recent rapid rise in
residential real estate prices that has occurred throughout the southern California
region, have driven up the cost of both ownership and rental housing in Rolling Hills.
Ownership Housing
All ownership housing in Rolling Hills is single family homes. Minimum lot size as
established by the RHCA is one acre. The value of these homes varies based on the
type, size and location.
According to the 2010 Census, 90.8 percent of houses in Rolling Hills are valued at over
$1,000,000. Recent for sales data for September 2013 shows a median for-sale housing
price of about $5,500,000.8
As shown in Table 10 below, Rolling Hills’ housing prices are similar to most of its
neighboring communities.

The rental housing market in Rolling Hills is comprised only of single family homes.
Because of the large estate lots and limited supply of available housing in the community,
rental rates are currently between $3,500 per month and $9,900 per month. 9 At these
prices, only upper income households could afford to rent in Rolling Hills.
Vacancy Rates
The residential vacancy rate, a translation of the number of unoccupied housing units on
the market, is a good indicator of the balance between housing supply and demand in a
community. When the demand for housing exceeds the available supply, the vacancy
rate will be low. Concurrently, a low vacancy rate drives the cost of housing upward to
the disadvantage of prospective buyers or renters.
In a healthy housing market, the vacancy rate would be between 5.0 and 8.0 percent.
These vacant units should be distributed across a variety of housing types, sizes, price
ranges and locations within the City. This allows adequate selection opportunities for
households seeking new residences.
According to the 2010 Census, Rolling Hills’ owner-occupied housing units have a
vacancy rate of 5 percent. This rate indicates that the housing market is relatively
healthy with some room for buyers to find a suitable unit or negotiate a lower purchase
price.
Household Tenure
According to the 2010 Census, 97.5 percent of the City’s housing units were owner-
occupied, with 2.5 percent renter-occupied.
Housing Affordability and Overpayment
Federal and state guidelines specify that households should not spend more than 30
percent of their gross income on housing. Of the Rolling Hills homeowners, the 2010
Census reports that 28.35 percent paid more than 30 percent of their income for
housing.
Table 11, below, estimates the maximum housing costs affordable to Very Low Income,
Low Income and Moderate Income households based on HCD established income
criteria. In the case of rent, the 30 percent assumes utilities are included in the monthly
rental cost. Utilities may include water, sewer, trash pickup, electric and gas, and may
add $100 to the monthly cost of a rental unit, exclusive of heating and cooling.
In the case of purchase, the 30 percent includes payment on mortgage principal and
interest, plus property tax, homeowner insurance and utilities. To purchase a home, the

buyer typically needs to put 20 percent of the housing cost down at the time of
purchase.
As indicated in Table 11, maximum housing costs affordable to an Extremely Low
Income four-person household are $136,015 to purchase a home and $691 per month
to rent a home. For a Very Low Income four-person household, maximum costs are
$210,048 to purchase a home and $1,068 per month to rent a home. For a Low Income
four-person household, the maximum affordable housing costs are $335,979 to
purchase a home and $1,708 per month to rent a home. For a Median Income four-
person household, the maximum affordable housing costs are $318,762 to purchase a
home and $1,620 per month to rent a home. For a Moderate Income four-person
household, the maximum affordable housing costs are $382,465 to purchase a home and
$1,944.00 per month to rent a home.
As presented above, the current cost to purchase a home in the City currently begins at
about $1,999,000. With a 20 percent down, this price would require a $399,800 down
payment and a monthly payment of about $8,350. These costs, as indicated in Table 11,
are certainly well above the reach of the Extremely Low and Very Low, Low, Median
and Moderate Income households.
Rental housing in Rolling Hills starts at $3,500 per month. These rents are certainly well
above the reach of the Extremely Low and Very Low, Low, Median and Moderate
Income households.

       D. ASSISTED HOUSING
       State law requires the City to identify, analyze and propose programs to preserve
       housing units that are currently deed restricted to low income housing use and will
       possibly be lost as low-income housing as these deed restrictions expire. There are no
       identified at risk housing units in the City. No low income housing units in the City
       have been constructed with the use of federal assistance programs, state or local
       October 1, 2013                                                                                            Page 29
mortgage revenue bonds, redevelopment tax increments, in-lieu fees, or inclusionary
housing ordinance or density bonuses. As a result, there is no housing at risk of losing
its subsidized status, and no further discussion of at risk units is required.
III. CONSTRAINTS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION
A variety of factors adds to the cost of housing in Rolling Hills and constrains the
provision of affordable units. These include market, governmental, contractual,
infrastructure, topographic, geologic and environmental constraints. Potential and actual
constraints to the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons
with disabilities also impact housing production and availability.
The extent to which these constraints are affecting the supply and affordability of
housing in the City of Rolling Hills is discussed below.
A. MARKET CONSTRAINTS
The most significant factor affecting the affordability of housing within the City of Rolling
Hills is the market. With the desirability and limited supply of hillside land, houses in a
hillside community like Rolling Hills are highly valued. These costs are further driven by
high construction costs, labor costs, and construction liability concerns.
1. Land Costs
The single largest cost associated with building a new house in Rolling Hills is the cost of
land. Land costs include the cost of raw land, site improvements, and all costs associated
with obtaining government approvals. Like the entire Palos Verdes Peninsula, land costs
are extremely high in Rolling Hills due to its proximity to the Pacific coast, dramatic
rolling hills topography that tends to yield large lots, and opportunities for canyon,
ocean and city views. Average cost for an undeveloped, unimproved parcel of residential
land in the City is $544,000 per acre10.
In addition to raw land costs, site improvements contribute to the cost of land in the
City. The remaining vacant parcels in the City have severe topographic and/or geologic
constraints that would necessitate significant grading to accommodate development. The
extremely high land costs would make construction of lower income housing in the City
impossible without government subsidy. The City has very limited resources because it
is not eligible for state or federal funds. There are no commercial enterprises in the
City, therefore the City does not receive any sales tax income.

22, 2013.
October 1, 2013                                                                                  Page 30
2. Construction Costs
A major cost associated with building a new house is the cost of building materials,
which typically comprise between 50 to 60 percent of the for-sale price of a home.
According to construction industry indicators, overall construction costs rose over 30
percent during the past decade, with rising energy costs and competition for building
materials from oversees markets significant contributors.               Typical residential
construction costs for high quality homes like those found in Rolling Hills are
approximately $330-500 per square foot.              Construction of septic tanks adds
tremendous cost to the construction of homes. Additionally, residential amenities (e.g.,
pools, fire places, porches) and high end construction materials further increase the cost
of construction.
Labor is another major cost component in building a house, constituting an estimated 17
percent of the costs of constructing a single-family dwelling.
The market generally controls construction costs, and types of amenities and
construction materials are generally selected at the discretion of the property owner
and/or developer. However, the City Zoning Ordinance allows for manufactured
housing units that can help to reduce residential construction costs.
3. Financing
Home mortgage interest rates have been at historic lows during the past ten years.
However during the past year, there has been a sharp rise in foreclosures in the
subprime mortgage market. Recent increases in interest rates coupled with declining
property values in the Los Angeles region has caused many home owners to default on
the mortgages. Unable to recoup their investments, a number of lenders have had to
shut down or file for bankruptcy.
This mortgage crisis had made qualifying for a home loan more difficult. Although 30-
year fixed rate mortgages are still available at about 5.0 percent, the income and down
payment requirements are more stringent. There are also fewer flexible loan programs
to bridge the gap between the amount of a required down payment and a potential
homeowner’s available funds.
B. GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Housing affordability is affected by factors in both the private and public sectors. Actions
by the City can have an impact on the price and availability of housing in the City. Land
use controls, site improvement requirements, building codes, fees and other local
programs intended to improve the overall quality of housing may have the unintended
consequence of serving as a constraint to housing development.
1. Land Use Controls
October 1, 2013                                                                             Page 31

Land Use Controls are established by the City's General Plan Land Use Element, Zoning
Ordinance, and Community Association Building Regulations. The Rolling Hills Land
Use Element provides for two residential categories: Residential Agricultural Suburban -
one acre minimum (RA-S-1) and Residential Agricultural Suburban - two acre minimum
(RA-S-2). As summarized in Table 12, building coverage is limited to twenty percent of
the net lot area. Total lot coverage (structures and hardscape) is limited to thirty-five
percent of the net lot area; maximum disturbed area is limited to forty percent of the
net lot area; and building height is restricted to one-story. These development
standards reflect the requirements of the CC&Rs and therefore do not themselves
constrain housing supply.
A minimum of two covered parking spaces are required for each dwelling unit. This
parking requirement can easily be met on the City's large residential parcels. The
parking standard is appropriate given the high number of automobiles per household in
Rolling Hills, and the fact that there are no sidewalks, curbs or gutters on the private
streets which are too narrow to permit on-street parking. The City has implemented in
its Zoning Ordinance standards to allow the development of manufactured homes in its
residential zones.

The City defines a “second unit” as a detached or attached dwelling unit which provides
complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons including permanent
provisions for living, sleeping, cooking, and sanitation, on the same parcel as the primary
residential structure. State law encourages the development of second units on single-
family lots. The City of Rolling Hills permits guest houses, attached or detached to the
October 1, 2013                                                                                                   Page 32

main residence that may have separate living and bath quarters, but not separate kitchen
and dining facilities.
Because of the unique infrastructure, geologic and fire safety constraints within Rolling
Hills, second units may pose adverse impacts on public health, safety and welfare. The
City of Rolling Hills has adopted an ordinance that prohibits second units on single-
family lots; a copy of this ordinance is contained in Appendix A of this document. The
ordinance makes the following findings that specify the adverse impacts on public health,
safety and welfare that would result from allowing second units, and which justify their
preclusion in Rolling Hills:
        Lack of Sewers - Development of second units could potentially double the
         amount of sewage effluent currently entering the soil thereby exacerbating soil
         stability problems.
        Geologic Setting - Numerous active landslides in Rolling Hills greatly diminish
         development potential and call for caution in increasing densities.
        Rural Design and Community Roadway Character - The current capacity, design,
         and topographic constraints of the City roadways indicate increased residential
         densities would compromise road safety.
        Fire Flow Requirements - The introduction of second units in Rolling Hills would
         change the infrastructure requirements on water facilities in the City. The
         California Water Company owns and maintains water lines in the City and the
         Utility has no plans to upgrade the aging water system. Therefore, fire-fighting
         capabilities could be compromised due to aging system, which could result in
         reduction in water pressure.
The existing zoning standards respond to the unique physical, health, and safety aspects
of the City. Based on infrastructure, geologic and environmental constraints, most land
in the City has developed at a density less than that permitted by City zoning.
City land use controls respond to Rolling Hills’ unique topographic, geologic,
infrastructure and contractual constraints. The City General Plan and zoning standards
are considered appropriate to protect the health and welfare of the community, while
complying with Government Code Section 65883(c)(3) to remove or limit where
appropriate and legally possible, governmental constraints to the maintenance,
improvement, and development of housing. City land use controls do not represent a
governmental constraint to the provision of housing.
2. Fees and Improvements
Various fees and assessments are charged by the City and other agencies to cover the
costs of processing permits and providing services and facilities, such as utilities, schools,
and infrastructure. Almost all of these fees are assessed through a pro rata share
October 1, 2013                                                                              Page 33

system based on the magnitude of the residence's impact or on the extent of the benefit
that will be derived.
A summary of residential development fees in the City is presented in Table 13. Costs
required for all residential development projects are indicated. These costs include
various City fees, school impact fees, water service fees, environmental review fees and
a RHCA fee.                Costs required for special circumstances apply to residential
developments requiring greater discretionary reviews.

The majority of City building and plan check fees have remained unchanged for the past
fifteen years, indicating that the fees do not present an excessive constraint to
development.
3. Processing Times
October 1, 2013                                                                                                   Page 34
The City typically requires two to three months to complete the processing of a
residential development application.          This timing complies with the time limit
requirements established by Sections 65943 and 65950 of the Government Code, and
does not present an excessive constraint to development.
4. Fire Safety Standards
As discussed above, effective July 1, 2008, all land in the City of Rolling Hills was
upgraded one level to “Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone” (VHFHSZ). As a result,
several more restrictive fire safety standards have been adopted in the City Building
Code that apply to all new development in the City. The new fire zone designation and
related standards are expected to place additional constraints on new development,
especially higher building costs. However, these standards are mandated by the State,
and were not self imposed by the City.
C. CONTRACTUAL CONSTRAINTS
Development in Rolling Hills is controlled through both City enforced zoning and
privately enforced CC&Rs.           City zoning does not in itself constrain housing
development. Reducing zoning standards or increasing densities would not modify the
development limitations dictated by the CC&Rs, which control density.
Virtually all of the land in Rolling Hills is subject to the CC&Rs established in 1936 by
the Palos Verdes Corporation. Exceptions to CC&R controlled land include the civic
center, fire station site and scattered public open space sites. These CC&Rs set forth
two classifications of property and restrict the development and use of property within
each classification to either only single family or single family and limited public use.
Neither classification allows for the development of multi-family housing or for
commercial, office or industrial activity. The CC&Rs establish minimum parcel and
dwelling unit sizes, and require approval by the RHCA Architecture Committee of all
new development.
D. INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRAINTS
Another factor adding to the cost of new construction is the limited availability of
infrastructure, specifically streets, sewer, storm water and water facilities.
1. Streets
Rolling Hills has no public roads or streets. Use of privately owned roadways requires
approval of the RHCA. The City's privately owned road network is typified by winding
roads with a 15 to 25 foot paved cross-section lacking in curbs, gutters and sidewalks.
October 1, 2013                                                                          Page 35

Narrow road width, coupled with steep grades and private roadways, effectively
precludes public transit within the City. The City's circulation infrastructure is not
conducive to higher density housing.
Because of the steep terrain and geotechnical issues of the Rolling Hills land form, this
constraint is unlikely to be reduced during the current planning period.
2. Wastewater Disposal
With the exception of thirteen residences that have individually or through the creation
of a small sewer district hooked in with adjacent jurisdiction's sewer systems, there is
no sanitary sewer system in Rolling Hills. Residences are served by individual septic
tanks and leach lines. Insofar as the City remains on a septic system, this will prevent
the development of higher density housing, including the construction of second units.
Because of its concern that septic systems hinder development and create potential
water quality issues, the City has retained an engineering firm to assess the feasibility of
a city-wide sewer system. The engineering firm determined that a conventional gravity
sewer system is not feasible in the City and had studied a hybrid approach consisting of
low pressure sewer system and gravity sewer system. The study determined that due to
the terrain and unstable geological conditions of the City the cost of such a system
would be prohibitive for such a small city with limited financial resources. The study was
presented to the residents, and due to the high cost of construction of such a system,
the residents were not interested in funding such a project through an Assessment
District or any other method. Therefore, based on the feasibility study it is very unlikely
that the development constraints associated with wastewater disposal will be removed
during the current planning period.
3. Storm Water Run-off
To comply with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for
Municipal Storm Water and Urban Runoff Discharges Within the County of Los Angles11, the
City has retained an engineering firm to assist the City control run-off from domestic
and construction activities, to implement best Management practices (BMPs), and to
reduce waste. These activities are intended to reduce development constraints
associated with storm water quality.
4. Fire Flow Requirements
As noted above, water infrastructure is owned and maintained by the CA. Water Co.
Additional development beyond that anticipated by the City General Plan would reduce
water pressure and compromise fire fighting capabilities. Because of Rolling Hills’ steep
11
   Order No. 01-182 of the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board as amended by Order R4-
2006-0074.
October 1, 2013                                                                                     Page 36

and varied terrain and aging infrastructure, this constraint is unlikely to be reduced
during the current planning period.
E. TOPOGRAPHIC CONSTRAINTS
Slopes of 25 to 50 percent are present on virtually every remaining undeveloped parcel
in the City. Development on such severely sloped parcels requires substantial
modification to the natural terrain that significantly adds to the cost of development.
The extreme topography present in Rolling Hills serves as a significant constraint to the
development of affordable housing.
F. GEOLOGIC CONSTRAINTS
Expansive soils and geologic hazard conditions continue to place constraints on
development within the City. As depicted in Figure 2, Seismic Hazards, the majority of
land in the City is located in earthquake-induced landslide areas. These are areas where
previous landslide movement has resulted in permanent ground displacement. The
California Division of Mines and Geology designates these areas as seismic hazards
requiring mitigation.
As summarized in the City of Rolling Hills Hazard Mitigation Plan, Rolling Hills is located
very near to the Palos Verdes Fault. In the case of a seismic event on that fault, Rolling
Hills is expected to experience very strong shaking that could be devastating to the City
and the nearby region that provides essential and critical services to the community.
The Newport-Inglewood Fault is located a few miles east of the City of Rolling Hills.
Although not as violent as the Palos Verdes Fault scenario, the shaking in the Newport-
Inglewood Magnitude seismic event would be strong. Due to the proximity of this fault
to the urbanized area of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the City’s essential and critical
service providers could experience long term impacts.
Liquefaction is a secondary effect of earthquake hazards. Liquefaction occurs when
ground shaking causes wet granular soils to change from a solid state to a liquid state.
This results in the loss of soil strength and the soil's ability to support weight. Buildings
and their occupants are at risk when the ground can no longer support these buildings
and structures.
The California Geological Survey has identified areas most vulnerable to liquefaction. In
the City of Rolling Hills, there are numerous identified liquefaction zones and areas
subject to earthquake-induced landslides, as shown on Figures 3 and 4.
Building at the head of a landslide can decrease the bedrock strength along an existing
or potential rupture surface and “drive” the landslide down slope. Improper grading
practices can also trigger existing landslides. Because of these geologic hazards, the City
insists on minimal grading to minimize land disturbance and exacerbation of soils
instability. The danger of increased soil instability, particularly if higher density
development is constructed, would contribute to potential risk to human life as well as
October 1, 2013                                                                              Page 37

to physical structures. The Safety Element of the General Plan sets forth policies to
restrict new development and expansion of existing development in areas susceptible to
landslides.
The City has developed a Site Plan Review Process by which most development must be
reviewed and approved by the City to prevent erosion and landslides and preserve
Rolling Hills’ natural hillside topography. The City’s grading requirements prohibit
extensive grading and recontouring of existing terrain. The City has adopted the County
of Los Angeles grading standards with some modifications necessary to ensure slope
stability. The City requires that all soil from grading be balanced on-site, which is
necessary because export of materials is not practical due to the narrow roadways and
fragile road surfaces. The RHCA also restricts the use of the streets for soil export due
to potential impacts on street condition and public safety. However, export of soil from
excavation activities, such as pools or basements is allowed.
Because of the public safety concerns associated with these geologic conditions, this
constraint is unlikely to be reduced during the current planning period.

G. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS
Rolling Hills supports a wide variety of plant and wildlife. Many of these species are
either listed or considered for listing by the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife and/or
the California Department of Fish and Game. These species include the Palos Verdes
Blue butterfly, the California Gnatcatcher, the Pacific Pocket Mouse, the San Diego
Horned Lizard, and Brackishwater snail. The community is also underlain with blue-line
streams that are under the jurisdiction of the Army Corps of Engineers.
Development that intrudes on these environmental constraints must provide mitigation
satisfactory to the overseeing federal and state agencies. Typical mitigation is the
preservation of habitat area, further restricting the potential land available for
development.
Because of the federal and state regulations restricting development in Rolling Hills, this
constraint is unlikely to be reduced during the current planning period.
H. CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING FOR PERSONS WITH
DISABILITIES
Constraints to the development, maintenance and improvement of housing for persons
with disabilities impact housing production and availability. Recent changes to state law,
including Government Code Sections 65583(a)(4) and 65583(c)(3), address the
provision of accessible housing for disabled persons. These changes require that the
Housing Element include an analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints
upon the maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels
and for persons with disabilities, including land use controls, building codes and their
enforcement, site improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and
local processing and permit procedures. These changes also require that the Housing
Element address methods for removing governmental constraints to the maintenance,
improvement, and development of housing, including housing for all income levels and
housing for persons with disabilities.
Rolling Hills endeavors to accommodate disabled access and to comply with the recent
changes to state law. The City has adopted Resolution 699 that certifies its recognition
of the American with Disabilities Act and adopts necessary mitigation efforts to assist
its disabled residents. The City has adopted the Los Angeles County Building Code. As
long as construction is consistent with the Building Code, residents are permitted to
provide any disabled access or amenity improvements necessary to reduce barriers.
Access to homes via ramps is permitted.
Residential Care Facilities: According to the Rolling Hills Municipal Code, “family”
means:
October 1, 2013                                                                            Page 42

        “Family” means one or more persons living as a single housekeeping unit, as
        distinguished from a group occupying a boarding, rooming or lodging house,
        hotel or club. Family may include domestic servants.
The City permits small residential care facilities that serve 6 or fewer clients in every
residential zone. Regarding business licenses, the City follows California Health and
Safety Code Section 1566.2, for residential facilities with six or fewer persons. The
code says that they shall not be subject to any business taxes, local registration fees, use
permits, fees, or other fees.
IV. HOUSING ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
Housing Element law requires cities to meet both local and regional housing needs.
Rolling Hills’ local housing needs are discussed in Sections II and III above. Rolling Hills’
regional housing needs are established by the Southern California Association of
Governments (SCAG), and are summarized below.
The Housing Plan, presented in Section VI that follows, establishes specific policies and
programs to address these identified housing needs.
A. LOCAL HOUSING ASSESSMENT
Local housing needs, as discussed in Section II, have been identified based on input from
available federal Census and state data, City Planning and Building Department records,
and community input.
Based on this information, Rolling Hills is an affluent community with no affordable
housing needs. However, data regarding special housing needs indicate that the City has
a large elderly population. Although available data suggests that the City’s elderly
population has no housing affordability needs, members of Rolling Hills’ elderly
population may require senior assisted living arrangements. Section II.B.4. of this
Element presents programs for addressing these senior housing needs.
B. REGIONAL HOUSING ASSESSMENT
State law requires jurisdictions to provide for their share of regional housing needs. As
part of the Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA), the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) determines the housing growth needs by income
category for cities within its jurisdiction, which includes the City of Rolling Hills. RHNA
determinations for the City of Rolling Hills during this planning period are presented in
Table 14.
As illustrated in Table 14, Rolling Hills is required to provide adequate sites for the
construction of 6 new dwelling units during this planning period. Of these new units, 1
October 1, 2013                                                                             Page 43

should be affordable to Extremely Low Income households, 1 to Very Low Income
households, 1 to Low Income households, 1 to Moderate income households, and 2 to
above moderate income households.

V. HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES
This section of the Housing Element evaluates the potential additional residential
development that could occur in Rolling Hills pursuant to the General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance. This section also discusses opportunities for energy conservation in resi-
dential development. Potential financial resources available to support the provision of
affordable housing are also summarized.
A. AVAILABILITY OF SITES FOR HOUSING
Consistent with Government Code Sections 65583(a)(3) and 66683.2(h), to assess
future residential development potential in Rolling Hills, an inventory of vacant parcels
has been prepared and evaluated in terms of the actual capability of parcels to
accommodate residential development. In addition, large parcels which are currently
developed but which have the potential for further subdivision have also been evaluated.
With the majority of the City's developable acreage already built out, many of the
remaining vacant parcels are characterized by physical constraints, which preclude their
development. These constraints are primarily related to severe topography and/or
existing landslides.
October 1, 2013                                                                                                Page 44
Figure 5 illustrates the vacant parcels in the City. However, about half of these parcels
have been identified as inappropriate for residential or any other development because
of geologic constraints. Twelve of the vacant parcels in the southern portion of the City
are located in the Flying Triangle area, where new development is prohibited by Los
Angeles County Building Code. Three of the vacant parcels, located in the western
portion of the City, have extreme geological constraints and are developable with single
family residence only. The buildable pad on these lots is very small and could not
accommodate larger developments. All of these parcels are subject to CC&Rs.
Aggregating the development potential on available vacant lots, there are 38 vacant sites
in the City of an average size of one to two acres, with 16 of the sites having geological
or environmental constraints that make development during this planning period
unlikely. Consequently, there are currently 16 vacant parcels available for development.
Some of those also have extreme slopes and only portion of the lots could potentially
be developed. Table 15 quantifies the number of dwelling units, which could be
accommodated on these parcels.
Non-residential properties in Rolling Hills are limited to City Hall and a school district
site that contains a school bus maintenance facility, continuation high school and Palos
Verdes Transit parking facility. Both sites are fully developed as institutional uses.
Neither of these properties are anticipated to be redeveloped within the time frame of
this element. Other governmental owned properties are developed with recreational
uses, and some are located on steeply sloping properties, most without adequate road
access.

B. ABILITY TO MEET RHNA ALLOCATION
1. Housing Supply
As indicated in Table 14 above, the RHNA prepared by SCAG identifies a future
housing need for Rolling Hills of 6 units to be developed over the 2014-2021 planning
period. The residential land inventory for Rolling Hills (Table 15 above) identifies the
potential for a maximum development of 16 additional single-family dwelling units,
indicating the City is able to accommodate its designated share of above moderate
income housing. However, with its limited land and serious geological, infrastructure
and environmental constraints, Rolling Hills is unable to identify suitable sites to
accommodate its regional allocation of Extremely Low, Very Low, Low or Moderate
Income housing.
As discussed in Section I. A. of this Element, development in the community is physically
limited due to its unique land form constraints, which include:
       Steeply sloping hillsides
       Landslide hazards
       Lack of urban infrastructure, specifically sewer
       Danger of wildland fires
       Sensitive animal habitats and species
In addition, new development is further constrained by restrictions of the RHCA
enforceable CC&Rs that run with the property in perpetuity. These CC&Rs have been
in place prior to the City’s incorporation, and continue to restrict development based
on the community’s unique constraints.
2. Housing Affordability
HCD, pursuant to AB 2348 and recent amendments to Housing Element Law,
established a new default methodology to determine the affordability of a housing site or
housing development. Although development in Rolling Hills is severely limited by
geologic, topographic and environmental constraints, HCD placed Rolling Hills in the
same category of cities as much larger urban cities and categorized it as a metropolitan
city. The amendments require that in metropolitan cities a site be zoned to permit at
least 20 dwelling units per acre in order to qualify as a housing site potentially affordable
to households in the Extremely Low, Very Low or Low Income ranges. Alternately, a
city can present market information or provide subsidies to demonstrate the
affordability of a housing site or new development.
Growth in the City of Rolling Hills is limited, and high-density development is severely
constrained by its physical and environmental constraints, as well the RHCA CC&Rs.
The adopted City zoning densities of one or two acre lots is based on infrastructure,
geologic and environmental constraints. In many instances, only a small portion of the
October 1, 2013                                                                              Page 47

one and two acre lots is buildable, with the majority of the land constrained by steep
slopes and canyons.
None of the reasonably available properties in the City of Rolling Hills could realistically
develop at a density greater than 1 unit per acre. Consequently, having completed an
inventory of land that could be suitable for residential development, including vacant
sites and sites having the potential for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship
of zoning and public facilities and services to those sites (Section 85683(a)(3)), the City
of Rolling Hills finds no potential sites that could achieve the HCD default affordability
density of 20 dwelling units per acre.
3. Availability of Public Services and Facilities
As discussed in Section III.D above, infrastructure in the City is limited. New
construction of many of the 16 sites available may not be feasible due to the inability to
construct streets, sewer and water systems to accommodate additional development.
Expansion of these infrastructure systems also is not feasible because topographic and
geologic constraints make such improvements cost prohibitive. In addition, expansion of
infrastructure systems may cause the following adverse impacts on public health, safety
and welfare:
       Geologic Setting - Numerous active landslides in Rolling Hills greatly diminish
        development potential and call for caution in expanding infrastructure and
        increasing densities.
       Rural Design and Community Roadway Character - The current capacity, design, and
        topographic constraints of the City roadways indicate increased residential
        densities would compromise road safety and traffic.
       Fire Flow Requirements – The California Water Company owns and maintains
        water lines in the City and the Utility has no plans to upgrade the aging water
        system. Therefore, fire-fighting capabilities could be compromised due to aging
        system, which could result in reduction in water pressure.
       Lack of Sewer – Most areas of the City are unserved by sewer. Unstable soils
        make the extension of the sewer system extremely challenging.
       Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone – The entire City has been designated by the
        State Fire Marshal as being located in the VHFHSZ. As a result, several more
        restrictive fire safety standards have been adopted in the City Building Code that
        apply to all new development in the City, making housing construction more
        expensive.
C. OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION
Under current law, this Rolling Hills Housing Element must include the following:
October 1, 2013                                                                             Page 48

      Analysis of opportunities for energy conservation with respect to residential
      development. Government Code Section 65583(a)(7).
The California state legislature in 1974 created the California Energy Commission to
deal with the issue of energy conservation. Since that time, the Energy Commission has
set conservation standards for new residential and nonresidential construction. These
standards, known as Title 24, were most recently updated by the Energy Commission
and will be effective January 2014. The new standards, implemented by the City as part
of the recently adopted California Green Building Code, specify energy saving design for
walls, ceilings and floor installations, as well as heating and cooling equipment and
systems, gas cooling devices, conservation standards, and the use of nondepleting energy
sources, such as solar energy or wind power.
Through the Site Plan Review process and the building code for new development or
additions, the City requires energy conservation in buildings and water conservation in
the landscaping areas. The City has adopted a Water Efficient Landscape Ordinance that
requires landscaping be water wise and plants be drought tolerant.
In addition, the Rolling Hills Open Space and Conservation Element establishes a policy
to permit the use of solar panels to maximize energy efficiency. In the past few years,
the City of Rolling Hills has approved 42 solar panel requests from residents. Other
residential energy design standards can be applied to reduce energy costs, including:
            Glazing - Glazing on south facing exterior walls allows for winter sunrays to
             warm the structure. Avoidance of this technique on the west side of the unit
             prevents afternoon sunrays from overheating the unit.
            Landscaping - Strategically placed vegetation reduces the amount of direct
             sunlight on the windows. Incorporation of deciduous trees in the landscaping
             plans along the southern area of units reduces summer sunrays, while
             allowing penetration of winter rays to warm the units.
            Building Design - The implementation of roof overhangs above southerly
             facing windows shield the structure from solar rays during the summer
             months.
            Cooling/Heating Systems - The use of attic ventilation systems reduces attic
             temperatures during summer months. Solar heating systems for swimming
             pool facilities saves on energy costs. Natural gas is conserved with the use of
             flow restrictors on all hot water faucets and showerheads.
            Weatherization Techniques - Weatherization techniques such as insulation,
             caulking, and weatherstripping can reduce energy use for air-conditioning up
             to 55 percent and for heating as much as 40 percent. Weatherization
October 1, 2013                                                                            Page 49

             measures seal a dwelling unit to guard against heat gain in the summer and
             prevent heat loss in the winter.
            Efficient Use of Appliances - Each household contains a different mixture of
             appliances. Regardless of the mix of appliances present, appliances can be
             used in ways that increase their energy efficiency. Unnecessary appliances
             can be eliminated, proper maintenance and use of the stove, oven, clothes
             dryer, clothes washer, dishwasher, and refrigerator can also reduce energy
             consumption. New appliance purchases of air-conditioning units and
             refrigerators can be made on the basis of efficiency ratings. The State
             prepares a list of air-conditioning and refrigerator models that detail the
             energy efficiency ratings of the product on the market.
            Outdoor Lighting Ordinance – Requires most energy efficient lighting for all
             outdoor lighting.
            Efficient Use of Lighting - Costs of lighting a home can be reduced through
             purchase of light bulbs, which produce the most lumens per watt, avoidance
             of multi-bulb mixtures and use of long life bulbs and clock timers on security
             buildings.
In 2008, the City had adopted Resolution No. 1040, providing for a City of Rolling Hills
Natural Environment and Sustainability Committee. The committee was composed of
nine resident members, appointed by the City Council with the purpose to assess and
track the City’s flora and fauna; to develop and recommend environmentally sustainable
policies, practices and programs for Rolling Hills and to provide outreach to residents
and bring in educational programs to the City. However, because Rolling Hills’ residents
are already environmentally conscientious, the Council disbanded the Committee,
finding it was not needed.
As a member of SCAG, the City also participates in the Regional Comprehensive Plan
to achieve a sustainable future. The City is a member of the South Bay Council of
Governments Green Task Force and the City joined ICLEI, which is a membership
association of local governments committed to advancing climate protection and
sustainable development.
The City’s commitment to energy efficiency is carried forward in Section V.C., Housing
Implementation Plan (2014-2021).
D. FINANCIAL RESOURCES
Development of affordable housing in Rolling Hills would require extraordinary financial
assistance. Assuming the other constraints previously discussed could be eliminated,
potential sources of such assistance and the applicability to Rolling Hills must be
examined.
October 1, 2013                                                                            Page 50

   The availability of Federal and State funding sources is subject to many limitations. Many
   types of government assistance are conditioned upon the existence of populations in
   need of assistance or housing stock conditions requiring repair or rehabilitation. The
   absence of in need populations and deteriorated housing in Rolling Hills renders the
   City ineligible for many types of assistance. In addition, high housing values in the City
   preclude the use of the Section 8, Housing Voucher Assistance Payments Program.
   Under that program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
   provides subsidies to landlords under certain conditions. Only housing units with rents
   at or below maximum rent levels set by HUD for each county are eligible to receive
   subsidies. Rents in the City far exceed maximum allowable levels payable under the
   Section 8 Program.
   One source of housing assistance used by many local governments is money derived
   from redevelopment project tax increment. This source is unavailable, however,
   because the City has no redevelopment areas and the absence of blight in the City
   precludes the formation of a redevelopment area. The City's limited financial resources
   further preclude the use of City General Fund monies for housing assistance.
   The absence of federal, state and local funding sources for affordable housing in Rolling
   Hills, coupled with the high cost of land and construction, act as a significant constraint
   to the provision of affordable housing in the City. Private financing of affordable housing
   is also unlikely given the low densities required by the CC&Rs and by the topography of
   the City.
   Since inception of the CDBG program in 1979, the City of Rolling Hills has used its
   CDBG funds to provide over $225,000 to local communities for housing rehab
   programs and for construction of Section 8 housing. Between 2008 and 2011, Rolling
   Hills received a total of $25,331 in CDBG funds, an average of $6,333 per year. The
   City transferred these funds to the City of Rancho Palos Verdes for their Senior
   Citizens Home repair program. However, the cost of administering the CDBG program
   has made it infeasible for the City of Rolling Hills to continue in the program.
   Although many available funding sources would not be available to Rolling Hills at this
   time, Table 16 summarizes potentially available funding sources as a reference to City
   staff and potential developers:

Federal Programs
Section 8                                         Provides rent subsidies to low-income renters. This
                                                  source cannot be used in Rolling Hills because rents on
                                                  housing in the City far exceed maximum rent levels
                                                  required for participation in the program.

Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation                 Provides for payment contracts on units needing
                                                  substantial rehabilitation. This source is inapplicable in
                                                  Rolling Hills because no housing in the City has been
                                                  identified as in need of rehabilitation.

                                                  environmental constraints make the development of

    VI. HOUSING PLAN
    Chapters II to V establish the housing needs, opportunities, and constraints in Rolling
    Hills. The Housing Plan evaluates the accomplishments of the last adopted housing
    element, and then presents the City's eight-year Housing Plan. The Plan sets forth the
    goals, policies, and programs to address Rolling Hills' identified housing needs.
    A. REVIEW OF HOUSING ELEMENT PERFORMANCE TO
    DATE
    State Housing Element law requires communities to assess the achievements of adopted
    housing programs as part of the five-year update to their housing elements. These
    results should be quantified where possible, but may be qualitative where necessary.
    These results need to be compared with what was projected or planned in the previous
    element. Where significant shortfalls exist between what was planned and what was
    achieved, the reasons for such difference must be discussed.
    1. Progress Toward Implementing the 2006-2014 (4th Cycle)
    Housing Element Programs
    The 2006-2014 Rolling Hills Housing Element established programs to address the
    following primary housing goals:
                Provide for housing which meets the needs of existing and future Rolling
                 Hills' residents.
                Maintain and enhance the quality of residential neighborhoods in Rolling Hills.
                Provide housing services to address the needs of the City's senior citizen
                 population.
                Promote housing opportunities for all persons regardless of race, religion,
                 sex, marital status, ancestry, national origin or color.

        housing programs as set forth in the 2006-2014 Housing Element As summarized in
        Table 17, the City has actively pursued avenues for supporting residential development
        and facilitating affordable housing opportunities, despite the overwhelming constraints
        that limit development opportunities in Rolling Hills.

      B. GOALS AND POLICIES
      As part of this General Plan update, the goals and policies of the past Housing Element
      were reviewed as to their appropriateness in addressing the community's housing needs.
      The following goals and policies reflect the City’s continued commitment to actively
      support residential development and avenues for facilitating affordable housing
      opportunities, despite the overwhelming constraints that limit development
      opportunities in Rolling Hills. These policies will serve as a guide to City officials in daily

C. HOUSING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (2014-2021)
The goals and policies set forth in the Housing Element to address the City's housing
needs are implemented through a series of housing programs. The Housing Element
program strategy consists of both programs currently in use in the City and additional
programs to provide the opportunity to adequately address the City's housing needs.
The following section provides a brief description of each program, five-year quantified
objectives, funding source, responsible agency and implementation time frame.
Shared Housing:
Many seniors who prefer to live independently resort to institutionalized living
arrangements because of security problems, loneliness, or an inability to live entirely
independently. Seniors in Rolling Hills have access to two nearby shared housing
programs: Focal Point at the South Bay Senior Services Center in Torrance and the
Anderson Senior Center in San Pedro. Both these centers offer resources to assist
seniors locate roommates interested in sharing housing. These programs make
roommate matches between seniors based on telephone requests. Records on the
number of matches that have occurred during the planning period are not available. The
City will continue to actively market the availability of these shared housing programs by
providing informational brochures at the public counter.
   Quantified Objective: Continue to provide informational brochures advertising
    existing shared housing programs to increase the number of roommate matches
    over the 2014-2021 period.
   Funding Source: City General Fund
   Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
   Implementation Time Frame: Currently on-going (2014-2021)
October 1, 2013                                                                           Page 58

Reverse Mortgage Program:
The most substantial asset of most elderly homeowners is their home, which in Rolling
Hills has increased significantly in value in the past years. But while owning a home in
Rolling Hills may provide a rich asset base, the onslaught of retirement and a fixed
income can cause many elderly homeowners to quickly become income poor. Home
maintenance repairs multiply as the home ages, and with rising costs in home utilities,
insurance, and taxes, housing maintenance often gets deferred.
An alternative option for elderly homeowners is to draw needed income from the
accumulated equity in their homes through a reverse mortgage. A reverse mortgage is
a deferred payment loan or a series of such loans for which a home is pledged as
security. Qualification for the loan is based primarily on property value rather than
income, allowing the elderly homeowner on a fixed income to receive a loan for which
he or she would not otherwise qualify. Most reverse mortgage programs permit
homeowners to borrow up to 80 percent of the assessed value of their property, to
receive needed principal of up to 25 percent of the loan, and then to receive monthly
annuity payments for the life of the loan.
Reverse mortgages may offer a viable financing alternative to many of Rolling Hills'
elderly homeowners. The City provides information to its senior population interested
in pursuing a reverse mortgage.
   Quantified Objective: Continue to offer referral services to seniors interested in
    pursuing a reverse mortgage.
   Funding Source: None necessary.
   Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
   Implementation Time Frame: Currently On-going (2014-2021).
Sewer Feasibility:
Because of its concern that septic systems hinder development and create potential
water quality issues, the City has retained an engineering firm to assess the feasibility of
a city-wide low pressure sewer system. The study determined that due to the terrain
and unstable geological conditions of the City the cost of such a system would be
prohibitive for such a small city with limited financial resources. Therefore, based on the
feasibility study it is very unlikely that the development constraints associated with
wastewater disposal will be removed during the current planning period.
   Quantified Objective:     Continue to consider sewer systems as new technology
    becomes available.
   Funding Source: City General Fund/ Private Assessment District
October 1, 2013                                                                            Page 59

    Responsible Agency: City Manager’s Office.
    Implementation Time Frame: (2014-2021).
Storm Water Runoff:
To comply with the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for
Municipal Storm Water and Urban Runoff Discharges Within the County of Los Angeles12, the
City has retained an engineering firm to assist the City control run-off from domestic
and construction activities, and to reduce waste. These activities are intended to reduce
development constraints associated with storm water quality.
    Quantified Objective: Continue to implement Best Management Practices (BMPs)
     pursuant to NPDES requirements.
    Funding Source: City General Fund.
    Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
    Implementation Time Frame: (ongoing 2014-2021).
Code and CC&R Enforcement:
One factor contributing to the high levels of maintenance of Rolling Hills’ homes and
neighborhoods is the high pride of ownership by its residents. City staff and Los
Angeles County Building Officials continuously assure that relevant City Codes and
regulations are being adhered to. The Architectural Committee of the Association,
under a separate process, also assures consistency with their CC&Rs. In the event that
a violation of City codes or regulations is discovered, City staff works to cure the
violation.
    Quantified Objective: Continue code enforcement efforts.
    Funding Source: General Fund.
    Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
    Implementation Time Frame: Currently Ongoing (2014-2021).

Reasonable Accommodation:
Pursuant to Chapter 671, Statutes of 2091 (SB 520), the City is committed to providing
reasonable accommodation.
    Quantified Objective: Permission of residents to construct modifications as
     required to reduce barriers consistent with the Building Code.
    Funding Source: General Fund.
    Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
    Implementation Time Frame: ongoing 2014-2021.
Energy Conservation:
The City commits to following sustainable development and energy conservation
recommendations of its past Natural Environment and Sustainability Committee and
SCAG. The City has adopted the Green Building Code.
    Quantified Objective: Follow sustainable development and energy conservation
     recommendations of SCAG and the Green Building Code.
    Funding Source: General Fund.
    Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
    Implementation Time Frame: Currently Ongoing (2014-2021)
Facilitate New Construction:
The City will continue to work with and assist housing developers and builders to
enable new housing to be built in the City. The steep hillsides, deep canyons, geologic
hazards and CC&Rs create constraints in the City that require high levels of
cooperation between City staff, developers and builders. Continued cooperation will
facilitate the construction of new housing and to allow the City to attain a feasible
portion of its regional share allotment of new housing.
    Quantified Objective: The development of Rolling Hills’ buildout potential of up to
     16 housing units during this planning period. These potential units satisfies Rolling
     Hills’ 2014-2021 regional share of Above Moderate Income housing.
    Funding Source: General Fund.
    Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
October 1, 2013                                                                           Page 61

   Implementation Time Frame: Currently On-going (2014-2021).
Facilitate Repair and Remodeling Activities:
Landslide damaged homes may continue to conduct remedial repair work on damaged
homes and hillsides in the City. In addition, many homeowners have instigated
extensive home remodeling which has lead to significant increases in the value and
quality of existing housing stock. Both repair and remodeling activities are expected to
continue. City staff has been active in facilitating the permitting process for remodeling
and remedial repair work and will continue to provide this assistance.
   Quantified Objective: Continue to assist all applicants for remodeling and remedial
    repair permits.
   Funding Source: General Fund.
   Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
   Implementation Time Frame: Currently On-going (2014-2021).
Ground Instability:
Continue to explore possible solutions to ground instability problems. Any grading, new
structures and additions require a soils and geology report that proves stability along
with City and County permits. Also, any grading, new structure and additions of more
than one thousand square feet in any 36-month period requires a Site Plan Review and
approval by the Planning Commission and concurrence by the City Council. The City
has developed strict grading practices that limit lot grading to no more than 40 percent
of the lot, and require maintenance of natural slopes. These practices are necessary to
safeguard the public health and safety against ground instability problems.
   Quantified Objective:      Continue to require geologic studies for each new
    development to ensure that land is suitable for construction and that construction
    will not negatively impact adjacent properties.
   Funding Source: City General Fund.
   Responsible Agency: City Planning Department and City Manager's Office.
   Implementation Time Frame: Currently On-going (2014-2021).
October 1, 2013                                                                           Page 62

Housing Repair on Landslide Sites:
The City will continue to allow the remedial repair of damaged structures and remedial
grading in landslide areas with special permits.
   Quantified Objective: Continue to assist all persons qualified.
   Funding Source: General Fund.
   Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
   Implementation Time Frame: Currently On-going (2014-2021).
Fair Housing Program:
As a means of increasing public awareness of legal rights under fair housing laws, the
City provides at its public counter brochures for the Fair Housing Foundation that
advertise services offered by the Foundation, including housing discrimination response,
landlord-tenant relations, housing information and counseling, and community education
programs.
   Quantified Objective: Continue to provide informational brochures at the City Hall
    public counter and on request; and provide information regarding the Fair Housing
    Foundation and services they provide in the citywide newsletter.
   Funding Source: General Fund.
   Responsible Agency: City Planning Department.
   Implementation Time Frame: Currently On-going (2014-2021).
Summary of 2014-2021 Quantified Objectives:
   Number of Units to be Constructed: 16 single-family units
   Number of Units to be Rehabilitated: 0 rehabilitation need
   Number of Units to be Conserved: 693 single-family housing units.
