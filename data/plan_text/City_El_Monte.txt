1. Vision El Monte
   The City of El Monte has a great story to tell. It is a story of a colorful past, a
   vibrant present, and a promising future for the community. For over seven
   generations, families have brought knowledge and traditions to the city from
   around the globe. Tongva, Spanish, Mexican, American, and the Asian Pacific
   peoples have all contributed to El Monte’s history. Despite their international
   origins, El Monte has always been known as a place where its residents share
   common values of family and service.
   Like many cities within the greater metropolitan region, El Monte is at a pivotal
   moment in its history. Civic leaders have the opportunity to forge a lasting and new
   legacy—one that embraces a healthy environment, that recognizes and affirms its
   cultures and places, that cherishes it residents, and that offers people security,
   promise, and a launching point for realizing their dreams. Providing the
   foundations for achieving this promising future is the overriding purpose of the El
   Monte General Plan.
                                                                                           Santa Fe Historical Trail
   The City of El Monte is responding to these challenges. It is revitalizing its
                                                                                           The City of El Monte has always been known
   downtown through a state-of-the-art transit center. The economy is being
                                                                                           as the End of the Santa Fe Trail.
   strengthened and diversified around the industrial, commercial, and financial
   sectors and through education and workforce training. The City is beautifying,
   opening up, and restoring the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo rivers, parks, and
   recreation amenities. Neighborhoods are being improved and strengthened with
   quality housing, community services, and amenities.
   Within this context, Vision El Monte’s future is about creating and sustaining a
   community that appreciates its heritage, respects its cultures, and is a place of hope,
   opportunity, and achievement for the future. These aspirations provide the
   foundation for the El Monte General Plan and provide the impetus for continued
   community engagement and involvement in improving the El Monte community.
                                                                   El Monte General Plan                                              I-1

    Introduction
    Shaping El Monte’s Vision
    The El Monte General
    Plan is a blueprint for
    the improvement of the
    community. Such a
    process required a vision
    and active engagement
    and involvement of City
    leaders,     City     staff,
    residents,        property
    owners,       community
    leaders, the business
    community, and many
    other stakeholders.
    The General Plan update process involved many formal and informal
    interviews with residents, developers, business representatives, and
    community service providers to understand their needs, concerns, and
    aspirations for El Monte. City department representatives, the Planning
    Commission, and City Council were also interviewed to identify key
    planning issues, challenges, and opportunities to improve the City. The
    depth of interviews was necessary to understand and articulate the issues in
    El Monte and aspirations for its future.
    The City Council appointed a General Plan Advisory Committee made up
    of representatives from the community, including businesses, churches,
    schools, community-based organizations, residents, and others. This group
    helped in outreaching to the community and participating with the
    community to form and articulate the community principles, values, and
    priorities that underpin the City’s vision. Its broad membership and
    participation ensured that all community interests were heard. This
    community effort culminated in the community vision for El Monte, which
    was adopted unanimously by City Council and the Planning Commission.
    The City held five community workshops on the topics of land use,
    transportation, parks and recreation, cultural resources, and community
    design, where participants were requested to confirm issues defined
    through earlier phases and discuss how the City should respond to its
    planning challenges. Hundreds of residents participated in these workshops
    and offered ideas for the General Plan. Each Element of the General Plan
    further describes the input and direction received from the workshops and
    its relationship to the Element.

General Plan Vision
The City Council has adopted a broad vision that guides the General Plan
and the guiding themes that clarify the vision. This vision is an anchor for
evaluating priorities and programs and dedicating financial and
administrative resources to City programs. El Monte’s General Plan vision
is further defined by six themes—a friendly and diverse community, a
balanced community, convenient transportation choices, a healthy
environment, a vibrant economy, and sustainable growth.
The City’s vision is:
    A vibrant and safe community that respects its historical and cultural
    diversity and strives to provide a high quality of life through well-designed
    neighborhoods, ample housing opportunities, quality education, park and
    recreational amenities, economic and employment opportunities, and a healthy
    environment.
Theme 1: Friendly and Diverse Community
El Monte will be a friendly and welcoming city that provides a safe
environment; values family, diversity, community; and cherishes, preserves,
and builds on our rich history and culture.
El Monte remains a friendly community, where people desire to put down
roots and build lives—a place that embraces diversity, where generations of
families have lived and many still call home. We support a supportive
environment for our children, places where our families gather together,
and a broad range of housing and safe neighborhoods for residents. Our
network of churches, quality schools, civic groups, quality community
services, and residential neighborhoods create a caring setting for families.
The El Monte community is bound together by our strong sense of family,
culture, and commitment to help one another achieve a better future. We
cherish the opportunities to weave together and celebrate the richness and
diversity of our community. In the end, we recognize that El Monte’s
greatest assets are its people, who are committed to visioning a better
future, taking on challenges to capitalize on opportunities, and working
together to build a better life for our families and neighbors.
                                                                El Monte General Plan I-3

    Introduction
    Theme 2: Balanced Community
    El Monte will have a balance of safe and stable neighborhoods, quality parks
    and recreational facilities, thriving business and job opportunities, shopping
    and entertainment, and excellent schools.
    El Monte aspires to be a balanced community that offers beautiful and
    stable neighborhoods served by ample parks and recreation opportunities.
    Quality is evidenced in well-designed housing, commercial and industrial
    uses, landscaping, urban design, and civic uses. A balanced community
    supports a strong economy and job base that provides ample revenues to
    support services and the opportunity to achieve a higher standard of living.
    El Monte neighborhoods offer quality housing and services that foster a
    high quality of life for residents of all ages and incomes.
    El Monte offers quality community services, police and fire service,
    libraries, parks, and recreation. Safe schools and high quality education
    provide opportunities for our residents. We support our local schools and
    the positive role they play in our children’s lives. El Monte invests in
    infrastructure so that adequate water, transportation, and other community
    services are maintained for future generations. Providing a high quality of
    life and balanced community will instill pride among residents and denote
    El Monte as a desirable place to live, work, learn, and enjoy their lives.

Theme 3: Convenient Transportation Choices
El Monte will be a city where people can easily and safely access community
facilities and services by convenient transportation choices that efficiently
connect El Monte to the region.
El Monte is noted for its excellent access to freeways, roadways and regional
transit opportunities, including commuter rail, bikeway, and transit hubs.
As the transportation hub of the San Gabriel Valley, El Monte recognizes
the importance of an efficient transportation system to its regional role and
future prosperity, and thus supports efforts to maintain and improve the
ability and convenience of residents, business, visitors, and workers to
travel to and from our community through multiple transportation modes.
El Monte will create a balanced, integrated multimodal transportation
system. This vision embraces the notions that streets should be pedestrian
and bicycle friendly, fully accessible to people with disabilities, and be safe
for walking to schools, commercial centers, neighborhoods, and parks; that
traffic should be effectively managed to reduce impacts to neighborhoods
and improve public safety; that public transit choices should increase the
availability of and use of transit; and that pedestrian and bicycle paths
should encourage walking, bicycling, and connections to amenities.

    Introduction
    Theme 4: Healthy Environment
    El Monte is committed to restoring and preserving its rivers and open
    spaces, providing adequate parks, promoting connections with the natural
    environment, and fostering healthy lifestyles.
    El Monte was originally known as the wooded place between the rivers. The
    Rio Hondo and San Gabriel Rivers that encircled it drew people to the area,
    provided habitat for plant and animal life, supplied water for agriculture,
    and offered recreational opportunities. With postwar suburbanization,
    urban development gradually replaced many of these natural assets, leading
    to a loss of environmental resources, a decline in recreational opportunities,
    and unintended impacts that affect our quality of life.
    We are committed to restoring our natural environment and history. This
    vision is to be achieved through a balance of parks and open space, a
    healthy urban forest, and trails and connections between parks. These open
    space resources will promote a healthy lifestyle for our residents. The City
    is also committed to restoring and creating the Emerald Necklace of parks,
    providing open space and recreational resources. This commitment extends
    to protecting our neighborhoods from the impacts of urbanization, cleanup
    of industrial activities, and promotion of clean air, water, and soil.
I-6 El Monte General Plan
Theme 5: Vibrant Economy
El Monte supports a prosperous economy that fosters a range of business, an
entrepreneurial spirit, ample job opportunities, a competitive and trained
workforce, and excellent standard of living.
El Monte’s economy provides the tax base for sustaining exemplary services
and investment. The Northwest Industrial Area will be the industrial and
manufacturing base; Flair Park will be the professional office district; and
commercial areas will provide regional and neighborhood commercial uses
for residents. El Monte downtown will be the governmental, cultural, and
commercial core, linked to the greater metropolitan area. With its transit
amenities and strategic location, El Monte aspires to become a hub of retail,
commercial, and business activity.
El Monte’s prosperity depends on its people, their skills, and a competitive
and healthy workforce. The City supports an entrepreneurial spirit that
fosters investment in local business, real estate, and community. We
support high quality education that provides our children the foundation
for learning, opportunity, and advancement. To keep pace with changing
workplace needs, we support workforce training through adult education.
Theme 6: Sustainable Growth
El Monte will grow in a sustainable way, preserving and enhancing
neighborhoods while fostering revitalization and quality development in
downtown and along commercial corridors.
El Monte has been defined by growth and change. From our agricultural
roots, our economy has diversified into manufacturing, goods movement,
commerce, and services. Neighborhoods have transitioned from rural areas
to suburban residential developments. Our transportation system connects
El Monte to the greater Los Angeles area. Our quality of life and future role
in the San Gabriel Valley depend on how we guide and facilitate change to
capitalize on new opportunities, while preserving the best of El Monte.
We support quality and well-designed housing, commercial and industrial
uses, landscaping, urban design, and civic uses, which enhance our city.
The City directs and coordinates growth and redevelopment in a
comprehensive manner, avoiding incremental and uncoordinated decision
making that lacks vision. Growth is targeted: housing and business is
directed to commercial corridors and the downtown, reinvestments are
made in industrial and commercial areas, and neighborhoods are protected
and enhanced with quality housing and services.
                                                         El Monte General Plan I-7

    Introduction
    Implementing the Vision
    The General Plan is all about implementing the City’s vision to improve
    the quality of life in the community. This is accomplished by setting a
    series of goals, policies, and programs and by consistently and correctly
    using them in making everyday decisions.
    THE ROLE OF THE GENERAL PLAN
    California law requires every city to adopt a comprehensive, long-term
    General Plan to guide the physical development of its community. The El
    Monte General Plan is a comprehensive plan, since it applies to and affects
    all territory within the boundary of the community. It is comprehensive
    because it addresses a wide range of municipal issues ranging from the
    City’s physical development, to the provision of services, to other concerns
    that affect quality of life. Finally, the General Plan is considered a long-
    term plan because it looks 20 years or more into the future.
    The General Plan serves the El Monte community by:
        Defining priorities and the course of action for decision making.
        Balancing the interests of residents, business, and visitors.
        Serving as a tool and guide to evaluate development proposals.
        Helping to allocate resources and manage municipal affairs.
        Furthering the public’s health, welfare, and quality of life.
    El Monte’s General Plan has taken years to develop and complete. It has
    been approximately 20 years since the plan was last updated and close to 30
    years since the fundamental course of action was set. Over that time, the El
    Monte has grown by more than 50,000 residents, the economy has
    undergone several complete cycles, and the community’s core values and
    vision has transformed. Because of these changes, this General Plan is
    designed to be a call to action and provide specific policy direction that will
    guide the future of El Monte for years to come.
    This General Plan contains elements required under state law: Land Use,
    Circulation, Housing, Conservation and Open Space, Safety, and Noise.
    The General Plan also contains four optional elements. Since
    redevelopment is critical for El Monte’s future, an Economic Development
    Element is included. As community aesthetics have become an issue, a
    Community Design Element is included. The Cultural Resources Element
    seeks to restore and building on our heritage. And the Health and Wellness
    Element provides policies to improve the health of our residents.
I-8 El Monte General Plan

To effectively implement the General Plan, we must know what its goals,
policies, and implementation plans are and the relationship and limitations
of each part. Each element contains at least one goal statement followed by
related policy statements, which are further implemented by programs.
Without goals and policies, programs are simply reacting to a circumstance,
and without programs, goals and policies cannot be implemented. The
following provides an example of how each component works.
General Plan goals are the broadest statement of community values. They
state generalized ideals to provide direction for action. For example, the
following goal visions a future for El Monte that is:
GOAL 1:          A safe, aesthetically pleasing, and unified community
                 appearance within the context of distinct districts and
                 neighborhoods.
The essence of the General Plan is in its policy statements. Often, the
tendency is to look for specific actions or projects to implement to achieve
without understanding the role of policies. General Plan policies further
refine the goal statements, and guide the course of action the City must take
to achieve the goals in the plan. In certain cases, the General Plan will
contain policies that appear more prescriptive in nature and are almost
strategies for action. For example:
Policy 1.1       Require public landscaping along streets, sidewalks, and
                 property frontages and in public spaces to strengthen the
                 City’s identity.
General Plan policies are implemented through programs that describe
steps necessary to achieve a policy and that define the level of commitment
to be executed. Programs provide the basis for establishing priorities,
scheduling, and assigning staff and other resources to specific actions
needed to implement the policies of the Plan. For example:
Program 1.1      Create a streetscape plan addressing landscaping, signage,
                 lighting, and special design features along Durfee Road.
Putting this altogether, the City’s goal is to create a safe, pleasing, and
unified community appearance. Given that public right-of-ways are one of
the more visible reminders of community image, a key policy is to require
public landscaping along public right-of-ways. To ensure that the public
landscaping is beautiful and cohesive, the program is to create a streetscape
plan that prescribes how to accomplish the policy along a specific roadway.
                                                          El Monte General Plan I-9

     Introduction
     IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN
     The Implementation Programs describe the actions to be taken by the City
     to carry out the goals and policies defined by the General Plan. They
     contain numerous programs to support the goals and policies of individual
     elements and support the vision of the general plan. The implementation
     items are not adopted as part of the El Monte General Plan, but the
     programs are critical to achieving the vision of the community.
     The Implementation Programs also allow decision makers to understand
     the importance of different programs and the relative priority in advancing
     the long-term goals of the community. They inform City decision making
     for other related planning efforts, such as Redevelopment Implementation
     Plans, Capital Improvement Plans, and even the annual budgeting process.
     When used correctly, the General Plan can be the single most powerful tool
     for effecting long-term change within the community.
     AMENDING THE PLAN
     California Government Code Section 65400 requires the City to annually
     review the General Plan and the corresponding Implementation Plan. An
     annual report should be prepared for review and approval by the City
     Planning Commission and City Council and forwarded to the State Office
     of Planning and Research and the State Housing and Community
     Development office on or before October 1 of each year. Information and
     suggestions for preparing the annual review report can be found in the State
     of California General Plan Guidelines.
     In summary, the annual review report is intended to provide information
     on how the General Plan is being implemented; any necessary course
     adjustments or modifications to the General Plan needed to improve
     implementation; the correlation between land use decisions made and
     existing objectives, policies, and tools; the progress made in meeting the
     City's share of regional housing needs pursuant to California Government
     Code Section 65584; and the City's efforts to remove constraints to the
     maintenance, improvement, and development of housing.
     As a living document, the General Plan is reviewed and periodically
     amended to reflect changes in the housing market, the economy, etc.
     Should individual chapters require amendment, the proposed changes can
     be proposed up to four times per year after noticed public hearings.

2.       Community Design Element
   Introduction
   Vision El Monte… a community of beauty, with greenways, stands of
   trees, and flowers; a sense of place, with distinct and well-designed
   neighborhoods and districts; a community defined by and linked to its
   rivers, schools, parks, and the downtown through attractive paths and
   streets—a destination.
   CREATING GREAT PLACES
   The Community Design Element is not a passive document, but rather a
   call to action to reinvent El Monte’s image and identity through tangible
   design improvements to its physical environment. El Monte’s goals are to:
       Create a distinct sense of place—building and restoring places,
        districts, neighborhoods, and natural features that make El Monte a
        special and distinct community.
       Create a quality built environment—ensuring architecture of lasting
        value and beauty in public, commercial, industrial, and residential areas
        throughout the community.
       Strengthen connections—making and strengthening convenient, safe,
        and attractive links to El Monte’s schools, parks, neighborhoods,          Creating Great Places
        commercial areas, and rivers.
                                                                                   El Monte is creating great places to work,
       Beautify the natural environment—helping El Monte achieve its legacy       relax, and live in the community.
        of an attractive city of green spaces and trees while fostering better
        health with walkable streets, great parks, and accessible facilities.
                                                             El Monte General Plan                                         CD-1

     Community Design Element
     PURPOSE OF COMMUNITY DESIGN ELEMENT
     El Monte realizes that it must act now to affect its future identity. The City
     aspires to recapture its rich legacy through the built environment, and the
     Community Design Element is best suited to guide this goal. The
     Community Design Element reflects the importance placed on shaping
     community identity through carefully guided public and private
     development. Although not required by state law, the City believes a solid
     Community Design Element sets an important precedent and serves as a
     guide for how to improve the physical design and appearance of El Monte.
     The Community Design Element’s primary intent is to establish citywide
     policy guidance on how to improve the built and natural environment and,
     secondarily, to provide more specific policy guidance for districts. The
     Community Design Element serves as the policy foundation for the City’s
     project review process and as a guidance document for all design-related
     planning efforts. It is meant as a reference for decision makers, planners,
     architects, builders, and residents to understand how the different parts of
     the City work together to achieve its overall image and identity.
     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Community Design Element is closely related to other elements of the
     General Plan. For instance, the Community Design Element examines how
     the urban form policies in the Land Use Element, the circulation patterns
     established by the Circulation Element, and the parks and open space
     elements in the Park and Recreation Element fit together to create a unified
     image and design for El Monte. The Community Design Element provides
     a framework for understanding the different districts and parts of El Monte
     and linking them together into a coherent whole.
     As the General Plan is a policy document, the Community Design Element
     is implemented through more detailed residential and nonresidential
     design guidelines and specifications—architectural standards, landscape
     palettes, urban forestry plans, and streetscape improvement plans that
     provide guidance for the preferred design of buildings, landscaping,
     streetscapes, and public spaces. These implementation measures must be
     consistent with the goals and policies in the Community Design Element
     and are included as key General Plan implementation programs.

EL MONTE SPEAKS
The City El Monte is a community of great pride, multiple identities, and
diverse land uses. At the hub of the San Gabriel Valley and accessible from
two major freeways, it is one of the area’s most established communities. In
the 1950s and 1960s the San Gabriel Valley, including El Monte,
experienced significant housing, commercial, and industrial growth. The
rapid growth experienced during this time replaced much of the City’s rural
and historical fabric (agriculture, barrios, historical structures, etc.).
Nevertheless, El Monte’s community assets are many. The City boasts an
Emerald Necklace of rivers, quality neighborhoods, a historic Downtown,
burgeoning office and industrial parks, a vibrant cultural center, and other
destinations. El Monte also has a rich culture and history unique to cities in
the San Gabriel Valley. It is therefore essential to strengthen El Monte’s
design and acknowledge its heritage to help achieve the City’s vision to be a …
    …vibrant and safe community that respects its historical and cultural
    diversity and strives to provide a high quality of life through well-designed
    neighborhoods…park and recreational amenities…and a healthy
    environment.
City outreach efforts helped identify what residents regard as the most                 Statue of Liberty
important community design issues. Foremost among their ideas was a                     The Statue of Liberty and the World War II
simple and powerful message—make El Monte a special place of beauty.                    Memorial stand proudly at City Hall.
These efforts, along with extensive interviews with City staff and officials,
produced many community design goals, most notably:
   A beautiful City with extensive trees, open spaces, landscaping, and safe
    and well-maintained parks.
   Attractive commercial arterials with consistent landscaping, signage,
    and street furniture that add to the beauty of the community.
   Well-maintained residential neighborhoods with guidelines for
    compatible development and pedestrian amenities.
   Well-landscaped pedestrian connections to schools, parks, and retail
    centers that are safe for families and individuals of all ages and abilities.
   Detailed architecture that combines the best of the City’s historical and
    contemporary design.
   A vibrant, attractive downtown with convenient access, comfortable
    amenities, and a variety of activities.
                                                                  El Monte General Plan                                            CD-3

                                                 Community Design Context
                                                 COMMUNITY DESIGN FEATURES
                                                 El Monte’s community design encompasses its total built environment—its
                                                 buildings, public spaces, neighborhoods, and streetscapes—and how they
                                                 relate to one another to create a distinctive identity. This section identifies
                                                 key design elements in El Monte that provide a foundation for goals,
                                                 policies, and programs to improve community design in El Monte.
                                                 Landmarks
                                                 Visually prominent buildings, special geographic features, architectural
                                                 themes, historic structures, and important cultural centers establish a
                                                 special sense of place in a community. Important design considerations for
                                                 landmarks include preservation, views, and access. El Monte’s major
                                                 landmarks include the Santa Fe Trail Park, the Statue of Liberty, the
                                                 Community Center/Historical Society Museum, Gay’s Lion Farm
                                                 Monuments, the El Monte Water Tower, and many others.
                                                 Post–World War II suburbanization erased much of the physical remnants
                                                 of El Monte’s past. In a City where historical and cultural heritage lives
                                                 more in the memories of its people than in its urban fabric, the City must
                                                 assume a leadership role in cultural and historical resource preservation.
                                                 The City has the unique privilege to acknowledge and embody important
                                                 remnants of this legacy, preserving remaining historical features, and
                                                 setting up a mechanism to ensure that future resources are preserved.
   Gay’s Lion Landmark
                                                 Corridors and Paths
   El Monte’s landmarks, such as the Gay’s lion
   pictured above, are a memorable reflection of El Monte’s corridors and paths are vital to the way its people view and
   its diverse and colorful past.                interact with their environment. Traversed by major highways, El Monte’s
                                                 identity has been profoundly influenced by infrastructure. The City’s main
                                                 north and south corridors are Peck Road, Tyler Avenue, Santa Anita
                                                 Avenue, and Durfee Road. Major east and west roads are Garvey Avenue,
                                                 Ramona Boulevard, and Lower Azusa Road. With its many neighborhoods,
                                                 districts, and commercial centers, connections are of great importance.
                                                 The Community Design Element seeks to establish, improve, or complete a
                                                 well-defined series of connections in the City. Residents must be able to
                                                 walk easily and safely to schools, parks, and other neighborhood amenities.
                                                 There should be connections between residential areas, the Downtown,
                                                 employment and recreation centers. The City’s Emerald Necklace is an
                                                 important cornerstone of the City’s network of multi-use trails and paths.
CD-4                                             El Monte General Plan

Employment Districts
El Monte contains different employment districts, each with its own special
characteristics due to location, historical character, economic role, and
other attributes. Whether they are historic districts, business parks, or
downtowns, these employment districts serve specific purposes and add
variety and identity to El Monte. El Monte’s major nonresidential districts
are the Downtown, Auto District, Flair Park, Northwest Industrial Area,
and major commercial anchors/centers throughout the community.
The Community Design Element intends to help enhance the identity,
beauty, and access to these areas to achieve economic, aesthetic, recreation,
and cultural goals of El Monte. In residential areas where neighborhood
centers do not exist, the goal is to create centers built around joint-use
park/school sites that offer education, recreation, and community services.
In commercial and industrial areas, the goal is to utilize design principles to
maximize economic activity, pedestrian access, and sustainability. This

Residential neighborhoods are a fundamental part of the City and their
condition defines residents’ quality of life and public perception of El
Monte. Each neighborhood is differentiated by architecture, culture,
history, development patterns, and housing types. Some contain historic
features that harken to El Monte’s past. The Community Design Element
identifies the City’s distinct neighborhoods as Downtown, Mountain View,
Norwood-Cherrylee, Arden Village, Park El Monte, and River East.
Recognizing the importance of the City’s neighborhoods, the Community
Design Element sets forth goals to address neighborhood design and
enhance their identity. Policies are identified to address neighborhood
scale, the creation of an activity center in each neighborhood, and
improvement of streetscapes, parks, and open space. The element also
focuses on general principles of single-family, multiple-family, and mixed-
use residential projects from which design guidelines can be drafted.
Architecture
The City of El Monte has a range of architectural styles and influences.
Several neighborhoods contain intact examples of early 1900s revival styles,
such as Spanish Colonial and Craftsman bungalows. Its commercial areas
feature a visually diverse range of post–World War II functional
architecture with relatively few significant historic buildings. With this
diverse architectural base, the City does not impose a particular style or
design theme, nor is one particular style desired or practical.

                                                   Community Design Element
                                                   Residents have expressed the need for architectural guidelines emphasizing
                                                   the principles of sustainability, durability, aesthetic quality, functionality,
                                                   and context sensitivity. The application and weight of each principle differs
                                                   depending on the type of development (residential, commercial, or
                                                   industrial). The Community Design Element provides policy guidance for
                                                   building designs that promotes architecture of lasting value and beauty in
                                                   public, commercial, and residential areas.
                                                   Activity Nodes and Centers
                                                   Activity nodes and centers are concentrations of uses that provide vibrancy,
                                                   convenience, and variety for residents, visitors, and businesses. The
                                                   Downtown contains several activity centers, including the cultural center,
                                                   Aquatic Center, governmental center, Main Street, auto dealers, Metrolink
                                                   station, and transit station. Activity centers outside the Downtown include
                                                   Five Points and other scattered areas in El Monte.
                                                   Each of these activity nodes and centers serves a variety of roles in the
                                                   community: economic, recreational, social, transportation, and cultural.
                                                   The City’s overarching design goal is to make each of these activity centers

                                                   The City of El Monte is framed by the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel

Goals and Policies
This section sets forth community design goals at the city, district, and
neighborhood level. The first five goals address how to set El Monte apart
from neighboring cities by setting policies to promote community-wide
design. The next three goals focus on improving key commercial districts in
El Monte—the Downtown, Flair Park, and Northwest Industrial District.
The final goal area addresses how to improve the design of neighborhoods.
COMMUNITY IDENTITY
Creating a distinct community identity is fundamental for El Monte. This
can have many different meanings, each reflecting individual perceptions
regarding neighborhoods, safety, aesthetics, parks, and other amenities.
Although El Monte’s identity means different things to different people, it
is shaped by common influences. Some of the more notable influences are
its people, their history and cultures, the physical and natural environment,
and the City’s collective vision of the future.
El Monte’s identity dates back to the Tongva, who were sustained by the
                                                                                 El Monte Logo

its imprint on El Monte. Today, the City’s image is uniquely diverse.
To shape a new identity for El Monte, the General Plan Vision builds on
the core strength of the community—its people and their commitment. The
General Plan seeks, through the implementation of a wide variety of
physical and governance improvements, to create a vibrant and safe city
that respects its historical and cultural diversity and strives to provide a
high quality of life through well-designed neighborhoods, parks and
recreational amenities, and a healthy environment.
El Monte is forging a unified community identity by restoring key features
of its past, revitalizing strategic areas, and positioning itself for the next
twenty years. The City will draw upon its multiple strengths to enhance its
image and identity—its indigenous roots, pioneer spirit, agricultural
heritage, suburban growth, and environmental legacy. These efforts are
intended to revive and improve El Monte’s unique identity and image to
residents, visitors, and the business community.

COMMERCIAL STREETSCAPES
El Monte has often been referred to as “the end of the Santa Fe Trail.” The
City has always been a place of passage and a destination and its landscape
is defined by its transportation infrastructure. Commercial corridors are
one of the most prominent features traversing the community. The
condition of the streetscape—its signs, landscaping, lighting, and other
aspects—define the image and identity of El Monte. What better way, then,
to strengthen community identity than to beautify commercial roadways?
In creating a positive image of the city, El Monte must address:
    Corridor Identity. The City can enhance the identity of well-known
     arterials through a thematic approach recognizing its contemporary and
     historical role. Valley Boulevard is the historic spine of the City;
     Ramona Boulevard was a corridor for the Red-Line Cable Cars; Santa
     Anita Avenue affords some of the City’s best views; and Tyler Avenue
     links the Downtown to the cultural center.                                  Commercial Streetscape
    Functional Needs. Although the auto dominates many roads, many El           Sign regulation, street trees, street lights, and
     Monte residents and workers walk to school, work, or shopping and           undergrounding of utilities would greatly
     desire a more pleasant street environment. Completing sidewalks and         improve the visual quality of many commercial
                                                                                 corridors.
     crosswalks, ensuring that walkways can accommodate people of all
     abilities, providing shade trees, installing quality street furniture, and
     other projects will create a more positive experience for users.
    Public Landscaping. Public landscaping and trees can soften the
     hardscape of commercial corridors and, if properly designed, invoke El
     Monte’s image and heritage as a wooded place. However, the majority
     of corridors lack consistency and quality of green infrastructure. Proper
     landscaping should take into account roadway function, its
     characteristics, desired visual image, and maintenance requirements.
    Signage and Lighting. El Monte’s streets are dotted with signs and
     lighting of varying shapes, sizes, and quality. While signage and
     lighting fulfills a vital informational role, unregulated signs clutter
     streetscapes and are a blighting influence. Moreover, signs and lighting
     should be sensitive to their intended use, with careful consideration of
     height, placement, materials, colors, and consistency.
This Element seeks to improve the image of its commercial corridors
through a comprehensive streetscape program. The following goals and
policies establish the framework to build on historical and contemporary
qualities of each corridor and institute capital improvements necessary to
transform the image of El Monte’s commercial corridors. In this way, major
arterials will present an attractive and unified image of El Monte.

                                                           Community Design Element
      Goal CD-2
      Attractive commercial corridors exemplified by consistency of hardscape,
      landscaping, signage, sidewalks, and other treatments appropriate to their
      context to foster a pleasant driving and pedestrian experience.
      Policies
      Corridor Identity
      CD-2.1    Streetscape Intent. Balance the achievement of the functional,
                design, pedestrian, and aesthetics goals and policies for
                commercial corridors as set forth in the Circulation and Parks
                and Recreation Elements.
      CD-2.2    Streetscape Design. Incorporate unifying and consistent
                elements for major arterials—landscaped parkways and medians,
                regularly spaced street trees, distinctive street lighting and
                furniture, and quality and appropriately scaled signage.
      CD-2.3    Corridor Themes. Cultivate a recognition and appreciation of
                the City’s history in its major commercial corridors named after
                founders and important individuals in the history of El Monte,
                through a public banner and sign program.
      Functional Purposes
      CD-2.4    Roadway Capacity. Ensure that roadways are appropriately sized
                with adequate traffic management devices to allow for the smooth
                and safe flow of traffic consistent with the function and
                performance standards set forth by the Circulation Element.
      CD-2.5    Corridor Driveways. Consolidate driveways and access points,
                wherever feasible, along commercial corridors to improve traffic
                flow, and safety of user, and allow for coordinated improvements
                to the streetscape.
      CD-2.6    Pedestrian Design. Improve pedestrian safety and comfort along
                major corridors by incorporating wider sidewalks, appropriate
                landscape buffers and canopy trees, and other pedestrian
                amenities to facilitate a walkable street environment.
      CD-2.7    Corridor Function. Support the functional classification of
                roadways as identified in the Circulation Element by requiring
                appropriate design treatments for each classification.
CD-12 El Monte General Plan

Public Landscaping
CD-2.8   Landscaping. Beautify corridors through specialized landscape
         palettes tailored to different roadway configurations. Require the
         incorporation of street trees of sufficient size, canopy, and
         diversity along roadways.
CD-2.9   Enhanced Intersections. Provide appropriate landscaping
         coverage and other design enhancements at major intersections
         (e.g., Valley Boulevard and Santa Anita) to denote critical
         intersections or entry points into districts.
CD-2.10 Landscaped Medians. Provide medians with landscaping where
         the right-of-way exists; where it does not exist, condition the
         improvement of projects on the provision of right-of-way.
Signage and Lighting
CD-2.11 Regulation. Beautify corridors by regulating the appearance and
         placement of commercial signs, billboards, and utility lines, and
         removing or consolidating other distracting appurtenances
         wherever feasible to present a unified corridor image.
CD-2.12 Public Signage. Establish a comprehensive signage plan that
         identifies City entries, street names, public facilities, parks, multi-
         use trails, transit stations, and key districts.
CD-2.13 Context Sensitivity. Require appropriately scaled signs based on
         different uses—clean monument signage for commercial centers;
         informational signs for roadways; and smaller-scale, customized,
         pedestrian-oriented signs for districts.
CD-2.14 Sign Quality. Prohibit signs that incorporate blinking or flashing
         elements, pole structures, roof signs, or temporary lettering or
         structures; require the use of high quality materials,
         complementary colors, and nondistracting lighting.
CD-2.15 Telecommunications. Regulate the development, operation, and
         maintenance of wireless facilities to ensure such facilities promote
         aesthetically innovative designs, are appropriately located to
         protect visual character and viewsheds, and prevent the
         emergence and proliferation of visual blight within the City.

                                                PUBLIC LANDSCAPING
                                                El Monte’s name derives from its legacy as a meadow and wooded place.
                                                The San Gabriel River and Rio Hondo River flowing from the mountains
                                                fed marshes and provided habitat for rich riparian woodland. However,
                                                today much of El Monte’s greenery consists of nonnative species. Restoring
                                                some of this original natural environment and integrating it into the
                                                modern suburban landscape of El Monte is therefore a key goal.
                                                Opportunities for public landscaping and greening El Monte are numerous.
                                                El Monte can beautify its public rights-of-way, parks, and streetscapes. The
                                                beauty of public landscaping lies in its diversity and potential for
                                                enhancing community design. It can be decorative, as in landscaped
                                                medians and gateways; functional, as in providing shady canopy trees; and
                                                symbolic, as in the choice of historical or indigenous species. El Monte is
                                                working actively to update and improve its landscaping program, and has
                                                developed various streetscape improvement programs along major arterials.
                                                Highlighted in the Parks and Recreation Element, the City of El Monte will
                                                address the following components in recreating a green environment:

                                                   Parks. Create a network of community and neighborhood parks
                                                    throughout each neighborhood to beautify neighborhoods and offer
                                                    opportunities for recreation.
                                                   Community Garden. Plant community gardens, where feasible, that
                                                    offer opportunities to plant vegetables, fruits, and flowers and foster
                                                    neighborhood interaction.
                                                   Linear Parks. Create the Emerald Necklace of linear parks, open space,
                                                    water resources, and recreational resources along the banks of the Rio
                                                    Hondo and San Gabriel Rivers.
                                                Within the above context, the following goal and policies are designed to
                                                encourage and require public landscaping, to the extent possible, to create a
                                                more livable, beautiful, and healthy environment for residents.

                                                            Community Design Element
      ARCHITECTURAL QUALITY
      El Monte realizes that great buildings reflect lasting quality and design.
      Architectural quality helps define the perception of the community by
      residents, businesses, and visitors. Too often in the past, projects were
      approved without the guidance of agreed-upon design principles, resulting
      in projects that have not withstood the test of time. Because of this,
      residents, policymakers, and businesses have expressed a strong desire to
      establish architectural guidelines to ensure quality development.
      For this reason, the City’s goal is to encourage high-quality architecture
      through adherence to the following principles.
         Quality Materials. Building materials should be high quality and
          natural materials, such as stucco, plaster, stone, and wood surfaces.
          Housing should not have reflective glass, glossy surfaces, or poor
          imitation materials.
         Durability. Materials and design of structures should be highly durable
          (without sacrificing aesthetics) and be capable to withstand weather,
          use, and time.
         History. Building construction should consider thoughtful integration
          of historical elements that have shown durability and are positively
          acknowledged by the community.
         Aesthetics. Structural appearance should incorporate thoughtful,
          aesthetically pleasing design in rooflines, facades, entryways, building
          orientation, and site layout.
         Functionality. Buildings must de designed in a manner to fulfill
          functional needs, whether of housing, business, or industry, including
          size of units, parking needs, and other accommodations.
         Sustainability. Structures should be of a sustainable design, with
          attention to resource conservation or reuse, energy conservation, water
          efficiency, and other practices.
      Quality architecture, by itself, does not create quality neighborhoods,
      commercial, or industrial districts. Site layout of individual properties, the
      street design and relationship of the building to the street, landscaping of
      properties, and other design considerations are important. Nonetheless,
      requiring quality architecture does set a precedent that the City is
      committed to improving the aesthetics of the community. The following
      goal and policies help define general principles of design. Subsequent
      sections address design issues for specific subareas of the community.
CD-16 El Monte General Plan

Goal CD-4
High-quality architectural design of residential, commercial, and industrial
buildings evidenced by thoughtful attention and balance of quality materials,
durability, aesthetics, functionality, and sustainability concepts.
Policies
CD-4.1    Building Materials. Use high-quality, natural building materials,
          such as stucco, plaster, stone, and wood surfaces for residential
          structures, and clean, distinctive materials for nonresidential
          uses.
CD-4.2    Building Scale. Reduce the bulk and perceived size of larger
          buildings by dividing their mass into smaller parts, stepping
          down to adjacent structures, and using pedestrian-scale features.
CD-4.3    Massing. Discourage single-plane massing by incorporating a
          variety of rooflines, articulated wall planes, and multiple forward
          and recessed walls.
CD-4.4    Architectural Detail. Ensure all sides of a building contain a
          high level of architectural detail and façade articulation, strong
          patterns of shade and shadow, and integrated architectural detail.
CD-4.5    Sustainability. Encourage “green building” and environmentally
          sustainable design concepts with respect to energy conservation,
          water conservation, storm drainage, etc.
CD-4.6    Rooflines. Require rooflines of varied elevations and finished and
          refined terminations (e.g., cornice, pediment, etc.) suited to the
          use of the building.
CD-4.7    Landscaping. Require lush and well-maintained landscaping
          appropriate the structure and its use and context in a manner that
          meets community expectations for quality.
CD-4.8    Parking and Garages. Parking and garages should be designed to
          fulfill their function without detracting from the aesthetic quality
          of the building face viewed by the public.
CD-4.9    Utilitarian Aspects. Mechanical equipment, electrical boxes,
          fencing, and other utilitarian aspects should be shielded so as not
          to detract from the aesthetic quality of the building or site.

                                              DOWNTOWN EL MONTE
                                              El Monte’s Downtown has always been its heart and the gateway to the
                                              region. In the late 1800s, Valley Boulevard was the only road and served as
                                              the Butterfield Stagecoach stop between Los Angeles and San Bernardino.
                                              This early main street gradually evolved into an outdoor shopping district.
                                              Today, the Downtown encompasses an area of 200 acres, bordered by the
                                              Rio Hondo River, Interstate 10, and Valley Boulevard.
                                              The El Monte Downtown today contains five subdistricts that serve
                                              distinct functions—civic, business, transit, residential, or other uses.
                                                 Government Center. The government center is the eastern gateway to
                                                  the Downtown and serves as the governmental core of El Monte. This
                                                  area is anchored by the El Monte City Hall offices, Los Angeles County
                                                  Superior Court, educational uses, and police station. Other
                                                  governmental and public uses also extend into other districts.
                                                 Main Street. Main Street covers an area bounded by the railroad tracks,
                                                  Santa Anita Boulevard, and Ramona Boulevard. The subdistrict is
                                                  anchored by a traditional outdoor shopping street. With several blocks
                                                  of street-facing frontage and tree-lined sidewalks, it connects the civic
                                                  center to the transit station.
                                                 Cultural District. The cultural district is the heart of the community
                                                  and is home to the El Monte Community Center, Historic Society
                                                  Museum, Jack Crippen Senior Center, Aquatic Center, Tony Arceo
                                                  Memorial Park, and El Monte High School. It is a well-known place for
                                                  street fairs, concerts, and community gatherings.
                                                 Neighborhoods. The Downtown has an eclectic mix of housing projects
                                                  and small distinct neighborhoods, south of Ramona Boulevard or along
                                                  Tyler Avenue north of Downtown. The fabric of this area is well
                                                  established, but could benefit from common design treatments, housing
                                                  rehabilitation programs, and infrastructure improvements.
                                                 El Monte Gateway. The El Monte Gateway Project is a groundbreaking
   Downtown Amenities                             effort to create a 60-acre, regionally significant, mixed-use community
                                                  that integrates public transit, housing, parks and open space, retail,

                                                  business, and entertainment. The El Monte Gateway will be a key
   cultural amenities for residents.              activity center, linked with the Emerald Necklace.
CD-18                                         El Monte General Plan

What makes Downtown El Monte a special place to live, work, and play is
its eclectic environment and unique subdistricts, each of which has a
symbiotic relationship with the other subdistricts. Residential
neighborhoods provide a customer and job base for the Downtown. The
following graphic illustrates the location of each subdistrict.
As expressed in the Land Use Element, Downtown El Monte is to be the
mixed-use, mixed-income, cultural heart of El Monte that epitomizes pride
and opportunity. Its historical role is augmented by new housing, retail,
office, parks, and cultural facilities. The Downtown takes advantage of
transit-oriented development. The population is diverse, the architecture is
human-scaled, and the character is authentic to El Monte.
Downtown El Monte needs a more unified design to reach its potential.
The following goal and policies address tangible ways, from a design
perspective, to enhance the vibrancy and character of the Downtown.

FLAIR PARK
Flair Park has a storied past in El Monte, the original site of a World
War II airfield and named after the cable address of Fletcher Aviation. The
park originally was intended for industry and commerce. With its strategic
location along Interstate 10, mountain views, and vast land assets, Flair
Park has evolved into the City’s professional office district. Wells Fargo,
Cathay Bank, East West Bank, Wells Fargo, Chinese Cultural Center, and
Los Angeles County have all rediscovered the park.
Since its earliest beginnings, El Monte has served as a gateway into the Los
Angeles region, where immigrants traveled long distances and settled at the
end of the Santa Fe Trail. El Monte’s role as a gateway city and burgeoning
influence in the region continues with the arrival of banking/finance,
cultural, and institutional uses that span the Pacific Ocean.

Flair Park is to be El Monte’s professional and financial district. It will be
identifiable by the agglomeration of mid- and high-rise office buildings
fronting Interstate 10, adorned with the logos of the area’s most prominent
corporate residents. Flanked with signature architecture and iconic skyline,
Flair Park will be denoted by its modern architectural design, business
amenities, and efficient access to transportation resources. The Flair Park
Specific Plan will support the long-term development and design of El
Monte’s professional and financial district center.

                                                     more intense office uses within Flair Park.
                                                    Hospitality District. The hospitality district will anchor the eastern
                                                     edge of the district, providing rooms for corporate visitors to have short
                                                     or extended stays, supporting international business activity and

NORTHWEST INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
The Northwest Planning District has historically been the City’s
manufacturing district and job engine. With the transformation of
manufacturing in the Los Angeles region, the majority of businesses in El
Monte have relocated. Nonetheless, the district offers great investment
potential due to its strategic location near Interstate 10, vast land resources,
and redevelopment project area status. The Northwest Industrial District
has the potential to become a first-class, modern industrial district.
The District’s vision is to continue to attract a balance of sustainable light
manufacturing, distribution, and technology-oriented businesses that are
compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods. The key to this
District’s success is creating the environment of a modern industrial park.
Industrial building and site design must balance functionality, aesthetics,
and compatibility. Streetscapes should provide landscaping and trees to
encourage pedestrian movement, not just truck and auto movement.
The following graphic highlights the park/recreational, urban forest, and
other design improvements proposed for the Northwest El Monte. Goal #7
and supporting policies further that end.

      Site Design
      CD-7.12 Landscaping. Require landscaping on industrial sites to present a
                refined image of a modern industrial park, reduce the perceived
                mass of structures, and provide buffers in consideration of:
                   Landscaping of open spaces and frontage-facing streetscapes
                    with greenery, trees, and flowers to create an inviting image

                   Landscaping of setbacks, berms, and other similar natural
                    features to reduce the mass and scale of the industrial
                    development and present a pedestrian-friendly image.
      CD-7.13 Loading. Require site loading and service areas to be as far as
                possible from the streetfront and ensure that such uses are
                adequately screened with high-quality articulated walls, trees, and
                other landscaping to present a clean finish to passersby.
      CD-7.14 Parking. Parking and paved areas should not be the dominant
                view of the industrial site; encourage employee and truck parking
                be placed to the side or behind the facility so that the dominant
                feature is the building architecture and landscaping frontage.
      CD-7.15 Operational Impacts. Promote a clean industrial park image and
                reduce the impact of uses on neighboring properties or residences
                by adhering to the following considerations:
                   Screen parking, storage, and service areas from public view
                    with landscaped walls, berms, and appropriate landscaping.

                    with walls and landscaping, locating service, delivery, and
                    loading areas far from adjacent uses and public streets.
                   Require mitigation of noise, odor, lighting, and other impacts
                    from affecting adjacent residential neighborhoods.
      CD-7.16 Sustainability. Require that industrial development minimize
                consumption of and sustain scarce environmental resources
                through site design, building orientation, landscaping, use of
                recycled water for irrigation, water efficiency, building design
                and materials, and best management practices for drainage.
CD-32 El Monte General Plan

COMMUNITY RETAIL CENTERS
Every community has a wide variety of community retail centers and El
Monte is no exception. Community retail centers in El Monte provide an
important service to residents, businesses, and visitors by providing a range
of goods and services, including groceries, apparel, household items, and
larger item purchases. Except for major commercial corridors, community
retail centers present the first initial image of El Monte. Ensuring that
commercial centers are well-designed is therefore a key goal of El Monte.
The City has a wide variety of community retail centers along major
corridors, built at different times over the past decades. Presently, the City’s
major commercial centers are along Garvey Avenue, Valley Boulevard, Peck
Road, and Lower Azusa Road. The General Plan will establish and regulate
three general categories of retail centers in El Monte, each distinguished by
their size, function, and location.
Each of El Monte’s commercial centers is one of three types—
community/regional, neighborhood, and mixed/multiuse nodes.
   Regional/Community Retail. These centers provide large-scale
    commercial uses that serve an area larger than the City. Auto dealers,
    home furnishings, building materials and hardware, and big-box retail
    are examples. Major regional/community commercial centers include
    the Sam’s Club, Home Depot, Five Points, and Santa Fe Trail projects.
   Neighborhood Retail. Neighborhood commercial centers provide
    convenient and smaller-scale retail, such as grocers, drug stores, and
    services that serve the immediate needs of residents of surrounding
    residential neighborhoods. There are many examples of neighborhood
    shopping centers throughout El Monte.
   Mixed/Multiuse Centers. The Zoning Code provides an overlay zone
    for portions of Garvey Avenue, Durfee Road, Valley Boulevard, and
    Peck Road to encourage a mix of residential and commercial uses. This
    includes limited retail sales and services that serve surrounding
    neighborhoods (minor node) and, in certain locations, limited retail
    sales and services that serve the community (major node).
The El Monte General Plan contains an implementation program to guide
the development, improvement, and rehabilitation of these types of centers.
In the meantime, the following goal and policies (in conjunction with the
overlay zone) provide the mechanism to approve and condition such
projects to achieve the overall goals set forth in the General Plan.

                                                         add visual interest through rich architectural detailing, varied
                                                         massing and rooflines, accent lighting, and landscaping to give
                                                         each commercial center a distinct identity.

                                                         monument signs, and other design amenities.
                                               CD-8.3    Pedestrian Features. Encourage pedestrian-scale features in
                                                         commercial centers, such as shaded sitting areas, fountains,
                                                         arcades, canopies, and awnings, customized signage, and
                                                         strategically located secondary entrances.

                                                         walkways that allow easy and safe passage to retail uses.
                                               CD-8.5    Access. Encourage internal adjoining and shared access points
                                                         between adjacent commercial properties in order to minimize the
                                                         number of curb cuts along major thoroughfares and numerous
                                                         unnecessary entry points along streets.

Signage, Lighting, and Walls
CD-8.8   Signage. Within commercial centers, encourage high-quality
         signage (e.g., wall signs, raised letter signs, projecting double-
         faced signs, customized logos) and distinct styles that
         complement building architecture; signage should not be
         uncoordinated or present a cluttered image.
CD-8.9   Lighting. Lighting fixtures should be compatible with the
         building architectural design. Accent lighting of buildings and
         landscape is encouraged, such as the use of shaded gooseneck
         lights, indirect lighting, cove lighting or "wall washing," rim
         lighting or eaves, and overhead down lighting.
CD-8.10 Walls and Fencing. Require only high-quality fencing and
         preferably articulated walls with quality natural looking materials
         that demarcate buildings; prohibit chain-link fencing, solid
         unarticulated block walls, and other low-quality materials that
         may sacrifice aesthetics for functionality.

         properties to create condominium associations that can address
         common land use and operational issues and allow the City to
         negotiate with a single entity.
CD-8.12 Conditions for Operation. Enforce, through development
         agreements or other discretionary approval process, requirements
         for property maintenance and a legal and financial means for
         enforcing compliance with City codes and regulations.
CD-8.13 Code Enforcement. Vigorously implement a proactive code
         enforcement program that identifies problem areas or complexes,
         dedicates sufficient financial resources to address problems, and,
         if issues are not promptly and fully resolved, refers cases to
         nuisance abatement, including fines and court action.
CD-8.14 Nuisance Abatement. Vigorously enforce an aggressive program
         to abate nuisances in community commercial centers, including
         dilapidated or abandoned buildings, incompatible land uses and
         activities, prohibited signage and billboards, and other uses that
         detract from the center and violate city codes and regulations.

NEIGHBORHOOD DESIGN FEATURES
El Monte is a collection of neighborhoods representative of its varied past.
Each neighborhood varies depending on its location, architecture, housing
types, and history. Because much of the city’s original development fabric
has been erased over time, the preservation, rehabilitation, and restoration
of residential neighborhoods is of critical importance.
El Monte’s neighborhoods are.
   Norwood-Cherrylee. The Norwood-Cherrylee neighborhood contains a
    mix of single-family homes anchored by Lambert Park. It contains the
    Rurban Homesteads and Wye Street, built during the 1920s as part of
    an experimental federal housing program. With its rural ambience, the
    area is distinguished by its equestrian and agricultural heritage.
   Arden Village. Arden Village is bordered by the Rio Hondo River, El
    Monte Airport, and nonresidential uses in northwest El Monte.
    Historically the site of labor camps for the agricultural industries,
    Arden Village is distinguished by small uniform lots, traditional single-
    family homes, and a distinctive classic identity.
   Mountain View. The Mountain View neighborhood, anchored by the
    Mountain View Park and elementary school, is bordered by the San
    Gabriel River. This neighborhood has one of the most diverse types and
    ranges of housing prices for single-family, multiple-family, mobile
    homes, and other housing. With its rural ambience, the area is
    distinguished by its equestrian and agricultural heritage.
   Downtown. Downtown El Monte is a diverse area of well-maintained
    homes, high density residential, and senior projects. Established small-
    lot single-family residential neighborhoods extend south of Ramona
    Boulevard. This area is denoted by its eclectic mix of housing, street
    configurations, proximity to historical resources, and shopping.
   Park El Monte. Park El Monte, southeast of Flair Park and the Rio
    Hondo River, is distinguished by curvilinear wide streets, lower scale,
    single-family homes, and quality housing. Due to the age of the
    housing, the area needs housing rehabilitation and improvements.
   River East. The River East neighborhood is bordered by the San
    Gabriel River to the east and Interstate 10 to the south. This
    neighborhood is made up primarily of residential uses, in particular,
    multiple-family planned residential developments. The neighborhood
    is continuing to complete the transition to planned residential uses.

                                                            Community Design Element
      El Monte prides itself on the quality of its residential neighborhoods. Some
      neighborhoods have a strong identity and tradition. Given the diversity of
      neighborhoods, the challenges are to: 1) recognize and highlight these
      distinct neighborhoods within the context of a modern city; 2) restore and
      enhance neighborhood identities through effective design policies; and 3)
      put in place policies that will maintain neighborhood character and fabric.
      The following goal and policies, in concert with other General Plan
      Elements, are intended to achieve these objectives.
      Goal CD-9
      Quality neighborhoods evidenced by distinct identities; focal points that
      provide recreation and social opportunities; attractive streetscapes that
      accommodate autos, pedestrians, and cyclists; and attractive and well-
      designed residential projects that improve property values.
      Neighborhood Identity
      CD-9.1     Neighborhood Design. Distinguish neighborhoods and districts
                 in their character and physical appearance by considering their
                 physical and visual separation, edge and entry treatment,
                 architecture, landscape, streetscape, and comparable elements.
      CD-9.2     Neighborhood Identity. Establish neighborhood identities
                 throughout the City, giving consideration to:
                    Natural environment
                    Historic significance
                    Infrastructure, including transportation
                    Urban fabric/traces
                    Contemporary culture
      CD-9.3     Neighborhood Scale. Apply different development and design
                 standards based on community expectations and desires for
                 different neighborhoods. Consider:
                  In stable residential neighborhoods where single-family homes
                   predominate, the existing scale of housing should be preserved.
                  Follow policies to reduce the perceived scale and impact of two-
                   story homes on adjoining one-story homes.
                  In neighborhoods of mostly multifamily housing, encourage lot
                   consolidation to foster more creative planning solutions.
                  In areas with unique features (e.g., equestrian or historic areas),
                   consider overlay zones to allow discretionary review.

3. Land Use Element
   INTRODUCTION
   Vision El Monte… A         balanced community of safe and well-designed
   housing and neighborhoods; a city with quality parks and recreational
   facilities; a vibrant economic hub with thriving business and employment
   opportunities; a collection of identifiable districts with unique roles and
   identities; and a place to call home that inspires pride.
   CREATING A BALANCED COMMUNITY
   The Land Use Element is about creating a balanced community that is
   economically and environmentally sustainable and provides the highest
   quality of life for residents. This element’s goals are to help El Monte:
      Provide a sustainable mix of complementary land uses—designating
       and developing focused areas for housing, business, parks and
       recreation, public facilities, and other land uses.
      Create identifiable and distinct places—tailoring application of specific
       land use, physical design, and principles of community design to
       different areas of the community.
      Revitalize and reinvest in the community—implementing
       redevelopment project areas, provision of incentives, and sound
       economic development policy and planning.
      Strengthen districts—applying new general plan land use designations,
       comprehensive planning, and design techniques that build on the assets
       of different strategic areas in El Monte.
                                                           El Monte General Plan LU-1

     Land Use Element
     PURPOSE OF THE ELEMENT
     The Land Use Plan is the most visible component of the General Plan; no
     other single element has more influence on El Monte’s future. The Land
     Use Element is intended to capture, communicate, and further El Monte’s
     vision for the community by determining the amount of housing,
     commercial and industrial uses, and parks and recreational resources, and
     their locations throughout the community.
     California law (Government Code §21670.4) requires that general plans
     identify land use designations and their associated development intensities,
     locations, and distribution throughout the community. Therefore, the Land
     Use Element is closely related to all other elements of the General Plan,
     because it describes each of the City’s land use designations, which will
     then literally determine the shape of the community.
     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The El Monte General Plan is implemented through a variety of regulatory
     documents. Described below, these implementation documents are the
     Municipal Code, Zoning Code, development agreements, redevelopment
     project areas, specific plans, and the El Monte Airport Land Use Plan.
     Municipal Code and Development Code
     The City’s Municipal Code and Development Code are the primary tools
     used to implement the goals and policies of the General Plan. The
     Municipal Code provides a broad variety of regulations necessary to
     promote the health, safety, and welfare of residents and businesses. It is
     comprehensive in scope, covering issues such as City administration,
     subdivision development, business regulations, building and safety
     standards, and other municipal regulations.
     The Development Code provides detailed direction related to land uses.
     Specifically, the Development Code specifies development standards;
     permitted, conditionally permitted, and prohibited uses; administrative
     processes; and other regulations such as parking and sign standards. It is
     important to note that the General Plan provides broad guidance as to the
     use of land. The Development Code provides a detailed listing of specific
     allowable uses within the general designations set forth in the General Plan.
LU-2 El Monte General Plan

Redevelopment Project Areas
California redevelopment law authorizes cities to set aside focused areas for
redevelopment activities in order to eliminate physical and economic
blight, stimulate economic development, and enhance city aesthetics. These
areas, called “redevelopment project areas," have more detailed land use
plans that implement the goals and policies of the General Plan. Project
area improvements are financed with tax increment revenue, which is the
incremental increase in tax revenues generated from the area.
To create a redevelopment project area, the City of El Monte Planning
Commission and City Council must review and adopt a redevelopment plan
and make relevant findings in accordance with state redevelopment law.
Because of the need for revitalization, the City has adopted 11
redevelopment project areas encompassing approximately 1,233 acres of
land—25 percent of the developed land area within the community. The
Economic Development Element describes these areas in greater detail.
Specific Plans
While the General Plan serves as the general blueprint for the long-term
physical development of the community, specific plans are created to
provide detailed regulatory guidance for special areas or large
developments. Specific plans comprise a land use plan, circulation plan,
development standards, design guidelines, phasing plan, infrastructure
plan, and implementation plan. Specific plans are often implemented as
customized zoning for a particular area of the City. The Land Use Plan
proposes the creation of specific plans to implement the vision for specific
employment districts and residential neighborhoods in the City.
El Monte Airport Land Use Plan
The County of Los Angeles Airport Land Use Commission is required, in
cooperation with affected cities and Caltrans’ Division of Aeronautics, to
prepare an airport land use plan (ALUP) for each airport (Public Utilities
Code §§ 21670 and 21670.1). The ALUP provides for the orderly growth of
public-use airports over a 20-year span in a manner that minimizes land use
conflicts with the surrounding area. The ALUP may include building
height restrictions, specify allowable land uses, and determine building
standards within the airport planning area. The county adopted the El
Monte Airport Land Use Plan in 1983 and the City’s General Plan is in
compliance with the adopted restrictions.
                                                         El Monte General Plan LU-3

     Land Use Element
     EL MONTE SPEAKS
     The City’s vision for land use is one of balance. A balanced community is
     evidenced by stable and beautiful neighborhoods, and served by ample
     parks and recreation opportunities. Quality is evidenced in well-designed
     housing, commercial and industrial uses, landscaping, urban design, and
     civic uses. A balanced community supports a strong economy and job base
     that provide ample revenues to finance a higher quality of services.
     City outreach programs, community workshops, interviews with elected
     officials, and discussions with stakeholders identified the key ways to
     achieve these goals. The Land Use Element addresses:
        Balanced Land Uses. Ensure a complementary mix of land uses—
         commercial and industrial businesses, strong neighborhoods and
         quality housing, parks and recreational amenities, employment centers,
         and other land uses that create a sustainable community.
        Auto District. Strengthen the Auto District to become the San Gabriel
         Valley’s premier location for automobile, truck, and recreational vehicle
         sales and service—all within an environment that is modern, attractive,
         and equipped with customer amenities and attractions.
        Flair Park. Facilitate transition of Flair Park into a first-class
         professional district by attracting businesses that build on the City’s
         emerging financial sector, government offices, international business
         with Pacific Rim connections, and other specialty niche markets.
        Northwest Industrial. Transition into a sustainable manufacturing,
         distribution, and technology-oriented district that provides opportunity
         for investment, entrepreneurship, and significant well-paid jobs in a
         sustainable environment compatible with residential neighborhoods.
        Downtown. Recreate Downtown as the mixed-use, mixed-income, and
         cultural heart that epitomizes pride and opportunity. Its historical role
         is augmented by new housing, retail, office, parks, and cultural facilities
         taking advantage of transit-oriented development.
        Corridors. Direct the construction of new mixed/multiuse housing
         along major corridors to protect and preserve single-family
         neighborhoods, reduce automobile dependence, improve air quality,
         and revitalize and transition underutilized uses.

LAND USE CONTEXT
This section describes each category of land use, summarizes the proposed
land uses on the Land Use Plan, and then calculates the City’s buildout for
population, housing, and employment so that appropriate infrastructure
and services can be provided.
LAND USE DESIGNATIONS
Land use designations refer to the allowable amount, type, and nature of
development in El Monte. Major land use designations include residential
(housing), commercial, industrial, public facilities (including parks), and
the airport. Each of these land use designations are divided into further
subcategories. Each designation allows for different types, intensities, and
densities of development that directly correlate to the square footage of
building area allowed on land within El Monte.
Each residential land use designation includes a range of allowable
densities, calculated as the number of dwelling units allowed per gross acre.
The lower threshold figure for each of these categories represents a
guaranteed minimum density, expressed as housing units per acre, provided
all other required development conditions can be met. The higher figure
represents a potential maximum density that could be achieved if the
proposed development demonstrates high quality design.
Each commercial and industrial category has a range of allowable intensities
of development. Building intensities for nonresidential uses are measured
by floor area ratio (FAR). FAR is calculated as the ratio of the total net floor
area of a building to the total area of a specific lot. FAR calculations do not
include areas within parking structures or outdoor open storage areas. The
same FAR can be achieved through a variety of building coverage,
orientations, and height configurations.
Site considerations, such as topography or location, and City policies and
regulations, such as development standards in the Zoning Code, may place
additional requirements on a property that could prevent the site from
achieving the maximum density established within this General Plan.
Actual density and FAR ranges are determined on a parcel-specific basis.
Density and FAR are based on adjusted gross acreage, which subtracts acres
associated with right-of-way.

                                                 Residential Land Use Designations
                                                 El Monte offers a wide range of housing densities and types to meet the
                                                 needs of current and future residents. In addition to the housing types and
                                                 densities shown below, land uses compatible with neighborhoods are also
                                                 allowed in the same areas as housing, such as schools, recreation centers,
                                                 parks, child care facilities, and public and institutional uses.
                                                 Low Density Residential
                                                 The low density residential designation is the most prevalent land use and
                                                 represents typical single-family detached homes on 7,200-square-foot lots.
                                                 The majority of these single-family homes are one- or two-story residences
                                                 set back from the street and separated by yards. This land use designation is
                                                 implemented by three zoning districts (R-1A, R-1B, and R-1C) that allow
                                                 from 0.1 to 6.0 residential dwelling units per acre.

                                                 by the R-4 zoning district, which allows the highest residential density of
                                                 25 units per acre. Senior housing can be built at higher densities with an
                                                 approved density bonus.

Commercial and Industrial Land Use Designations
Commercial, office, and industrial land uses reflect a wide range of densities
and intensities of development and allowable uses of land. While some
types of land uses are separated, others may be mixed together, such as
housing and nonresidential uses. The Zoning Code provides greater detail
on the types of uses allowed within each General Plan land use designation.
Neighborhood Commercial
Areas designated for Neighborhood Commercial provide convenient,
smaller-scale retail businesses in close proximity to neighborhoods.
Permitted uses include small commercial businesses (grocers, laundromats,
daycare centers, drug stores, etc.) that meet the needs of residents and do
not generate substantial volumes of traffic. This land use designation is
implemented by the C and C-1 zone and allows an FAR of up to 0.5.
General Commercial
Areas designated for general commercial uses allow a wide range of retail
and service commercial uses to serve the community and the region.
Permitted uses include a range of retail businesses, personal services, food
and beverage establishments, hotel and other tourist uses, automotive sales
and repair, retail, daycare centers, and professional offices. General
commercial uses are primarily located along major corridors. The C-2, C-3,
and C-4 zones implement this designation and allow up to 0.75 FAR.
Office Commercial
The Office Commercial category accommodates low-scale two-story
professional offices in areas where such development may serve as a buffer
between less compatible uses. Professional, medical, and financial offices
and institutions are the intended uses. Presently, less than 1 percent of all
land in El Monte is designated for office commercial. The C-O zoning
district implements this land use designation, allowing up to 0.75 FAR.
Regional Commercial
Regional Commercial areas are intended to provide for large-scale
commercial uses that serve an area larger than the City. Auto dealerships
that have a regional draw are the primary intended business use, although
department stores, theatres, restaurants, and limited office uses are also      Regional Commercial
allowed. These uses are located in areas that benefit from strategic access to  Sam’s Club, pictured above, is a regional

                                                 This designation allows mixed/multiuse housing along corridors.
                                                 Mixed/multiuses can be vertically integrated (e.g., commercial frontage
                                                 with residential and/or office uses above the first floor) or horizontal
                                                 (housing adjacent to commercial and office uses). The scale, size, and mix of
                                                 land uses vary based on the location and character of surrounding land uses.
                                                 Densities of 25 to 35 units per acre and/or FAR of up to 1.00 are allowed.

                                                 The Industrial Business Park designation is intended primarily for the
                                                 Northwest Planning Area. Allowable uses include a mix of sustainable
                                                 manufacturing, processing, office, warehousing, and distribution uses that
                                                 generate employment, minimize traffic, and are compatible with residential
                                                 neighborhoods. Supporting and limited retail uses are also allowed.
                                                 Industrial uses are allowed at an intensity of up to 1.0 FAR.

Public and Institutional Uses
This land use designation refers to a wide variety of open space,
institutional, governmental, educational, and transportation land uses in El
Monte that serve residents, visitors, and the business community. This
includes public facilities, parks and open space, and the airport.
Public Facilities
The Public Facilities classification pertains to lands and facilities owned
and maintained by governmental agencies (federal, state, and local) and
public utilities. Public schools, police and fire-related facilities, Superior
Courthouse, public libraries, community centers, and the City Hall are all
public facilities allowed within this land use designation. Most of these
facilities, with the exception of schools, are located near Downtown. This
land use designation allows for an intensity ranging up to 1.0 FAR.
Parks and Open Space
The Parks and Open Space land use designation refers to areas designated
for parks, open space, linear parks, trails, and other similar recreational
uses. It includes areas as diverse as Peck Water Conservation Park, the
Emerald Necklace, pocket parks, plazas, and other gathering places. Since
buildings, such as recreational facilities, are sometimes allowed within this
land use designation, an FAR of 0.0 to 0.10 is permissible. Areas designated
as parks and open space are intended to be used solely for such uses.
Airport/Transportation
The Airport land use designation applies solely to the El Monte Airport
                                                                                El Monte City Hall and Airport
and encompasses all aviation-related businesses on the airport site. This
designation also extends to all areas within the airport influence zone in      El Monte City Hall and Airport Terminal,
accordance with the ALUP that was adopted by the Los Angeles County             pictured above, are notable landmark public
                                                                                facilities.
Airport Land Use Commission in 1983. This land use designation allows an
FAR of up to 1.0, subject to regulations in the ALUP.
El Monte’s physical landscape has significant transportation infrastructure.
El Monte has many parcels used as rights-of-way that support the railroad
and freeway systems. The flood control channels also require significant
public right-of-way. Approximately 20 percent of the City’s land mass is
devoted to transportation, regional flood control channels, and utilities.
The General Plan does not contain a designation for such land uses.

GOALS AND POLICIES
This section of the Land Use Element describes land use goals and policies
that, in conjunction with the Land Use Plan and accompanying density and
intensity standards, guide development within El Monte consistent with
the City’s vision. This section is organized into two subsections: first, those
goals and policies that apply citywide (land use compatibility, revitalization
and redevelopment, distinct and identifiable places, and balance of land
uses), and second, those goals and policies that apply to specific community
policy areas identified in the earlier section.
LAND USE COMPATIBILITY
El Monte is a diverse community containing a broad mix of residential,
industrial, entertainment, office, and commercial land uses. In addition, the
community is crossed by major infrastructure systems: freeways, flood
control channels, railroad lines, and major arterials. A number of land uses,
including industrial, commercial, and transportation facilities, can have
potentially adverse effects on residential neighborhoods, sensitive habitat
areas, medical facilities, schools, and other sensitive land uses. Thus, a key
goal of the Land Use Element is to ensure the compatibility of land uses.
Achieving land use compatibility in the El Monte community is a delicate
process. Due to historical patterns of development and built-out nature,
residential land uses are interspersed adjacent to less compatible uses. This
is particularly the case for the Northwest Industrial District, which is
surrounded by residential neighborhoods or fronted by major corridors.
Commercial, industrial, and transportation uses vital to El Monte’s
economy must be encouraged, yet the impacts of such uses cannot detract
from the quality of residential neighborhoods.
Land use compatibility will be more critical as areas transition over time.
Certain transportation corridors will begin to transition to mixed/multiuse
housing and commercial uses. These uses must be designed to address noise
and air quality impacts along corridors and adjacent to industrial uses. In
other areas, auto-related uses along Valley Boulevard and Peck Road will
require buffering. Changes in fundamental land uses in Flair Park and
northwest El Monte will also require attention to compatibility issues.
The following goal and policies further land use compatibility in El Monte.
                                                           El Monte General Plan LU-13

      Land Use Element
      Goal LU-1
      Compatible residential, commercial, and industrial development that is
      sensitively integrated with existing development and neighborhoods and
      minimizes impacts on surrounding land uses.
      Policies
      LU-1.1    Code Compliance. Ensure land use compatibility through
                adherence to the policies, standards, and regulations in the
                Municipal Code, Development Code, Community Design
                Element, and other regulations or administrative procedures.
      LU-1.2    Mitigation. Require new uses to provide buffers between existing
                uses where potential adverse impacts could occur, such as
                decorative walls, setbacks and landscaping, restricted vehicular
                access, parking enclosures, and lighting control.
      LU-1.3    Interagency Cooperation. Establish and maintain an ongoing
                liaison with Caltrans, the railroads, utility companies, and other
                major government and private agencies to help minimize the
                traffic, noise, and visual impacts of their facilities and operations.
      LU-1.4    Heavy Industry. Within proximity to sensitive land uses, limit
                development or expansion of industrial, manufacturing, and
                distribution uses that create toxics, air pollutants, vehicular and
                truck traffic, or present other public health and safety hazards.
      LU-1.5    Police Safety Review. Require, through the conditional use
                permit, police department review of uses that may be associated
                with high levels of noise, nighttime patronage, criminal activity,
                loitering, or other activities to prevent adverse impacts.
      LU-1.6    Quality of Life. Prioritize protection of quality of life so that it
                takes precedence during the review of new projects. Accordingly,
                the City shall use its discretion to deny or require mitigation of
                projects that result in impacts that outweigh public benefits.
      LU-1.7    Residential Compatibility. Discourage duplexes, triplexes,
                quadplexes, and apartments from being constructed in
                predominantly single-family residential neighborhoods to
                preserve the character and integrity of neighborhoods.
LU-14 El Monte General Plan
REVITALIZATION AND REDEVELOPMENT
El Monte is one of the oldest and most established cities in the San Gabriel
Valley, so the revitalization and redevelopment of property is a critical
concern. Some areas suffer from blight conditions that depress property
values and create safety concerns. In others, the City may wish to change
fundamental land use to stimulate the economy, improve an area, or
encourage investment. As described further, these areas include commercial
corridors, industrial areas, and even some residential neighborhoods.
Although El Monte has a range of stable residential areas, revitalization and
reinvestment is needed in certain neighborhoods and areas. Some
neighborhoods contain incompatible nonresidential uses (industrial uses)
or dilapidated properties that are blighting influences in the neighborhood.
The City’s ten redevelopment project areas cover more than 1,000 acres of
land and have helped to improve neighborhood shopping, enhance
commercial business opportunities, and remove blighting influences.
This General Plan focuses economic development, revitalization, and
reinvestment in other areas through focused land use, transportation,
design, and economic development strategies. In addition, the plan focuses
on creating distinct, discernible places of varied sizes, functions, and
complexity. By these means, economic activity can be stimulated to
reinforce itself, achieving greater private sector profit, public benefit, and
sustainability. The following goal and policies address general principles
for revitalization and redevelopment efforts in the city.
Goal LU-2
Revitalization and redevelopment of residential, commercial, and industrial
areas through the sensitive integration of infill development, elimination of
blight, and master planning efforts.
Policies:
LU-2.1     Underutilized Uses. Facilitate and increase the concentration of
           commercial and industrial uses to activity centers, major
           intersections, and other focused areas.
LU-2.2     Midblock Residential. Introduce midblock residential uses, such
           as mixed/multiuse housing, condominiums, apartments, and live-
           work units to stimulate the revitalization and reuse of major
           corridors and removal of underused and incompatible uses.
                                                           El Monte General Plan LU-15

      Land Use Element
      LU-2.3    Reinvestment Incentives. Continue to provide special financial
                incentives, regulatory concessions, and improvement programs to
                revitalize deteriorated housing stock, residential neighborhoods,
                major business corridors, and employment centers.
      LU-2.4    Master Planning. Utilize master-planning devices such as
                specific plans, planned development zoning, and creative site
                planning to stimulate the desired mix and intensity of
                development and a comprehensive approach to land use planning
                and design.
      LU-2.5    Specific Plan. Require preparation of specific plans that foster
                cohesive and well-designed residential, commercial, and
                industrial districts. This requirement shall be applied to large
                vacant lands or for the reuse of existing properties where it is the
                intent to establish a cohesive district where there are multiple
                property owners.
      LU-2.6    Blighting Influences. Remove blighting influences wherever
                they exist through a combination of proactive code enforcement,
                issuance of citations and enforcement actions, acquisition of sites,
                and demolition where needed.
      LU-2.7    Fiscal Stability. Implement redevelopment and revitalization
                strategies (e.g., land use, transportation, economic development,
                parks, etc.) that will achieve, as a major consideration but not the
                only priority, greater fiscal stability for the City.
      DISTINCT AND IDENTIFIABLE PLACES
      El Monte contains different districts, each with special characteristics due
      to location, historical character, economic role, or other attributes. Whether
      they are historical districts, business parks, or downtowns, these areas serve
      specific purposes and add variety and identity to El Monte. Within this
      context, El Monte residents have expressed the aspiration to create distinct
      and identifiable places that inspire pride in the community.
      El Monte’s major business districts include the greater downtown,
      characterized by its transit center, government center, Main Street, and a
      range of housing options. The Flair Park provides a high-profile
      professional office area situated strategically along I-10. The Northwest
      Industrial District serves as the industrial heart of the community. In
      addition, the burgeoning auto district continues to be the City’s revenue
      engine, anchored by the highest volume car dealership in the nation.
LU-16 El Monte General Plan

El Monte’s residential neighborhoods are each distinguished by history,
architecture, street patterns, lot size, and housing. The Downtown is
denoted by its eclectic mix of housing opportunities. Arden Village is a
stable neighborhood of single-family homes. Park El Monte is
distinguished by its curvilinear street patterns and single-family homes.
Norwood-Cherrylee Village is a stable residential neighborhood. River East
anchors the City’s eastern border along the Rio Hondo River. The
Mountain View neighborhood anchors the southeast portion of El Monte.
In addition to larger neighborhoods and districts, smaller nonresidential
activity centers are located throughout the community and each one plays
an important role to business, residents, and visitors. For instance, the El
Monte Airport has been a long-standing feature of the community,
requiring special treatment. The cultural center district, a part of El
Monte’s Downtown separated by I-10, is also a unique hub of activity and
focal point for cultural and recreational activities. Numerous commercial
centers of activity, such as Main Street, are frequented activity centers.
The General Plan recognizes the diversity of neighborhoods and business
districts, and therefore sets forth as fundamental the goal to create distinct
and identifiable places that will provide economic, aesthetic, recreation,
cultural, and other benefits. The following goal statement and policies
provide broader guidance on creating distinct places. Please refer to the
Community Design Element for detailed guidance on specific programs.
Goal LU-3
Distinct and identifiable residential neighborhoods and commercial,
industrial and office districts that reflect and augment the historical, cultural,
economic, and social fabric and roles in El Monte.
Policies:
LU-3.1     Land Uses. Distinguish the City’s neighborhoods and districts in
           their character and physical appearance by considering their
           physical and visual separation, edge and entry treatment,
           architecture, landscape, streetscape, and comparable elements
           during their design and development.
LU-3.2     Connections. Strengthen connections between the diverse
           residential and nonresidential districts in the community
           through streetscape design, provision of open space, and other
           improvements that create a cohesive identity for the community.
                                                            El Monte General Plan  LU-17

      Land Use Element
      LU-3.3      Green Infrastructure. Utilize landscaping, trees, parkways, paths,
                  and equestrian trails, such as the Emerald Necklace, to define and
                  enhance the identity of places, create a pedestrian-friendly
                  environment, and link the various districts throughout El Monte.
      LU-3.4      Gateways. Enhance residential neighborhoods and commercial
                  and industrial districts with distinctive landmarks and gateways
                  that will define boundaries, create a sense of arrival, affirm the
                  role of the district in El Monte, and instill pride.
      LU-3.5      Identity. Develop a cohesive theme for the entire community and
                  subthemes for individual residential neighborhoods and districts
                  to foster identity, create a sense of community, and add to the
                  City’s eclectic image.
      LU-3.6      Architecture. Create and encourage a variety of distinct
                  architectural styles and design guidelines that are tailored to the
                  different functions, types, and histories of districts, exemplify
                  excellence in design standards, and stand the test of time.
      LU-3.7      History and Culture. Incorporate a broad range of history,
                  culture, and public art expressions throughout each of El Monte’s
                  districts to promote community identity, preserve and affirm
                  heritage and culture, and instill community pride.
      BALANCE OF LAND USES
      The City’s vision is one of sustainability, and a balance land use plan is
      critical to that goal. Quality neighborhoods provide housing for residents of
      all ages. Commercial and industrial areas generate tax revenue to support
      services and infrastructure and provide jobs that sustain the economy. Open
      space, parks, and trees provide recreational opportunities, but also areas for
      water recharge, filtering of air pollutants, and beautification.
      As is the case with many of the first-ring suburbs of Los Angeles, El Monte
      developed into a burgeoning suburb in San Gabriel Valley. Suburban
      neighborhoods gradually replaced agricultural lands. Transportation
      infrastructure was extended across the community to connect to the greater
      Los Angeles region. Businesses were located along major arterials and in
      some cases near residential neighborhoods. Parks and open space were
      largely replaced with residential, commercial, and industrial uses.
      Restoring the balance of land uses and carefully managing and enhancing
      the accompanying uses will define and shape El Monte’s future. The
      following goal and policies, supplemented by strategies for focus areas, are
      designed to ensure a balance of land uses for a sustainable community.
LU-18 El Monte General Plan

Goal LU-4
A complementary balance of land uses that provide adequate opportunities
for housing, economic activity, transportation, parks, and recreation to
support an exemplary quality of life and a sustainable community.
Policies
LU-4.1   Housing Opportunities. Support a range of types and prices of
         housing available to all economic segments of the community, in
         appropriate locations to meet present and future needs, consistent
         with the goals and policies in the Housing Element.
LU-4.2   Neighborhoods. Develop strong residential neighborhoods that
         are distinguished by distinct architecture, parks and open space,
         public facilities and services, and public involvement in their
         planning and improvement.
LU-4.3   Parks and Open Space. Provide sufficient quality parks, open
         space, greenways, trails, and recreational facilities that meet
         community needs through the implementation of the goals and
         policies set forth in the Parks and Recreation Element.
LU-4.4   Economic Development. Support the development of office,
         commercial, and industrial uses, both citywide and in strategic
         areas, that strengthen the economy.
LU-4.5   Balanced Growth. Direct land uses and community growth in a
         manner that is consistent with community-wide goals and is
         consistent with the vision of the General Plan.
LU-4.6   Public Services and Facilities. Support community growth and
         change through the provision and maintenance of quality public
         services and facilities, including infrastructure and appropriate
         funding mechanisms to maintain it in good working order.
LU-4.7   Transportation. Require that new development provide adequate
         mitigation for negative traffic or mobility impacts, unless the
         project is found to have overriding public benefits.
LU-4.8   Transportation. Encourage and facilitate a range of quality
         childcare facilities and services, including infant care, pre-school
         care and after-school care, to promote economic development and
         serve the needs of working families.

      Land Use Element
      STRATEGIC AREAS
      This section of the Land Use Element provides special goals and policies,
      in addition to those identified earlier, to help create, preserve, revitalize,
      and enhance selected areas of the City. Together with other elements of the
      General Plan, specific plans, the Development Code, and neighborhood and
      capital improvement programs, the policies are intended to help create,
      preserve, revitalize, and enhance selected areas of the City.
      The strategic areas map (Figure LU-2) illustrates the locations of areas
      intended for policy and program guidance. The boundaries on the strategic
      areas are intended to denote generally, where specific actions are sought.
      Application of the actions to adjacent or nearby parcels is also appropriate if
      that action contributes to the desired outcome commensurate with costs.
      Strategic areas have two basic distinctions: conservation and enhancement
      areas and land use development areas.
         Conservation and Enhancement Areas. These are stable neighborhoods
          and commercial areas where land use changes are not anticipated. The
          General Plan thus focuses on preservation and enhancement of these
          areas through goals and policies contained in the General Plan.
         Land Development Areas. These are areas where fundamental land use
          change is either imminent and needs further guidance or where change
          in an area is desired and needs stimulation and/or guidance.
      Each strategic area contains a brief description of the physical conditions
      and issues followed by a set of policies or practical strategies. These policies
      are unique structural aspects of the strategic policy areas. Whereas the rest
      of the General Plan is a combination of general initiatives and ongoing
      reactions of proposals, policies in these sections are intended to result in
      actions and provide direction to influence each particular proposal.

                                               DOWNTOWN EL MONTE
                                               El Monte’s Downtown has always been its heart and the gateway to the San
                                               Gabriel Valley. In the late 1800s, Valley Boulevard was the only road and
                                               served as the Butterfield Stagecoach stop between Los Angeles and San
                                               Bernardino. Nearly a century later, this early Main Street gradually evolved
                                               into a shopping district. Today, the Downtown encompasses an area of 200
                                               acres, bordered by the San Gabriel River, I-10, and Ramona Boulevard.
                                               The Downtown today contains key activity centers that serve distinct
                                               functions—civic/governmental, business, transit, or other uses. As shown
                                               below, these districts include Main Street, El Monte Gateway, government
                                               center, and residential neighborhoods. Each subdistrict plays a unique role,
                                               which together support a vibrant downtown experience. The graphic
   El Monte Downtown, 1900s                    illustration below identifies the location of each subdistrict of the
                                               downtown and the following discussion describes key characteristics.
   El Monte’s historic downtown at the turn of
   the 20th century was a bustling center.
   El Monte Downtown, Today
   El Monte’s historic downtown has evolved
   into multiple subdistricts serving distinct
   roles.
LU-22                                          El Monte General Plan

Government
The government center district is the eastern gateway to greater downtown
and serves as the governmental core of El Monte. This area is anchored by
the El Monte City Hall offices, Los Angeles County Superior Court,
educational uses, and police station. Governmental institutions continue to
be the primary land uses. The area has significant growth potential to
accommodate additional government uses, with its large surface parking lot
areas, single-story buildings, and underutilized land assets.
Main Street
Main Street covers an area bounded by the railroad tracks, Santa Anita
Boulevard, and Ramona Boulevard. The subdistrict is anchored by Main
Street, a traditional outdoor shopping district. With several blocks of street-
facing frontage and tree-lined sidewalks, it connects the civic center to the
transit station. With ample surface parking lots and single-story
developments, the mall could eventually be ripe for revitalization,
particularly with horizontally and vertically integrated mixed/multiuses
along the mall walkway, multistory parking garages on surface parking lots,
and enhanced connections to the Emerald Necklace.
Residential Neighborhoods
The Downtown has an eclectic mix of housing and distinct neighborhoods.
The majority of existing housing is south of Ramona Boulevard and east of
Santa Anita Boulevard. This residential neighborhood includes older
homes built on smaller lots, connected by narrow streets. The fabric of this
area is well established, but could benefit from common design treatments,
rehabilitation programs, and infrastructure improvements.
El Monte Gateway
The El Monte Gateway is a groundbreaking effort to create a 60-acre
regionally significant, mixed-use community that integrates public transit,
housing, parks/open space, retail, business, and entertainment. With the
potential for up to 1,850 units in a mixed/multiuse environment, this
transit-oriented development will also serve as a key activity center, linked
with the Emerald Necklace, which will help revitalize the city, create a
central gathering place, and strengthen the core of the community.

                                            Cultural Center
                                            The cultural center subdistrict is south of I-10, adjacent to the El Monte
                                            Union High School. It contains the El Monte Community Center, Historic
                                            al Society Museum, La Historia Museum, Jack Crippen Senior Center,
                                            Aquatic Center, and Tony Arceo Memorial Park. The Aquatic Center, a
                                            signature facility, also anchors the cultural district. The subdistrict is a
                                            well-known place for street fairs, parades, concerts, and community
                                            gatherings. The subdistrict is linked to the Downtown by Tyler Avenue.
                                            The cultural center is also enhanced by surrounding neighborhoods that
                                            are distinguished by architecture, tree-lined streets, and quality housing.
                                            Unlike other subdistricts, the center district will continue in the same role.
                                            Goal LU-5
   Community Center
   The Grace Black Community Center,        Establish the Downtown as the mixed-use, mixed-income, and cultural heart
   including the museum, is one of the most of El Monte. Its historical role is augmented by new housing, business, parks,
   well-known places for City events and    cultural facilities, and transit-oriented development. The population is
   activities.
                                            diverse, the architecture is human scaled, and the character authentic.

                                                FLAIR PARK
                                                Flair Park has a storied past in El Monte as the original site of a World War
                                                II airfield and is named after the cable address of Fletcher Aviation. The
                                                park originally was intended for industry, manufacturing, and commerce.
                                                The housing and industrial boom of the 1950s and 1960s created a home for
                                                a growing aerospace industry in El Monte. For 50 years, many of the parts
                                                for space shuttles and rockets were designed or built in El Monte.
                                                With the development of the San Gabriel Valley economy and El Monte,
                                                Flair Park attracted a mix of manufacturing uses and low-rise offices. In
                                                recent decades, Flair Park has become the City’s office district, with the
                                                highest concentration of employment in government, finance, and business
                                                services. Major institutions such as Cathay Bank, East West Bank, Wells
                                                Fargo, and Los Angeles County have rediscovered the park.
   Flair Park History
                                                Flair Park can again play a pivotal role in the regional economy. Its
   Flair Park was the original home of Fletcher unparalleled view of the San Gabriel Mountains is sought after. Land assets
   Aviation, a key manufacturer in the
   aerospace industry, and a key airstrip.      are significant, with large parcels available for office development. Its
                                                strategic location along I-10 and its freeway visibility attract businesses

Infrastructure/Transportation
Strategically located along I-10 and
near the El Monte Transit Station,
Flair Park has excellent access to
transit, freeway, and rail. Yet, this
tremendous asset is also a liability.
The Interstate 10 and Baldwin
Avenue interchange is significantly
undersized, creating level of service
issues at peak hours. Heavy
congestion on Rosemead Boulevard
makes it difficult for employees and
transit to access the park. The City
will need to work cooperatively with
                                          I-10/Baldwin Interchange
state entities and surrounding cities to
address this issue.                       Improvement of the I-10/Baldwin interchange
                                          will facilitate access into Flair Park.
Design
The Flair Park represents El Monte emergence in San Gabriel Valley. Since
its earliest beginnings, El Monte has served as a gateway community into
the Los Angeles region, where immigrants traveled long distances and
settled at the end of the Santa Fe Trail. El Monte’s role as a gateway
community and burgeoning influence in the region continues with the
gradual arrival of banking/finance, cultural, and institutional uses that span
the Pacific Ocean to Asia. The Flair Park design is buildings, and working
environment must reflect the needs of a Class A office park. Flanked with
signature architecture and iconic skyline, Flair Park will be denoted by its
modern architectural design, business amenities, and efficient access to
transportation resources. The Flair Park Specific Plan will support the
design of El Monte’s professional business park.
Environment
Flair Park will benefit from key improvements to its built environment.
The Emerald Necklace is visioned as a key riverfront amenity that will
flank the southern boundary of Flair Park, providing an aesthetically
pleasing environment for walking. Streets will be lined with trees and
setbacks, required of modern business parks today. Green building designs
that are aesthetically pleasing, functional, and state of the art are to be
encouraged. The City will continue to work with the San Gabriel Basin
Water Quality Authority and other regional entities to clean up the
underground water pollution and contaminated sites in the park. Plazas and
landscaping will also be intertwined to improve the desirability of the park.

                                      NORTHWEST INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
                                      The Northwest Industrial District has historically served as the key
                                      manufacturing district and home to major defense industries. Residential
                                      neighborhoods built during the 1950s surround these industrial uses. With
                                      the transformation of manufacturing in the Los Angeles region, the
                                      majority of businesses in El Monte have relocated inland or out of state. Yet
                                      the district offers great investment potential due to its strategic location
                                      near I-10, vast land resources, and redevelopment project area status.
   Northwest Objective
   The Northwest Industrial
   District is the industrial engine
   for the city, attracting a balance
   of sustainable manufacturing,
   distribution, and technology-
   oriented business. It provides
   opportunity for investment,
   entrepreneurship, and significant
   creation of well-paid jobs in a
   well-managed environment that
   minimizes traffic impacts,
   promotes a clean environment,
   ensures long-term vitality, and
   strengthens neighborhoods.
                                      The Northwest Industrial District has the potential to become a first-class,
                                      modern industrial district. Its vast land resources, strategic location near
                                      population centers, and access to railroads and I-10 offer strategic cost
                                      advantages to business. Surrounding residential neighborhoods can provide
                                      a labor force for employers in the area. Infrastructure improvements can
                                      improve freeway access, leverage potential uses of the railroad, and improve
                                      internal circulation within the area. Ongoing brownfield cleanup efforts
                                      offer opportunity to improve property values and the health of residents.
                                      The district’s vision is to serve as the employment engine for the City, but
                                      transition to an area that attracts a balance of sustainable light
                                      manufacturing, distribution, and technology-oriented business. It can
                                      provide opportunities for investment, entrepreneurship, and significant

AUTO DISTRICT
The City of El Monte is perhaps best known for its Auto District. The
District, generally located along Peck Road and Valley Boulevard, is
anchored by Longo Toyota, the nation’s largest dealership; long-standing
fixtures such as El Monte RV, and nearly a dozen other auto dealers. The
auto industry is not only a major employer, but also an economic engine for    Auto District Objective

The vision for the El Monte Auto District is that it will become the premier
location to buy a car, serving as San Gabriel Valley’s primary automobile,
truck, and recreational vehicle sales and service destination, providing a
year-round auto show environment and wide range of automobile choices—
all within an environment that is modern, attractive, equipped with
customer amenities and attractions, well maintained, and convenient.

      Land Use Element
      Land Use/Transportation
      A fundamental challenge to maximize the Auto District and the benefits to
      the City’s economy and tax base is the availability of land. The City will
      need to acquire and consolidate key parcels within the Auto District. This
      will allow auto dealerships the ability to acquire land, if needed, for
      expansion of their operations and relocation of inventory. In some cases,
      the City can assist in relocation of existing businesses to more competitive
      locations to facilitate the land acquisition process.
      Transportation
      Efficient transportation into the Auto District and circulation around the
      district is important. The City will also need to pursue improvements to
      access points at the intersection of Garvey Avenue and Durfee Road to
      allow access into the southern portion of the Auto District. Improvements
      to the Santa Anita and I-10 interchange would also improve the Auto
      District and adjacent transit station. In some cases, road widening is
      necessary. The City could consider a public parking structure in the Auto
      District and a shuttle to improve the shopping experience of customers.
      Design
      To serve as the primary auto, truck, and recreational vehicle sales and
      service destination in San Gabriel Valley, the structural design of the Auto
      District is critical. Customers and auto dealers will desire an environment
      that is modern, attractive, and accessible. Implementing this design strategy
      will require physical changes to the district. Circulation improvements—
      both vehicular and pedestrian—must be implemented along Valley and
      Peck Road. Where circulation challenges prevent improvements, transit
      should be provided. Buildings must be modern in scale and development
      regulations must be flexible to allow for creative use of space.
      Amenities
      The Auto District environment and customer experience will be improved.
      The Auto District will accommodate entertainment and recreational land
      uses and activities that enhance the customer experience. The district will
      also accommodate regional retail uses that will attract additional potential
      customers to the Auto District. The Economic Development Element
      provides further strategies to preserve the economic viability of this area.
      The following goal statement and policies are intended to realize the vision
      for the City’s Auto District as the premier place to buy autos, trucks, and
      recreational vehicles in the San Gabriel Valley and greater region.
LU-36 El Monte General Plan

Goal LU-8
Establish the Auto District as the premier vehicle sales and service
destination in southern California, providing a year-round auto show
environment and wide range of automobile, truck, and recreational vehicle
choices—all within an environment that is modern, attractive, equipped with
customer amenities and attractions, well maintained, and convenient.
Policies
LU-8.1    Auto District. Create a defined El Monte Auto District that
          encompasses the area occupied by new dealerships north of the I-
          10 and other auto dealership sites along Valley Boulevard
          southeast toward Little Five Points.
LU-8.2    Priority Uses. Give first priority to new auto, truck, and
          recreational vehicle dealers to locate in the Auto District; second
          priority to uses directly supporting new sales (e.g., financing,
          amenities, rentals, service, etc.); and third to all other businesses.
LU-8.3    Supporting Amenities. Attract, cultivate, and retain auto dealer
          amenities (theatres, restaurants, shopping, etc.) and necessary
          automotive support uses (financing, rentals, etc.) that enhance
          customer experience and support the Auto District.
LU-8.4    Redevelopment. Use redevelopment, financial incentives, and
          regulatory concessions to create the district, acquire land
          necessary for its coherent expansion, relocate businesses
          incidental to the Auto District to adjacent areas, and
          relocate/attract auto dealerships to the Auto District.
LU-8.5    Circulation. Improve circulation throughout the Auto District
          with wayfaring and pedestrian signage, shuttle or transit access
          moving from the northern to southern subdistricts, kiosks, and
          differentiated pavement colorings to inform visitors.
LU-8.6    Interstate 10. Work with Caltrans to improve freeway and ramp
          access to Durfee Road, Garvey Avenue, and the I-10, consistent
          with the recommendations in the Circulation Element.
LU-8.7    District Visibility. Improve visibility of the Auto District by
          removing land uses and buildings that block access into the
          District and installing monument signage at points along
          Interstate 605 and Valley Boulevard.

                                   `MAJOR CORRIDORS
                                   El Monte is spanned by major roads that front residential neighborhoods.
                                   In 1993, the City established a redevelopment project area for Durfee Road
                                   and portions of Garvey Avenue to facilitate their transition into industrial
                                   and commercial corridors similar to adjacent cities. Years later, however,

LU-38                              El Monte General Plan
Design
The physical design of mixed/multiuse housing is a critical component of
the success of the revitalization strategy for corridors. Mixed-use projects
must convey a high level of architectural and landscape quality, and ensure
compatibility among commercial and residential uses. Projects should be
designed to avoid conflicts among residential and commercial functions,
such as noise, lighting, and other factors. Residential and commercial uses
must be integrated, visually and physically, into a coherent whole.
Architectural treatment of building elevations and modulation of their
massing will stimulate visual interest. Adequate open space consistent with
City design guidelines will ensure a livable quality environment.
Streetscapes
Mixed/multiuse housing along major corridors such as Durfee Road and
Garvey Avenue is designed to improve the physical appearance of corridors,
offer quality housing, and improve neighborhood pride. In order to achieve
these objectives, the physical design of the streetscape is critical. Arterial
streets lined with ample sidewalks of adequate width will encourage
walking and pedestrian activity. Streets or greenways with a canopy of
native species trees will provide shade for pedestrians, improve aesthetics,
and complement street-facing residential and commercial uses. Lush
greenways and medians will soften the concrete hardscape, encourage
slower vehicular speeds, and present a unified image of the street.
Housing Types
Mixed/multiuse housing addresses an important lifestyle segment of the
housing market in El Monte. With the high cost of single-family housing,
El Monte has a significant need for quality multiple-family and planned
residential developments of townhomes, apartments, and senior housing.
The Land Use Plan Monte allows mixed/multiuse housing in many
districts—the Downtown, major corridors, El Monte Gateway, and others.
Certain housing types in different configurations will be more appropriate
in different residential neighborhoods of the community.
El Monte visions corridor revitalization as a means to facilitate a vibrant
and attractive street environment, remove incompatible uses, provide
quality housing, and improve air quality and mobility. The City will
prepare a corridor implementation plan with the following goal statement
and policies to revitalize its corridors.
                                                         El Monte General Plan LU-39

      Land Use Element
      Goal LU-9
      Recreate vibrant commercial corridors with the introduction of a mix of
      higher density residential uses, sensitively integrated commercial uses
      concentrated at critical nodes, and tree-lined streetscapes that are
      aesthetically pleasing, encourage walking, and inspire community pride.
      Policies
      Land Use
      LU-9.1    Corridor Reuse. Promote the reuse of strip commercial and
                industrial corridors by consolidating retail and commercial uses
                into activity nodes and transitioning intervening areas for
                midblock residential or mixed\multiuse developments.
      LU-9.2    Housing Types. Sensitively integrate higher density residential
                uses (e.g., townhomes, live-work, planned residential
                developments, etc.) along major corridors consistent with
                corridor implementation plans.
      LU-9.3    Prohibited Uses. Prohibit industrial and commercial uses along
                major corridors that detract from residential neighborhoods and
                adjacent residential uses along the corridors; assist in relocating
                present incompatible uses to other areas of the City.
      Circulation and Streetscape
      LU-9.4    Truck Traffic. Convert Durfee Road—from the southern City
                limits to Valley Boulevard—from a principal arterial to a
                secondary arterial and discourage heavy truck through-traffic to
                allow for the right-of-way needed to make it a green corridor.
      LU-9.5    Bicycle Lanes/Walkways. Create a Class 2 bicycle lane along
                Durfee Road, from the south City limits to Ramona to provide an
                exclusive or semiexclusive use of bicycles; also line the street with
                complete sidewalks to encourage pedestrian activity.
      LU-9.6    Streetscape Program. Establish a comprehensive streetscape and
                landscape program for corridors that include right-of-way
                improvements to street trees, street lighting, streetscape elements
                (sidewalk/crosswalk paving, street, furniture), and public signage.
LU-40 El Monte General Plan

Design
LU-9.7  Housing Design. In concert with expectations for architecture in
        the Community Design Element and corridor implementation
        plans, require excellence in residential architecture design and
        construction practices exemplified by the following principles:
           Materials. Use high-quality, natural building materials, such
            as stucco, plaster, stone, and wood surfaces. Prohibit
            reflective glass, glossy surfaces, or poor imitation materials
           Durability. materials and design should evidence high
            attention to durability (without sacrificing aesthetics) that
            will withstand weather, use, and the test of time
           Aesthetics. structural appearance should incorporate
            thoughtful design in rooflines, facades, entryways, building
            orientation, and site layout
           Functionality. residential buildings must de designed in a
            manner to fulfill the functional needs of housing, including
            size of units, parking needs, and other accommodations
           Sustainability. incorporate green building techniques, energy
             efficiency, and other sustainable building technologies into
             new housing balanced with the overriding need for aesthetics
LU-9.8  Lot Consolidation. Offer, to development projects with lots of
        one acre or more; progressive residential densities under the
        maximum density allowed under the Land Use Plan for
        mixed/multiuse housing; where lots are smaller, encourage lot
        consolidation and merges to assemble large enough lots.
Environment
LU-9.9  Brownfields. Require property owners to clean up any brown
        fields or leaking underground storage tanks as a result of
        industrial activities prior to recording a sale/transfer of property
        unless the new owner assumes full cleanup responsibility.
LU-9.10 Green Parkways. Line corridors with green parkways and/or
        lush landscaped medians, shade-providing canopy trees, and
        complete sidewalks, wherever possible, to improve the
        streetscape, add value to properties, and beautify the corridors.

                                               River in the north-central portion of the City. The El Monte Airport is
                                               owned and managed by the County of Los Angeles. The El Monte Airport’s
                                               role is to provide primarily recreational aviation services to El Monte and

                                               The El Monte Airport Master Plan proposes plans to accommodate existing
                                               and future needs. The adopted airport land use plan (ALUP) for the El
                                               Monte Airport, however, has remained unchanged since 1983. The Master
                                               Plan (1995) anticipates that the airport’s core functions (primarily
                                               recreational and training purposes and to a lesser degree company business,
                                               personal business, and governmental uses) will remain.
                                               The Los Angeles County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan designates
                                               airport influence zones for El Monte and provides a series of proposed
                                               policies and compatibility criteria to ensure that both aviation and
                                               surrounding uses may continue. The Airport Land Use Commission Law
                                               requires cities and counties to amend their general plans to conform to
                                               adopted airport land use plans. The El Monte General Plan land use plan is
                                               consistent with the ALUP, which is consistent with the ALUCP.

Goal LU-10
Maintain land use compatibility and consistency to minimize airport land
use impacts to adjacent land uses within the city.
Policies
LU-10.1 Compatibility. Require that all new development be consistent
         with the adopted airport land use plan for the airport and
         prohibit structures or activities that encroach upon or adversely
         affect navigable airspace.
LU-10.2 Buildings. Limit the type of development, population density,
         maximum site coverage, and height of structures as specified in
         the applicable safety zones in the airport land use plan for the
         airport, shown in the Public Health and Safety Element.
LU-10.3 Permitting. Refer proposed changes to the General Plan, specific
         plans, zoning ordinance, or building regulations affecting areas
         covered by the El Monte Airport Land Use Plan to the Los
         Angeles County Airport Land Use Commission prior to adoption.
LU-10.4 Land Uses. Prohibit schools, hospitals, day care facilities, or new
         residential development from locating in close proximity to the
         airport or, if already present, from changing or modifying their
         use in a manner that conflicts with the airport land use plan.
LU-10.5 Master Plan. Work with Los Angeles County Airport Land Use
         Commission to update the 1995 Airport Master Plan in a manner
         that promotes the airport’s value to the community, businesses in
         the San Gabriel Valley, and recreational interests.

4.           Housing Element
   Introduction
   Vision El Monte…… a balanced city that provides a wide range
   of housing types and prices suited to residents; a city of well-
   maintained and distinct neighborhoods that are safe and have quality
   housing and supporting park and recreational amenities; a community
   that cares about its residents, offering assistance to homeowners,
   renters, and people with special needs.
   PROVIDING QUALITY HOUSING
   The Housing Element is about ensuring that adequate and affordable
   housing is available for residents, that neighborhoods support the
   desired quality of life in El Monte. The overarching goals are to:
      Provide quality supply and diversity of housing—facilitating the
       provision of a range of housing types and prices affordable to all
       economic segments of the community.
      Improve and maintain housing quality—encouraging the
       rehabilitation and preservation of housing for residents through
       code enforcement and rehabilitation loan assistance.
      Improve and maintain neighborhoods—providing well-designed
       and maintained infrastructure, trees and parks, medians and
       greenways, and public and social services.
                                                         El Monte General Plan H-1

    Housing Element
       Ensure fair housing—promoting equal housing opportunity to all
        residents of El Monte regardless of income, disability, family type,
        age, or other circumstance.
       Engage the community—providing ways for residents and
        business to help plan, design, and implement programs and
        services.
    PURPOSE OF ELEMENT
    California law requires that cities develop housing programs to meet
    their fair share of existing and future housing needs for the
    community. To comply with state law and provide housing
    opportunities for residents, the City of El Monte prepares a housing
    element every eight years. The El Monte Housing Element covers the
    planning period of 2014-2021.
    The Housing Element must contain goals, policies, and programs to
    facilitate the development, improvement, and preservation of housing
    commensurate with the City’s housing need. The Housing Element
    must:
       Identify adequate sites for a range of housing opportunities.
       Assist in the development of adequate and affordable housing.
       Address constraints to meeting the City’s housing needs.
       Conserve and improve the condition of housing.
       Promote housing opportunities for all residents.
    CONTENT OF ELEMENT
    California Housing Element law prescribes the scope and content of
    the housing element. Pursuant to Section 65583 of the Government
    Code, the housing element contains four parts:
       Analysis of El Monte’s demographic, social, housing
        characteristics; current housing needs; and future housing needs
        due to population growth and change.
       Analysis of governmental and nongovernmental constraints that
        affect the development, maintenance, and improvement of
        housing for all income groups and people with special needs.
H-2 El Monte General Plan

   Inventory of resources available to address the City’s housing
    needs, including available land for housing, as well as the
    financial resources and administrative capacity to manage
    housing programs.
   Evaluation of accomplishments of current housing programs and
    specific programs to address the development, improvement, and
    conservation of housing to meet current and future needs.
This Housing Element focuses on summarizing pertinent housing
needs and setting forth goals, policies, and implementation programs.
As a necessary reference to this document, the Housing Element
Technical Report provides detailed discussion of background
information.
RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
The City of El Monte’s 2014-2021 Housing Element is directly related
to and consistent with a number of housing policy and program plans
that are mandated by the state of California and the federal
government.
    Federal Planning Requirements
El Monte prepares two plans as a condition of receiving federal funds
for housing and community development activities. The Consolidated
Plan identifies housing and community development needs and
programs for lower and moderate income households and
households with special needs. The Analysis of Impediments to Fair
Housing Choice is designed to ensure that City policies and programs
affirmatively further fair housing. The Housing Element builds on
these planning efforts, and its goals, policies, and programs are
consistent with the City’s federal housing plans.
    California Planning Requirements
State housing element law requires the Southern California
Association of Governments (SCAG) to determine the amount of
housing needed within its six-county region and allocate a share of
the regional housing need to each community. State law requires local
governments to ensure that adequate sites, public facilities, and
                                                    El Monte General Plan H-3

    Housing Element
    services are available to facilitate housing production commensurate
    with their assigned housing need.
        General Plan Consistency
    California law requires that General Plans contain an integrated set of
    goals and policies that are internally consistent within each element
    and the General Plan as a whole. For instance, land use policies in the
    Land Use Element must be consistent with housing policies in the
    Housing Element and transportation policies in the Circulation
    Element. Therefore, as the General Plan is updated, the Housing
    Element must also be amended to maintain consistency in housing
    goals, policies, and programs.
    EL MONTE SPEAKS
    California law states that local governments shall make a diligent
    effort to achieve public participation from all economic segments of
    the community in the development of the housing element. This
    Housing Element was part of the overall update to the General Plan
    and thus built on its community workshops and public engagement
    efforts. The public engagement program was also coordinated with
    the outreach efforts for the Consolidated Plan. These efforts are
    summarized below.
        Housing Services
    The City’s Consolidated Plan (ConPlan) provided the planning
    context for understanding El Monte’s housing and service needs. The
    2010-2015 ConPlan incorporated substantial citizen participation and
    consultation. During this process, the City held a town meeting that
    examined issues related to affordable housing, public housing,
    homelessness, and non-housing community development and public
    hearings to garner citizen comments on the needs, strategies, actions,
    and projects in the Consolidated Plan. A needs survey was distributed
    at all of the City facilities for residents to communicate their
    comments on housing, homelessness, community development, and
    economic development needs. The City distributed the ConPlan and
    provided a 30-day public comment period, after which the City
    Council held public hearings for adoption.
H-4 El Monte General Plan

    Fair Housing Needs
Input on City fair housing needs was gathered primarily through the
public participation process for the Analysis of Impediments to Fair
Housing(A.I.). To solicit public participation in the A.I., the City held
a Community Meeting to provide background on the scope of the
study and solicit input on the most pressing issues affecting housing
opportunities in El Monte. The City also distributed Resident Surveys
at various locations. Following the Community Meeting, a draft copy
of the A.I. was prepared. The Draft A.I. was then finalized and made
available for a 30-day public review. The City Council convened a
Public Hearing to solicit feedback from the public and then formally
adopted the A.I. during the City Council Meeting held on June 1,
2010. Comments received on the Draft A.I. during the public review
period or during the Public Hearing were incorporated into the
Conclusions and Recommendations section of the A.I. The Housing
Element focuses on ensuring that land use policies, development
codes, and permit procedures encourage appropriate housing choices.
    Housing Element Workshop
Prior to drafting the final Housing Element, the City held one
community workshop with the Planning Commission in 2013 to
identify housing needs, hear from residents regarding their concerns,
and seek policy and program direction from the City Council. To
ensure that adequate representation was available from all economic
segments of the population, the following groups representing low
and moderate income residents were specifically contacted for their
involvement in El Monte:
       A Community of Friends
       Action Food Pantry
       California Housing Partnership Corporation
       Catholic Charities/Brother Miguel Center

Planning Commissioners and attendants asked questions on the
definition of persons with developmental disabilities and expressed
their desire to provide more housing for this special needs group. A
representative from the San Gabriel Valley Conservation Corps
attended the workshop and talked about the need to continue funding
for the organization in order to provide much needed youth
programs in the community. Comments received from these forums
were incorporated into the draft Housing Element. The document was
also circulated to the Chamber of Commerce, the Library, the Senior
Center, local school districts, and other interested parties upon
request. The draft Housing Element will be reviewed by the
Department of Housing and Community Development and respective
changes will be made to ensure that the draft meet statutory
requirements before adoption hearings are held.
    Public Hearings
The Planning Commission and City Council held noticed public
hearings on November 19, 2013 and December 17, 2013, respectively,
to review and adopt the Housing Element and Negative Declaration.
Additional notices were sent to the same groups noticed for the
community workshop. The adopted 2014–2021 Housing Element will
be sent to water and sewer providers and public schools.

    Housing Element
    Housing Context
    The Housing Element is intended to facilitate the development,
    improvement, and preservation of housing and neighborhoods in El
    Monte. The community context summarizes key housing issues in El
    Monte that are a foundation for responsive housing policies and
    programs. As a necessary companion for this Housing Element, the
    Housing Technical Report provides greater detail on El Monte’s
    housing context.
    EL MONTE’S POPULATION
    According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey (ACS), El
    Monte has a population of 113,763. Hispanic residents comprise 69
    percent of the total population, and Asians comprise 33 percent. El
    Monte’s population is one of the youngest in the county, with a
    median age of 31. However, reflective of broader regional
    demographic trends, the baby boom population in the City of El
    Monte is the fastest growing group, having increased 32 percent
    during the past decade.
    Household composition also affects housing needs. El Monte has a
    significant number of families (84 percent) who typically look for
    larger dwellings. As a family-oriented community, El Monte has the
    third largest average household size of cities in the San Gabriel
    Valley, at 4.04 persons. Single-person households, a smaller share of
    households, tend to desire condominiums and similar housing.
    Seniors, a growing segment of El Monte, tend to look for housing that
    is affordable and easy to maintain.
    Certain individuals and families in El Monte encounter greater
    difficulty finding affordable housing due to their special
    circumstances. These special circumstances could be related to age,
    employment, family type, or other characteristics. El Monte residents
    include seniors, people with disabilities, female-headed households
    (single–parent), large households, veterans, homeless people, and
    others with special needs. Providing housing and support services are
    essential to meeting their needs.
    Reflective of trends throughout the San Gabriel Valley, the Southern
    California Association of Government is projecting population
H-8 El Monte General Plan

growth over the next few decades. The City of El Monte is projected
to increase in population to approximately 140,000 residents by 2035.
Natural growth and change in the City’s demographic makeup will
create a demand for different types and prices of housing,
underscoring the importance of providing housing choices and prices
that are suited to people with different lifestyle needs.
EL MONTE’S ECONOMY
Employment influences the demand for different types of housing to
the extent that the workforce seeks to live near their place of work. El
Monte has approximately 27,000 jobs that are concentrated in Flair
Business Park, greater downtown, Auto District, and the Northwest
Industrial District. The type of jobs held by residents also influences
the income earned by residents and their ability to afford different
types and prices of housing. Major sectors residents are employed in
include construction and manufacturing (27 percent), public sector
and schools (18 percent), wholesale/retail (17 percent), and
professional/real estate/financing/information (13 percent).
Economic revitalization is a key objective in the General Plan update.
The Land Use Plan and Economic Development Element anticipate
growth of professional offices and financial trades in Flair Park, new
manufacturing and distribution employment in the Northwest
Industrial District, and professional trades, retail, and services in the
El Monte Gateway.
The median income of households in the City is approximately
$41,820, and it reflects differences in family size, composition, age,
and other factors. Households can be grouped into five classifications.
Approximately 67 percent of households earn low income, defined as
less than 80 percent of the County median family income (MFI).
Moderate and above-moderate income households, earning 80
percent or more of MFI, comprise the remaining households (33
percent) in the City.
In recent years, the City has experienced an increase in middle–
income households in a wide variety of professions, many of which
will increase in number with the developments projected for
employment centers. These households will seek moderately priced
housing for their families. Given the escalating housing prices in the
                                                       El Monte General Plan H-9

     Housing Element
     city, discussed later, and the lack of market-rate apartments, a
     significant concern is that these households may leave the community
     to find suitable housing in inland cities.
     EL MONTE’S HOUSING
     According to the 2007-2011 American Community Survey, El Monte
     has 29,437 housing units. Of that total, single-family homes comprise
     roughly 70 percent of all homes in the City. Multiple-family housing
     comprises one quarter of all housing units, with the majority in
     projects of five or more units. The City’s 1,331 mobile home units
     comprise the remaining 5 percent of the housing stock.
     Approximately 41 percent of households own homes and 59 percent
     rent homes. Many single-family homes (45 percent) are rented,
     presumably due to the need for larger units that can accommodate
     families.
     In El Monte, the housing vacancy rate is generally lower than optimal,
     averaging 3.2 percent for rentals and 1.8 percent for ownership units.
     The low vacancy rate has had a dramatic influence on housing
     availability. Average home prices are $338,000 for single-family
     homes and $275,000 for condominiums, with newer homes selling at
     much higher prices. Apartment rents are also high, with median rents
     of $935 for a one-bedroom unit to $1,700 for a three-bedroom
     apartment.
     Increasing rents and home prices have made it more difficult for
     residents to afford housing in El Monte. Overpayment refers to a
     household that pays more than 30 percent of gross income for
     housing costs. According to the 2007-2011 American Community
     Survey, 56 percent of all households in El Monte overpaid for
     housing, with more than 61 percent of renters overpaying.
     Overcrowding refers to a household that has more members than
     rooms in a home. According to the 2007-2011 American Community
     Survey, 25 percent of households live in overcrowded housing, with
     higher overcrowding rates among renters.
     El Monte has an older housing stock; roughly 70 percent were built
     before 1980. As a general rule, homes older than 30 years generally
     need repairs (e.g., new roof, plumbing, and siding. Homes older than
     50 years frequently need new electrical, plumbing, roofing, and other
H-10 El Monte General Plan

improvements. Homes older than 70 years, unless maintained, require
substantial rehabilitation. Although El Monte has older housing,
investment is occurring as homeowners improve their homes and
infill projects replace older homes.
El Monte contains a mosaic of neighborhoods distinguished by
history, architecture, density, housing types, lot patterns, and street
configurations. These neighborhoods include Norwood-Cherrylee,
Arden Village, Park El Monte, Mountain View, Downtown, and River
East. The City is committed to providing quality housing for its
residents, ample parks and recreational opportunities, tree-lined
streets and sidewalks for walking, safety and security, and quality
public facilities and services.

     Goals and Policies
The Housing Element is about creating a livable community through
providing quality housing, building safe and nurturing
neighborhoods for residents, and assisting El Monte residents with
special housing needs. This section focuses on goals, policies, and
programs for each topic. Each topic is introduced with a summary of
key planning information, followed by a goal statement and policies
to guide the implementation process.
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS
Neighborhoods are the fundamental building block in El Monte and
the most tangible measure of quality of life. El Monte contains a
mosaic of six major residential neighborhoods, each distinguished by
its own history, architecture, density, housing types, lot patterns, and
street configurations.
                                                                             Norwood-Cherrylee Neighborhood

intended to allow for subsistence farming. With its rural ambience,
the neighborhood is distinguished by its equestrian and agricultural
heritage. Many of the single-family homes adjacent to the Rio Hondo
and San Gabriel Rivers are still used for equestrian purposes and
visitors can occasionally see horseback riders. Many streets in the
northern section are not improved with sidewalks, reflecting the more
rural nature and history of the neighborhood.

safety programs. The City is completing a network of sidewalks to
allow children to walk safely to school and parks. Traffic safety and
patrols prevent speeding and accidents. The City also provides
volunteer programs, neighborhood watch programs, and gang
prevention and youth diversion programs. The overriding goal is to
make neighborhoods safer for residents, visitors, and the business
community.
Housing Quality
El Monte’s neighborhoods contain a mix of homes built in many
decades. Some homes are in excellent condition, some require
maintenance, and others require major rehabilitation. To ensure that
homes are maintained in excellent condition, the City offers various
housing rehabilitation loans and grants. Housing rehabilitation
programs are currently targeted to single-family homes, and need to
be expanded to mobile homes and apartments. Code enforcement
programs help ensure that homes and businesses are maintained in            Tree-Lined Streets
accordance with community’s expectations. The Beautification                Tree-lined streets and sidewalks add

Parks, Recreation, and Trails
The Parks and Recreation Element visions the creation of more than
200 acres of parks within each neighborhood or near the Emerald
Necklace. A key facet is the development of joint school-parks in each
neighborhood. In cooperation with schools, health care providers, and
the City, joint-use sites can also provide family support services,
including education, child care, recreation programs and activities,
and even health care. Each neighborhood is visioned to have an
interconnecting system of sidewalks, with tree-lined streets and
greenways dotted with mini parks. Wrapping around and linking all
neighborhoods in El Monte is the Emerald Necklace, a proposed 17-
mile loop of trails and linear parks that are being proposed along the
Rio Hondo River and San Gabriel River.

     Neighborhood Involvement
     While El Monte has a relatively local and strong nonprofit
     infrastructure, the City visions a framework for residents to become
     even more active in the improvement of their neighborhoods. The
     City desires to create neighborhood planning areas that bring together
     diverse constituencies to identify, develop, and implement creative
     solutions for neighborhoods. Civic involvement of these groups could
     also be linked to City funding sources through the five-year update of
     the Consolidated Plan, which allocates funding for community
     development activities. Opportunity exists for the City to facilitate a
     framework that draws civic leaders and people not traditionally
     involved into a range of neighborhood building opportunities.
     The following goal statement and policies are designed to strengthen
     El Monte’s neighborhoods and make them a special place to live.
H-18 El Monte General Plan

Goal 1
Sustainable neighborhoods evidenced by quality housing conditions,
ample community services, exemplary public safety and security,
quality public facilities and infrastructure, and civic pride.
Policies
H-1.1 Housing Rehabilitation. Support the rehabilitation of single-
        family and multiple-family units and acquisition and
        rehabilitation of multiple-family housing to improve housing
        conditions, remove blight if needed, and improve the quality
        of life in neighborhoods.
H-1.2 Neighborhood Conditions. Conduct proactive code
        enforcement, real estate inspection programs, and other
        neighborhood improvement efforts to maintain neighborhood
        quality, stabilize declining areas, and improve quality of life.
H-1.3 Community Amenities. Require adequate provision of public
        services and facilities, infrastructure, open space, adequate
        parking and traffic management, pedestrian and bicycle
        routes, and public safety to create highly desirable
        neighborhoods.
H-1.4 Neighborhood          Involvement. Encourage active resident
        involvement in       neighborhood planning organizations to
        identify needs      and implement programs aimed at the
        beautification,      improvement,      and      preservation        of
        neighborhoods.
H-1.5 Architectural Design. Require that all housing, either new or
        rehabilitated, is of exemplary design and construction quality
        through the development and implementation of building
        design standards and architectural review.
H-1.6 Neighborhood Identity. Strengthen neighborhood fabric and
        identity through parks and recreation services, cultural and
        historic features, public art, neighborhood events, as well as
        resident participation in planning and improvement of their
        neighborhoods.

     Housing Element
     H-1.7 Neighborhood            Preservation.      Preserve  single-family
              residential neighborhoods from undue intensification or
              change of land uses that materially detract from the character,
              stability, and quality of life in neighborhoods.
     H-1.8 Code Enforcement. Enforce existing covenants, conditions,
              and restrictions that govern property maintenance for all
              planned residential developments, including apartments and
              townhomes.
     ACCOMMODATING NEW HOUSING
     The City of El Monte had a population of approximately 113,763 as of
     2011. Historically, population has increased at a moderate pace. The
     Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) projects
     population to increase to 140,100 by 2035 due to natural increase and
     employment growth. Employment growth will result from economic
     revitalization efforts underway in the Northwest Industrial District,
     Flair Business Park, Auto District, and the Downtown.
     Section 65583 of the Government Code sets forth the specific
     components to be contained in a community’s housing element.
     Included in these requirements is an obligation on the part of local
     jurisdictions to provide their “fair share” of regional housing needs.
     Local governments and Council of Governments are required to
     determine existing and future housing need and the allocation of said
     need must be approved by the California Department of Housing and
     Community Development (HCD). El Monte is a member of the
     Southern California Association of Governments and SCAG is
     responsible for preparing the Regional Housing Needs Assessment
     (RHNA) for the six-county territory that it represents.
     The City of El Monte has been allocated a total production goal of
     2,142 housing units for the period of 2014–2021. This housing need
     allocation is divided into four housing affordability groups shown in
     Table H-1. State law requires cities to facilitate the achievement of
     these housing goals by making available adequate sites to
     accommodate new housing and implementing programs to facilitate
     and encourage housing production commensurate with the RHNA
     production requirements.

The City of El Monte desires to provide adequate housing
opportunities for its residents and workforce. At the same time,
the City also desires to pursue other community development
goals. It desires to create a vibrant downtown, revitalize aging
corridors, stimulate investment in neighborhoods, and provide
sufficient amenities. To achieve these objectives, the Land Use
Element directs housing into three areas of the community: major
corridors, Downtown Core, and infill development.
Major Corridors
El Monte is crossed by major roads that front residential
neighborhoods. Many corridors contain underused residential,
commercial, and industrial uses incompatible with adjacent
neighborhoods. Corridors provide the opportunity for quality new
housing, while accommodating population growth and protecting the
character of single-family neighborhoods. Corridor revitalization can
also promote the consolidation of strip commercial and industrial
uses into distinct activity nodes. The General Plan thus designates
three corridors for mixed/multiuse development.
     Durfee Road
The General Plan Land Use Plan designates 45 acres along Durfee
Road for mixed/multiuse development at a density of 30 units per
acre. In keeping with the intent of the Housing Element to create
neighborhoods, Durfee Road is visioned to have a mixed/multiuse
node (such as one at Elliott Avenue and Durfee Road) that connects
Mountain View school and park with higher density residential uses
along the Emerald Necklace. Durfee Road will be transformed into a
pedestrian-oriented street with ample landscaping, wide sidewalks,
                                                                       El Monte General Plan H-21

                                                the preferred concept for Durfee Road.
                                                    Garvey Avenue
  Durfee Road Concept
  The Durfee corridor is visioned with a new
  neighborhood center at Durfee Road and
  Elliott Avenue, midblock residential (denoted
  yellow) with connections to the school, park,
  and river.
                                                Garvey Avenue also offers the opportunity for significant
                                                reinvestment. The City has redesignated 44 acres of land to
                                                mixed/multiuses. The streetscape would be transformed to a more
                                                pedestrian-oriented environment with street trees, sidewalks, and
                                                landscape amenities.
                                                The intent is to concentrate commercial uses at major intersections
                                                along Garvey Avenue (e.g., Merced, Santa Anita, Tyler, and Peck) and
                                                facilitate stand alone residential uses between the established
                                                commercial nodes. This is achieved by allowing for lot consolidation
                                                and facilitating and encouraging developers to consolidate lots
                                                wherever possible. Meanwhile, high quality residential uses are
                                                encouraged as feasible. The following graphic illustrates one of many
                                                possible corridor concepts.

                                                                          Garvey Avenue Concept
                                                                          The Garvey corridor is envisioned with a new
                                                                          retail center at Tyler Avenue, Five Points
                                                                          Shopping Center, and midblock residential
                                                                          and mixed uses between the retail nodes.
The type of residential product along the Garvey Corridor differs
widely and is more suited for vertical mixed/multiuses, particularly at
major commercial nodes. Development could also be built at higher
heights and more shallow lots, in keeping with a corridor concept.
The Housing Plan sets forth a program in greater detail to redevelop
the corridor.

                                               The project goal is to provide up to 35 percent rental (648 units) and
                                               up to 65 percent ownership (approximately 1,202 units). The TOD
                                               project will also set aside residential units that are affordable to lower
                                               income households, including seniors. Affordability requirements

                                               Infill Development
                                               The City of El Monte recognizes that housing production can also
                                               serve other goals, including the physical improvement of
                                               neighborhoods. As part of an overall strategy of neighborhood
                                               improvement, the City will continue to encourage the production of
                                               quality housing within neighborhoods as a desirable way to replace
                                               deteriorated or substandard housing. The type of housing desired is
                                               generally single-family units and lower density multifamily
                                               developments, such as planned residential developments, that will
                                               strengthen and improve the fabric of a residential neighborhood.
H-24                                           El Monte General Plan
Although providing sufficient quality housing in El Monte is an
important goal, the production of housing must be balanced with
other neighborhood goals. Important city goals, as expressed by the
community and as set forth throughout the General Plan, include the
provision of adequate parks and recreational amenities, quality
architectural standards, protection of single-family neighborhoods
from transition or incompatible uses, and exemplary traffic control
and public safety. These neighborhood preservation goals, discussed
later, define the best opportunities for new housing.
Taken together, these areas will allow more than 4,600 new housing
units, with a mix of ownership and rental projects (see Table H-2).
During the planning period, more than 3,000 units are anticipated to
be constructed, which is nearly double the remaining RHNA. The
adequacy of these housing opportunity sites to accommodate the
appropriate mix and affordability of housing is discussed in the
Housing Technical Report.

     Housing Element
     Goal 2
     Adequate sites for new housing that create a vibrant downtown,
     revitalize transportation corridors with quality housing, and motivate
     reinvestment and revitalization in neighborhoods.
     Policies
     H-2.1 Housing Sites. Provide adequate sites through land use,
              zoning, and specific plan designations to allow single-family
              homes, apartments, mobile homes, and special needs housing.
     H-2.2 Major Corridors. Direct the production of quality
              mixed/multiuse projects along major corridors, including
              Valley Boulevard, Durfee Road, Peck Road, and Garvey
              Avenue to allow for efficient land use practices, improved
              mobility, and energy conservation.

              public safety, and other public services and facilities.
     H-2.4 Regulatory/Financial Incentives. Provide for regulatory and
              financial incentives, where feasible, to encourage the
              production of well-designed housing, special needs housing,
              and housing affordable to households of different income
              levels.
     H-2.5 Neighborhood Protection. Protect established single-family
              neighborhoods from the transition, intensification, and
              encroachment of nonresidential uses and higher density

        environmentally sustainable practices, building treatments,
        landscaping, and other best practices in concert with
        community expectations for quality.
H-2.8 Downtown Core. Direct the production of new quality
        housing, including mixed/multiuse and mixed-income
        housing along with appropriate amenities, as appropriate, into
        the Downtown Core.
DIVERSITY OF HOUSING TYPES AND PRICES
Where should we live? Near work or family? What kind of housing
can we best afford? How long will it take to save a down payment to
afford a home in El Monte or another community? Does this
neighborhood, size of home, or quality of housing in El Monte best
meet the needs of our family and children or should we move
elsewhere? Where would be the safest and most affordable place for
my parents to retire and live?
    Lifestyle Choices                                                      High Quality Planned Developments
All of us ask these housing questions at different times in our lives—     High quality apartments, illustrated above,
when our children move out on their own, as we begin to have               provide affordable and first-time housing for
                                                                           young adults as they enter the workforce
families, and as we contemplate retirement. The answers to these and
other questions have many implications for El Monte families and
their ability to live near one another. These questions underscore the
importance of an adequate supply of housing attainable for all income
levels and its fundamental relationship to achieving long-term goals
of the community.
    Housing Our Children
Our children are the future of El Monte, and we desire that affordable
housing is available to them. Many young adults earn wages of $7.50
to $15 per hour, an annual income of $15,600 to $31,200. At these
wages, a young adult could afford to pay between $400 and $1,000
per month in rent. With the average rent for a one-bedroom
apartment at $950, young adults have difficulty affording housing
without doubling up.
Given the difficulty of affording entry level housing opportunities,
young adults will begin to weigh their choices to double up with
                                                     El Monte General Plan                                          H-27

     Housing Element
     friends, live with family for an extended period of time, or move out
     of the City. Given market prices, fewer residents can buy their first
     home before their mid-thirties. This places a premium on providing
     attainable entry-level housing, such as apartments, that offer the
     opportunity to build a down payment or equity.
         Housing Our Workforce
     Providing quality and attainable housing also helps El Monte achieve
     its economic development goals. Flair Business Park is transitioning
     to a full-fledged office park and center of employment in El Monte.
     Revitalization efforts in northwest El Monte will reinvigorate this
     manufacturing and distribution area into a thriving employment
     center. The TOD will add more than one million square feet of
     commercial and office space, in addition to significant entertainment
     and hotel uses in the Downtown.
     The types of employment opportunities offered by businesses in Flair
     Park, Northwest Industrial District, and the TOD will be equally
     diverse. These include jobs in the manufacturing and distribution
     sectors, the retail and wholesale sectors, and professional and
     financial sectors. The salaries for jobs within each industry will vary
     significantly, depending on the skills, required education, and years
     of experience needed. Again, this underscores the importance of a
     diversity of housing products.
         Housing Our Families
     The pursuit of liberty and happiness for families is often intertwined
     with the attainment of homeownership. Homeownership carries with
     it independence and freedom, economic stability and success, and
     personal safety and security for families. Homeownership commits
     one to a long-term investment with the home, resulting in increased
     investment in the property, which in turn increases property values in
     the neighborhood.
     El Monte is a predominantly family community with many young
     children. As families have children, they begin to look for larger
     single-family homes that offer more suitable accommodations,
     whether it is a yard for their children to play in, more bedrooms, or a
     detached garage. Families also seek to make longer-term investments
     in their community. This fact underscores the need for attainable
H-28 El Monte General Plan
homeownership opportunities, a difficult challenge when the average
home price exceeds $335,000.
    Housing Our Seniors
As we get older, our housing needs and preferences change. Many
seniors remain in the same home during retirement years, but others
look for housing options that are smaller and easy to maintain. This
includes age-restricted senior housing that provides the benefits of
greater security, social amenities, and a range of needed support
services. However, if suitable housing cannot be found, senior
households may move out of the community to more affordable
housing in more remote areas.
The City recognizes the importance of housing our seniors in El
Monte. More than 860 units of subsidized affordable apartments are
available for lower and moderate income seniors. Many of these
projects are located downtown close to transit and public services.
These senior apartments often maintain partnerships with local
service providers for supportive services, including exercise, health
care, education, nutrition, transportation, tax planning, and other
services.

     Housing Element
         Housing Affordability and Choice
     In this housing market, prices and rents have increased so rapidly in
     recent years that fewer and fewer individuals and families can afford
     to purchase or rent a home. This seriously curtails the real housing
     choices available to El Monte residents.
         Homeownership Assistance
     In 2013, the average price of a single-family home was $338,000 down
     from $475,000 in 2006. Similarly, the purchase price for
     condominiums was $275,000 down from $415,000 in 2006. To qualify
     for a loan to buy a single-family home, a buyer would need to earn
     well above $100,000, which is 13 percent of what all households earn.
     First time buyers could not qualify to purchase a resale condominium
     without a salary of well above $75,000, which approximately 23
     percent of households currently earn.
     El Monte benefits from a wide variety of employment, including retail
     and service workers, teachers, police officers, and many other
     professions. Service workers typically earn between $7.50 to $15 per
     hour, or up to $31,600 annually. Police officers earn $55,000 to $67,000
     annually. Teachers in the Mountain View School District, one of the
     best-paying districts in Los Angeles County, start at $45,000 and can
     earn $92,000 after 30 years. Even these wages may be insufficient to
     afford a home these days.
         Rental Assistance
     The City of El Monte is actively involved in expanding
     homeownership opportunities to residents through down payment
     assistance, working with partners active in the community, and
     through outreach and education. Many El Monte residents,
     particularly young adults or seniors, can only afford an apartment. At
     entry level wages, a young adult could afford to pay between $400
     and $1,000 per month in rent. Yet the average one-bedroom
     apartment rents for about $1,200 per month.
     The County of Los Angeles and Baldwin Authority Housing
     Authority offer rental assistance in the form of housing vouchers to
     very low income households in El Monte. However, the waiting list is
     long and vouchers are available for only one of every three eligible
H-30 El Monte General Plan
households. Seniors and disabled people have preference, but the
remaining disproportionate need is for affordable rental housing for
families with children. El Monte has an acute need for subsidized
apartments suitable for families with children.
        Mobile Home Park Rent Stabilization
Mobile home parks in the City provide lower income residents with
affordable housing. According to a recent study of mobile home parks
conducted for the City of El Monte, the average household income of
residents in non-mobile homes in the City is approximately $53,063,
while the average household income of residents in mobile homes is
approximately $33, 958.Private sector ownership of mobile home
parks brings with it economic incentives to raise rents, which in light
of the scarcity of spaces and the prohibitive cost of mobile home
relocation, makes mobile home owner susceptible to excessive or
unfair rent increases. The study has found that monthly rents for
certain mobile home spaces in El Monte exceed the average rent for
area apartments, which is $1,174 per unit/month.
To ensure that conditions are preserved to promote and enhance
fairness in the economic relationship between mobile home park
owners and mobile home owners, the City of El Monte is currently in
the process of adopting a mobile home park rent stabilization
ordinance. The City recognizes that mobile home owners and
residents should be protected from unreasonable space rental
increases, while also recognizing the need of mobile home park
owners to receive a just and reasonable return on their investment.
The ordinance was reviewed by the Planning Commission on August
13, 2013 and will be reviewed by the City Council in September 2013.
    Mobile Home Conversion Ordinance
In 2013, the City Council has adopted regulations governing the
change of use of mobile home parks in order to balance the needs of
protecting mobile home park residents from displacement and
hardships with the rights of mobile home park owners to make
decisions concerning their businesses and property use. The City has
adopted Mobile home Park Discontinuance and Tenant Relocation
Regulations to set forth procedures for the conversion of an existing
mobile home park or spaces to another use. These regulations are
intended to benefit the general public by minimizing the adverse
                                                     El Monte General Plan H-31
     Housing Element
     impact on the housing supply and on displaced persons by providing
     certain rights and benefits to tenants and by requiring tenant
     relocation assistance whenever an existing mobile home park or
     portion thereof is converted to another use. The regulations require
     mobile home park owners who wish to convert their property for
     another use to file an application to discontinue the mobile home park
     or mobile home park use. The application for discontinuance is
     required to include a relocation plan that will comply with standards
     and regulations developed by the Planning Commission.
H-32 El Monte General Plan
    Creative Partnerships and Tools
In today’s housing market, creative approaches and partnerships are
required to finance and build affordable housing. The County
Housing Authority, Habitat for Humanity, Rio Hondo Community
Development Corporation (RHCDC), Institute for Urban Research,
Housing Rights Center, and other agencies offer expertise in
developing and managing affordable housing or providing a network
of supportive services. In recent years, the City has partnered with
several nonprofits to build housing.
The City of El Monte has also granted regulatory concessions,
subsidized infrastructure improvements, modified development
regulations, and provided direct assistance to such groups to build
affordable housing. Working with nonprofit developers enables the
City to better provide high quality and affordable housing products.
As the City continues to pursue its housing goals, nurturing public-
private partnerships will continue to be an important strategy for
leveraging funding, enhancing the City’s administrative capacity, and
achieving City housing goals.
    Affordable Housing Preservation
Preserving the availability of publicly subsidized affordable housing
also plays an important role in the City’s housing strategy. El Monte
has 11 rental projects that provide subsidized, low-cost housing for
more than 863 senior households earning lower incomes. These
projects provide long-term affordable housing options that are deed
restricted. Four projects have been identified as potential candidates
for conversion to market rents during the next ten years due to the
expiration of affordability controls.
State law requires all housing elements to include an analysis of
multiple-family affordable housing projects (see Technical Appendix)
assisted by governmental funds regarding their eligibility to change
from low income housing to market rates. Given the cost of building
new housing versus the relatively low cost of preserving existing
housing and the value of publicly subsidized housing to our seniors,
the City of El Monte is committed to assisting, where feasible, to
maintain these affordable units.

SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS
Certain individuals and families in El Monte have greater difficulty in
finding affordable housing due to their special circumstances. Special
circumstances may be related to income, family characteristics,
medical condition or disability, and/or household characteristics. A
major emphasis of the Housing Element is to ensure that persons of
all walks of life have opportunity to find suitable and affordable
housing in El Monte.
State law identifies many groups as having special needs, and the
Housing Element contains programs to address their needs. Table H-3
summarizes these special needs groups in the City and their housing
status.

      Seniors
The City of El Monte is home to 4,488 households with a senior
member, comprising 14 percent of all households. In El Monte, 59
percent of senior households (or 2,493) own a home and 1,995 are
renters. According to the Census, 70 percent of all seniors earn low
income, and more than 59 percent of lower income senior renters and
34 percent of lower income senior homeowners overpay for housing.
Due to their fixed retirement income, seniors may need assistance to
maintain and improve their homes. Seniors may also require
accessibility improvements for their homes over time.
                                                                  El Monte General Plan H-37
     Housing Element
     El Monte operates the Jack Crippen Senior Center, which serves as a
     meeting place and service center for seniors. The City provides
     housing grants and loans, rental assistance, and other programs for
     seniors. The City also provides housing options for seniors, including
     11 senior housing projects, ten skilled nursing facilities, and seven
     residential care facilities. Many of these projects also have on-site
     services, including assisted living, day care, health care, and other
     senior services.
         Persons with Disabilities
     The City of El Monte has 9,876 households with a member who has a
     mental, physical, mobility, or developmental disability. Disabled
     persons may earn very low incomes, have higher health costs, and are
     often dependent on supportive services. Individuals with disabilities
     may reside in group quarters, such as licensed community care
     facilities, residential care facilities for the elderly, etc. People with
     disabilities may also live in independent or group housing.
     The City enforces disabled accessibility requirements for new
     housing, allows residents to modify their homes to improve
     accessibility, and provides improvement and rehabilitation grants for
     homeowners. In many cases, however, disabilities could be mental or
     developmental in nature. For individuals requiring more specialized
     care, the City offers a range of group housing arrangements,
     including licensed community care facilities, alcohol and drug
     rehabilitation, and skilled nursing facilities.
         Persons with Developmental Disabilities
     According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code a
     "Developmental disability" means a disability that originates before
     an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to
     continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that
     individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
     epilepsy, and autism.
     Many persons with developmental disabilities can live and work
     independently within a conventional housing environment.
     Individuals who have more severe disabilities require a group living
     environment where supervision is provided. The most severely
H-38 El Monte General Plan
affected individuals may require an institutional environment where
medical attention and physical therapy are provided. Because
developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first issue in
supportive housing for those with developmental disabilities is the
transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an
appropriate level of independence as an adult.
The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently
provides community based services to approximately 243,000 persons
with developmental disabilities and their families through a statewide
system of 21 regional centers, four developmental centers, and two
community-based facilities. The San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center
is one of 21 regional centers in the State of California that provides
point of entry to services for people with developmental disabilities.
Information from the San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center provides a
closer look at the developmentally disabled population. According to
the Regional Center, there are approximately 930 individuals (0.8
percent of the total population) diagnosed with a cognitive or
developmental disability in the City of El Monte.
    Family Households
El Monte is predominantly a family community. In recent years,
soaring housing prices and rents have placed an increasing cost
burden on families. Families earning low incomes experience high
rates of overpayment today. Moreover, the City of El Monte is home
to 5,271 female-headed families and 8,504 families of five or more           Housing for Families
members. Single-parent and large households also have critical               El Monte’s children are our future. Ensuring
housing-related needs, with high levels of overpayment, lower                quality affordable housing is available gives
                                                                             our children security and a place to call
incomes, and overcrowding.                                                   home.
The housing needs of families have commonalities, such as affordable
child care and affordable housing. Many residents rent housing
because they cannot afford to buy quality housing. For those who
rent, there is a limited choice of quality apartments. Similarly, the City
does not currently have publicly subsidized rental housing for
families. Although the County offers about 500 lower income
households with rental vouchers, the waiting list is three times the
number of units available.

         Veterans
     Veterans of foreign wars comprise a significant group in El Monte.
     According to the 2010 Census, the City is home to 2,173 veterans.
     Many veterans experience high levels of post-traumatic stress
     disorder, injuries from service, and other conditions that make it
     difficult to obtain jobs and find suitable housing. The housing needs
     of the armed forces extend also to their families living in the states
     that need to maintain housing.
     The Veterans Administration offers programs to help veterans find
     jobs, modify their homes, and obtain counseling and support.
     Housing programs include the Specially Adapted Housing Grants
     program, Guaranteed Home Loan, Independent Living Program, and
     the Home Improvement and Structural Alterations program. El
     Monte offers homebuyer down payment assistance and rehabilitation
     loan programs that could also be leveraged with VA programs to
     improve housing options for veterans. To date, Mercy Housing has
     provided 41 housing units to veterans in El Monte.
         Homeless People
     San Gabriel Valley has a significant homeless population, with an
     estimated 364 persons, according to the Greater Los Angeles
     Homeless Count Report authored by the Los Angles Homeless
     Services Authority (LAHSA). The needs of homeless people are as
     varied as the reasons for their homelessness. These needs may include
     affordable housing, stable employment, treatment of medical
     conditions, childcare assistance, credit history, adequate rental
     assistance, and treatment of substance abuse and/or mental illness. El
     Monte is committed to actively addressing the needs of homeless
     people through its housing and service policies and programs.
     El Monte is part of the countywide Los Angeles Continuum of Care
     (LACoC), coordinated by the LAHSA, a joint powers authority.
     LAHSA partners with cities to provide homeless services throughout
     the county. In 2003, the City established a Homeless and Veterans
     Commission to maintain dialog on how to address the needs of these
     populations. The City currently works with nonprofit agencies in the
     community to fund vouchers, permit transitional housing, and
H-40 El Monte General Plan
support agencies providing services. The Housing Plan contains new
programs to address the needs of homeless people.
    Farmworkers
The State of California also recognizes the special housing needs of
farmworkers, in particular migrant farm laborers earning very low
incomes. The transitory nature of the labor force, the need for
affordable housing, the unique educational needs, and the impact on
the stability of children’s lives make this group particularly
vulnerable. El Monte has an estimated 185 farmworkers, many of
whom are employed year-round. Their housing needs can best be met
through existing permanent affordable rental housing in the
community.
The following goal statement and policies are designed to address the
housing and support needs of special needs groups in El Monte.

     Housing Element
         Housing Implementation Plan
     The Housing Implementation Plan sets forth a variety of specific
     programs to achieve the General Plan vision and the housing goals
     and policies in the Housing Element. These programs are described
     below.
     1.     Corridor Implementation Plans
     The City has redesignated 90 acres of land along Garvey Avenue and
     Durfee Road for higher density mixed/multiuse housing, with
     commercial uses concentrated at key intersections. Additional sites
     have been designated along Peck Road for mixed/multiuse housing.
     The City has completed rezoning these sites to allow multifamily and
     single-family residential uses by-right and has developed related
     development standards. The City will amend the Zoning Code
     concurrent with Housing Element adoption to formally adopt the
     development standards for the Mixed/Multi-Use (MMU) Zone.
     While sites were rezoned, not all of statutory requirements of the
     adequate sites program requirements were addressed. To comply
     with AB 2348, at least 50 percent of the remaining lower income need
     from the 4th cycle RHNA (320 units) will be accommodated on sites
     designated for exclusively residential uses allowing a minimum 20
     dwelling units per acre. To address this requirement the City has
     identified approximately 12 acres within the MMU Zone which will
     be designated exclusively for residential uses as identified in Table 41
     in Appendix A of the Housing Element Technical Report.To further
     facilitate redevelopment of these corridors in a cohesive manner, the
     City will prepare corridor implementation plans for Durfee Road and
     Garvey Avenue. The plan will include land use and streetscape
     concepts, including preferred locations for housing, commercial
     nodes, landscaping and parkways, and a mobility plan. The plan will
     provide greater certainty to developers, who will understand City
     expectations and can therefore propose projects with limited
     discretionary approvals.
     To ensure sufficient residential capacity to accommodate the
     identified regional need for lower income households is maintained
     in the Garvey Avenue corridor and the Durfee Road corridor, the City
H-44 El Monte General Plan
will develop and implement a formal monitoring program. The
program will track development approvals on identified sites and for
those that result in a reduction of potential affordable units below the
residential capacity assumed in Table 40, the City will identify and
designate additional sites to rezone to ensure that no net loss occurs.
This means that if any of the identified sites are not developed in
accordance with the development requirement outlined for the MMU
zone, including sites designated for exclusively residential uses as
identified on Table 40, an alternative sites or sites will be identified
and rezoned to maintain overall affordable unit capacity. The City
will report on the progress of this amendment in its annual progress
reports required pursuant to Government Code Sections 65400 and
due on April 1st of each year. Specific housing objectives are below:
Objectives:
   Develop Corridor Implementation Plans for the Garvey Avenue
    and Durfee Corridor areas that will include land use and
    streetscape concepts, including preferred locations for housing,
    commercial nodes, landscaping and parkways, and a mobility
    plan.
   Further encourage and facilitate the development of affordable
    housing through streamlined processing, fee modifications,
    density bonus incentives, reductions in development and
    parking standards, and funding, when available, for site
    improvements.
   Continue to provide appropriate land use designations and
    maintain an inventory of suitable sites for residential
    development. Make the vacant and underutilized residential
    sites inventory available to non-profit and for-profit housing
    developers on the City’s website and at City Hall.
   Designate at least 10.5 acres for exclusively residential uses in
    the MMU zone; and identify alternatives sites if any identified
    sites are not developed in accordance with the development
    requirements of sites designated for exclusively residential
    uses in the MMU zone.

     Housing Element
     2.       Downtown Specific Plan
     El Monte’s Downtown encompasses 200 acres, bordered by the Rio
     Hondo River, Interstate 10, and Ramona Boulevard. The Downtown
     Core contains key activity centers that serve civic/governmental,
     business, transportation, recreational, and residential uses. The
     Downtown vision is as a mixed-income, multiuse, and vibrant center
     of El Monte, with additional housing, retail, office, parks, and cultural
     facilities. In order to plan for this area in a comprehensive manner, a
     Downtown Specific Plan will be created that provides for an
     appropriate balance of land uses, including housing, and strengthens
     connection to the Emerald Necklace of parks and trails as well.
     Objectives:
        Prepare a Downtown Specific Plan that includes a land use plan,
         infrastructure plan, parks and recreational plan, design
         regulations, transportation and circulation plan, and other key
         elements.
     3.     El Monte Gateway
     The TOD at the El Monte Transit Station (El Monte Gateway Specific
     Plan) is a groundbreaking effort to create a 60-acre mixed-use and
     transit-oriented environment that will revitalize the Downtown Core
     of El Monte. The City Council approved the specific plan in 2007 and
     consultants are designing infrastructure projects to support it. On
     completion, the project will provide up to 1,850 new housing units in
     a high density and mixed-use environment, providing ownership and
     rental units. The City allows multiple-family projects to be approved
     as a by-right use, subject only to administrative-level conformance
     review. Flexible and shared parking is encouraged based on the ULI-
     shared parking model.
     Objectives:
        Implement the program measures outlined in the Specific Plan
         and environmental mitigation measures to allow for housing sites
         to be available in the Housing Element planning period.
        Facilitate the timely construction of residential projects by
         providing technical and financial assistance to the project, such as
H-46 El Monte General Plan

    relocation of the public works yard, support of grant applications,
    and other assistance, including additional incentives, such as
    regulatory concessions/waivers, fee waivers, streamlined
    entitlement reviews/approvals, and technical assistance for
    financing/funding of development projects.
    Continue to provide appropriate land use designations and
    maintain an inventory of suitable sites for residential
    development. Make the vacant and underutilized residential sites
    inventory available to non-profit and for-profit housing
    developers on the City’s website.
4.     Lot Consolidation
A number of infill parcels especially those that are identified as
opportunity sites for mixed-use development are smaller and would
benefit from lot consolidation. Individually, some of these smaller lots
may not support the density of development that can be achieved
through the joining (or consolidation) of multiple parcels. The City
will provide technical assistance to property owners and developers
in support of lot consolidation. In addition, the Planning Division will
create incentives, such as reduction in setbacks, parking requirements,
and other standards, as well as lowering of development fees to
encourage higher densities, residential uses and lot consolidation in
the Mixed/Multiuse Zone. The MMU zone development standards
provide a graduated density scale based on parcel size to encourage
voluntary private actions to consolidate lots and to facilitate quality
infill residential development.
Objectives:
   Encourage lot consolidation of smaller parcels to accommodate
    projects at a minimum of 16 units per site with emphasis on
    parcels located in the El Monte Gateway Specific Plan and the
    newly established Mixed/Multiuse Zone.
5.     Mixed/Multiuse Designation and Development Standards
Mixed/multiuse projects require careful planning to ensure that
projects exhibit high quality, provide appropriate mitigation
measures, and are compatible with one another and corridor sites.
                                                      El Monte General Plan H-47

     Housing Element
     The City will amend the Zoning Code concurrent with Housing
     Element adoption to adopt development standards for
     mixed/multiuse housing suitable for the Durfee, Garvey, and Peck
     corridors. These development standards include open space, flexible
     parking standards (based on floor area ratios), height, setbacks, and
     density provisions. The MMU zone development standards also
     provide a graduated density scale based on parcel size to encourage
     voluntary private actions to consolidate lots and to facilitate quality
     infill residential development. These provisions are intended to
     promote new housing in the corridor areas and accommodate the
     unmet RHNA need. The City will periodically review these
     development standards to identify standards that may potentially
     constrain the development of affordable housing and housing for
     persons with disabilities.
     Objectives:
        Periodically review mixed/multiuse development standards to
         identify constraints and remove or offset constraints where
         possible.
        Provide information on the MMU Zone development standards
         at City Hall and on the City’s website highlighting standards
         unique to mixed-use development and lot consolidation.
     6.     Residential Design Standards
     El Monte has residential neighborhoods with varying degrees of
     historical, architectural, and cultural significance to the community.
     To ensure that new and substantial rehabilitation of housing is
     completed in an appropriate manner with respect to scale, size, and
     character, the City has adopted its first Community Design Element.
     And to implement General Plan policies, the City has developed
     Comprehensive Design Guidelines to provide greater design
     guidance for residential projects, including single-family, multiple-
     family, and other residential uses. Administrative permitting and
     processing procedures are included to implement necessary design
     guidelines.
H-48 El Monte General Plan

Objectives:
   Continue to utilize the City’s Comprehensive Design Guidelines
    in order to provide guidance for residential development.
   Provide information in public places regarding the City’s
    Comprehensive Design Guidelines and make information more
    widely available.
7.     Green Building
In 2006, the California legislature adopted AB 32, the Global Warming
Solutions Act, which created the first comprehensive state regulatory
program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990
levels by 2050. Promoting energy conservation has thus become a
consistent theme in regulations, green building practices, and general
business operations. The City plays a part in conserving energy
through efficient infill residential development practices, and is also
pursuing urban forestry grants to help improve air quality in the
community. The El Monte Gateway also provides a commitment to
incorporate the principles of sustainable design to meet LEED
certification standards and exceed Title 24 requirements by a
minimum of 10 percent. However, significantly more could be done
by the City to improve its physical environment, reduce the impact on
global warming, and conserve resources.
Objectives:
   Continue to expand the Sustainable Development Chapter of the
    Municipal Code with standards for various strategies focused on
    encouraging sustainable development, including, but not limited
    to, energy efficiency, water conservation, natural resources
    conservation, etc.
   Modify and adopt California Energy Code with a 15 percent
    increase in energy efficiency, and adopt a tiered approach using
    energy efficient standards.
   Continue to participate in the Energy Leader Partnership with
    Southern California Edison through the City’s Energy Action Plan
    (EAP), which identifies the long-term visions and goal to achieve
    energy efficiency in the community and in government
    operations.

     Housing Element
     8.    Regulatory Incentives
     El Monte is largely built out, with new housing opportunities limited
     to the recycling of parcels from nonresidential to higher density
     housing. The City approves General Plan amendments, zone changes,
     conditional use permits, minor modifications, variances, and density
     bonuses where appropriate to facilitate quality housing that furthers
     City goals. At the same time, in established residential
     neighborhoods, it is critical to preserve and strengthen neighborhoods
     through appropriate regulatory means.
     Objectives:
        Continue to approve conditional use permits, zone changes,
         general plan amendments, variances, and density bonuses as
         appropriate while balancing the goal of preserving established
         residential neighborhoods.
     9.    Financial Incentives
     The City encourages and facilitates the construction of affordable
     senior and family projects. Financial assistance has included land
     dedications, multiple-family revenue bonds, housing grants, low
     interest loans, and reductions in development impact fees where
     feasible. Housing developers have utilized these financial incentives
     to leverage and obtain other funding sources, such as low income
     housing tax credits. Taken together, the combination of public and
     private financing sources allows developers to secure lower interest
     rate loans. The City will continue to offer financial incentives for
     housing projects that address unmet needs in the community and
     seek creative means to further increase funding for housing.
     Objectives:
        Offer financial assistance, when funding sources are available, to
         make feasible the construction of affordable housing projects that
         address the City’s community development and housing goals.
        Seek opportunities to leverage housing resources with those of
         for-profit groups, developers, and nonprofit groups in the
         community; work with developers to submit grant applications
H-50 El Monte General Plan

     for infill projects for the El Monte Gateway and other projects
     along the corridors.
    Work with developers to explore grant opportunities for infill
     projects for the El Monte Gateway and other projects along the
     corridors.
10.    Density Bonus
To facilitate development, the City offers developers the opportunity
of a Density Bonus Program which provides a density increase of 35
percent plus development incentives for qualified affordable projects.
To be eligible for the Program, the affordable project must contain: (1)
at least 10 percent of the units reserved for low income households; or
(2) at least 5 percent reserved for very low income households; or (3)
at least 50 percent reserved for senior households. The units must
remain affordable for at least 30 years if the density bonus is granted.
Information on the Density Bonus Program is provided at City Hall
and will be provided on the City’s website.
Objectives:
    Inform and encourage developers to utilize the density bonus
     program by promoting the program on the City’s website and at
     City Hall, and by offering technical assistance at City Hall.
11.    Conditional Use Permit Process
The City has established a conditional use permit process for certain
residential uses (e.g., multifamily housing) because of the City’s
experience with poorly designed projects, annexation of areas having
nonconforming properties, property maintenance, and health and
safety concerns. While the City desires to maintain the CUP
requirement in R-3 and R-4 zones as a means to continue
neighborhood stabilization efforts, the City recognizes its
responsibility to address its share of the region’s housing needs.
Therefore, the Housing Element focuses the production of multiple-
family housing along corridors and in the El Monte Gateway. The
projects are allowed by right as required by state law. In addition, the
El Monte Gateway Specific Plan and future corridor implementation
                                                        El Monte General Plan H-51

     Housing Element
     plans will contain objective design standards so the City can ensure
     that high-quality new housing.
     Objectives:
        Continue to allow mixed/multiuse housing by right along
         designated corridors and in the El Monte Gateway Specific Plan
         subject to conformance review with related development
         standards; retain the CUP requirement for multiple-family
         projects elsewhere in the City.
     12.   Streamline Processing
     The City continues to monitor permit processing times to ensure the
     fastest possible turnaround for applications. The City will modify the
     application packet, as appropriate, to simplify and streamline the
     application process. Additionally, the processing time of applications
     for new construction or rehabilitation of housing for lower and
     moderate-income households and seniors will be prioritized.
     Objectives:
        Continue to monitor permit processing times and investigate
         ways to streamline the process. Prioritize the review of projects
         that include affordable housing units.
     13.   Code Compliance
     Code compliance is an important tool to ensure that the value,
     character, and quality of neighborhoods, property, and housing are
     maintained. The City’s Economic Development Department (Building
     and Neighborhood Service Divisions) and the police department are
     responsible for inspecting properties for compliance with state and
     local regulations regarding the condition and maintenance of
     buildings and properties. If deficiencies are found, the property
     owner is notified of the code deficiency and compliance measures
     required, and then granted a specified period of time to correct the
     matter. To facilitate timely compliance, City staff direct the property
     owners to City-administered loan programs, including grants and
     rehabilitation loans. However, should corrections not occur in a
     timely manner, the City can issue citations or initiate legal action. As
H-52 El Monte General Plan

the housing inspection program is developed, code compliance efforts
can work in tandem with that program to yield more effective results.
Objectives:
   Continue to implement residential code enforcement programs
    using a progressive approach of voluntary compliance,
    administrative citations, and court action if needed.
   Enlist the support of volunteers to provide staffing to implement a
    more proactive approach to code enforcement.
14.   Housing Inspection Program
Ensuring quality housing conditions is an important issue in El
Monte. Historically, the City has experienced illegal conversions,
unpermitted construction, and other housing and property code
violations. Such incidents not only create potential safety hazards, but
also depress the values of surrounding properties and create blighting
influences. To address this issue, the City implements an inspection
program for all single-family homes that requires the property owner
to address health and safety code violations prior to closure of a sale.
However, many of the housing and property code violations also exist
in older multiple-family apartments and mobile homes. Proactively
addressing housing conditions in apartments and mobile homes will
also help to improve housing conditions, benefiting both residents
and the neighborhood.
Objectives:
   Continue to implement the housing inspection program for a
    period of not less than five years that can be extended by City
    Council.
   Create a housing inspection program for mobile homes and
    apartments, working in partnership with various stakeholders in
    the community.
15.   Housing Rehabilitation Loan Program
Ensuring ongoing housing rehabilitation is critical for maintaining
neighborhood quality and housing. The City provides up to $35,000 in
loans for the rehabilitation and/or preservation of property. The City
                                                      El Monte General Plan H-53

     Housing Element
     provides assistance in the form of a zero percent deferred loan to low
     and moderate income homeowners that is payable in full upon the
     sale, transfer of title, lease, rental, cash-out, or unapproved refinance
     of all or any part of the property. The loan is available for single-
     family residences containing one or two dwelling units, one of which
     is owner occupied. The loan may be used for lead-based paint testing
     and abatement, electrical, heating, plumbing, roofing, exterior work,
     building code violations, health and safety issues, and many other
     improvements. Triplexes, quadplexes, multiple-family residences,
     and mobile homes are ineligible for assistance.
     Objectives:
        Continue to implement the residential home loan program for
         single-family residences citywide and lead-based paint hazards
         inspections as part of the rehabilitation loan program.
     16.   Affordable Housing Preservation
     The City has 11 projects providing 863 units of rental housing
     affordable to lower income households. The City currently has three
     projects totaling 212 affordable housing units that are technically at
     risk of conversion by 2024. None has filed a notice to terminate its
     Section 8 contract or prepay its mortgage. The City is committed to
     preserving its stock of affordable housing, some which is at risk of
     conversion and/or needs significant renovation and improvement.
     The City will assist in preserving 128 at-risk units by providing
     technical assistance, seeking additional nonprofit and for-profit
     partners, and facilitating financial assistance.
     Objectives:
        Monitor the status of affordable units that may become at risk of
         conversion and provide technical assistance to facilitate
         preservation for units.
        Support nonprofit funding applications and conduct hearings, to
         assist developers in obtaining funds for preservation.
H-54 El Monte General Plan

17.   Acquisition and Rehabilitation
The acquisition and rehabilitation program can address the affordable
housing needs of low and moderate income families in El Monte.
Under this program, the City acquires or facilitates the acquisition of
existing housing for rehabilitation or for construction of new
affordable housing. The finished units are made available to low
income renters or sold to income-eligible first-time homebuyers. The
City has successfully used this program to acquire and rehabilitate
housing for transitional housing. Significant efforts are being directed
at creating new affordable housing. As part of this effort, the City
works with the Rio Hondo Community Development Corporation
(RHCDC) to help the City manage the properties, expand
homeownership opportunities, create affordable housing, and assist
the City in meeting its affordable housing goals cited in the
Consolidated Plan.
Objectives:
   Work with nonprofit partnerships, including RHCDC, to acquire,
    rehabilitate, and deed restrict apartments to improve housing
    conditions and achieve community development goals of the City,
    when funding sources are available.
18.   Housing Partnerships
In today’s housing market, creative approaches and partnerships are
required to finance and build affordable housing. The County
Housing Authority, Habitat for Humanity, Rio Hondo Community
Development Corporation, Institute for Urban Research, Housing
Rights Center, and other agencies offer expertise in developing and
managing affordable housing or providing a network of supportive
services. In recent years, the City has partnered with nonprofits to
build housing. The City has granted regulatory concessions,
subsidized infrastructure improvements, modified development
regulations, and provided direct assistance to such groups. Working
with nonprofit developers enables the City to better provide high
quality and affordable housing products. As the City continues to
pursue its housing goals, nurturing public-private partnerships will
continue to be an important strategy for leveraging funding,
                                                      El Monte General Plan H-55

     Housing Element
     enhancing the City’s administrative capacity, and achieving City
     housing goals.
     Objectives:
        Continue to actively form and maintain existing partnerships with
         nonprofit and private organizations to help provide housing and
         supportive services to El Monte residents.
     19.   First-Time Homebuyer Assistance
     The City’s first-time homebuyer program targets low income
     households earning up to 80 percent of the County median family
     income. Using federal HOME funds, the City provides financing
     assistance of up to 25 percent of the eligible purchase price of a home
     through a silent second mortgage. The loan term is 30 years at zero
     interest and no monthly payments. The buyer must not have owned a
     home in the past three years, must occupy the property as a principal
     residence, and must have a minimum down payment of percent.
     Eligible properties include single-family homes, townhomes, and
     manufactured homes. In implementing the program, high housing
     prices relative to household incomes have resulted in fewer successful
     applications. This underscores the need for additional funding
     sources that have higher income limits (e.g., redevelopment set-aside
     funds) than under the federal HOME program.
     Objectives:
        Provide homeownership opportunities for low income
         households through homebuyer education and financing
         assistance, when funding sources are available.
        Consider the use of other funding sources to supplement the
         homebuyer assistance program.
     20.   Police Officer Homeownership Assistance
     This program provides El Monte police officers with financial
     assistance for the purchase of a principal residence in El Monte. The
     program is based on the concept that the public interest is served and
     public safety is enhanced by encouraging police officers to live within
     the City limits. The program provides City financial assistance of up
H-56 El Monte General Plan

to $10,000 in the form of one-time, zero interest forgivable loans.
There is no maximum purchase price and no income restriction.
Participant must be a full-time El Monte police officer who occupies
the property as a principal residence for the term of the loan (10 years)
or until the residence is sold. No payments will be required nor does
interest accrue during this period. The loan amount shall be reduced
and forgiven at a rate of one-tenth of the total loan amount for each
full year the participant remains an El Monte police officer and owns
and maintains the home as principal residence.
Objectives:
   Provide up homeownership opportunities for sworn full-time
    police officers who choose to live in El Monte.
   Consider extending the homeownership assistance program to
    veterans, public school teachers, and middle-income families in El
    Monte.
21.   Housing Voucher Program
The Baldwin Park Housing Authority administers the housing
voucher rental program for El Monte. Funded by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, the housing voucher program
extends rental subsidies to very low income households by offering
the tenant a voucher that pays the difference between the current fair
market rent (FMR) established by the housing authority and 30
percent of the tenant’s income. The voucher is accepted on a
voluntary basis by the landlord. A tenant may choose housing that
costs more than the FMR if the tenant pays the extra rent. In some
cases, rental assistance is needed on a shorter-term basis to prevent
homelessness. In these cases, the City also provides rental assistance
to local service agencies. This program is described later under the
City’s continuum of care efforts under the homeless assistance
program.
Objectives:
   Support the housing choice voucher program and lobby for
    additional vouchers as needed.
                                                       El Monte General Plan H-57

     Housing Element
        Continue to provide City financial assistance to local nonprofit
         organizations that can be used for motel vouchers.
     22.   Fair Housing Program
     The City of El Monte is committed to furthering and improving fair
     housing opportunities so people in all walks of life have the
     opportunity to find suitable housing in the community. To that end,
     the City contracts with a fair housing service provider to provide
     landlord/tenant education, conduct testing of the rental and
     ownership market, and investigate and mediate housing complaints
     where needed. The City periodically prepares the required federal
     planning reports, including the Analysis of Impediments to Fair
     Housing Choice (AI), to document the City’s progress in improving
     and maintaining fair housing opportunities. Recommendations from
     that effort are contained within the Housing Element. The City also
     prepares, as required by federal law, housing planning documents
     and progress toward fair housing goals set forth in the Consolidated
     Plan.
     Objectives:
        Continue to contract with local fair housing providers to provide
         educational, advocacy, and mediation services for the City.
        Continue to periodically prepare an Analysis of Impediments to
         Fair Housing Choice and implement its findings.
     23.   Housing Accessibility Programs
     The City provides various services to help people with disabilities to
     access housing opportunities. El Monte complies with the
     Community Care Facilities Act and the Lanterman-Petris Act. The
     City enforces state and federal accessibility laws to facilitate the
     improvement of housing for persons with disabilities. The City
     administratively allows modifications to land use, building codes,
     and the permitting process to facilitate the reasonable
     accommodations without going through a standard variance process.
     However, given the large number of people with disabilities, the
     growing need for housing opportunities, and changing legal context
     for housing planning, additional efforts are needed.
H-58 El Monte General Plan

The City has amended the Zoning Code to include formal reasonable
accommodation procedures in accordance with fair housing laws and
disability laws to provide clear rules, policies, procedures, and fees
for reasonable accommodation in order to promote equal access to
housing. Policies and procedures indicate the qualifying individuals
who may request a reasonable accommodation (i.e., persons with
disabilities, family members, landlords, etc.) along with any specific
procedures that must be followed.
Objectives:
   Continue to approve reasonable accommodations for modification
    of building codes, permitting process, and land uses to new and
    rehabilitated homes to maximize accessibility for people with
    disabilities.
   Consider ways to incorporate or incentivize the incorporation of
    visitability concepts into new housing consistent with HCD’s
    voluntary model ordinance for visitability concepts.
   Continue to administer City-operated programs to assist
    households with disabilities with architectural modifications to
    their homes and continue to implement the provisions of the
    Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
   Provide information in public places regarding the City’s
    reasonable accommodation ordinance and make information
    available on this program more widely available.
24.    Housing for Persons with Developmental Disabilities
The housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities are
typically not addressed by Title 24 Regulations, and requires in
addition to basic affordability, slight modifications to existing units,
and in some instances, a varying range of supportive housing
facilities. To accommodate residents with developmental disabilities,
the City will seek State and Federal monies, as funds become
available, funds would be used for housing construction and
rehabilitation targeted for persons with developmental disabilities. El
Monte will also provide regulatory incentives, such as expedited
permit processing, fee waivers, and deferrals, for projects that house
individuals with developmental disabilities. To further facilitate the
                                                     El Monte General Plan H-59

     Housing Element
     construction of units to accommodate persons with developmental
     disabilities, the City shall reach out annually to developers who
     specialize in housing special needs groups. Finally, as housing is
     developed or identified, El Monte will work with the San
     Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center to implement an outreach program
     informing families of housing and services available for persons with
     developmental disabilities. Information will be made available on the
     City’s website.
     Objectives:
        Continue to offer specific regulatory incentives throughout the
         planning period; apply for funding to encourage development of
         units specifically for persons with developmental disabilities,
         when funding is available.
        Conduct outreach to potential developers and initiate a
         cooperative outreach program with the San Gabriel/Pomona
         Regional Center within 1-year of Housing Element adoption.
     25.   Emergency Shelter and Transitional Housing
     El Monte works with the County of Los Angeles Continuum of Care
     Coalition to address homelessness. The City also provides funds to
     Catholic Charities, Our Savior Center, Mid Valley Recovery Center,
     Project Achieve, and El Monte/South El Monte Emergency Response
     Association. These agencies provide food and pantry services,
     clothing, emergency rental or motel vouchers, and referral services.
     The City’s Veteran and Homeless Commission oversees homeless
     issues in El Monte. The City of El Monte is home to an intake center,
     transitional, and permanent supportive housing projects.
     The City amended the Zoning Code to comply with provisions of SB
     2. Specifically, the Zoning Code has been amended to permit
     emergency shelters and single-room occupancy (SRO) units by-right
     in the M-1 overlay zone along with appropriate management and
     operation standards. The Zoning Code has also been amended to
     permit transition and supportive housing as a residential use in all
     zones allowing residential uses subject to the same standards as
     similar uses in the same zone.
H-60 El Monte General Plan

Objectives:
   Continue to monitor the inventory of sites appropriate to
    accommodate emergency shelters, SROs, and transitional and
    supportive housing and work with the appropriate organizations
    to ensure the needs of homeless and extremely low-income
    residents are met.
   Continue to fund a wide variety of nonprofit organizations
    providing services for homeless people through the Consolidated
    Plan process.
26.   Housing and Community Development Program
El Monte provides millions of dollars in grants each year to a wide
range of nonprofit human service and community development
organizations supporting programs through the City’s Consolidated
Plan process. These programs assist homeless persons, very low and
low income households, families with children, women, and others in
finding housing and appropriate supportive services. Funding is
targeted to federally defined low and moderate income areas in El
Monte. The City provides funding to different agencies, contingent on
the continuation of funds through the City’s general fund, HOME
funds, and Community Development Block Grant funds, and also
contingent on City Council approval of uses. El Monte continues to
support the use of these community development funds to improve
the quality of life of residents in the community.
Objectives:
   Continue funding nonprofit human service and housing
    development organizations to provide needed services and
    housing, subject to funding availability and City Council
    approval.
27.   Manufactured Housing
Government Code Section 6582.3(a) specifies that local governments
cannot exclude permanently sited manufactured homes from lots
zoned for single-family dwellings (unless manufactured housing is
more than 10 years old), but may require certain design/architectural
requirements. A city may not require an administrative permit,
                                                   El Monte General Plan H-61

     Housing Element
     planning or development process, or other requirement that is not
     imposed on a conventional single-family dwelling in the same zone.
     The City has amended the Zoning Code to define manufactured
     housing and mobile homes consistent with State law and identified
     the zone(s) where such housing is permitted.
     Objectives:
        Facilitate the development of alternative housing models, such as
         manufactured housing and mobile homes, through the provision
         of appropriate development standards.
        Explore the feasibility of design guidelines for mobile homes and
         manufactured housing to ensure quality development.
     28.   Mobile Home Parks
     Mobile home parks in the City provide lower income residents with
     affordable housing. To ensure that conditions are preserved to
     promote and enhance fairness in the economic relationship between
     mobile home park owners and mobile home owners and residents,
     the City has developed a mobile home park rent stabilization
     ordinance and a mobile home park conversion ordinance. The City
     recognizes that mobile home owners and residents should be
     protected from unreasonable space rental increases, while also
     recognizing the need of mobile home park owners to receive a just
     and reasonable return on their investment. To provide information to
     both mobile home park owners and mobile home owners/residents,
     the City will develop an educational outreach program that addresses
     residents housing rights and the obligations of property owners. The
     City will also provide information on the mobile home park rent
     stabilization ordinance, the mobile home park conversion ordinance,
     and other fair housing information on the City’s website and at City
     Hall.
     Objectives:
        Ensure that mobile home owners and residents are protected from
         unreasonable space rental increases, while also recognizing the
         need of mobile home park owners to receive a reasonable return
         on their investment.
H-62 El Monte General Plan

   Minimize the adverse impact on the housing supply and on
    displaced persons by providing certain rights and benefits to
    mobile home tenants and by requiring tenant relocation assistance
    whenever an existing mobile home park or portion thereof is
    converted to another use.
   Develop a mobile home park educational outreach program to
    provide both mobile home park owners and mobile home
    owners/residents with information on housing rights and
    obligations.
29.    Community Care Facilities
The Health and Safety Code (§§ 1500 et seq.) requires that group
homes serving six or fewer persons be: (1) treated the same as any
other residential use, (2) allowed by right in all residential zones, and
(3) subject to the same development standards, fees, taxes, and permit
procedures as other housing of the same type in the same zone. The
City has amended the Zoning Code to define community care
facilities, include specific permitting processes where such uses are
allowed, and to specify regulations to exercise appropriate reviews
within the parameters of state law.
Objectives:
   Continue to facilitate community care facilities in the City through
    appropriate zoning regulations within parameters of state law.
   Provide information in public places regarding the City’s
    requirements for community care facilities in order to address
    inquiries about the establishment of such uses.
30.    Development of Second Units
Development of second units provides lower-income households an
affordable housing opportunity typically within a single-family
neighborhood setting. Therefore, the City will continue to allow for
second units in the Zoning Code. Recently adopted amendments to
the Zoning Code include allowing second units administerially and
permitting a reduction in the required lot size to qualify for a second
unit, thus increasing opportunities to construct second units in the
City. Second units, also known as “granny flats,” are a practical
method for a family to maximize the available land on their own lot.
                                                       El Monte General Plan H-63

     Housing Element
     By utilizing land and utilities, a family minimizes construction costs.
     The City is capitalizing on the Zoning Code by increasing the stock of
     affordable units while maintaining the integrity of the existing single-
     family neighborhoods.        To encourage greater participation by
     residents in the development of second units, the City will provide
     information on second unit development opportunities on the City’s
     website and at City Hall.
     Objectives:
        Encourage the development of second units to provide lower-
         income households an affordable housing opportunity within
         single-family neighborhoods.
     31.   Family Housing
     The City of El Monte has a demonstrated need for family rental
     housing, particularly large-family housing. Addressing this need is
     complex. The City has taken a proactive stance to encourage the
     production of multiple-family housing by designating more than 100
     acres of land along corridors for mixed/multiuse housing as a by-right
     use with supportive development standards. To support the
     development of rental and for-sale housing for large households,
     especially lower-income households, the City encourages
     developers/builders to incorporate larger bedroom counts in future
     housing development, as appropriate, to accommodate the needs of
     larger households.
     Objectives:
        Continue to support and work with Rio Hondo Community
         Development Corporation and other nonprofits to acquire and
         dedicate affordable housing for families in El Monte.
        Encourage the development of housing for large households
         through a variety of activities such as outreach to housing
         developers, providing technical assistance, providing expedited
         processing, fee reductions, and waiving specific development
         standards.
     32.   Water and Sewer Service Providers
     Pursuant to Chapter 727, Statues of 2005 (SB 1087), the City of El
     Monte is required to deliver its adopted housing element and any
H-64 El Monte General Plan

amendments thereto to local water and sewer service providers. This
legislation allows for coordination between the City and water and
sewer providers when considering approval of new residential
projects, to ensure that the providers have an opportunity to provide
input on the Element. Additionally, review of the Housing Element
ensures that priority for water and sewer services is granted to
projects that include units affordable to lower-income households.
Objectives:
      Submit the adopted Housing Element to local water and sewer
       providers for their review and input.
Quantified Objectives
For the present planning period of the Housing Element, the City has
set forth the following quantified objectives. The quantified objectives
for construction, rehabilitation, and preservation refer to the planning
period 2014-2021 (see Table H-4). It is recognized that the quantified
objectives are the maximum number of households/units to be
assisted during the planning period. The state’s current budget
deficit, uncertainty with future federal allocation of monies, and
changing housing market may influence these objectives.

5. Parks and Recreation Element
   Introduction
   Vision El Monte…a city of ample park and recreational opportunities; a
   healthy city, where people of all ages and abilities can recreate; a city of
   green spaces, trees, and natural beauty, which evoke its legacy of the
   wooded place between the rivers; and an Emerald Necklace of multibenefit
   trails and parks that encircle the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel Rivers.
   CREATING A HEALTHY COMMUNITY
   This is what the Parks and Recreation Element is about—improving the
   quality of life through parks, recreational opportunities, and connected
   green spaces throughout the community so as to improve the health of
   residents. This Element’s goals are to help El Monte:
       Provide ample parks—developing of an integrated hierarchy of
        neighborhood, community, and regional parks near residents.
       Foster a healthy lifestyle—building varied facilities and programs that
        promote a healthy lifestyle and social ties among residents.
       Restore the natural environment—creating the Emerald Necklace,
        enhancing open space amenities, restoring and protecting native
        habitat, and watershed management.
       Beautify El Monte—planting a lush community forest and improving
        public landscaping with vegetation, pedestrian amenities, public art,
        and greenways along major roadways.
       Connect the community—developing of sidewalks, trails, paths, bicycle
        routes, and greenways that connect neighborhoods, schools, activity
        centers, and the Emerald Necklace.

     Parks and Recreation Element
     PURPOSE OF ELEMENT
     The City of El Monte realizes that it must act with definitive and sustained
     commitment to recapture its legacy of a fertile wooded place between two
     rivers and to create an urban environment that fosters a healthy community.
     The Parks and Recreation Element is designed to accomplish this goal.
     This element reflects the importance of shaping quality of life through the
     enhancement, restoration, and preservation of El Monte’s natural resources,
     and providing a built environment that fosters recreation and health. This
     element is a call to action, setting forth goals, policies, and actions necessary
     to improve El Monte’s environment for the community.
     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     Many regional park and recreation planning efforts influence this Element.
     The San Gabriel River Corridor Master Plan, Rio Hondo Subwatershed
     Plan, Integrated Regional Water Management Plan, and other regional
     plans together provide a framework to address water quality, water
     resources, flood protection, recreation, open space, habitat preservation,
     public health and safety, and stewardship of the Rio Hondo and San
     Gabriel watershed. These documents provide unified goals for communities
     to act in a collective manner within the context of watershed level.
     The Emerald Necklace Vision Plan is a multifaceted plan to create a 17-
     mile loop of parks and greenways connecting 16 cities and more than
     500,000 residents along the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel Rivers and their
     tributaries. This plan proposes a world-class parks network that will create
     parks, recreational opportunities, natural habitat, and multiuse trails. The
     City of El Monte has taken a leadership position in this effort by preparing
     and signing the Emerald Necklace Vision Plan for other cities to adopt in
     order to work collectively toward the goals of the plan.
     The Parks and Recreation Element is consistent with regional plans,
     incorporating policy directions from county-initiated efforts and the
     Emerald Necklace Vision Plan. To implement this element, the City has
     created a Parks and Recreation Plan that focuses on specific programs,
     definite actions, creative funding sources, and timing to implement projects
     that will create a more livable community for residents, visitors, and
     businesses. The plan is intended to be updated more frequently than the
     General Plan to respond to dynamic implementation of specific projects.
PR-2 El Monte General Plan

EL MONTE SPEAKS
A central principle of El Monte’s vision is to restore and preserve open
space along its rivers and throughout the city, to provide adequate parks
and recreational programs for the community, promote connections with
the natural environment for residents of all ages, and foster a built
environment that promotes healthy lifestyles for all City residents. To
achieve this goal, the City of El Monte realizes that it must act with
definitive and sustained commitment and engage its residents.
As part of the general plan update, City outreach efforts identified what
residents regard as the most important ways to achieve the City’s vision
with respect to parks, recreation, and open space. These efforts reflect the
City of El Monte’s consistent desire to accomplish the following objectives
with respect to parks, recreation, and open space:
   Significantly increase the quantity and quality of parks and recreational
    facilities and programs, tailored to the needs of the community, within
    easy access to residents to improve their health.                            Planning El Monte’s Parks
   Enhance recreational opportunities for all ages through new programs         Workshops provided residents the
    and facilities, improving public transportation, expanding joint-use         opportunity to plan the location of city parks,
    ventures wherever feasible, and augmenting services.                         greenways, community forest, and
                                                                                 bicycle/trail network.
   Create a walkable and bikeable city with a network of sidewalks,
    greenways, and paths that allow children to travel safely to school,
    families to stroll or bike through neighborhoods, and seniors to walk.
   Implement the Emerald Necklace vision of an interconnected network
    of parks, multiuse trails, and open space along the Rio Hondo and San
    Gabriel Rivers and tributaries that connect to regional resources.
   Green El Monte through greenways, miniparks, a community forest,
    and other green infrastructure that will clean the air and water, improve
    health, and beautify the city.
   Promote energy and natural resources conservation through the
    implementation of sustainable and green infrastructure designs and
    principles throughout the community.
Parks and Recreation Context
El Monte is composed of different elements—edges, boundaries, corridors,
neighborhoods, and landmarks, among other features. Today, the urban
fabric does not reflect our rich legacy as a fertile wooded place. It is thus
incumbent upon us to recognize, preserve, and enhance El Monte’s park

                                                     children. However, as one of the most densely populated cities in the Los
                                                     Angeles region and the San Gabriel Valley, the community is underserved
                                                     by parks and recreational opportunities. The City has 51 acres of parkland,

                                                     This element has several priorities:
                                                        Pursuing opportunities to work with the local school districts to
                                                         develop joint-use parks at or adjacent to public schools.
                                                        Providing a community park in each neighborhood, supplemented by a
                                                         constellation of neighborhood, mini, or joint-use parks.
                                                        Ensuring that parks are safe, well maintained, adequately funded, and
                                                         outfitted with age-appropriate recreational amenities.
                                                        Creating a comprehensive and integrated park system that can serve as
                                                         a model for communities throughout the region.

Within this context, this element expands this array to meet El Monte’s
current and future recreational needs for residents of all ages by:
   Providing a meaningful array of recreational programs and activities to
    promote physical health and mental well-being for residents of all age
    groups and abilities in El Monte.

Open Space – Emerald Necklace
El Monte is framed by the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel Rivers, once
prominent natural rivers that fed marshes and a lush riparian woodland.
Although these meandering rivers have been gradually replaced by more
uniform flood-control channels, along the rivers are still parks, open space,
and recreational marvels, such as Peck Water Conservation Park, Whittier
Narrows Recreation Area, and the Santa Fe Dam. El Monte is leading the
Emerald Necklace Plan to reclaim and restore open space areas surrounding
the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo Rivers and its tributaries.
The Emerald Necklace is a vision, patterned after the Olmstead Plan, for a
17-mile loop of parks and greenways connecting 16 cities along these rivers.     Emerald Necklace
El Monte is strategically located at the center of this initiative. Key          The Emerald Necklace Vision Plan is a

    River, including the Peck Water Conservation Park, and linking it
    through multiuse trails along the banks of the rivers.
   Affirming El Monte’s heritage through the design of park and
    recreational amenities that reflect the City’s natural and cultural history
    and providing educational opportunities.
   Protecting water resources, fostering water conservation, protecting
    water quality, and promoting a clean watershed and water supply
    through the control of underground and nonpoint sources of pollution.

                                                With the suburbanization of El Monte, many original open space areas have
                                                been replaced by housing, commerce, and transportation infrastructure.
                                                These trends have impacted our quality of life with respect to aesthetics, air

                                                between the built and natural environment for the health of all residents.
                                                This section focuses on three components of green infrastructure:
                                                   Developing an integrated system of green parkways and medians that
                                                    span El Monte, line roadways, and offer shaded walking, bicycling, and
                                                    equestrian paths for residents.

                                                paths, and trails are just as important. Residents have expressed the desire,
                                                through public outreach efforts, to be able to walk, bicycle, ride horses, and
                                                hike. These and other popular daily practical exercise and leisure activities
                                                are critical to the health of residents. However, limited opportunities for
                                                such activities are presently available in the community. Therefore,
                                                priorities for this element include:

Park Acreage
Park and recreational opportunities are critical for the physical and social
development of children as well as the health of adults. Whereas the national
average standard for parkland is 6.3 acres per 1,000 residents, communities
in the west San Gabriel Valley average 3.3 acres of parkland per 1,000
residents. El Monte has 0.41 acres per 1,000 residents, well below the City’s
present standard of 3 acres per 1,000 persons. The City of El Monte should
have 375 acres of parkland for its residents to match the San Gabriel Valley
average and must make considerable strides to reach that goal.
The City recognizes that achieving park goals will take many years. In the
interim, the City has a 10-year goal to provide 2 acres of parkland for every
1,000 residents, or 200 new park acres. Achieving this ambitious goal will
require unprecedented commitment and leadership by elected officials, City
staff, nonprofit organizations, school districts, residents, and businesses. In
many cases, public awareness and support will be needed to secure funding
necessary to acquire land, develop facilities, and provide programs.
                                                                                 El Monte’s Youth
As detailed in the City’s Parks and Recreation Plan, the City is committed       The Parks and Recreation Element is about
to undertaking the following strategies over the next 10 years:                  providing adequate park and recreational
                                                                                 opportunities for El Monte’s children and
                                                                                 youth.
    Create up to 16 acres of miniparks and neighborhood parks and up to
     25 acres of community parks, easily accessible by greenways, sidewalks,
     and neighborhoods within close walking distance.
    Develop the network of Emerald Necklace linear parks comprising up
     to 18 acres of parks and multibenefit trails along the banks of the San
     Gabriel River and Rio Hondo River.
    Work with the Mountain View School District, El Monte City School
     District, and El Monte Union High School District to develop, use, and
     maintain up to 48 acres of joint-use parks.
    Pursue the development of the Peck Water Conservation Park, which
     will add up to 35 acres of developed parkland for residents and
     additional open space for habitat and wildlife species.
    Link residents to nearby park and recreational amenities along the
     Emerald Necklace, just outside City boundaries but within an appropriate
     service radius of neighborhoods.
Over the next 10 years, the City could add 25,000 new residents. Under the
City’s present Quimby Ordinance, developers will be required to contribute
or finance an additional 75 acres of parks over and above the 200 acres.

      Parks and Recreation Element
      Park Design Classification
      While providing adequate park acreage to meet the needs of El Monte
      residents is the first priority, City parks must also be equipped with the
      appropriate mix of amenities and recreational facilities to best serve residents.
      The City’s parks are generally smaller facilities with a limited set of amenities,
      while community and regional parks are located outside of El Monte. The
      National Recreation and Park Association recommends that cities, based on
      their unique needs, establish a park classification system that details service
      areas, sizes of parks, intended uses, and preferred sets of amenities.
      The City’s future park system will contain a broader range of parks,
      including mini, school, neighborhood, community, linear, and special-use
      facilities. Regional parks are proposed as part of the Emerald Necklace
      Vision Plan and include those facilities outside the City limits. To that end,
      the City will create a park classification system and design standards for
      each type of park. Design standards are intended to ensure that park users
      have the most age-appropriate recreational opportunities available.
      Recommended park classifications include those shown in Table PR-2.
        Table PR-2 El Monte Park Classification

                       Miniparks meet the needs of residents living near. Typically smaller than two
        Miniparks      acres, miniparks provide more limited active and passive recreation
                       opportunities and are easily accessible by sidewalks or greenways.
                       Neighborhood parks serve residents within a ½-mile radius. Recreation
        Neighborhood   equipment is age appropriate and includes a children’s play area, sports field,
                       or hard court. Facilities are typically smaller than 10 acres in size.
                       Community parks address recreational needs of residents within ¾ mile.
        Community      Facilities should serve recreation programs and include sports fields, outdoor
                       education, and meeting areas. Facilities are generally larger than 10 acres.
                       Regional parks are a component of the Emerald Necklace and provide open
        Regional       space for wildlife and habitat; connect residents to regional bike, equestrian,
                       and hiking trails; and provide environmental educational opportunities.
                       Special-use park and recreational facilities include the Aquatic Center, cultural
        Special Use    and educational opportunities (e.g., museums), and town plazas that are
                       designed for specific or specialized uses.
PR-12 El Monte General Plan

Park Distribution
El Monte desires that all residents have equal access to parks with the same
quality of amenities. For instance, residents of each neighborhood should
be served by a community park that is centrally located and offers a wide
range of recreational amenities. Neighborhoods should also have access to
smaller parks and recreational facilities that supplement the recreational
needs of residents within a closer walking distance.
This element proposes neighborhood planning districts, summarized in
Table PR-3, each with an anchor community park and a constellation of
special resources (which may include existing facilities, prioritized joint-use
parks, new miniparks, and cultural and natural resources) and defined
bicycle and walking connections between housing, local schools, parks, and
the regional trail resources offered by the Emerald Necklace.
    Norwood-Cherrylee. This park planning district is anchored by
     Lambert Park and requires 55 acres of new parkland.
    Downtown. This park planning district is anchored by Pioneer Park
     and requires an additional 13 park acres.
    Mountain View. This park planning district is anchored by Mountain
     View Park and requires an additional 46 park acres.
    Park El Monte. This park planning district does not have an anchor
     park and needs an additional 27 acres of parkland.
    Arden Village. This park planning district is anchored by the proposed
     Gibson Park and requires 24 more park acres.
    River East. This district is anchored by Zamora Park and requires
     approximately 35 more acres of parkland.

      Parks and Recreation Element
      Joint-Use Facilities
      El Monte desires to create more developed parkland for the community in a
      manner that helps define existing neighborhoods, instill pride in parks, and
      create an opportunity to provide other local services. Given the lack of
      vacant land and high cost of acquiring new sites, public schools are an
      important opportunity to create joint-use parks that can serve local needs.
      Joint use is simply the development of public schools in a manner that
      provides park, recreation, educational, and public services for students
      during school hours and for the community during after-school hours.
      The overarching concept of joint-use facilities is that schools should be
      accessible day and night, and all year round. Moreover, schools may be able
      to serve a broader range of community needs in partnership with public,
      civic, and private organizations. Joint uses may include parks as well as
      libraries, gymnasiums, auditoriums, health clinics, performing arts space,
      and other uses. Joint-use facilities can also provide a focal point for
      recreation, social activities, and other public services, and capitalize on the
      synergistic opportunities of school activities for youth.
      The General Plan proposes creation of nearly 50 acres of joint-use facilities.
      Priorities for joint-use facilities should be those schools located in areas
      currently underserved by parks or in areas adjacent to existing parks and
      recreational facilities, where the opportunity to leverage resources is greatest.
      Nonetheless, maximizing these opportunities will require unparalleled
      commitment and leadership, both from the City Council and school
      districts, to work together to find creative solutions, develop and leverage
      funding resources, and forge agreements to achieve these goals.
PR-14 El Monte General Plan
Park Accessibility
Accessibility relates to residents having a safe and pleasant route to parks. If
the primary sidewalk access is missing, undersized, or along major arterials,
residents will feel unsafe and will not use the park. To achieve these goals,
the Park Plan proposes an interconnected system of greenways with
completed sidewalks and crossing areas that will connect the many
miniparks to schools and to residences. In some cases, the City will also
need to create access around physical barriers (the airport, freeways,
channels, etc.), in some cases in collaboration with the County.
Park accessibility also refers to the degree to which park and recreation
equipment and/or facilities can be enjoyed by people of different ages and
abilities. The park must be accessible to people of all abilities, including
younger children, adults, seniors, and disabled people. Making parks
accessible includes designing facilities and equipment that are readily
useable for people with disabilities, ensuring that streets have appropriate
curb cuts and completed sidewalks, and that transit options are available for
residents living far from parks or for those unable to travel to parks.
Park Safety and Maintenance
Parks are among the most highly desired amenities within El Monte, and
their continued use depends on their condition and safety. Parks serve as
gathering places where neighbors can form social ties that produce stronger
and safer neighborhoods. To ensure park safety, parks should be equipped
with the latest surveillance technology and be regularly patrolled. The City
will continue participating in the Emerald Necklace Safety & Security Task
Force to implement efforts to ensure safety and security along the river.
The General Plan Implementation Plan also proposes park patrols.
Proper maintenance and care of the City’s physical assets ensures that parks
continue to provide the greatest enjoyment to residents and visitors. Many
of the City’s park and recreational facilities were built long ago and are in
need of rehabilitation and modernization. Cyclical shortfalls in City funds
have led to deferred maintenance, contributing to rehabilitation needs. To
reverse this situation, the General Plan prioritizes the need for facility
reinvestment and the development of funding and implementation steps.
This may require additional fees or taxes to implement properly.

RECREATION FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS
Recreation programs and leisure opportunities strengthen our community
and enhance quality of life. The desire to recreate spans all our differences
in ages, income levels, cultures, and abilities. A comprehensive range of
recreation programs provides many benefits: it provides a sense of place
and belonging; promotes health and wellness; offers safe places to play,
grow, and learn; and enhances cultural unity. It is in this context that
recreational activities satisfy some of the most basic human needs.
Community Facilities
The City of El Monte has six community centers at anchor parks that offer
a wide range of educational, recreational, and cultural programs. Nonprofit
organizations, including faith-based organizations, also provide a number
of supplementary community centers offering similar programs.
   Cultural Center. The City cultural center complex features the state-of-     Aquatic Center
    the-art Aquatic Center, El Monte Historical Museum, Grace T. Black

    Auditorium, and the Jack Crippen Senior Center. The Aquatic Center           location for the Parks, Recreation and
    features four pools and associated facilities, a multipurpose room,          Community Services Department and a first-
    meeting rooms, and auxiliary facilities. It hosts water-related programs     rate aquatic center.
    and activities for residents of all ages and is one of the most cherished
    city facilities. Grace T. Black Auditorium is a popular location for
    community events, gatherings, and private rentals.
   Boys and Girls Club. The Boys and Girls Club, on Mountain View
    Road, offers education and career guidance, health and life skills,
    sports, fitness and recreation, character and leadership development,
    and environment and residential camping. The club offers a safe and
    secure place for youth to learn and grow and is free and open every day.
   Community Centers. The City also offers a number of community
    centers at five of its local parks: Lambert Park, Zamora Park, Pioneer
    Park, Mountain View Park, and Arceo Park. These facilities are the
    central locations for recreational and educational programs to their
    surrounding neighborhood. The community facilities vary significantly
    in terms of size, amenities, and condition.
   Our Saviour Center. Our Saviour Center in El Monte is the social

                                                The City of El Monte strives for a balance of unique large facilities, such as
                                                the Aquatic Center, that distinguish our community. As a complement, a
                                                network of well-designed, smaller recreational facilities distributed
                                                throughout the community would provide more flexible venues for a
                                                variety of programs.
                                                The City’s recreational facilities should be designed according to the
                                                following hierarchy with standards for service for each facility. This
                                                hierarchy is consistent with the park design classifications in Table PR-2.

Diversity of Recreation Activities
The City of El Monte has a diverse population, so a variety of recreation
programs and leisure opportunities is important to address our diverse needs.
A broad spectrum of recreation programs provides the opportunity to come
together around a common need and interest—recreation—which spans our
differences in ages, income levels, cultures, and abilities.
Children and Youth
The City offers programs for youth and children that provide not only
recreational and educational activities, but also build character and
leadership skills. The parks offer soccer, basketball, volleyball, flag football,
and other sports. Youth sports leagues offer basketball, baseball, indoor
soccer, softball, football, and cheerleading. The American Youth Soccer
Organization provides soccer leagues for more than 400 children. The Boys
and Girls Club serve 200 to 300 youth, providing basketball, soccer, game
rooms, and even overnight camping.
Adults
El Monte offers softball, golf, soccer, and basketball for adults. These sports
leagues are well-attended programs for adults of all ages. The Parks,
Recreation and Community Services Department offers many adult classes,
including piano, gymnastics, music classes, yoga, Spanish, ceramics,
painting, and English as a Second Language. The City’s Aquatic Center
provides a wide range of water-related programs and activities for residents
of all ages. The Jack Crippen Senior Center is the central location for
recreational activities and programs, excursions, and special events for
seniors. The City’s two public libraries also provide passive forms of leisure
and recreation.
Special Events
The City of El Monte sponsors a wide variety of events for residents to
celebrate holidays and the community’s cultural heritage, or just socialize
with close friends and neighbors. Favorite holiday events held every year
include the Holiday House, a tradition for over 35 years that draws 15,000
residents. During the summer months, the Concert in the Park series draws
6,000 residents to each event. El Monte also celebrates its commitment to
youth through its annual Children’s Day Parade and Festival, attended by
10,000 residents. Other seasonal events are held throughout the year, such
as Veterans Day Parade, 4th of July events, and many others.

                                               Recreational Facilities Conditions
                                               The enjoyment and relevance of El Monte’s recreation facilities depends on
                                               their continued maintenance and modernization. During the General Plan
                                               process, participants noted that many of the recreational facilities are aging,
                                               have significant deferred maintenance, and in some cases need to be com-
                                               pletely demolished and rebuilt. In other cases, the design of the facility is
                                               outdated and does not meet the City’s current needs. Part of the issue is
                                               related to limited funds, while the other side is the need for facility
                                               inventories and rigorous maintenance and reinvestment plans.
                                               Financing recreational facilities is of critical concern. The City’s Quimby
                                               Ordinance requires developers to dedicate or pay for three acres of
                                               developed parkland for every 1,000 residents that will live in proposed
                                               subdivisions. However, the ordinance does not explicitly require developers
                                               to finance a pro-rata share of recreational facilities required for residents.
                                               Moreover, El Monte does not charge other impact fees to ensure that a
                                               sufficient number of recreational facilities can be built. The City will need
   Maintaining Our Parks                       to investigate and implement all reasonable means for funding new

   of El Monte.
                                               Partnerships
                                               Presently, El Monte has a significant deficiency in the number, type, and
                                               quality of recreational facilities and programs. The challenges of serving
                                               such diverse needs, the multiplicity of service providers, and the magnitude
                                               of unmet needs will require the City to think differently about how it
                                               should best position itself. Rather than a primary service provider, the City
                                               must be equally committed to being a catalyst, facilitator, and collaborator
                                               in developing and maintaining partnerships with other public and private
                                               organizations to expand the quantity and diversity of recreation and local
                                               leisure opportunities.
                                               Closing the gap requires different service models and concepts for El
                                               Monte. For instance, the City’s commitment to multiple roles and
                                               responsibilities must extend beyond recreation and leisure programs to the
                                               broader range of community and human services. The City’s Parks,
                                               Recreation and Community Services Department has the organizational
                                               structure that could allow for a more comprehensive and integrated
                                               approach to addressing a broad range of recreation, educational,
                                               employment, and related needs. This structure offers an opportunity for a
                                               one-stop delivery system that can provide, manage, and coordinate the
                                               effective delivery of services.

The Emerald Necklace Accord partners are committed to: 1) improve park
and recreational opportunities; 2) restore and preserve habitat; 3) affirm
and strengthen cultural and natural history; 4) restore the watershed; and
5) foster collaboration and collective leadership to achieve the vision. To
implement these goals, the following general issue areas will be addressed.
Parks and Recreation
Park and recreation amenities will play a key role in the Emerald Necklace.
The Emerald Necklace Vision proposes development and enhancement of
more than 24 regional parks, including 1,500 acres of habitat and open
space. Developed parks will include linear parks, such as Lashbrook Park,
along the river banks, which will offer picnic areas, exercise trails, and
opportunities for passive and active recreation. Other parks, such as Rio
Vista, will also offer opportunities to learn about the culture, history, and
natural environment of the Emerald Necklace. Signature parks, such as the
Peck Water Conservation Park, will provide opportunities for habitat
restoration, wildlife, fishing, multiuse trails, and passive and active
recreation opportunities. The Duck Farm and Discovery Center will also
provide educational opportunities.
Multiuse Trails
An important feature of the
Emerald Necklace is the
interconnected network of
trails and paths. The
Emerald Necklace’s parks
will be connected by
approximately 17 linear
miles of multiuse trails that
will provide ample and safe
opportunities for walking,
hiking,       biking,     and
equestrian use. Multiuse
trails will provide direct
access into El Monte and Multiuse Trails
surrounding communities
                                Multiuse trails along the river banks offer opportunities for
along the banks of the Rio walking, jogging, bicycling, and equestrian uses.
Hondo River and San
Gabriel River and feeder
washes. Trails will include interpretive signage that offers opportunities to
learn about the history of El Monte. Trails will also allow direct nonroad
connections from residential neighborhoods to the greater downtown area
of El Monte, encouraging walking and bicycling.

                                              Cultural Significance
                                              The rivers have a rich history and culture. Sustained by the water, fish, and
                                              lush selection of riparian plants, the Tongva peoples originally inhabited
                                              the area. In 1771, the Spanish established the original San Gabriel Mission,
                                              La Mission Vieja, along the Rio Hondo River. The fertile soil along the
                                              rivers enabled the area to become the most productive agricultural center in
                                              California. Pioneer settlements took place in 1851 and later became El
                                              Monte. The Mexican Revolution of 1910 brought immigrants who worked
                                              in agriculture and lived in designated barrios (such as Hicks Camp,
                                              Wiggins Camp, Chino Camp, and Canta Ranas) along the rivers. The City is
                                              working to incorporate cultural, and natural features and educational
                                              opportunities into the Emerald Necklace project.
                                              Open Space
                                              The Emerald Necklace will contain many signature parks, such as the 200-
                                              acre Peck Water Conservation Park, which has the potential to have
                                              regional significance. The site of a spent gravel quarry, Peck Park has been

Watershed Management
The Emerald Necklace Vision
Plan affirms a sustainable vision
for a healthy watershed, which
will involve implementation of
practices aimed at conserving
water, protecting water quality,
and flood management. Six
washes and two creeks converge
into the Emerald Necklace. These
creeks    and      washes     carry
contaminants downstream from
storm drain inlets into the Rio
Hondo and San Gabriel Rivers. Major sources are quarries north of El
Monte, which also allow contaminants to settle into the water table.
The Emerald Necklace Accord affirms the Rio Hondo watershed and San
Gabriel watershed as precious recreational and environmental resources.
Among its 10 signatory parties, the City of El Monte has taken a leadership
role to work together to develop a sustainable vision for the health and
welfare of residents in the community through a coordinated plan for the
preservation of open space in the watershed for recreation, environmental
education, development and enhancement of trails, native habitat
conservation and restoration, and protection of water resources.
Habitat Restoration
Peck Water Conservation Park, Whittier Narrows Area, and other locales
around the Necklace are home to hundreds of resident, migrant, and
introduced species of birds, including state species of special concern. Peck
Park Lake, Santa Fe Dam, and Whittier Narrows Dam are stocked with
fish. Various segments of the Emerald Necklace, particularly areas with
intact habitat or open space, are home to amphibian, reptile, and mammal
species. However, restoring the original complex riparian habitat of the
Emerald Necklace brings challenges. In certain areas, the habitat has been
erased, while in other areas, nonnative plant species, such as Arundo,
threaten the ecological balance of the remaining habitat. Pollutants entering
the storm drain system also threaten restoration efforts. It is in this context
that the General Plan envisions habitat restoration as a component in the       River Habitat

for residents, restore the health of the watershed, and create a lasting
contribution and legacy for future generations of El Monte.

PR-28 El Monte General Plan
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE
El Monte has followed traditional patterns of suburbanization, where
residential, commercial, and industrial developments have gradually replaced
many of the original open space and natural areas in the community. El
Monte is committed to providing a managed network of greenways, linear
parks, and urban forest that will support native species, maintain natural
ecological processes, protect air and water, and beautify our environment.
Greenways
Greenways are an essential in achieving a green El Monte and invoking its
heritage as a wooded place between the rivers. Greenways will assist in
improving air quality and water supply and quality. Greenways with trees
will create a shade canopy that reduces the heat reflected from pavement.
They can include vegetation infrastructure that captures and filters
                                                                              Lashbrook Park

for trees and sidewalks and include best management practices (e.g.,
bioswales) that assist in groundwater recharge. They will be dotted with
miniparks that a grove of trees, an outdoor seating area, and play/exercise
equipment. Together, the system of greenways and miniparks will provide
moments of green and contribute to a healthy community forest.

                                                 The City of El Monte’s original habitat was a lush selection of riparian
                                                 woodland plants consisting of trees, shrubs, perennials, and vines. The Rio

                                                 willows, western sycamore, cottonwoods, and white alders. Today, the
                                                 City’s forest consists of five species of trees in parks and along streets. Given
                                                 neighborhoods and the health of residents and visitors, the City is
                                                 committed to reforesting efforts and funds to maintain the urban forest.

Linear Parks
Another type of park in El Monte is the linear park. These are elongated
stretches of green infrastructure, such as landscaped separated trails, long
narrow parks such as Lashbrook Park or other similar designs. The
Emerald Necklace Vision Plan sets forth a plan to create linear parks along
the Rio Hondo River and San Gabriel River. Where there is sufficient
right-of-way, linear parks should extend from the Emerald Necklace along
its six tributaries, which connect the community to the greater Los Angeles
River watershed, surrounding communities, and the Whittier Hills.
Linear parks should connect parks, panoramic views, or public activity
centers. When possible, a linear park should be designed to encourage
passive and active recreation uses. Linear parks should offer views of
significant natural features, historic structures, and/or unique human
activities, as well as opportunities to experience the natural topography and
landscape. They should be landscaped with native vegetation to reflect their
role in the City’s open space system and its natural and cultural history. The
identity of a linear park should be reflected in its landscaping; manmade
elements and park amenities should relate to elements of the urban fabric.
The linear park system must be designed to protect the safety of its users.
                                                                                 Linear Parks
                                                                                 Linear parks along the Emerald Necklace can
                                                                                 provide multiuse trails, native vegetation, and
                                                                                 scenic views of the San Gabriel Mountains.
El Monte’s greening is an ambitious goal to achieve. Replacing a largely
concrete and asphalt environment with greenways, trees, and linear parks
requires unprecedented commitment, financial resources, and leadership.

MULTIUSE PATH SYSTEM
Paths, sidewalks, greenways, and multiuse trails are of great importance to
the El Monte. A planned and well-integrated sidewalk, greenway, and
multiuse trail system will foster a healthy lifestyle for residents of all ages.
Providing safe routes to school for children to walk or bicycle will
encourage exercise on a daily basis and reduce traffic and greenhouse
emissions. Attractive and safe sidewalks and greenways will allow residents
to walk to shopping areas or places of employment and public facilities. The
City is committed to developing a multiuse trail system.
Pedestrian Paths
Walking and jogging are the most highly desired recreational activities.
The ability to walk safely, comfortably, and conveniently from one place to
another affects whether one chooses to walk, bike, take transit, or drive. For
example, if transit users cannot easily walk to and from bus stops, transit
will be a less viable travel option. If sidewalks are missing or streets are
unsafe, residents will choose to drive. Residents without automobiles are
adversely impacted by discontinuous sidewalks and unsafe street crossings.
The availability of sidewalks also affects whether families with young
children walk to parks or schools or, if they have a car, drive.
The City is committed to improving the walkability of El Monte’s streets.        Pedestrian Paths
Presently, 35 percent of the city roadways lack complete sidewalks, and the
                                                                                 Wide sidewalks with ample places for shade
City has adopted a plan to complete all remaining sidewalks by 2010.
                                                                                 trees encourage a healthy lifestyle and

with very young children. Pedestrians could also benefit from amenities
that enhance the walking experience, such as benches, shade trees, water
fountains, public art, wayfinding signage, and landscaped greenways.
Sidewalks and pedestrian paths must be designed with the user in mind.
Sidewalks should allow full use by people with disabilities and families with
children. Ample street trees with shade should line City sidewalks, creating
a pleasant experience for pedestrians and reducing the heat island effect.
Sidewalks should line all the major greenways, where feasible, and connect
to miniparks, providing an oasis for residents to rest, enjoy greenery, and
socialize with friends and family. All sidewalks and greenways need curb
cuts, signals, formal crosswalks, or stop signs at intersections.
The City is committed to fostering a healthier lifestyle for residents, and
perhaps the key to this effort is the completion of pedestrian paths that
encourage walking and exercise.

                                                  Multiuse Trails
                                                  El Monte is at the confluence of numerous washes, trails, and rivers.
                                                  Although the community does not have a network of trails, El Monte’s
                                                  location serves as a hub for an intricate network of trails and washes that
                                                  extend from the Angeles National Forest to the Whittier Narrows Dam.
                                                  This provides an opportunity to develop a series of trails along the Emerald
                                                  Necklace that provide walking, bicycling, and equestrian opportunities.
                                                  A series of washes and tributaries run throughout the watershed and feed
                                                  the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel Rivers. The proposed trails that line these
                                                  secondary channels have the potential to connect residents to resources in
                                                  other cities throughout the region. These wash channels are lined with two
                                                  maintenance roads, one of which could be transformed into a decomposed
                                                  granite or concrete, tree-lined trail, with decorative gates and wayfinding
                                                  signage at the intersections of channels and urban streets.
                                                  Existing paths along San Jose Creek, accessed southwest of the city along
                                                  the San Gabriel River, run parallel to the soft-bottom portion of the creek

                                                  also exist where the various washes converge with the main channels.
                                                  El Monte’s agricultural heritage has left remnant equestrian activities.
                                                  Some property owners in the northern and southern portions of El Monte
                                                  own horses and frequent trails along the river banks and regional parks.
                                                  These include Whittier Narrows Park, Peck Water Conservation Park, and
                                                  the Santa Fe Recreational Area. Although horseback riding in El Monte is
                                                  limited today, the City is committed to preserving its equestrian tradition
                                                  by augmenting and enhancing its equestrian trails along the Emerald

Bicycling
Promoting alternative modes of transportation and mobility is known to
improve air quality, reduce congestion and frequency of accidents, and
reduce commute times. From a parks and recreation perspective, alternative
modes of transportation such as bicycling can also improve the health of
residents. El Monte has the opportunity to achieve all these objectives
through encouraging residents to bicycle.
The challenges of providing safe, citywide bicycle routes are significant and
common to urban areas. El Monte has no bicycle routes and lacks safe
right-of-way in many areas. However, the City does have the opportunity to
create bicycle paths to connect neighborhoods to local parks, schools, and
Emerald Necklace. The Emerald Necklace also provides safe routes to
business areas.
To further the City’s goals, three types of bikeways are envisioned:
   Class I Bike Path. This is a separate right-of-way, typically paved, and
    designated for the exclusive use of bicycles and pedestrians. Cross-flows
    with motor vehicles are minimized. While a bike path may be adjacent
    to a street, it will typically be away from streets in a separate right-of-
    way.
   Class II Bike Lane. This is a restricted area at the edge of a street
    designated for the exclusive or semiexclusive use of bicycles, with          Multiuse Trails
    through travel by motor vehicles prohibited. Cross-flows by motor            Bicycle paths along the Rio Hondo River offer

    striped lane on the street.                                                  bicycling.
   Class III Bike Route. This is a signed street providing for shared use of
    a street by motor vehicles and bicyclists. While bicyclists have no
    exclusive use or priority, the signage warns motorists of probable
    bicyclists sharing the roadway. Signage includes static signs by the side
    of the road and stenciled symbols/lettering on the roadway surface.
Along the bicycle paths and trails, the City intends to provide amenities
that create an enjoyable experience for bicyclists. This includes wayfinding
and interpretive signage, water fountains, benches, bike racks, landscaping,
greenways along major routes, and recreational amenities. Bicycle routes
will also connect to local and regional nodes for mass transit and be
coordinated with the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Agency (MTA).
The City is committed to creating a system of multiuse trails and paths that
will foster a healthy lifestyle among residents. The following goal statement
and policies further that end. The Circulation Element illustrates the map
for different types of trails.

6. Circulation Element
   Introduction
   Vision El Monte… A city where people can easily circulate and safely
   access community facilities and services by a range of convenient
   transportation choices, and a city with a transportation system that
   efficiently connects residents, business, and visitors to the region.
   CREATING TRANSPORTATION CHOICES
   The Circulation Element is about providing a multimodal transportation
   system that offers a range of mobility choices to easily, efficiently, and
   safely move around the City. The Circulation Element is designed to:
       Provide a convenient and effective transportation system—supporting
        the land uses in El Monte and enabling residents, visitors, and the
        workforce to move around effectively.
       Provide transportation choices—implementing a multimodal
        transportation system that includes attractive and viable alternatives to
        the automobile, including the use of transit, bicycles, and walking.
       Provide strong connections—connecting neighborhoods with parks and
        open space, schools, retail/commercial centers, employment centers,
        and civic and institutional uses.
       Enhance quality of life in El Monte—minimizing the adverse impacts
        of traffic through improved and balanced streetscape design, pedestrian
        and bicycle amenities, and traffic calming.
                                                            El Monte General Plan C-1

    Circulation Element
    PURPOSE OF ELEMENT
    Convenient, safe, efficient, and pleasant transportation is essential to the
    quality of life and a strong economic base in El Monte. The purpose of the
    Circulation Element is to provide a safe, efficient, and effective circulation
    system that supports residential, economic, and other uses. It contains the
    general location and extent of existing and proposed major thoroughfares,
    transportation routes, terminals, and facilities envisioned by the Land Use
    Element of the plan. These requirements are accomplished within the
    complete streets framework in state law.
    The Circulation Element satisfies state law requirements with respect to
    general plans. It provides a comprehensive approach to local transportation
    by identifying specific goals, policies, and plans for multimodal
    transportation in the City that address all private automobile travel, public
    transit, truck, bicycle, and pedestrian circulation modes. As such, the
    Circulation Element is also intended to be consistent with and build on the
    California Complete Streets Act. The Circulation Element does not address
    public utilities and facilities; these topics are addressed separately in the
    Public Health and Safety and Public Services elements.
    RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
    The Circulation Element is related to and consistent with other elements of
    the General Plan. It supports the City’s plans for long-term development
    expressed in the Land Use Element. It is related to the Economic
    Development Element in that the safe and efficient movement of people
    and goods supports a strong economy. It correlates with the Parks and
    Recreation Element by planning for bicycle, multiuse, and pedestrian
    paths. The Circulation Element also recognizes that streets present the
    visual image of the City, and thus its goals are consistent with and support
    design goals in the Community Design Element.
    The Circulation Element is related to public transportation plans prepared
    by regional transportation authorities. The City’s public transportation
    system is coordinated with plans prepared by the California Department of
    Transportation (Caltrans), Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit
    Authority (LACMTA), the South Coast Air Quality Management District,
    and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). Other
    regional planning agencies that have a direct impact on the transportation
    system in El Monte include the Southern California Regional Rail
    Authority and the Los Angeles Airport and Land Use Commission.
C-2 El Monte General Plan

EL MONTE SPEAKS
The Circulation Element’s goals, policies, and programs are informed by an
extensive outreach program in El Monte. The City of El Monte held
community workshops, interviews with elected officials, and discussions
with business associations and other stakeholders as part of the General
Plan update process. This outreach effort provided an understanding of
issues from which a circulation vision for El Monte was drafted. The vision
that emerged is one of choices and balance. A convenient, safe, and efficient
transportation system needs to not only provide for auto, rail, transit bus,
and airport circulation, but also allow people the choice to walk, bicycle,
and use public transit as a matter of convenience and efficiency.
El Monte is committed to fostering a balanced and integrated multimodal
transportation system that embraces the notion that: streets should be
bicycle and pedestrian friendly, fully accessible to people with disabilities,
and provide safe linkages to transit centers, employment, schools,
commercial centers, neighborhoods, and parks; traffic on city streets should
be effectively managed to reduce adverse impacts to neighborhoods; public
transit choices should increase the availability of and use of transit; and
pedestrian and bicycle connections in the City should encourage walking,
bicycling, and access to parks and open space amenities for all.
Important ways to achieve the City’s vision for circulation include:
   Work with partners to capitalize on freeway access, regional bus transit,
    commuter rail, and City fixed-route bus transit to improve mobility and
    stimulate economic development.
   Design and retrofit roadways where feasible to allow for multiple uses
    (e.g., bicycling, walking, bus transit, etc.) and improve the aesthetics
    and safety of roadways.
   Effectively manage the local transportation system, such as truck
    routes, traffic and congestion, pedestrian safety, at-grade rail crossings,
    noise, and aesthetics.
   Enhance, adjust, and expand transit services in El Monte to provide
    convenient transit options and integrate with LACMTA, Foothill
    Transit, Metrolink, and the future Mid Valley (Ramona-Badillo)
    Transit Corridor.
   Create a walkable and bikeable city with a network of sidewalks,
    greenways, and paths that encourage residents to walk, bicycle, and
    move about El Monte without a car.
   Improve trail connections between the rivers, railroad, and freeway
    while softening and interpreting the natural edges of the City.

    Circulation Element
    Circulation Context
    El Monte has often been referred to as the end of the Santa Fe Trail. The
    City has always been known both as a place of passage and a destination,
    and its landscape is defined by its transportation infrastructure. The City of
    El Monte grew exponentially when the Southern Pacific Railroad built the
    first tracks through the City in 1873. Main Street was paved in 1906, and
    one year later, the Pacific Electric “Red Cars” were serving as public
    transportation for the town. The Red Cars traversed the City from east to
    west along the Ramona Boulevard corridor for several decades.
    During the mid-twentieth century, the City of El Monte was again defined
    by its transportation infrastructure. Interstate 10 (I-10) and I-605 were
    extended through and around El Monte, formally ushering in the era of the
    automobile and significant regional traffic as well. The Army Corps of
    Engineers built the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel flood control channels that
    encircle the community. The El Monte Transit Station was developed in
    the 1970s and is now the busiest bus station west of Chicago. The El Monte
    Airport was also built during that time.
    El Monte’s transportation assets, its role as a transit hub, and the vision for
    a range of safe, efficient, and pleasant transportation choices will provide
    the foundation for circulation goals, policies, and programs.

CIRCULATION ISSUES
As the regional transportation hub of the San Gabriel Valley, the City of El
Monte faces a variety of circulation issues that affect economic
development, the mobility of its residents and workforce, and quality of life
in the community. This section provides an overview of key issues as
context for understanding the challenges and opportunities in designing an
effective, efficient, safe, and multimodal transportation system.
Regional Network
El Monte is home to regional transportation systems. Both I-10 and I-605
surround the City. The El Monte Airport serves recreational fliers and the
general aviation community. Freight and passenger rail networks also cross
the community and the City is surrounded by regional highways. El Monte
benefits from its location and strong regional transit connections, but the
regional network also creates challenges for the City’s economy, flow of
goods, and public safety. This element includes the following priorities for
the regional transportation system:
   Support improvements to I-10 and I-605, including high occupancy toll
    lanes, ramps/interchanges, and traffic management techniques, to
    improve vehicle flow.
   Work with LACMTA, Foothill Transit, and San Gabriel Valley
    regional communities for improvement of the Mid Valley Transit
    Corridor.
   Work with the Alameda Corridor East Authority and other public
    entities to improve the flow, efficiency, safety, and aesthetics of rail
    corridors in El Monte.
   Manage truck operations in El Monte to support economic goals,
    protect residential neighborhoods, improve public safety, and maintain
    quality of life.
   Support bus transportation to enhance transportation options,
    including connectivity with regional light rail and regional high speed
    rail opportunities.
   Work with Los Angeles County to ensure the safe operation of the El
    Monte Airport and efficient use of general aviation community assets.
Road Network
The roadway system provides the fundamental basis for auto, transit,
bicycle, and pedestrian travel—residents depend on it to commute to work,
businesses rely on it to reach their customers, and pedestrians rely on fully
completed sidewalks to walk to and from school, home, shopping, and
                                                         El Monte General Plan C-5

    Circulation Element
    entertainment. To provide a complete roadway network for these purposes,
    this element includes (among others) the following priorities:
       Improve freeway access to and from Flair Park, Northwest District, and
        the downtown; complete missing portions of the local street grid in
        these areas as well.
       Improve, design, and operate roadways in a manner that encourages
        multimodal transportation options.
       Ensure that sufficient funding is available to construct, rehabilitate, and
        improve local roadways.
       Improve connections across the railroads, Interstate 10, Rio Hondo and
        San Gabriel Rivers, and other infrastructure.
       Design and operate major roadways in El Monte to incorporate, to the
        extent feasible, the latest in context-sensitive design techniques.
    Traffic Management
    El Monte has an established land use pattern and transportation network.
    Few feasible alternatives are available to widen existing roadways to
    accommodate growth. Moreover, the City also has a high level of regional
    transportation infrastructure that provides routes for regional traffic to pass
    through El Monte. In recognition of these limitations, the element provides
    traffic management policies and programs to:
       Support traffic demand management techniques to reduce automobile
        trips and encourage bicycling, walking, and use of transit.
       Develop and refine intelligent transportation system strategies to
        maximize the operational efficiency of roadways.
       Implement tools to reduce and control traffic in neighborhoods and
        provide safe routes to schools, parks, and activity centers.
       Ensure adequate parking for development projects in the City and
        support parking facilities where appropriate.
       Coordinate with regional agencies to improve circulation within the
        community and on regional routes affecting the City.
    Public Transit
    The City of El Monte is home to significant public transit facilities and
    services. The El Monte Transit Station (EMTS) is a regional bus hub in
    downtown with direct access to the El Monte Busway, one of the most
    successful dedicated bus/high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes in the
    country. Both LACMTA and Foothill Transit operate many routes that run
    through El Monte and converge on the EMTS. The Metrolink commuter
C-6 El Monte General Plan

rail runs east–west through El Monte and stops near downtown. The City
also operates a successful local bus service. In recognition of the importance
of transit service to El Monte, this element sets forth policies to:
    Pursue strategies to improve intercity transit service with the East San
     Gabriel Valley communities through the Mid Valley Transit Corridor.
    Expand City transit service to better serve residents who otherwise at
     the El Monte Transit Station to use the regional transit connection.
    Expand transit services to better serve Flair Park, the Northwest
     Industrial District, and other areas of the community.
    Pursue strategies to improve the integration of riders using the
     Metrolink and El Monte Transit Station.
    Increase and/or improve the integration of local and regional bus
     service through scheduling, increased service, and other means.
Bicycles and Pedestrian Paths
In an urban environment dominated by the auto, the availability of
sidewalks, bicycle paths, and trails are just as important. Residents desire to
walk and bicycle to work, home, school, and recreational amenities.
Walking and bicycling not only provide an alternative to the auto, but also
improve the health of residents. However, with the exception of regional
bike paths along the rivers, there are no bicycle routes, paths, or lanes in the
City. Similarly, more than one-third of the sidewalk network is incomplete.
Sidewalks that do exist are often narrow, with limited landscaping and
pedestrian amenities. Priorities for the Circulation Element are to:
    Provide a complete network of sidewalks, with dedicated tree-planting
     areas and pedestrian amenities that link parks, schools, key civic
     facilities, businesses, and residences.
                                                                                 Sidewalks, Paths, and Trails
    Create an interconnected network of highly amenitized and safe bicycle
     routes that link parks, schools, civic facilities, businesses, and          Sidewalks with ample greenery and shade
     residences in El Monte.                                                     trees provide an attractive and enjoyable
                                                                                 setting for pedestrians.
    Integrate the City’s pedestrian and bicycling network with the Emerald
     Necklace Vision Plan of linear parks and multiuse trails.
    Ensure that residents of all ages can easily and safely walk and bicycle
     to schools, parks, and amenities in their neighborhoods.

    Circulation Element
    EL MONTE CIRCULATION PLAN
    The Circulation Plan is the blueprint for the development and buildout of
    the transportation system to support the City’s General Plan vision, the
    Land Use Plan, economic development goals, and other general plan
    priorities. This section describes the City’s transportation network,
    functions of travel corridors, and the Circulation Plan (Figure C-1).
    Roadway Types
    The Circulation Plan is built on a hierarchy of roadways and intersections
    that differ in design, primary function, and intended use.
       Major Arterials. These streets carry traffic from one part of the City to
        another and connect to the highway system. Arterials carry the highest
        volumes of traffic at the highest speeds, with limited interference to
        traffic flow. Major arterials typically function as truck routes and
        emergency response routes. However, they are not exclusively auto-
        dominated streets; they may serve as major transit corridors and need
        to accommodate convenient and safe pedestrian travel.
       Secondary Arterials. Secondary arterials carry traffic from one part of
        the community to another and connect to major arterials. Secondary
        arterials typically carry lower volumes, principally local traffic, and are
        used for shorter trips to activity centers, jobs, residences, schools, and
        other local destinations. Secondary arterials are often used for transit,
        bicyclists, and pedestrians. Depending on the roadway width, trucks
        may have limited access to secondary arterials.
       Collectors. Collector streets are intermediate routes; they connect
        residential neighborhoods to each another and neighborhoods to
        commercial and other districts in El Monte. They collect traffic from
        local streets in residential neighborhoods and channel it onto arterials.
        Collector streets may also carry local transit service. Finally, collectors
        often serve as the primary bicycle routes in the community and also
        accommodate pedestrian travel. Most collector streets have two lanes.
       Local Streets. Local streets serve local land uses, typically residential
        neighborhoods, and provide direct access to individual parcels. Local
        streets typically carry the lowest volume of traffic, which is nearly
        exclusively local traffic. Local streets, being the primary means for
        residents to get around their neighborhood, should also accommodate
        bicycles and local pedestrian circulation. Speeds on local streets are
        relatively low, and on-street parking is often permitted. In some cases,
        however, local streets serve commercial and industrial uses.
C-8 El Monte General Plan

Functional Purpose of Primary Local Travel Corridors
The Circulation Plan is structured to achieve a balance for all
transportation modes. Where feasible, streets have been designed to
accommodate a variety of modes. However, there will be certain emphases
placed on different streets depending on their location, relation to activity
centers, and design.
Local travel corridors are defined below.
   Auto Corridors. Auto corridors are most frequented by autos. The
    principal corridors for auto travel in El Monte are Valley Boulevard and
    Garvey Avenue in the east–west direction, and Rosemead Boulevard,
    Baldwin Avenue, Santa Anita Avenue, and Peck Road in the north–
    south direction. These streets will also comprise most of the truck route
    system in El Monte. Other key streets will be secondary corridors for
    auto travel, and in certain cases will support travel by other modes.
   Transit Corridors. Transit corridors refer to streets that are designated
    for transit (bus) use. Primary transit corridors are expected to carry the
    highest levels of transit service, particularly regional bus service, with
    the highest number of bus routes and the highest frequency of service.
    As an alternative, a secondary transit street is expected to carry lower
    but still significant levels of transit service, probably with a greater
    orientation to local rather than regional bus routes.
   Truck Routes. Truck routes are the primary routes for truck traffic.
    Truck routes are focused onto principal travel corridors that support
    commercial and industrial activities. Controlling and limiting trucks
    help prevent them from intruding into neighborhoods and traveling on
    streets not designed to accommodate them, reduce diesel and
    particulate emissions near sensitive land uses, control noise and
    vibration, and improve quality of life in the community.
   Bicycle and Pedestrian Corridors. Two green corridors are proposed in
    El Monte—one generally parallel to I-10 that connects the Rio Hondo
    Channel to the San Gabriel River, and a north–south corridor along
    Tyler Avenue. These two corridors will provide the backbone for
    bicycle and pedestrian circulation in El Monte and provide good access
    to downtown El Monte. Connected bike paths and bike routes, defined
    later in this element, will connect neighborhoods, schools, parks, open
    space, and retail/commercial and institutional areas.

Function of Primary Regional Travel Corridors
Whereas the local roadway corridors provide the primary mode of travel
within the community, the City of El Monte is linked to the greater
metropolitan area by other transportation routes. As described below,
regional transportation routes include the Metrolink passenger rail lines, El
Monte Airport, Union Pacific Railroad, and freeways.
The following provides a general discussion of each regional travel corridor.
   Freight Corridors. A Union Pacific Rail Road (UPRR) main line travels
    east–west through the City, north of Valley Boulevard. Approximately
    35 freight trains pass daily through El Monte. With the improvements
    to the Alameda Corridor, the number and frequency of railroad freight
    trains are expected to significantly increase in the future. According to
    region plans, grade separations will be at six crossings, and mobility
    improvements are scheduled for the remaining at-grade crossings.
   El Monte Airport. The El Monte Airport, a general aviation airport, is
    located in the City of El Monte. The County of Los Angeles owns and
    operates the airport. As a general aviation airport, the airport supports
    regional and general aviation operations. The County of Los Angeles El
    Monte Airport Master Plan (1995) plans for the airport to maintain its
    role as a general aviation airport. Refer to the Land Use Element for
    discussion of consistency with the county’s airport land use plan and
    the Public Health and Safety Element for airport safety.
   Metrolink Line and El Monte Busway. The Los Angeles to San
    Bernardino Metrolink commuter rail line runs east–west through the
    center of the City, with a rail station on the northeast part of downtown
    El Monte. The City of El Monte also has an elevated and dedicated
    busway that extends from the El Monte Transit Center to I-10. This
    transitway is one of the most successful and long-lasting dedicated
    bus/HOV-lane facilities in the country.
   Freeways. The City of El Monte is bisected by I-10 and is accessed at
    key arterials, namely Valley Boulevard, Durfee/Garvey Avenue, Santa
    Anita Road, and Peck Road. I-605 frames the City’s eastern border.
    Rosemead Boulevard, a state highway, borders Flair Park on the City’s
    western border. These freeways and state highway provide excellent
    access to destinations through the Los Angeles metropolitan region.

     Goals and Policies
     The goals and policies section is organized into five issues, addressing
     different aspects of El Monte’s circulation system. After discussion of each
     issue and its importance to El Monte, City goals and policies are presented
     to further the community’s transportation vision.
     CONNECTING EL MONTE TO THE REGION
     Transportation planning in El Monte is linked to the regional
     transportation context. El Monte’s mobility plan is designed to maximize
     the City’s power to effect positive change within its boundaries as well as to
     positively influence transportation patterns and routes beyond the City's
     boundaries that ultimately affect transportation patterns in the community.
     Freeway Access
     The General Plan calls for the intensification of three business districts—
     Flair Park, the Downtown, and Northwest Industrial District. Combined,
     these districts provide the majority of employment in El Monte and a
     significant share of general fund tax revenues. As indicated in the
     Economic Development Element, the key to improving El Monte’s
     economy is increasing the business value of an El Monte location. Well-
     connected and integrated circulation is the key to improving these areas.
     The City of El Monte’s key economic and employment centers are
     separated by I-10, the Rio Hondo Channel, and local roadways. Moreover,
     several districts are bisected by regional transportation infrastructure,
     including freight railroads and the Metrolink line. The General Plan
     proposes to intensify and redevelop these regional centers to further
     economic and employment development goals. Certain improvements to
     the regional freeway infrastructure are desired to support these goals.
     Passenger Rail/Transit
     As a transportation hub in the San Gabriel Valley, the City of El Monte
     supports the expansion of regionally significant infrastructure projects to
     improve transit use. LACMTA will be significantly expanding its regional
     bus service and plans to expand the bus terminal in El Monte to
     accommodate growth. To support that effort, the City is undertaking
     feasibility studies to create a rapid transit line, the Mid Valley Transit
     Corridor, that will run from the El Monte Transit Station eastward via
     Ramona Boulevard and Badillo to cities in the east San Gabriel Valley.
C-14 El Monte General Plan

El Monte is also served by Metrolink, the regional commuter rail system,
and there is a rail station in the downtown area that is about one mile from
the transit center. To support SCAG’s Compass Blueprint growth strategies
and regional air quality goals, the City supports the linking of the
Metrolink station to the El Monte Gateway to promote intermodal use.
This can be achieved through the improvement of service connections
between both locations and consideration of other strategies.
Freight Movement
Freight movement is an essential need for businesses in El Monte. Trucks
are allowed to make deliveries to and from businesses or their various
customers in the community pursuant to any regulations contained in the
City’s Municipal Code. With respect to trucks that pass through El Monte,
but do not serve local needs, the General Plan designates truck routes where
the roadway design is sufficient to accommodate large vehicles and the
adjacent land uses require truck accessibility to deliver goods and materials.
Freight movement by rail is an important issue in El Monte. The Union
Pacific Railroad operates a main line that runs through El Monte. The
Alameda Corridor project is projected to double the rail traffic along this
line. Although the City has several grade-separated crossings, additional
grade separations are desired to allow for unimpeded auto, truck, and
transit passage along the north–south roadways in El Monte. The City is
working with the Alameda Corridor East Authority (ACE) on such projects.
Airport
El Monte Airport, a general aviation airport, is located in El Monte and
owned and operated by the County of Los Angeles. The El Monte Airport is
a single-runway airport and primarily used for recreational and training
purposes. Other uses include “touch-and-goes” and, to a lesser extent,
company business, personal business, and governmental uses. The airport is
surrounded by fully developed sensitive land uses that include residences,
schools, and other commercial and industrial uses.
The County of Los Angeles El Monte Airport Master Plan (1995) for the
airport indicates that the location of the airport presents problems in terms
of land use compatibility and facility expansion potential and restricts both
aircraft and airport operation flexibility. Under these constraints, the plan
anticipates that the operational role of the El Monte Airport will remain
primarily for recreational and training purposes and, to a lesser extent,
other uses as previously indicated.

     Circulation Element
     Regional Improvements
     In addition to improvements required to mitigate traffic impacts resulting
     from implementation of the Land Use Plan, the City of El Monte also
     desires that certain additional regional transportation projects be pursued.
     These projects are of regional significance because: they are tied to regional
     employment centers; they require the crossing of county, state, and federal
     jurisdiction; and/or they benefit a significant number of people living
     throughout the region. The City also recognizes that funding for the
     projects has not yet been allocated and, furthermore, the review, approval,
     and implementation of the projects are not under the jurisdiction of the
     City. However, the City recognizes the benefits these projects will produce
     for the region and the City and is highly supportive and an advocate for
     implementation of these transportation projects.

          report.
                                                         El Monte General Plan C-19

     Circulation Element
     LOCAL ROADWAY NETWORK
     Providing and maintaining a roadway system that is efficient and safe,
     serves all El Monte, and supports a multimodal transportation system is a
     goal of the Circulation Element. The Circulation Element seeks to achieve a
     balance in the use of roadway space and ensure that city streets are
     walkable, bikeable, and pedestrian friendly. Moreover, attractive and
     pedestrian-friendly streets are needed to enhance our quality of life.
     Roadway Design
     The City of El Monte is almost completely built out; roadway widening is
     not possible without taking considerable property and right-of-way, which
     is not a practical or desirable proposition in the City. In many areas and
     along many corridors, the adjacent buildings and land uses will not change
     for many years. Given the inability to widen many streets, the Circulation
     Element anticipates that the existing roadway cross-sections will remain on
     most streets in the City.
     After decades of planning for the automobile or truck, context-sensitive
     design has become a more prominent consideration in transportation
     planning. The design and operation of streets should not only relate to their
     function, but be sensitive to the desired nature and scale of adjacent land
     uses and the districts they pass through. This is particularly important on
     commercial and neighborhood streets where traffic volumes and speeds will
     need to be managed to be consistent with the type and intensity of adjacent
     land uses.
     Therefore, although existing street widths will remain, the roadway
     standards in this plan provide for wider sidewalks than currently exist in
     most locations to make streets more pedestrian friendly. Roadway standards
     are thus in many cases stated as ranges for lane widths, roadway widths, and
     right-of-way widths to provide flexibility to accommodate existing roadway
     widths, provide for enhancements where feasible, and allow the
     characteristics of different roadways to be tailored to their unique
     circumstances for the most efficient use.
     Street standards for each street type are shown in Figures C-3a to C-3d.
     Although not conveyed by street cross-sections, aesthetics is also an
     important consideration in roadway design. The Community Design
     Element provides additional guidance on roadway aesthetics.

Roadway Performance Standards
Traffic conditions are often rated according to level of service (LOS). LOS
describes the efficiency and quality of traffic operations and is measured at
intersections or along road segments. Operating conditions are described on
a scale from LOS A (excellent condition) to LOS F (very poor condition).
Level of service definitions are summarized in Table C-3.
 Table C-3                Level of Service Standards
                                                                                        Volume/Capacity Ratio

      A          Excellent operation.                                                           <0.600
                 All approaches to the intersection appear quite open,
                 turning movements are easily made, and nearly all
                 drivers find freedom of operation.
      B          Very good operation.                                                        0.601–0.700
                 Many drivers begin to feel somewhat restricted within
                 platoons of vehicles. This represents stable flow. An
                 approach to an intersection may occasionally be fully
                 utilized and traffic queues start to form.
      C          Good operation.                                                             0.701–0.800
                 Occasionally drivers may have to wait for more than 60
                 seconds, and backups may develop behind turning
                 vehicles. Most drivers feel somewhat restricted.
      D          Fair operation.                                                             0.801–0.900
                 Cars are sometimes required to wait for more than 60
                 seconds during short peaks. There are no long-standing
                 traffic queues. This level is typically associated with
                 design practice for peak periods.
      E          Poor operation.                                                              0.901–1.00
                 Some long-standing vehicular queues develop on critical
                 approaches to intersections. Delays may be up to several
                 minutes.
      F          Forced flow.                                                                   >1.001
                 Represents jammed conditions. Backups from locations
                 downstream or on the cross street may restrict or
                 prevent movement of vehicles out of the intersection
                 approach lanes; therefore, volumes carried are not
                 predictable. Potential for stop-and-go type traffic flow.

     Circulation Element
     Roadway Improvements
     The basis of mobility in El Monte is the roadway system. The General Plan
     identifies two primary areas where roadway improvements are needed to
     complete missing portions of the grid. The City’s local roadway network
     and prepared improvements are shown in Figure C-4.
        Study Area #1. Special Study Area #1 is approximately bounded by
         the west City limit, Valley Boulevard, Santa Anita Avenue, and I-10 /
         Rio Hondo Channel. This area comprises the lower portion of the
         Northwest Industrial District. Traffic studies prepared for the General
         Plan demonstrate that several intersections, state highway segments,
         and freeway ramps are operating at deficient levels and that further
         intensification pursuant to the land use plan will affect these roadways
         further. The EIR proposes mitigation measures to address these
         concerns. Moreover, the General Plan proposes that a detailed
         feasibility study and Northwest circulation study be conducted in Study
         Area #1 to determine long-term solutions for this area.
        Study Area #2. Special Study Area #2 is a portion of downtown El
         Monte bounded by Santa Anita Avenue, Valley Boulevard, Tyler
         Avenue, and Ramona Avenue. Traffic studies prepared for the General
         Plan demonstrate that several roadways, state highway segments, and
         freeway ramps are operating at deficient levels and that General Plan
         buildout will affect these further. The EIR proposes mitigation
         measures to address these concerns. Moreover, the General Plan
         proposes that a detailed feasibility study be conducted in Study Area #2
         pursuant to the “Plan to Improve Traffic Safety and Circulation in El
         Monte” (November 2006) to improve the safety and comfort of
         nonmotorized users (bicycles and pedestrians) in this area.
     Roadway Aesthetics
     Major thoroughfares are gateways and contribute to the character of the
     districts they traverse. Coordinated and lush street landscaping and
     improvements define and enhance primary corridors, soften the transition
     between commercial and residential areas, and create a pleasant residential
     setting in neighborhoods. The Community Design Element sets forth a
     program to improve street aesthetics. This includes policies to: 1) define the
     image and identity of major corridors in the community; 2) incorporate a
     wide variety of public landscaping; 3) coordinate signage and lighting to
     improve consistency and aesthetics; and 4) consider the functional needs of
     the roadway in its design and operation. The Community Design Element
     also sets forth policies to guide the design of streetscapes in major districts.

C-28 El Monte General Plan
Goal C-2
Provide and maintain an efficient roadway system that supports multimodal
transportation, serving all parts of El Monte.
Policies
C-2.1     Balance the Roadway System and Land Uses. Provide a safe
          and efficient street system to support the City’s mobility goals for
          all transportation modes and the General Plan goals.
C-2.2     Roadway Performance Standards. The City desires to maintain
          a level of service (LOS) D throughout the City, except that LOS
          E may occur in the following circumstances:
          -  Intersections/roadways at, or adjacent to, freeway ramps
          -  Intersections/roadways on major corridors and transit routes
          -  Intersections/roadways on truck routes
          -  Intersections/roadways in or adjacent to commercial districts
          These standards may require, but are not intended to mandate,
          roadway and/or intersection widening. They are a policy goal and
          shall be used to monitor traffic conditions to assess the impacts of
          new development. As LOS standards apply only to vehicles and
          do not account for walkability or other modes, they shall not be
          the sole criteria for judging transportation system performance.
          Pedestrian walkability and convenience, livability, transit access,
          operability, and aesthetics shall also be performance criteria.
C-2.3     Fully Developed Street System. Fully develop the street system
          in the City by adding to the missing street grid or reconfiguring
          the existing street grid in the west-central part of the City, Study
          Area #1, to help ensure efficient traffic flow.
C-2.5     Context-Sensitive Street Standards. Design and operate streets
          and intersections to be sensitive to adjacent land uses and
          districts and to all roadway users, including transit, bicycles, and
          pedestrians, where appropriate.
C-2.6     Roadway Sizing. Provide appropriate roadway sizing in the City.
          Where roads are wider than traffic requires, consider converting
          surplus space to landscaped medians, bike lanes, and wider
          sidewalks, to make the road more pedestrian and bicycle friendly.
C-2.7     Maintain Infrastructure. Develop and maintain adequate
          funding sources and maintenance programs for the ongoing
          maintenance and upkeep of City transportation
                                                          El Monte General Plan C-29

     Circulation Element
     TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT
     The City of El Monte has an established urban fabric. Street widening is
     generally infeasible and undesirable for its impact on quality of life. The
     City’s regional transportation infrastructure provides routes for regional
     traffic to pass through El Monte and impact its streets, and population
     growth has resulted in an increasing number of trips, further impacting
     roadways and public safety. Thus, it will be increasingly important to
     effectively manage traffic operations on City streets and examine ways to
     accommodate all modes of transportation.
     Intelligent Transportation Systems
     Nearly every community in southern California faces traffic congestion
     problems that can no longer be solved through road widening or restriping.
     The LACMTA periodically prepares a long range transportation plan
     (LRTP) to address regional transportation challenges. A key component of
     the LRTP is the traffic system management program, which defines the
     LACMTA’s support for intelligent transportation system improvements on
     regional arterials to improve traffic flow and cost-effectively enhance
     arterial capacity where roadway widening is not possible.
     El Monte participates in the San Gabriel Valley Transportation Forum
     (SGVTF) to address the creation of an ITS. The SGVTF’s purpose is to
     design, develop, and deploy an advanced traffic management system
     specifically so that traffic signals can be synchronized and ITS can be
     integrated across jurisdictional boundaries. Synchronizing traffic signals
     along arterials and optimizing signal settings will result in smoother traffic
     flows and reduced idling. This in turn reduces fuel use, saves travel time,
     diminishes wear and tear on vehicles, and reduces vehicular emissions.
     The City of El Monte is committed to exploring and utilizing feasible
     technologies in traffic detection and operational management. This could
     entail traffic monitoring, signal coordination, traffic signal
     synchronization, bus priority schemes, dynamic electronic signage, and
     smart pedestrian crossings. The Element proposes policies to support ITS
     and programs to develop and implement a system for El Monte in
     conjunction with neighboring communities in the San Gabriel Valley.
     Policies are also included for the City of El Monte to pursue both the
     development and implementation of a Traffic Management System.
C-30 El Monte General Plan

Neighborhood Traffic
As regional and local traffic increases, through-traffic can seek alternative
routes, which can impact residential neighborhoods in El Monte. This
occurs when drivers divert from congested arterial roadways to local and
collector roads. Cut-through traffic lowers the level of service in El Monte
and increases safety hazards, especially around schools and parks. Speeding
is a common problem on some local streets, creating unsafe conditions for
residents and unacceptable noise levels.
The first and key strategy for keeping though-traffic out of residential
neighborhoods is to effectively manage traffic on arterial roadways, so there
is no incentive for traffic to divert through neighborhoods. Since speeding
also contributes to safety hazards, programs to manage traffic volumes and
speeds to appropriate levels in the neighborhoods are equally important.
These techniques usually need to reflect specific local neighborhood
circumstances rather than generic solutions. This element recognizes the
importance of traffic calming and identifies actions for a process for
developing neighborhood traffic management programs where appropriate.
Safe Route to Parks and Schools
Schools and parks in El Monte are located in residential neighborhoods to
allow most students to walk to school. Many parents drop off and pick up
children from school in cars. This may be due to convenience, the lack of
complete sidewalks connecting residences and schools, and safety
considerations. The same issues arise at well-used local parks and
recreational facilities. This can often result in unique congestion problems
on local streets that are not designed to handle large, peak-hour loading
queues at schools, parks, and recreational facilities.
The City of El Monte encourages walking and bicycling to and from
schools and parks and reducing congestion in areas surrounding public
facilities. The City of El Monte is committed to working with school
districts to provide accessible pedestrian routes from neighborhoods and to
provide crossing guards at critical intersections to facilitate safe passage for
children. Moreover, the City is committed to completing its sidewalk
network and working with neighborhoods and the community to install
traffic-calming devices to encourage walking and bicycling to parks.

     Goal C-3
     A well-managed traffic management system that maximizes the operational
     efficiency of existing roadways, encourages a balance of transportation
     modes, and improves the safety and livability of neighborhoods.
     Policies
     C-3.1       Operational Efficiency. Maximize the operational efficiency of
                 the arterial roadway system with the implementation of traffic
                 management and traffic signal operations measures without
                 adversely impacting transit, bicycles, and pedestrians.
     C-3.2       Traffic Flow Management. Manage traffic flow on roadways for
                 appropriate vehicle speeds, calm traffic in the City, and protect
                 neighborhoods from traffic intrusion. Apply appropriate
                 techniques to control the volume and speed of traffic consistent
                 with land use policy, sensitive uses, and other concerns.
     C-3.3       Neighborhood Traffic. Work with community representatives,
                 neighborhood groups, businesses, and residents to develop
                 creative strategies to address traffic, congestion, and
                 transportation issues unique to neighborhoods or districts.
     C-3.4       Safe Routes to Schools. Work with school districts to identify
                 safe routes to all schools, enabling better school access by cyclists
                 and pedestrians. Support safe drop-off and pick-up zones around
                 schools during the morning and afternoon peak hours.
     C-3.5       Through Traffic. Work with adjacent cities, the County of Los
                 Angeles, and other government entities to minimize the adverse
                 traffic impacts on El Monte streets from traffic originating
                 outside the City and passing through the City.
     C-3.6       Traffic Signal Management. Pursue development and
                 implementation of a Traffic Management System, with a traffic
                 management center in the City or a joint center with adjacent
                 jurisdictions and/or the County of Los Angeles, to coordinate and
                 manage the City’s traffic signal system, integrate operations on
                 City streets, and implement advanced traffic management
                 technologies where appropriate.

TRANSIT ALTERNATIVES
Few cities in the San Gabriel Valley are so profoundly affected by transit. El
Monte’s early years were influenced by the railroad; the town grew
exponentially when the Southern Pacific Railroad built the first tracks
through the City in 1873. Main Street was paved in 1906, and one year later
the Pacific Electric “Red Cars” were serving as public transportation for the
town. The Red Cars traversed the City from east to west along the Ramona
Boulevard corridor until the tracks were replaced in the 1950s. Today, El
Monte is home to significant transit facilities and services that will
continue to play a critical role in the future of the community.
El Monte Gateway and Station
The City of El Monte is home to the El Monte Transit Station, a regional
bus hub with direct access to the El Monte Busway on I-10. One of the most
successful and long-lasting dedicated bus/HOV facilities in the country, the
busway runs from El Monte to Downtown Los Angeles. Both the
LACMTA and Foothill Transit operate bus routes that converge at the El
Monte Transit Station. The federal government is funding a demonstration
project to convert HOV lanes along I-10 into high-occupancy toll lanes,        Transit Station
whose revenues will fund a bus maintenance facility in El Monte. They will
                                                                               The El Monte Transit Station in downtown El

mixed-use community that integrates transit, housing, retail, business, and    the bus terminal by the year 2012.
entertainment.
Metrolink
The City of El Monte is served by Metrolink, the regional commuter rail
system. There is a rail station just north of downtown. Metrolink operates
on the Southern Pacific Railroad line just north of Valley Boulevard. It
offers excellent commuter service, but at the present time, transit
connections from the current rail station to the Northwest Industrial
District or Flair Park are not direct. The General Plan focuses on
intensified job growth, particularly in Flair Park, where several thousand
additional jobs are anticipated. As part of the full development of the
Transit Station, the City supports the improvement of transit connections
from the Metrolink station to Flair Park, the Gateway Project, the El Monte
Transit Station, and the future Mid Valley Corridor. This offers
unparalleled opportunities to develop a truly integrated and full-service
transit center that can become a model for the region and nation.

                                               Transit Service
                                                Promoting transit service within and to and from El Monte benefits the city
                                                in many ways. Transit service helps reduce congestion on roads, improves
                                                safety due to the reduction of vehicles on roadways, and decreases the need
                                                for costly road improvements and repairs. Moreover, transit service is vital
                                                for people who cannot drive, such as seniors, disabled persons, and
                                                teenagers and youth and those who choose not to drive. Providing and
                                                maintaining a broad range of quality transit alternatives are thus priorities.
                                                The City of El Monte is well served by public transit. LACMTA and
                                                Foothill Transit provide numerous routes throughout El Monte and
                                                connect residents to destinations throughout the San Gabriel Valley and
                                                Los Angeles metropolitan region. These transit providers converge at the
                                                El Monte Transit Station, adjacent to the future El Monte Gateway Project.
                                                These regional providers serve most areas of the community, except for
                                                Flair Park, due to access issues and uncertain delays for congestion.
   Metrolink                                    Regional providers also link up with El Monte’s local service.
   Metrolink provides commuter rail service
   from the Inland Empire to Los Angeles, with  El Monte Transit also operates
   rail stops in downtown El Monte.             fixed-route buses that residents
                                                can use to visit shopping areas,
                                                entertainment, schools, parks,
                                                and recreational facilities. All of
                                                the routes originate at the Trolley
                                                Station,      north     of    Valley

                                                Flair/MTA Business Park Shuttle. Dial-A-Ride services for seniors and
                                                disabled people are also available in El Monte.
                                                Creating a pleasant environment encourages use of transit alternatives.
                                                Quality transit facilities shield bus riders from inclement weather or heat,

Goal C-4
A local and regional transit service that is accessible and safe; connects to
homes, residences, parks, and other community destinations; and provides a
viable alternative to the use of autos.
Policies
C-4.1      Transit Service Coverage. Provide transit routes that more
           directly serve residential neighborhoods, and improve transit
           service to Flair Park that connects to the El Monte Transit
           Center. Seek to provide transit within a quarter mile of residents
           and activity nodes.
C-4.2      Regional Bus Transit. Work with LACMTA and Foothill
           Transit to enhance regional transit connections in the City
           through additional routes and increased service frequency.
           Support LACMTA expansion of rapid bus service in the region
           and particularly on routes serving the City.
C-4.3      Enhanced Local Bus Transit. Continue to adjust and enhance
           the local transit circulator service in the community, particularly
           to serve local neighborhoods, schools and parks, key commercial
           districts, and the regional bus and rail transit stations.
C-4.4      Regional Transit Stations. Support the efficient operation of the
           El Monte Transit Station and the Metrolink Station, and focus
           bus transit routes, the bicycle network, and pedestrian corridors
           to these facilities to maximize potential for transit ridership.
C-4.5      Improved Bus Transit Amenities. Improve amenities at bus
           stops, including attractive and convenient stops with

                                              As the City of El Monte is committed to encouraging alternatives to the
                                              automobile, the provision of walking and bicycling paths and trails are
                                              essential parts of the transportation plan. A well-planned sidewalk,
                                              bicycling, greenway, and multiuse trail system will not only provide viable
                                              alternatives to the auto, but also foster a healthy lifestyle for residents of all
                                              ages. Providing safe and pleasant alternatives to the auto will encourage
                                              exercise on a daily basis, reduce traffic and emissions, and create a more
                                              accessible community for residents, visitors, and workers.
                                              Sidewalks
                                              City recreation surveys show that walking is the most popular activity for
                                              residents of all ages. A safe, well-maintained, and complete sidewalk
                                              network is fundamental to encourage residents of all ages to walk. Many
   Pedestrian Paths                           City streets lack completed sidewalks, particularly in northern El Monte.

                                              parks, and other frequented locations), and have adequate lighting.
                                              Walking can be uncomfortable at certain times of the day or year.
                                              Pedestrians benefit from amenities that enhance the walking experience.
                                              Ample street trees provide needed shade from the summer sun, particularly
                                              for seniors and children. Lush, decorative landscaping along roadways not
                                              only improves roadway aesthetics, but creates a sense of calm and beauty
                                              that encourages residents and visitors to walk. Providing decorative
                                              benches and other features, coupled with the amenities above, is important
                                              to encourage walking for people of all ages.
                                              While all City streets should have sidewalks on both sides, they all may not
                                              have the same type of sidewalks. Residential streets, collectors, arterials,
                                              and major highways should have minimum design standards for sidewalks,
                                              but they will differ in design depending on intended use, roadway design,
                                              and features along the roadways. Differences in setbacks may also be
                                              necessary depending on the speed of vehicles on the street. Fundamental to
                                              this process is to design or retrofit streets with the pedestrian in mind,
                                              based on the role of the street.
                                              The Circulation Element proposes the creation of a comprehensive
                                              pedestrian plan that will allow the redesign and retrofit of the City’s
                                              circulation system to encourage and foster pedestrian activity.

Bicycling
Promoting alternative modes of transportation and mobility will improve
air quality, reduce congestion and frequency of accidents, reduce commute
times, and improve the health of residents. This element identifies an
integrated network of bicycle routes throughout the City that connect
neighborhoods, schools, open space, and major employment, civic, and
recreational destinations, including the Emerald Necklace.
Three classes of bicycle routes are envisioned for El Monte. These are Class
I Bike Paths or Bike Trails, Class II Bike Lanes, and Class III Bike Routes.
Each type is described below. Figure C-6 shows locations of bike routes.
Class I Bike Path or Bike Trail
A Class I bike path is an off-street path that is designated for the exclusive
use of bicycles and pedestrians. Cross-flows with motorized vehicles are
minimized. While a bike path may be adjacent to a street, it will typically be
separated from streets in its own right-of-way. A bike path is paved, while a
bike trail is usually an unpaved dirt surface. There are Class I bike paths
along the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River. As part of the implementation
of the Emerald Necklace Vision, the City envisions a new east–west
corridor that will include a Class I bike path.
Class II Bike Lane
A Class II bike lane is an on-street, striped path designated for the exclusive
or semiexclusive use of bicycles, with through travel by motorized vehicles
prohibited. Cross-flows by motorized vehicles and pedestrians are
permitted. Class II bike lanes are proposed along a number of collectors and
secondary arterials, subject to a determination of feasibility. Examples
include Mountain View Road, Peck Road, and Tyler Avenue.
Class III Bike Route
A Class III bike route is a signed street providing for shared use of a street
by motor vehicles and bicyclists. While bicyclists have no exclusive use or
priority, the signage warns motorists that bicyclists may share the roadway.
Signage includes static signs by the side of the road and stenciled
symbols/lettering on the roadway surface. There are Class III bike routes on
a number of collectors and secondary arterials in El Monte. Like all other
proposed bicycle routes, a feasibility study will need to be conducted to
determine the final locations, designs, and use of streets for bike lanes.

     Circulation Element
     Trails
     The City of El Monte, unlike many communities in the region, is framed by
     many miles of flood control channels built by the Army Corps of Engineers.
     These channels, while providing needed flood control protection, also offer
     opportunities for trails, bicycle routes, and equestrian uses. In some cases,
     the County of Los Angeles has already installed limited bicycle routes along
     these channels. However, as a city committed to providing alternatives to
     automobile use as well as to promoting the health of residents, El Monte
     has the opportunity to use these flood control channels to meet its mobility,
     recreational, and environmental goals.
     As described in the Parks and Recreation Element, the Emerald Necklace is
     a bold vision for the development of a 17-mile loop of parks, greenways, and
     trails along the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel Rivers that connect 16 cities.
     The interconnected network of trails and paths fundamental to the Emerald
     Necklace will provide ample and safe opportunities for walking, hiking,
     biking, and equestrian use. Multiuse trails will provide direct access into El
     Monte and surrounding communities along the banks of the Rio Hondo
     River and San Gabriel River and feeder washes. Trails will also allow direct
     nonroad connections from residential neighborhoods to the greater
     downtown area of El Monte, encouraging walking and bicycling.
     Amenities
     As a means to encourage residents and the workforce to utilize multimodal
     transportation alternatives, the City supports the provision of amenities
     along bicycle routes, pedestrian routes, and trails. The type of amenities
     depends on the intended use and location of the pedestrian path, bicycle
     route, or trail. For instance, interpretive signage and cultural resources are
     supported for trails surrounding the Emerald Necklace. For pedestrian
     paths along sidewalks, the walking experience is enhanced through the
     planting and care of canopy trees, installation of benches, and other
     pedestrian amenities. Bicycle amenities can include appropriate signage,
     crosswalks, and bicycle racks and hubs at different points. Individual areas
     may have additional amenities, such as paths in and around Main Street.

Goal C-5
A connected, balanced, and integrated system of walking, biking, and
equestrian paths and trails that is accessible and safe and connect to homes,
residences, parks, and other community destinations.
Policies
C-5.1    Citywide Bicycle Network. Develop and maintain a citywide and
         diversified network of bicycle paths, lanes, and streets that
         connect to neighborhoods, park and recreational amenities,
         schools, activity centers, and the Emerald Necklace.
C-5.2    Regional Coordination. Coordinate development of the City’s
         bike network with adjacent jurisdictions, LACMTA (and its
         Bicycle Transportation Strategic Plan), Los Angeles County, and
         the Emerald Necklace, to maximize system connectivity.
C-5.3    Bicycle Hubs. Establish bike hubs in the community (centralized
         locations with convenient bike parking for trip destinations or
         transfer to other transportation modes) at key transit nodes or
         commercial nodes.
C-5.4    Bicycle Amenities. Provide bicycle amenities throughout the
         City, including items such as bike racks, bike lockers, and traffic
         signal crossing buttons for bicyclists.
C-5.5    Citywide Pedestrian Network. Establish a citywide network of
         sidewalks, trails, and paths that connects neighborhoods, schools,
         open space, and major destinations, where feasible. Coordinate
         provision of the pedestrian network with adjacent jurisdictions.
C-5.6    Pedestrian Amenities. Provide amenities along pedestrian
         routes, such as well-maintained and landscaped sidewalks, tree
         shade cover, benches, pedestrian phases at signalized
         intersections, and midblock signalized or well-signed pedestrian
         crosswalks.
C-5.7    Equestrian Trails. Provide equestrian trails and/or paths in the
         northeast and southeast areas of the City where feasible and
         where equestrian ownership, use, and demand warrant. Such
         improvements should facilitate access to the San Gabriel River.
                                                          El Monte General Plan C-43

     Circulation Element
     LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING
     El Monte’s transportation system does not function in isolation, and travel
     in the City is generated directly by land uses. It is therefore important that
     circulation policies and land use policies are consistent and synchronized.
     Development policies and procedures and building design requirements
     should be transit friendly and pedestrian friendly and include elements to
     support transit, bicycles, and pedestrians. Adequate parking, both on- and
     offsite, is also important. Finally, land use decisions should, where feasible
     and desirable, take advantage of mass transit options.
     Traffic Demand Management
     Transportation demand management (TDM) is a general term for strategies
     and programs that promote the efficient use of transportation systems
     without adding lanes or widening the roadway system. TDM strategies can
     help address a variety of traffic problems in El Monte and also provide
     secondary economic, social, and environmental benefits to the community.
     Examples of TDM strategies are:
        Carpooling or transit use
        Pedestrian and bicycling routes
        Bike/transit integration
        Encouraging walking and cycling
        Parking management and pricing
        Alternative work schedules
     El Monte has one of the highest per capita uses of public transportation.
     However, use of bicycle and pedestrian routes is much lower. The Parks
     and Recreation Element, in tandem with the Circulation Element, sets
     forth a citywide plan for bicyclists and pedestrians. The Land Use Element
     also contains site and building design policies that reduce or better
     distribute travel demand throughout the community or support alternatives
     to the auto. TDM practices would be greatly beneficial in areas of high
     employment (e.g., Flair Park, Northwest El Monte, and the downtown). El
     Monte implements a TDM ordinance that requires developers to include a
     range of transportation demand management program options and features
     in larger new developments.
C-44 El Monte General Plan

Parking Strategies
Managing parking is part of traffic management. Parking deficiencies can
cause vehicles to recirculate on public streets, increase traffic volumes and
congestion, impede economic development goals, and increase safety
hazards. The City’s Municipal Code includes parking requirements to
ensure that adequate onsite parking for most residential, commercial, and
industrial areas of the community, and the City will continue to apply these
regulations to all proposals for new and modified development projects.
However, several areas in El Monte present unique parking challenges.
Customers visiting downtown and Main Street use on-street parking during
weekdays. The City and its Redevelopment Agency have created off-street
surface parking lots behind Main Street for customer use. It is believed that
the development of El Monte Gateway will increase customers to Main
Street and that existing public surface parking lots can accommodate the
off-street parking demand for the foreseeable future. However, there is
interest in mixed-use and residential development in the downtown, and
such new projects may require consideration of building multilevel parking
structures to accommodate such development.
Flair Park is envisioned as an emerging international finance district,
connected to the Los Angeles metropolitan region by Interstate 10. Midrise
office buildings will be the predominant use in the district. Large
corporations in Flair Park already provide onsite and multilevel parking
structures. Flair Park could also benefit from a multilevel parking structure
onsite or offsite with a dedicated district shuttle. This would allow more
land to be converted to employment- and revenue-generating land uses as
opposed to surface and structured parking.
Land Use Strategies
Transit-oriented development (TOD) is moderate to higher-density
projects within walking distance of a major transit stop. TOD can be new
construction or redevelopment of one or more buildings whose design and
orientation facilitate transit use. Transit-friendly land use strategies can
reduce congestion, increase mobility, and improve air quality. The City can
improve accessibility to rail transit by clustering higher-density residential
development around the transit station and downtown. Transit can become
more effective as an alternative to the auto if other services and amenities
are incorporated into the design of projects. The Land Use Plan
concentrates the majority of new development along corridors, Downtown,
Flair Park, and the Northwest Industrial District. The downtown area is
particularly well suited for TOD in light of the connectivity of the area to
high quality and high frequency transit.

     Circulation Element
     Project Mitigation
     Table C-4 is a list of locally desired capital and transit improvements
     projects that the City has submitted to Metro for evaluation in a nexus
     study underway for the Congestion Management Program (CMP), with the
     understanding that the full extent of the benefits from these projects on
     circulation has not been studied or evaluated. However, the various
     components and strategies purported by the projects have been widely
     accepted and shown to produce positive environmental, economic
     development, and congestion relief benefits. The Metro nexus study will
     assess the feasibility of the replacing the existing credit and debit system
     with a fee-based system to address traffic impacts resulting from future new
     development projects. Under the proposal, the model would produce a fair-
     share, quantifiable impact fee for the City to apply to new development
     projects to support congestion relief projects.

7. Economic Development Element
   Introduction
   Vision El Monte… a prosperous local economy that fosters a broad
   range of business ventures; a business-friendly environment that provides
   opportunity for entrepreneurs; a strong employment base, evidenced by
   ample choices of well-paying jobs; a well-trained workforce supported by
   ample educational opportunities; and a fiscally strong City, able to provide
   the quality of services and amenities that support a high quality of life.
   DESIGNING A PROSPEROUS ECONOMY
   The Economic Development Element is intended to provide a strategy to
   make El Monte’s economy strong and sustainable, benefiting the City, its
   residents, and business. This element’s overarching goals are to:
      Support businesses—creating and improving the business reasons for
       locating in El Monte that will attract, expand, and create business
       ventures and private investment.
      Expand employment opportunities—increasing the number and quality
       of employment choices in a widening variety of industries and
       occupations for El Monte residents.
      Increase local revenues—attracting and expanding economic activity
       through revitalization efforts, increasing business value, improving
       sales, and generating revenue for the City.
      Improve quality of life—increasing the diversity and quality of
       shopping, services, entertainment, and community amenities available
       to residents, thus improving the quality of life in El Monte.
                                                            El Monte General Plan ED-1

     Economic Development Element
     PURPOSE OF ELEMENT
     Improving economic activity increases the quality and choice of
     employment opportunities, generating wealth for residents. By stimulating
     private investment and economic activity through prudent policies, the
     City benefits from greater revenues, ensuring its long-term fiscal stability.
     Tax dollars generated from economic activity can then fund public safety,
     parks and recreation, housing, and community services that improve
     quality of life.
     Because local economic conditions directly affect the quality of life in El
     Monte, this element sets forth practical strategies to improve business
     opportunities. In some cases, this means creating a better place for business,
     such as infrastructure improvements, so that businesses wish to relocate or
     stay in El Monte. In other cases, this means providing educational
     opportunities so our workforce can compete and benefit from business
     expansion. This element also proposes to create the business-friendly
     environment necessary to allow business owners to do what they do best.
     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     The Economic Development Element is related to several key plans and
     programs. In 2007, the Chamber of Commerce studied various economic
     development opportunities in the City, proposing a vision for readily
     identifiable economic activity areas: the Northwest Industrial District,
     Flair Park, the greater downtown, and the auto district. The Land Use
     Element further refined many of the concepts expressed in the Chamber of
     Commerce study with respect to changes in land use, the environment, and
     infrastructure needs in the strategic areas. The Economic Development
     Element focuses on the key strategies necessary to revitalize these areas.
     California redevelopment law authorizes cities to create focused areas for
     redevelopment activities in order to eliminate physical and economic
     blight, stimulate economic development, enhance aesthetics, and provide
     affordable housing. The City’s Redevelopment Agency has adopted a five-
     year redevelopment implementation plan that sets forth broad land use,
     program, and financing strategies for project areas.
ED-2 El Monte General Plan

EL MONTE SPEAKS
Like many suburban communities today, El Monte realizes that its
economy is critical to its success and sustainability as a community. An
economic development program is needed to induce more private
investment in El Monte; private investment will in turn create better jobs
for residents, diversify the tax base to increase revenues, and improve the
quality and variety of shopping, services, entertainment, and amenities.
Perhaps now more than ever, the City of El Monte realizes that the future of
the community, the fiscal condition of the City, and in fact, the well-being
of residents and business are inextricably linked to the success of economic
development. In a community referred to as business friendly, too often in
the past economic opportunities have slipped away. This has created much
of the fiscal situation the City faces today.
It is in this context that the City of El Monte
     … supports a prosperous local economy that fosters a broad range of
     business, an entrepreneurial spirit, ample employment opportunities, a
     competitive and trained workforce, and an excellent standard of living.
City outreach efforts for the preparation of this element have helped
identify what residents, businesses, and stakeholders regard as the most
important economic development issues. The results of these efforts, along
with extensive interviews with City staff and officials, produced the
following economic development objectives.
    Distinct and attractive downtown with ample retail shopping
     opportunities, dining, and entertainment.
    Professional office park along Interstate 10 (I-10) catering to finance,
     hospitality, and commerce, including Pacific Rim trade.
    Revitalized Northwest Industrial District and its continued role as a job
     center for El Monte residents.
    Thriving auto district that can provide sales tax revenue for the City
     and a quality car-buying experience to visitors.
    Quality commercial strips and centers that provide a full range of
     neighborhood-serving goods and services.
    Fiscally strong city that can continue to provide and expand
     community services that support a desired quality of life.
                                                             El Monte General Plan ED-3

     Economic Development Element
     Economic Development Context
     The planning context for economic development in El Monte is complex.
     Regional economic forces influence economic development opportunities,
     and the City has little influence over these forces. However, the City of El
     Monte is well positioned in the San Gabriel Valley to leverage its physical
     and locational assets for the City’s economy. As a setting to economic
     development goals and policies, this section highlights the City’s strategic
     focus areas and their role in achieving the City’s economic vision and then
     proposes key objectives that underpin the goals and policies section.
     ECONOMIC FOCUS AREA
     The City recognizes that the foundation of the local economy lies in job
     creation (employment), fiscal stability, diversification, and professional
     offices. Although there are exceptions, each leg of the economy is
     represented by a different sector/location in El Monte. Figure ED-1
     illustrates the major strategic areas in El Monte to facilitate economic
     development.
     Northwest El Monte
     The Northwest Industrial District is visioned as a job engine for El Monte,
     generating a substantial number of well-paying jobs. To facilitate this
     vision, the City created the 410-acre Northwest El Monte Project Area in
     1993. In recent years, the Redevelopment Agency has facilitated the
     development of office buildings, the International Business Incubator, and
     the Foreign Trade Zone, among others. Additional projects included the
     new Home Depot and rehabilitation of the Midway Shopping Plaza. Yet
     this area continues to be in transition because of the loss of numerous
     defense-oriented businesses and heavy manufacturers in recent years.
     Auto District
     The auto district is the revenue engine of El Monte, generating retail sales
     of automobiles, trucks, and recreational vehicles. As the strongest sales tax-
     producing sector, the auto district provides nearly a quarter of El Monte’s
     revenue. The City established the original El Monte Center Project Area in
     1983 and added 114 acres of land to the project area in 1989 as part of the El
     Monte Center Amendment Number 1, resulting in establishment of Nissan,
     Honda, Dodge, and Pontiac-GMC dealerships in the project area. The El
     Monte Center Amendment area now covers a portion of the auto district,
     while the Valley-Durfee Redevelopment Project Area, established in 2003,
     provided additional opportunities for expansion of auto uses.
ED-4 El Monte General Plan

Downtown El Monte
The Land Use Plan visions downtown as the mixed-use, mixed-income,
cultural heart of El Monte that epitomizes community pride and
opportunity. Its historical role is augmented by new housing, retail, office,
parks, and cultural facilities taking advantage of transit-oriented
development. The City established the 213-acre Downtown El Monte
Redevelopment Project Area in 1987. In 2001, the Downtown El Monte
Added Area was created, containing 231 acres of commercial, residential,
and industrial land. This project area was created to help revitalize
neighborhoods and provide opportunities for new housing, supporting
commercial uses, and transit-oriented development.
El Monte Gateway
Development plans are underway to double the size of the El Monte Transit
Station, which is already the busiest such transit center west of Chicago. It
will anchor the new TOD (up to 1,850 new homes), up to 1 million square
feet of commercial space, and public parkland open space. The project will
play an important role in the economic development and revitalization of
El Monte, bringing new residents and new businesses to the downtown
area, serving as a catalyst project for the City, and improving the public
perception and popular image of El Monte.
Corridors
The Land Use Element visions the revitalization of two major corridors—
Garvey Avenue and Durfee Road—with mixed/multiuse housing as a means
to protect and preserve adjacent single-family neighborhoods, and revitalize
and transition underutilized uses. In 2003, the City created the Valley-
Durfee Project Area, which includes approximately 142 acres of land. The
project area presently covers areas redesignated for mixed/multiuse (Durfee
Road south of Magnolia Avenue) and a portion of the auto district along
Valley Boulevard and Garvey Avenue that extends southeast to Interstate
605.
Flair Park
The General Plan visions the transition of Flair Park into a first-class
professional district by attracting businesses that build on the City’s
emerging financial and trade sector, government offices, international
business with Pacific Rim connections, and other specialty niche markets.
Flair Park is intended to provide a range of employment opportunities for
the City’s professional office workforce. Flair Park is not currently within a
redevelopment project area, except for a triangular portion in the southern
section of Flair Park that is within the Downtown El Monte Added Area.

     Economic Development Element
     FUNDAMENTAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
     Although the City’s current redevelopment and economic development
     strategies provide the context for planning, the purpose of the Economic
     Development Element is to provide a strategy that will foster a sustainable
     local economy. To implement this key planning objective requires an
     understanding of the fundamentals of economic development so the City
     can apply them in a meaningful way to achieve its long-term vision.
     Attract Private Investment
     With the Economic Development Element, the City aims to induce
     significantly more private investment in El Monte’s economy because
     private investment will not only improve the economy but also the quality
     of life experienced by residents. It is private investment that will create
     better jobs for residents, diversify the tax base to increase revenues, and
     improve the quality of shopping, services, entertainment, and amenities.
     Public investments are a means to secure this new private investment.
     This focus on attracting private investment drives two key policy issues.
     First, those desiring or promoting public investments for economic
     development must be able to demonstrate the City’s return on investment.
     Will the public investment induce private investment and how much?
     How many jobs will be generated? The public should base its commitment
     of funds on suitable answers to such questions. Second, the City should
     only invest public funds when new private investment cannot occur
     without public involvement. Even then, the amount of public funds should
     only be the amount necessary to get the private investment.
     Promote Policies, Not Projects
     Successful economic development, rather than focusing on projects,
     requires the City to create a long-term vision for the economy and set up
     the policy framework to guide the City. Individual projects, left unguided
     by a sound policy framework, will not collectively achieve the City’s vision.
     In too many communities, City staffs—constrained in size by municipal
     funding limits—can too easily be overwhelmed by the rush of projects.
     Getting each project moving leaves insufficient time to get the basic policies
     right, and thus the end result often does not achieve the City’s vision.
     A community focusing on policies puts more effort into evaluating the
     continued relevance of problematic zoning requirements than getting a
     variance approved for one particular business. A community focusing on
     policies strives to establish equitable fee requirements to meet long-term
     infrastructure needs, rather than reducing development impact fees to land
ED-6 El Monte General Plan

a single development. A community focusing on policies works to solidify
the underlying economic fundamentals that sustain long-term economic
growth, instead of relying solely on getting a signature project developed to
change their economic fortunes.
Create the Business Environment
Fulfilling the General Plan vision requires El Monte to foster an
environment that promotes the business reasons to operate in El Monte.
When those business reasons are limited to cost—cheap land, cheap labor,
and cash incentives—businesses can be expected to migrate when another
location lowers costs. Competing on price alone is not a sustainable strategy
for community development. The City’s economic development program
should focus on creating and improving business reasons that add value to
an El Monte business location.
To improve those business reasons, the City must fully understand the
challenges and opportunities of an El Monte business location—
transportation and access to suppliers and customers; availability and skills
of local labor force; land and facilities for expansion; availability of and
access to capital; and other unique issues. Addressing these challenges is
the sustainable way to attract new businesses that will operate in El Monte
for the long term. The Land Use Element and Community Design Element
offer additional strategies to create an environment maximizing business
reasons for an El Monte location.
Communicate Well
Successful economic development requires effective communication to get
the right messages out. Communicating fulfills three objectives: first, the
City will make economic development information available to the public,
existing businesses, site selection consultants, and potential new business.
Second, the City will communicate marketing messages to existing and new
businesses. Finally, the City will have a public relations program to
improve the public image of El Monte. These efforts should be coordinated
together into a consistent communications strategy.
The City must improve its ability to hear from economic stakeholders. The
business visitation program proposed under the business retention and
expansion goal provides the best means of hearing from stakeholders. As
part of its comprehensive economic development strategy, the City will
identify other programs to gather input from stakeholders, such as
attending monthly business roundtables or breakfasts, formalizing
relationships with business groups, and regularly meeting with commercial
and industrial real estate brokers to understand changing market demand.
                                                          El Monte General Plan ED-7

     Economic Development Element
     Building Capacity
     The General Plan has set forth a new vision for Flair Park, the Northwest
     Industrial District, the downtown, the auto district, and other focus areas in
     the community. To implement this vision requires staffing and leadership
     capacity to manage economic development, change, and even disruption.
     This element sets forth policies and programs to institutionalize economic
     development, effectively manage change, and lessen the negative effects of
     that change on existing residents and businesses alike.
     Many El Monte businesses and organizations already provide a range of
     services to businesses, such as employment training, business assistance,
     and marketing that can be leveraged to achieve the City’s economic
     development objectives. Thus, a fundamental economic principle is to
     nurture existing partnerships, develop new partnerships, and expand
     partnerships where necessary to achieve City economic objectives. These
     include partnerships with schools, nonprofit business development
     organizations, City businesses, the Chamber of Commerce, and others.
     Performance Measurement
     The City of El Monte is a billion-dollar public corporation, responsible for
     the wise management of its physical assets. And, like any private
     corporation, accountability is the key to improving performance. In this
     context, the City must critically think about the expenditure of public
     funds for economic development as investments—investments that must
     generate specific returns to the public. The business community and those
     interested in the City’s economic future must think in terms of the City’s
     goals when asking for public funding and showing how the public funds
     they desire will generate new private investment and create real jobs.
     Economic Development Tools
     Over the years, local economic development programs have created many
     ways to help businesses grow, expand, and create new job opportunities. We
     can generalize these into programs that help businesses with the three
     factors of production—land (and facilities), labor, and capital—and the
     overall management and operations of these factors. The following briefly
     describe the tools available to help business.
        Facilities. Businesses typically expand their operations in response to
         new contracts for their products and services. Business expansions are
         beneficial for the City, its tax revenues, and its workforce. Many
         jurisdictions directly facilitate expansions of industrial and business
         parks through planning and zoning, the expansion of basic
         infrastructure, and publicizing a list of available land and buildings.
ED-8 El Monte General Plan

  Labor. A second tool for economic development is workforce training.
   Because workers usually commute beyond city boundaries, most
   programs are provided regionally, with funding from the federal
   government. Nevertheless, local economic development programs play
   a crucial role in linking businesses to these regional programs or
   developing partnerships with local educational institutions.
  Capital. When businesses invest in new products and services and need
   to expand operations, a significant cash investment is often required. As
   businesses have typically invested heavily in new products and services,
   they often lack the additional capital to expand operations and facilities.
   The City can provide financial assistance directly through a gap
   financing program or industrial revenue bonds, or indirectly through
   enterprise zones, empowerment zones, or foreign trade zones.
  Operations. The City can help businesses improve their management
   skills and operations to become more productive and profitable. This
   may involve the City linking businesses with small business
   development centers, providing venues for local businesses to network,
   coordinate marketing activities for clusters of related types of
   businesses, or providing at least one ombudsman position to assist
   business negotiate the local, state, and federal regulatory environment.
The following goals and policies help implement these fundamental
economic drivers in the planning and decision making process.
                                                         El Monte General Plan ED-9

      Economic Development Element
      Goals and Policies
      The element categorizes the goals and policies into three broad groups. The
      first goal establishes the City’s framework for economic development. The
      General Plan recognizes the need for a vision, comprehensive economic
      development approach, and dedicated staff and resources to make things
      happen. The second set of goals and policies addresses the three basic
      avenues to improving a local economy: growing existing businesses,
      attracting new businesses, and helping residents create wealth by starting
      their own businesses. The final set of goals and policies addresses economic
      development strategies for specific areas of the community.
      INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
      The General Plan proposes an aggressive agenda to transform the
      Northwest Industrial District into a job engine, create a preeminent office
      environment in Flair Park, triple the size of the auto district, and create a
      vibrant downtown. Achieving these economic development goals demands
      the City have the organizational capacity to implement necessary programs
      and projects. The City must also target its scarce resources and work with
      other groups and agencies to do more than the City alone can accomplish.
      Building Capacity
      The General Plan vision will not just happen without the City making it
      happen, and the City cannot make things happen with its current staffing.
      The first step in building capacity is to have a dedicated City staff position
      for an economic development manager. Working with businesses requires
      someone with a flexible schedule. At the same time, those seeking to make
      investments in El Monte will want to work with someone who can make
      things happen. The economic development manager must have access to
      and the respect of the City Manager, City Council, and City departments.
      Success will also require that all City departments work together to achieve
      economic development goals. Economic training is thus critical to success.
      Training will enable key City staff to work together effectively, enable the
      Planning Commission to better appreciate the role of planning in economic
      development, and help the City Council appreciate the value of and justify
      the public investments needed to achieve economic development goals.
      Training should be ongoing for City staff and City Council as individual
      job responsibilities take precedence over time, as City priorities and market
      conditions evolve, and City leadership changes.
ED-10 El Monte General Plan

Planning Economic Development
Communities rarely plan economic development opportunities. Rather,
opportunities often result from chance, luck, or being in the right place at
the right time. In contrast, cities can rarely capitalize on opportunities
without planning: planning the infrastructure, planning the regulatory
environment, and planning the economic assistance programs. Because
windows of opportunity only periodically open, the City must be well
positioned to leverage resources as opportunity arises. Taking advantage of
windows of opportunity requires that the City have an economic plan.
The City’s economic development plan can take many forms but it is much
broader than the redevelopment implementation plan. Most commonly,
cities adopt a comprehensive economic development strategy in accordance
with federal Economic Development Administration (EDA) requirements.
EDA requires an adopted strategy as a prerequisite to apply for funding.
This element establishes the basic parameters of the City’s economic
development program, from which the City Economic Development
Manager can develop an economic development strategy.
Economic Development Partners
The City must also work with its economic development partners, who have
responsibility for many key inputs for economic expansion. El Monte, like
most municipalities, lacks the resources to accomplish all its economic
development goals on its own. Furthermore, many activities and programs
require a regional approach. Workforce development, in particular,
warrants a regional approach because most workers hold jobs in cities other
than the one in which they live in. Economic development that benefits the
San Gabriel Valley as a whole also requires a regional approach.
In addition to the business visitation programs discussed later, El Monte
will need to work with the following economic partners:
    Regional Economic Development Agencies. This includes the Los
     Angeles Economic Development Corporation (LAEDC), San Gabriel
     Valley Economic Partnership (SGVEP), and other similar regional
     entities focusing on specific economic markets in El Monte.
    Business Development Partners. This includes the San Gabriel Valley
     Small Business Development Center (SBDC) hosted by Mt. San
     Antonio College in Irwindale, and the Minority Business Enterprise
     Center at the University of Southern California.
    Educational Partners. This includes Rio Hondo College, Los Angeles
     County Workforce Investment Board and WorkSource Center, the El
                                                         El Monte General Plan ED-11

      Economic Development Element
          Monte/Rosemead Adult Education Center, El Monte public school
          districts, and the Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment (PACE).
         Business Associations. This includes the El Monte/South El Monte
          Chamber of Commerce, the Downtown El Monte Business Association,
          Flair Park Association, and proposed associations representing the auto
          district and Northwest Industrial District.
      Funding Economic Development
      The City must evaluate its current programs and policies to determine how
      it can support economic development. For example, are development
      projects suited to funding through the federal community development
      block grant program? The City, however, cannot afford to fund every
      needed project and program. The City must identify alternative funding on
      a project-by-project basis. The City should also avail itself of state and
      federal programs for which it may qualify, such as the state’s enterprise
      zone. The implementation provides more details on specific funding
      sources for which the City should be eligible.
      Measuring Success
      A successful economic development strategy requires accountability—to
      ensure that revenues are spent wisely, that investments achieve desired
      objectives, and that public investments earn an appropriate return. Such
      improvement requires the City to identify measurable objectives for all its
      economic development undertakings, establish benchmarks and targets,
      and constantly measure its performance so that the City can adjust its
      economic development priorities and programs where necessary.
      Measuring progress is a key part of successful economic development.
      There is a difference between activity and performance. Measuring the
      number of businesses visited annually or façade improvement grants
      identifies the amount of work being done. What’s important, though, is to
      measure success. If the City’s primary goal is creating new jobs, the City
      must institute a means to count jobs and measure how many new jobs the
      economic development program helps create each year.
      Finally, the economic development program must provide an annual report
      to let the City Council and residents know how well the public resources
      dedicated to economic development are creating new jobs and inducing
      new private sector investment. The annual report and resulting public
      comments provide a useful and necessary feedback loop that will allow the
      City Council and City staff to adjust the objectives, strategies, and
      allocation of resources to better achieve the City’s economic development
      goals and inspire public trust that limited resources are being spent wisely.
ED-12 El Monte General Plan

Goal ED-1
The City will have adequate organizational capacity, resources, and
budgetary commitment needed to achieve the General Plan vision for each
strategic area and achieve current and future economic development goals.
Policies
ED-1.1     Staffing. Fund and support a Redevelopment Director, Economic
           Development Manager, and associated professional economic
           development staff with resources sufficient to institutionalize
           economic development in the City’s decision-making process.
ED-1.2     Economic Training. Provide ongoing economic development
           training for City staff, the City Council, and the Planning
           Commission to incorporate economic thinking in City decisions
           and to maintain commitment to economic development.
ED-1.3     Economic Development Plan. Adopt, implement, and keep up-
           to-date a comprehensive economic development strategy that
           implements the General Plan vision for the Northwest Industrial
           District, Flair Park, auto district, downtown, and commercial
           corridors.
ED-1.4     Partnerships. Leverage the capacities of the City’s economic
           development partners to provide services, fund projects, and
           manage programs that are either beyond the ability or authority
           of the City or that can strengthen existing City initiatives.
ED-1. 5 Funding. Explore, develop, and use alternative funding sources to
           pay for and provide incentives for economic development
           activities for which the City lacks sufficient resources.
ED-1.6     Communications Strategy. Develop a comprehensive
           communications strategy to keep all economic development
           stakeholders informed, sell El Monte as a business location,
           counter undesirable publicity, provide a unified and positive
           image of El Monte, and coordinate focused marketing strategies.
ED-1.7     Performance Measurement. Establish objective measures of
           economic development, identify performance benchmarks and
           targets, constantly measure performance, and adjust programs
           where needed to improve performance.
                                                           El Monte General Plan ED-13

      Economic Development Element
      BUSINESS RETENTION AND EXPANSION
      Successful economic develop organizations allocate a substantial portion of
      their resources to activities commonly referred to as businesses retention
      and expansion. Why? Keeping an existing job from moving away is easier
      and more cost-effective than attracting a new job. More jobs are created
      through expansions than through attracting new businesses. In addition, a
      new business considering El Monte will talk to existing businesses first, so
      the City must have a good reputation with its existing business community.
      Although this element places emphasis on attracting new businesses in
      strategic areas, successful business attraction is built on the pedestal of
      successful business retention and expansion. Without the groundwork
      developed through serving existing businesses, the City will find itself
      competing for businesses on price and incentives rather than on the
      sustainable basis of El Monte being a good business location. This element
      thus places business retention and expansion as the City’s primary set of
      activities and programs to enhance and expand the local economy.
      Business Visitation
      How do cities know how their businesses are doing? They ask them. How
      do cities know which businesses need help? They ask them. It is that
      simple. Typically, most business managers are too busy running their
      businesses to show up at informational workshops and public meetings. We
      can wish it were different, but that is the way it is. If a local government
      wants to know how to help its businesses operate more efficiently, be more
      profitable, invest in the local community, and hire more workers, it usually
      has to visit its businesses and talk face-to-face with local management.
      El Monte’s economic development manager will have to establish and
      implement a regular visitation program. The visitation program helps the
      economic development manager build professional, working relationships
      with local business managers and operators. Successful economic
      development practitioners easily and effectively establish personal
      relationships. Through the trust and goodwill created by these working
      relationships, business managers can let local government know when there
      are problems and when businesses need help. The alternative is to read
      about it in the Los Angeles Times after a business relocates.
      Doing the City’s Part
      To promote economic development, the City must continue to do its part.
      First, the City regulates land uses through its zoning ordinance and specific
      plans. In many communities, setbacks in older industrial areas, strict
ED-14 El Monte General Plan

variance requirements, antiquated lists of uses, and conditional use permit
requirements plague existing businesses wishing to expand. The City needs
to review its land use requirements to minimize unnecessary regulatory
impediments to business expansion. The City should, however, keep its
focus on policies and not projects. The City should establish clear zoning
policies for older industrial areas, and apply them equally rather than trying
to help one individual business get around a problem policy.
Secondly, cities provide infrastructure services. The City must regularly
review its plans for the buildout of industrial and office areas. It must then
plan and construct projects to provide infrastructure sized for the ultimate
buildout of these employment areas. Although state and federal programs
can help finance infrastructure when a company wants to create new jobs,
most companies cannot wait for the federal government to approve a grant
application. By providing adequate infrastructure up front, the City will
encourage development of office and industrial property.
Finally, the City must keep its economic development planning up to date
through periodic updates to its strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats
analysis (SWOT) and insight gained through the visitation program. This
insight and the policies established through economic development
planning enable the City to continually improve the business reasons that
support an El Monte business location. By focusing on these business
reasons, the City can improve the fundamental economic drivers that, over
the long term, help create new jobs and attract new investment.
Partnering
The City’s economic development partners provide many of the services
and incentives that help existing businesses. Local business associations
provide one effective way for businesses to voice their concerns and needs
to City officials. The Workforce Investment Board, Rio Hondo Community
College, school districts, and job training providers all offer services to
existing businesses to help their current workers become more productive.
City business development partners help provide management training and
other services to assist local businesses. Other partners help local businesses
capitalize on opportunities such as export markets or federal contracting.
Partnering with these various organizations and agencies requires an active
role by the City. Where possible, the City should appoint the economic
development manager to represent the City on boards and committees of
these partners. Where the City does not have an official position, the
economic development manager should volunteer as an advisor when
possible. The City must be actively engaged in these organizations to voice
the needs of local businesses and to ensure El Monte gets its fair share of
                                                           El Monte General Plan ED-15

      Economic Development Element
      services. When providing funding or other official support to partnering
      organizations, the City should formalize its expectations with measurable
      outcomes, enabling the City to justify its contributions and seek
      improvements when outcomes are not met.
      Most important among these partners, workforce training and career
      counseling service providers operate at a regional scale. In part, the regional
      focus represents the requirements of underlying federal funding and the
      fact that most employees work outside of the City where they reside. At a
      regional scale, however, the needs and voices of smaller businesses often not
      heard. The City can play an important role, working individually or
      through its region partners, to make sure the needs of small local businesses
      are heard and answered by regional workforce training partners.
      City Assistance
      The City currently assists the business community through its community
      redevelopment agency, infrastructure, and other municipal services. The
      City can also provide direct financial incentives, such as gap financing.
      Businesses must provide up to 20 percent equity when financing an
      expansion and new equipment. Typically, though, firms have invested their
      resources to get new contracts or develop new products that generate the
      need for an expansion. The City can establish its own gap-financing
      program or work with others to form a cooperative program.
      At a secondary level, the City of El Monte can also provide economic
      development assistance by participating in state and federal programs. The
      state’s Enterprise Zone and the federal Empowerment Zone programs
      provide a variety of tax credits and other incentives to businesses that invest
      in these zones or hire residents from these zones. The California Recycling
      Market Development Zone provides incentives for businesses engaged in
      recycling. The City should continue to monitor its eligibility for these and
      other similar programs and seek inclusion when feasible.
      The General Plan calls for redevelopment and new development patterns
      that will require the relocation of existing businesses. Most businesses lack
      the resources and profit incentive to move operations. When businesses do
      relocate, there is no guarantee they will keep their operations in El Monte;
      they will weigh all the reasons supporting different possible locations and
      make the best business decision. To demonstrate the value that El Monte
      places on each business, the City should establish a mechanism to help
      finance the relocation of businesses that choose to remain in El Monte.
ED-16 El Monte General Plan

Goal ED-2
El Monte’s existing businesses will prosper, investing to expand their
facilities, creating new job opportunities for current and future residents, and
increasing the City’s revenues.
Policies
ED-2.1      Business Visitation. Establish and maintain an annual business
            visitation program and a system of communication with existing

            creation; measure performance in meeting targets.

      Economic Development Element
      BUSINESS ATTRACTION
      While business retention and expansion provides the majority of new jobs,
      business attraction serves important roles. First, bringing new businesses to
      the community can help diversify the local economy and protect it against
      shocks affecting individual economic sectors. Second, realizing the City’s
      vision for areas like Flair Park requires attracting new businesses. Finally,
      the publicity generated by the arrival of a new businesses helps build the
      City’s image as a progressive and dynamic community.
      Types of Businesses
      Fundamental economic development practice divides the world of
      businesses into two types, base and nonbase. Firms in base economic
      sectors sell a preponderance of their goods and services outside of the
      region. Theses businesses bring new dollars into the community and,
      through wages paid to their employees, generate new consumer spending to
      support the community’s nonbase businesses. In contrast, nonbase
      businesses primarily sell goods and services to those living in the region.
      These businesses recirculate dollars that are already within the region.
      Because cities have limited resources to devote to economic development,
      economic development programs focus on base-sector businesses. Bringing
      new dollars into the city, these programs indirectly benefit the nonbase
      businesses. Following conventional economic development practice
      suggests that the City focus its attraction efforts on manufacturing—not
      warehousing and distribution—in the Northwest Industrial District and on
      Pacific Rim trade and finance in Flair Park. Although conventional wisdom
      suggests the City minimize use of its economic resources for enhancing
      retail activity, the City’s fiscal condition suggests the need for immediate
      efforts to augment sales tax revenues by attracting new auto dealers.
      Finally, when evaluating different types of business opportunities to attract
      to the community, the City must remain committed to its General Plan
      vision. The Land Use Element has specified the vision for each of the focus
      areas in the community. This vision reflects countless hours spent with
      stakeholders, business community, and the Chamber. Undoubtedly, many
      businesses may choose El Monte for other reasons—cheap land, cash
      incentives, low operating costs, etc.—that provide short-term profit
      maximization reasons for being in El Monte, yet may be contrary to the
      City’s long-term vision.
ED-18 El Monte General Plan

Business Attraction Targets
As the City establishes its economic development program, the new
economic development manager will oversee the preparation of a business-
attraction-target study. This is a fundamental step that will enable the City
to attract businesses that add well-paying manufacturing and professional
jobs, diversify the retail base, attract Pacific Rim trade and finance, are
conducive to surrounding residential neighborhoods, expand the revenue
base needed to ensure the long-term fiscal stability of the City, and achieve
the long-term vision of the City of El Monte.
The business-attraction-target study should be based on periodic SWOT
analysis and interviews of El Monte’s businesses to learn what makes the
City a good business location and what makes it difficult. Building on the
SWOT analysis, the second step will be to determine what economic
clusters have formed in El Monte and in the San Gabriel Valley, identifying
shared resources that make the City and the area a good business location
for firms in these sectors. The City’s business-attraction-target study can
then focus on these clusters and shared resources.
Creating the Environment
Businesses will choose El Monte for business reasons. They will look at the     Creating the Environment
City’s environment. Does it have access to the desired local or regional
markets? If so, does it have the appropriate infrastructure, sized to           Please refer to the Land Use,
accommodate business? Are the City’s land use, zoning, and permitting           Community Design, Parks and
processes conducive to choosing an El Monte business location? Are              Recreation, and Public Safety
employees with the right mix of education and job skills in proximity to the    Elements for a detailed list of
business? These and other questions are foremost in the mind of businesses      infrastructure and environmental
when they evaluate relocation decisions. El Monte must be aware of these        improvements intended to
business needs as well.                                                         enhance El Monte as a good
                                                                                business location.
Many factors that businesses consider in making relocation decisions are
beyond the control of the City; nonetheless, El Monte does have control
over the quality of its physical environment. The City can plan and build
the infrastructure and fund the municipal services needed for strong
economic development. In their absence, El Monte’s (and any city) business
attraction strategy is reduced to providing financial incentives or waiving
development regulations. This brings in businesses only because they are
not required to meet prudent land use and development standards.
Limited Incentives
The use of financial incentives to lure new businesses has become—for
better or worse—an expected practice in many cities. Developers and
individual businesses often ask for financial concessions, claiming projects
                                                          El Monte General Plan                                 ED-19

      Economic Development Element
      will not “pencil out” without them. In reality, the issues may be outdated
      development codes, uncertain permitting processes, or other factors. Once
      the City focuses on improving the business reasons for choosing an El
      Monte location, few businesses will seek concessions. Those that do are
      probably not strong businesses that can sustain the City’s economy.
      The City will implement a policy for financial incentives to assure equity in
      their use and accountability in specific returns on investment. Generally,
      regulatory and financial incentives will only be offered to firms in economic
      sectors defined as primary business attraction targets. The level of incentive
      will reflect the expected return on investment. Recipients will be
      contractually obligated to provide the appropriate returns on investment—a
      number of jobs or level of private investment. Finally, the City should offer
      new businesses no incentive that is not available to existing businesses.
      Communicating
      After preparing a business-attraction-target strategy, the City will
      implement a marketing strategy that communicates the value of an El
      Monte business location to firms in target sectors. The strategy will include
      provision to make key economic development information available on the
      City’s Web site and the Chamber of Commerce. The specific firms
      necessary to communicate the City’s messages will become clear once the
      business-attraction-target study has identified target industries and/or
      businesses. Finally, the strategy should enable the economic development
      manager to strengthen the City’s ties to commercial and industrial real
      estate brokers.
      Partnering
      The City will identify and forge relationships with new partners that can
      assist in attracting the desired type of businesses to El Monte. In some
      cases, this will include specific industry or trade associations, while in
      others this might be new regional economic partnerships. Forging
      partnerships with international trade associations may also be required. As
      new industries relocate to El Monte, the City may also establish new
      partnerships with these businesses. The workforce needs of these businesses
      can then be communicated to the Workforce Investment Board, Rio Hondo
      Community College, school districts, and job training programs.

Goal ED-3
An improved El Monte business environment that attracts new businesses,
investment, new jobs, and increased revenues to El Monte.
Policies
ED-3.1   Business-Attraction-Target Strategy. Prepare and keep up to

                                                          El Monte General Plan ED-21

      Economic Development Element
      BUSINESS CREATION
      Of the three avenues for expanding the local economy, business creation
      creates the fewest new jobs and investment, yet does provide value to the
      community. In today’s global economy, the owners of the larger businesses
      in El Monte—the ones reaping the profits—likely do not live in El Monte.
      Indeed, their stockholders could conceivably live anywhere in the world. In
      contrast, efforts to create new businesses will directly target the residents of
      El Monte. Second, residents who start a new business not only bring new
      income to El Monte, but, more importantly, create new wealth in El Monte
      that often is invested locally. Finally, new business leaders have twice the
      reason to get involved in the management of their community.
      Creating New Business
      Many new businesses do not last for more than two years. However, new
      businesses that receive proper training have a higher success rate. Training
      needs can include loan financing and management, cash flow management,
      employee relations and support, and business practices and accounting.
      Typically, the local small business development center provides training
      programs for entrepreneurs. This training includes preparing a business
      plan, marketing and accounting, and obtaining start-up financing.
      For El Monte residents, the small business development center at Mt. San
      Antonio College provides these types of business assistance and training.
      The City’s role is to help publicize the available training and assistance to
      El Monte’s residents and small business owners. The City economic
      development manager should be involved with the management and
      operation of the small business development center, assuring representation
      of El Monte’s needs. The City of El Monte also is home to a corporate
      training center at the Pacific Place, sponsored by Rio Hondo College.
      Business Incubators
      Business incubators can be an economic development initiative. Incubators
      typically provide below-market-rate space, common fee-based services (e.g.
      conference rooms, receptionists), and business management advice (often
      through the local small business development center or organizations like
      SCORE—Service Corps of Retired Executives). Traditionally, business
      incubators assist nonretail business, once again focusing on bringing new
      dollars into the community rather than just circulating existing dollars.
      The Northwest Industrial District offers a good opportunity for the
      development of an incubator focusing on industrial and manufacturing
      businesses. With the development of new small-scale condo and flex space,
ED-22 El Monte General Plan

grant monies might help secure square footage for an incubator. Although
Flair Park is aimed at Pacific Rim trade and finance, the types of
supporting businesses that will locate there will make it an effective
location for a business incubator for any type of office-based business.
Finally, Main Street and the downtown area provide a good venue for
retailers and thus would be a good location for a retail business incubator.
Local Policies
Given the cost of starting a new business, many businesses start at home. As
this business sector continues to grow in economic importance, the City
should expect an increasing number of residents to pursue home-based
businesses. The City should review the effectiveness of its existing home-
based business zoning regulations, balancing the desire to promote
economic development and wealth generation with the need to maintain
residential neighborhoods. The City should also monitor the availability
and costs for business space for small start-up businesses. The City should
review its development regulations to minimize undue regulations that
limit the availability of business space for small start-ups.
Goal ED-4
An improved El Monte business environment that fosters opportunities for
new businesses, expands job opportunities, and increases City revenues.
Policies
ED-4.1     Partnerships. Work with the City’s business development and
           educational partners, and publicize the assistance and training
           available to El Monte residents to start up and grow businesses.
ED 4.2     Chamber of Commerce. Work with the Chamber of Commerce
           to identify and address challenges to small and start-up
           businesses operating in El Monte.
ED-4.3     Business Locations. Plan sufficient land area to accommodate
           new businesses; use the City’s planning and zoning authority to
           eliminate locations that handicap the viability of new businesses;
           ensure that local land use regulations encourage business start-
           ups.
ED-4.4     Business Incubator. Support the establishment and operations of
           an industrial and manufacturing incubator in the Northwest
           Industrial District, an office-based incubator in Flair Park, and a
           retail incubator downtown.

      Economic Development Element
      DOWNTOWN EL MONTE
      The General Plan visions the downtown as the mixed-use, mixed-income,
      cultural heart of El Monte built around five subdistricts: Government
      Center, Cultural Center, Downtown Residential, El Monte Gateway, and
      Main Street. Within this context, the Economic Development Element
      focuses on increasing economic activity and new private investment in the
      city. This section provides guidance and direction for supporting and
      attracting the businesses that populate three retail nodes.
      Types of Retailing
      Creating a vibrant retail experience requires an understanding of consumer
      needs. For the largest part of consumer spending, convenience is the name
      of the game. Customers want to get in, get what they need, and get out
      quickly. Strip commercial centers exist because they have optimized
      convenience. They are most profitable when anchored by a major retailer,
      since shoppers at the major retailer will spill over and patronize smaller
      retailers located in the same center.
      Another large part of consumer spending is comparison-goods shopping.
      For larger, more expensive, less common purchases (e.g., furniture),
      consumers want to compare a potential purchase across several brands.
      Retailers that can amass many brands compete very well for consumer
      spending in this category. Comparison shopping typically leads to big-box
      retailers or the agglomeration of retailers near freeways and major arterials
      that provide access to a larger number of potential customers.
      The third largest portion of consumer spending follows the social and
      experiential aspects of shopping. These shopping trips provide social
      interaction and pleasurable experiences of shopping as the primary purpose
      rather than the particular good or service purchased. Areas that provide for
      socialization, entertainment, and pleasant shopping experience compete
      well for this type of consumer spending. This shopping experience is often
      provided by traditional outdoor main street malls.
      Plan for Retailing
      The General Plan visions the Downtown Core as a destination whose
      retailers attract customers from throughout the San Gabriel Valley. To plan
      for the downtown, the City needs to understand the most appropriate role
      for Main Street El Monte, El Monte Gateway, and Santa Fe Trail Plaza.
      Each should be developed to focus on its particular niche so as not to dilute
      the cross-selling potential of the other areas. The City should play an active
      role in coordinating the business and economic development of each area.
ED-24 El Monte General Plan
   Santa Fe Trail Plaza. The Santa Fe Trail Plaza starts with the
    expansion of an existing auto-dependent convenience center that
    provides easy-in/easy-out service. This area should be developed to
    capitalize on the convenience niche in the downtown area. However,
    the city may wish to provide linkages to Main Street El Monte to allow
    for cross-selling as well.
   El Monte Gateway. This project is visioned as providing a relaxed
    socializing, entertainment, and retail experience for a more affluent and
    upscale clientele than presently attracted to Downtown El Monte. To
    distinguish this area from Main Street and to avoid diluting cross-
    selling potential, this area should focus on an affluent, upscale clientele.
   Main Street El Monte. Main Street El Monte provides a hybrid retail
    experience, with some convenience and comparison shopping but little
    entertainment. Its layout and design, however, are most conducive to a
    socializing and entertainment retail experience. Main Street’s retailers
    primarily serve the local trade area, but the area has the potential to
    attract consumers from a much larger, regional trade area.
The nonretail subareas are relatively built out and do not represent a
significant opportunity to attract new private investment. However, these
areas provide a substantial number of stable health-care, education, and
government jobs. These jobs provide an opportunity to capitalize on
daytime spending to support and enhance the prospects of retail businesses.
Thus, the City should work with the above sectors to strengthen them and
link them to the purchasing power of employees working in these sectors.
Plan for Main Street El Monte
Transforming Main Street El Monte into a retail destination requires
careful planning. The City should conduct regular market studies to
identify gaps in the retail mix, formulate strategies to capitalize on the
regional trade area’s lifestyle segments, and attract retailers with a broad
regional appeal. Main Street, like many downtowns, can offer an authentic
retail and social experience that will compete very well for socializing and
entertainment retail spending. The City should work with the downtown
business association to help them understand the benefits of creating a
warm, welcoming social experience for shoppers, and then create a business
improvement district to fund improvements that maximize the shopping
experience and the economic success of each downtown business.
                                                           El Monte General Plan ED-25

      Economic Development Element
      Creating the Physical Environment
      Creating a vibrant downtown experience will require significant design,
      infrastructure, and environmental improvements. The Land Use Element
      and Community Design Element establish the following strategies to
      achieve the economic planning objectives for the downtown:
         District Identity. Distinguish El Monte downtown in its character,
          physical appearance, and role through specialized design treatments
          (public art, cultural resources, circulation, architectural guidelines,
          etc.), as defined by a Downtown Specific Plan.
         Transportation. Establish a stronger link between the cultural center,
          Main Street, El Monte Gateway Project, governmental, and
          surrounding neighborhoods by incorporating unifying streetscapes and
          walkways through a comprehensive streetscape improvement plan.
         Land Use. Accommodate retail commercial, office, restaurant,
          entertainment, civic, cultural, educational, health care, and residential
          land uses in accordance with the Land Use Plan’s designations and
          subdistrict boundaries, which may be more defined by a specific plan.
         Design Treatment. Create a warm, welcoming social experience for
          shoppers. Public spaces, outdoor cafes, generous placement of street
          furniture, and special events all improve the social experience. Also,
          support improvement of commercial and residential properties.
         Emerald Necklace. Improve the Rio Hondo River through the
          Downtown with linear parks, gateways, walkways, and native plants,
          and link pedestrian access with the downtown to create a vibrant and
          well-traveled path and riverfront experience.
      Getting the Word Out
      Shopping centers get free publicity by locating next to busy arterials.
      Shopping mall owners advertise their malls. Main Street El Monte, like
      other downtowns, must also get the word out to the shopping public.
      Downtown associations and cities often host a series of special events each
      year to attract visitors to the downtown, exposing them to the quality of the
      place and the variety of retailers. Communities typically devote a large
      share of resources to a single event—the signature event that, over time,
      helps define the public image of the community. The City should work
      with the downtown business association to host events and create a
      signature event. These events are a key tool for attracting consumer
      spending from a larger, regional trade area. The City should also develop a
      marketing and public relations campaign for Main Street El Monte.
ED-26 El Monte General Plan

Goal ED-5
Expanding businesses and new businesses will invest in the continued
development and improvement of Main Street El Monte, creating a thriving
central place that defines the popular image of El Monte.
Policies
ED-5.1    Retail Sales. Prepare and keep up-to-date market studies for the
          downtown to identify gaps in the retail mix and distinguish the
          retail mix along Main Street from the Santa Fe and El Monte
          Gateway Project; market Main Street to targeted retailers.
             Focus the Santa Fe Trail Plaza project area on auto-using
              convenience retail shopping.
             Focus the El Monte Gateway area on a socializing and
              entertaining retail experience targeted to affluent clientele.
             Focus Main Street El Monte on a socializing and entertaining
              retail experience targeted to the regional trade area.
ED-5.2    Business Retention. Strengthen the existing professional
          business sectors of the downtown:
             Retain and strengthen the governmental/civic employment
              sector (city, state, and regional) presence in the downtown.
             Strengthen and build the growing healthcare sector,
              benefiting from senior housing, community care facilities,
              and other medical facilities in the downtown.
             Retain and strengthen the educational sector (Adult School,
              Rio Hondo College, local school districts, etc.).
ED-5.3    Physical Environment. Create an attractive downtown business
          environment by implementing the land use, design, and
          environmental strategic actions set forth in the Land Use,
          Community Design, Housing, and Parks/Recreation Elements.
             For Main Street, create a welcoming social environment with
              public spaces, outdoor cafes, generous placement of street
              furniture, and special events.
             Link together the civic center, cultural center, and downtown
              residential subdistricts with the retail centers to leverage
              purchasing power of residents and workforce.
             Introduce mixed-use housing to generate both daytime and
              nighttime spending supportive of retail.

                 bring private investment and retail sales into Downtown.
      ED-5.5     Marketing Downtown. Work with the City’s civic organizations
                 and Downtown El Monte business association to host special
                 events and market Main Street El Monte to trade area residents.
      ED-5.6     Signature Event. Develop and implement an annual signature
                 event; work with the City’s business association partners and
                 civic groups to host and market the signature event; invest in
                 growing the signature event into a regional attraction.

FLAIR PARK
The Southland’s headquarters for Pacific Rim finance and trade—this is
the Flair Park of tomorrow. From its historic origins as home to Fletcher
Aviation, airstrip and world war industrial base, the Park has broadened
into a manufacturing, industrial, and small office center. As Flair Park
matures, it has begun to emerge as a center of international finance and
commerce in the San Gabriel Valley, capitalizing on the strategic link to
Pacific Rim business and key location.
Despite the current economic uncertainty, Pacific Rim finance and trade
will continue their economic growth over the long term. Flair Park offers
an unparalleled office location between downtown Los Angeles and
Ontario, with lengthy visibility from the I-10, and an easy commute for a
large, skilled, and educated labor force. El Monte’s cultural heritage as the
destination of Santa Fe Trail migrants and its mix of ethnic groups makes
the community a natural fit for international finance and trade firms.
Types of Businesses
Flair Park is presently anchored by major employers that include Wells
Fargo, Cathay Bank, East-West Bank, the Chinese Cultural Center, and Los
Angeles County government offices. Although the City of El Monte
welcomes all businesses that do not detract from the long-term vision for
the area, the City’s economic development efforts, marketing, and business
attraction programs should focus on the primary targets—the offices for
firms engaged in international trade and finance.
A premium finance district will require a mix of businesses that support a
Class A working environment and international finance and trade. To that
end, the City of El Monte should interview representative firms in the
target sectors to determine the types of supporting businesses that would
add value to a Flair Park business location and recruit those businesses.
These might include language training or translation services, hospitality
services for corporate centers, convention centers, or other uses.
Most of the businesses currently located in Flair Park are not engaged in
international trade and finance. Achieving the vision requires attracting
new business to Flair Park. Policies will promote economic development
that makes Flair a competitive location for firms in these sectors. To
successfully attract new businesses requires making Flair Park a good
business location. The City can only build this transformation on a
foundation of good business retention and expansion.
                                                         El Monte General Plan ED-29

      Economic Development Element
      Plan for Businesses
      The public will identify Flair Park by the agglomeration of mid- and high-
      rise office buildings fronting I-10, adorned with the image-defining logos of
      the area’s most prominent corporate residents. The City visions tall office
      buildings as the primary focal point, defining the image of Flair Park. To
      help make this happen, the City needs to provide the appropriate market-
      based planning and regulatory environment that incites the desired type
      and pattern of development.
      The City will adopt a specific plan that identifies the final development
      pattern, encourages lot consolidation and redevelopment, and minimizes
      discretionary regulatory actions for office buildings, hospitality uses, and
      other desired land uses within the appropriate subdistricts. While allowing
      for economically viable use of parcels in the Flair Park, the plan will
      prohibit larger investments that do not achieve the vision (e.g., low-rise
      buildings or manufacturing uses in finance row). The specific plan will
      provide the framework and certainty needed for developers and the City.
      In implementing the specific plan, some existing businesses may not
      further the long-term vision of the district. In these cases, the City should
      demonstrate its value for existing businesses by establishing a funding
      program to relocate such businesses to other areas in the City. Meanwhile,
      as property values in Flair Park escalate with adoption of the plan, property
      owners stand to gain windfall profits. It is only fair for the property owners
      to help fund the improvements that will bring demand for office space. The
      City should establish a property-based business improvement district to
      help fund redevelopment and revitalization efforts.
      Creating the Physical Environment
      Business locations that provide the highest quality workplaces will attract
      the desired development, best companies, and a talented workforce.
      Corporations will seek a professional office park that is in close proximity to
      workforce and markets and that contains a wealth of amenities, welcomes
      business, and reflects a high-profile corporate image. The Land Use
      Element and Community Design Element thus establish specific strategies
      to achieve this working environment, including:
          Transportation. Improve transportation through addressing freeway
           egress and access, improving internal circulation within Flair Park, and
           developing an integrated pedestrian trail plan to serve employees.
          Emerald Necklace. Green the San Gabriel River through Emerald
           Necklace projects, including linear parks, bicycle trails, walking paths,
           and green infrastructure within Flair Park.
ED-30 El Monte General Plan

    Parks and Trails. Create a signature central park(s) connected to a
     series of smaller parks, trails, and pedestrian paths that link the various
     subdistricts of Flair Park and denote a Class A office park.
    District Identity. Foster a distinct identity for Flair Park through the
     designation of subdistricts and improvement of these areas with
     specialized design treatments that reinforce the Park’s identity.
    Environmental Cleanup. Accelerate the cleanup of the Superfund site
     and any remaining brownfields to reduce developer uncertainty and
     risk, and improve the appearance of the Park.
    Quality Architecture. Develop high architectural and design standards,
     including an iconic skyline that is visible along I-10 and the entire San
     Gabriel Valley.
It is well recognized that vibrant places require both a daytime and
nighttime population. Without a nighttime population, business parks
become nighttime and weekend ghost towns. Therefore, the specific plan
policies will promote residential, retail, and entertainment uses to
complement the network of mid- and high-rise office buildings, making
Flair a vibrant and enviable office location that can command the rents to
support mid- and high-rise office development. The specific plan should
thus support a mix of uses, including hospitality, retail, entertainment, as
well as consider the potential for residential uses.
Selling Flair
The City of El Monte has set forth a compelling vision for Flair Park: an
iconic skyline along I-10, adorned with the logos of the area’s most
prominent corporate residents. The City must now create a brand image
that fits the vision. The City must adopt a marketing communications
strategy to convey to office brokers and site-selection consultants the value
of a Flair Park location for businesses engaged in international finance and
trade and other key niche markets. The City can create a marketing
communications plan as part of or separate from the specific plan
development process. It must, however, coordinate the two projects.

      Economic Development Element
      Goal ED-6
      Southern California’s leading firms engaged in international trade and
      finance will locate major corporate operations in Flair Park.
      Policies

                 trade and finance to identify their business needs and location
                 criteria; at Flair Park, address the locational needs of these firms
                 to create a competitive business location.
      ED-6.2     Financing. Create a property-based business improvement

      ED-6.3     Specific Plan. Adopt a specific plan to implement the vision of
                 Flair Park and guide the visioned development in concert with
                 the Land Use and Community Design Elements.
      ED-6.4     Land Use Regulation. Revise land use regulations as necessary to
                 minimize discretionary regulatory actions for speculative mid-
                 and high-rise office development and office-based businesses in
                 Flair Park; prohibit larger development investments that are
                 inconsistent with or do not further the vision for Flair Park.
      ED-6.5     Business Environment. Make infrastructure, streetscape, design,
                 and parks improvements to Flair Park, as specified in the Land
                 Use, Community Design, and Parks and Recreation Elements, to
                 support business reasons for locating and expanding in El Monte.
      ED-6.6     Business Relocation. Establish, fund, and maintain a program to
                 assist the relocation of businesses that are inappropriate for or do
                 not want to remain in the future Flair Park to appropriate areas
                 based on the land use plan.
      ED-6.7     Branding and Marketing. Create and implement a brand image
                 for Flair and marketing communications plan to communicate

      ED-6.8     Partnerships. Work with City economic development marketing
                 partners, including the Flair Park Association, to market Flair
                 Park to target businesses.
ED-32 El Monte General Plan

NORTHWEST INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
The industrial engine for El Monte, promoting growth of existing firms and
attracting new manufacturing firms in a well-managed, quality working
environment, and a modern industrial park that is compatible with
surrounding residential neighborhoods—this is the future of the Northwest
Industrial District. Though market demand for different land uses varies
over time, the General Plan is committed to capitalizing on this area’s
traditional land use pattern to continue creating job opportunities.
Manufacturing jobs traditionally provided a route to middle-class lifestyle.
In recent decades, automation, increased productivity, and global
competition have reduced manufacturing jobs. Historically low industrial
vacancy rates, increasing land values, and conversion to nonindustrial uses
have driven manufacturers out of the San Gabriel Valley. Nonetheless, El
Monte’s central location, transportation network, and access to a large labor
force make the City a good location for firms serving regional markets.
Types of Businesses
The Northwest Industrial District’s economic vision is focused on creating
new jobs through expansion of existing business and attraction of new
business. Although the City welcomes the opportunity to assist existing
wholesale, warehousing, and distribution uses to expand and create new
jobs, the General Plan intent is to attract new light manufacturing uses
because they are more compatible with adjacent residential neighborhoods
and produce twice as many jobs as warehousing and distribution.
As part of establishing a formal economic development program, the City
will develop a business-attraction-target study. Prior to completing that
study, the City can focus on sectors identified by the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corporation as strong competitors in the regional economy.
Building on the presence of Vons, the City should consider food products
manufacturing. Finally, the City should consider directly marketing to the
desired type of manufacturing firms in surrounding cities where the land is
being converted to residential and mixed-use developments.
The City should interview existing manufacturers to understand the unique
needs of these local businesses. Typically, manufacturers have benefitted
from active local and regional workforce training programs. Existing
manufacturers, however, can identify the specific benefits and challenges of
operating in the Northwest Industrial District. The City can then address
these challenges to improve the value of this El Monte business location.
                                                          El Monte General Plan ED-33

      Economic Development Element
      Plan for Businesses
      The Northwest Industrial District is already fully developed, yet has
      significant infrastructure needs: rehabilitation and resizing of sewer, water,
      and drainage infrastructure are required; roadways need rehabilitation, and
      in some cases extension or reconfiguration; and Superfund cleanup and
      brownfield remediation are required. The Northwest Industrial District
      could benefit from a Master EIR and master plans for water, sewer,
      drainage, and transportation so that cumulative impacts can be identified,
      addressed in capital improvement plans, and fees assessed.
      Beyond ensuring that infrastructure is suitable and environmental cleanup
      efforts are underway, the City can provide economic development assistance
      to attract businesses to the Northwest Industrial District. The California
      Enterprise Zone and the federal Empowerment Zone programs provide a
      variety of tax credits and other incentives to businesses that invest in
      designated zones or hire residents from these zones. The California
      Recycling Market Development Zone provides incentives for businesses
      engaged in recycling. The City should continue to monitor its eligibility for
      these and similar programs and seek inclusion when feasible.
      Creating the Physical Environment
      Creating a modern industrial park will require significant infrastructure
      and environmental improvements. The Land Use Element and Community
      Design Element establish the following strategies to achieve the economic,
      environmental, and other planning objectives of the District:
         Transportation. Improve transportation through addressing freeway
          egress and access at Baldwin, completing the Baldwin Avenue grade
          crossing, and improving internal circulation within the District.
         Emerald Necklace. Green the San Gabriel River through Emerald
          Necklace projects, including linear parks, bicycle trails, and walking
          paths, and green infrastructure within Flair Park.
         Superfund Site/Brownfields. Clean up the Superfund site and address
          brownfield remediation of industrial sites to reduce their liability and
          secure future private investments in the District.
         District Design. Create a distinct image of a modern industrial park
          through streetscape improvements, parks, landscaping, and state-of-the-
          art industrial building and site designs.
         Infrastructure. Create comprehensive master plans and integrated
          environmental documentation for needed sewer, water, drainage,
          transportation, and other infrastructure improvements.
ED-34 El Monte General Plan

Selling the Northwest Industrial District
The City should work with its economic development partners, especially
the San Gabriel Valley Economic Partnership and the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corporation, to actively market the area to
potential new businesses. The City should also develop ties to industrial
real estate brokers to help market the area. Finally, new businesses
considering an El Monte location will talk to existing business. The City
must maintain good working relationships with existing businesses to earn
a reputation for being responsive—a message that is also communicated
and reinforced to prospective business by its marketing partners.
Goal ED-7
An improved El Monte business environment that promotes growth of
manufacturing firms, creates well-paid jobs, and offers opportunities for
business relocation and expansion in the Northwest Industrial District.
Policies
ED-7.1    Business Expansion and Attraction. Support the expansion of
          existing conforming businesses and the attraction of new
          manufacturing businesses to the Northwest Industrial District.
ED-7.2    Business Visitation. Implement a business visitation program;
          identify strengths and weaknesses of a Northwest Industrial
          District business location based on input from business in the
          area.
ED-7.3    Land Use. Create, maintain, and administer appropriate land use
          and design regulations to facilitate business retention, expansion,
          and attraction goals.
ED-7.4    Marketing Efforts. Work with the City’s economic development
          marketing partners to market the Northwest Industrial District
          to the region’s existing and prospective manufacturers.
ED-7.5    Incentive Programs. Participate in state and national economic
          incentive programs that can lower costs for manufacturers in the
          Northwest Industrial District; offer incentives only to business
          attraction targets and only in exchange for performance targets.
ED-7.6    Infrastructure. Plan and provide sufficient infrastructure and
          municipal services to serve the full buildout of the Northwest
          Industrial District; encourage development that supports the
          City’s business expansion and business attraction targets.

      Economic Development Element
      EL MONTE AUTO DISTRICT
      The City has planned the El Monte Auto District to maintain and expand
      its role as Southern California’s preeminent place to buy a new car. While
      new car sales provide important municipal revenues, providing an excellent
      car-buying experience promotes overall economic development by
      improving the public image of El Monte.
      For most consumer spending, the City loses sales tax revenues to other
      jurisdictions. New car sales, however, attract significant spending from
      outside the City. The sales tax revenue that the City gains through new car
      sales exceeds the leakage for other consumer spending. Other nearby
      communities, however, are attracting auto dealers to sites along I-10. The
      increasing competition from other cities suggests that the City should begin
      its efforts to bolster the auto district sooner rather than later.
      Types of Business
      The City’s vision for the auto district focuses on dealerships for new cars,
      trucks, and recreational vehicles. The City also visions the district
      providing a range of ancillary services necessary to support the district’s
      primary role of selling new vehicles. Although the City has not yet
      elaborated a full list of appropriate ancillary services, these might include
      rental car agencies, auto parts, and after-market customization services. The
      vision does not include new or expanded used-car dealerships.
      In addition to new auto sales, the General Plan visions the auto district
      providing an auto show atmosphere and hosting several auto shows each
      year. Venues and businesses that support the auto show theme would also
      be appropriate for the auto district. Auto shows can include design
      competitions that will not only attract industry watchers and the press, but
      a significant portion of consumers interested in purchasing automobiles.
      The City could also sponsor a year-round showroom for the latest
      technology in automotive, truck, and recreational vehicle design.
      Plan for Businesses
      The City’s interest is to increase the sales of new cars, thereby increasing
      sales tax revenues for the City. Auto dealers have a clear, stake in selling
      more cars, too. However, too often businesses prefer to prevent increased
      competition, not always appreciating the economic value of agglomeration.
      When making major purchases, consumers prefer to shop around and
      compare different products from different manufacturers and different
      retailers. By increasing the number and variety of dealers, the City can
      improve the auto district’s overall appeal as a place to car-shop.
ED-36 El Monte General Plan

The City will partner with auto dealers to create a local business
association. Working with this association, the City will help market the El
Monte Auto District, creating a new brand and brand image for the district.
The City will also work with this association to better identify the types of
supporting services that would improve the district’s appeal and enhance
the El Monte car-buying experience. As appropriate, the City should revise
its land use regulations to promote these ancillary services and to phase out
services that detract from the new-car-buying experience.
Creating the Physical Environment
Creating the premier place to buy a car, truck, or recreational vehicle will
require significant design, infrastructure, and environmental
improvements. The Land Use Element and Community Design Element
establish the following strategies to achieve the economic, environmental,
and other planning objectives of the auto district:
    Transportation. Improve access by improving the intersections of
     Valley Boulevard, Durfee Road, and Garvey Avenue at Interstate 10,
     and improving wayfaring signage to address internal circulation issues.
    Land Use. Allow for flexibility in land use regulations that will
     facilitate on-site storage of vehicles and provide a working environment
     conducive to auto dealerships and supportive services.
    Design. Facilitate and encourage quality architecture and site design
     concepts to facilitate a modern and efficient auto district that is
     aesthetically compatible with surrounding neighborhoods.
Marketing
While the City will benefit from increased auto sales and the attraction of
new dealers, the existing dealers and landowners in the district have a stake
in the expansion and branding of the district. Each new dealer represents
increased local competition but also provides an increased draw, bringing
more potential buyers to the district. Because existing dealers and
landowners will benefit from the district’s growth, they should have a voice
in the district’s development.
El Monte will facilitate creation of an auto district business association,
represented by key auto dealerships, supporting services, and long-standing
businesses in the district. Working with this association and a regular
business visitation program, the City can help create a unique joint
marketing plan for the district. It can be as simple as signage to create a
unified brand image and a Web site presence. It could include common
brand images in each dealer’s paid advertising or a joint publicity
campaign. Finally, it could include a common paid advertising campaign.

      Economic Development Element
      Goal ED-8
      Existing auto sales and services firms will prosper and new firms will locate
      in the auto district, increasing sales tax revenues for the City.
      Policies
      ED-8.1     Business Associations. Work with existing auto dealerships and
                 ancillary businesses to create a formal business association for the
                 auto district; maintain a liaison with them.
      ED-8.2     Marketing Efforts. Work with the auto district business
                 association to brand and market the auto district to customers
                 throughout southern California.
      ED-8.3     Partnerships. Work with the City’s economic development

                 district to potential new auto retailers.
      ED-8.4     Supporting Land Uses. Identify, plan for, and attract ancillary
                 uses that support auto dealers and their customers and create a
                 premium car-buying and servicing experience.
      ED-8.5     Business Environment. Make needed infrastructure, streetscape,
                 design, parks, and recreational improvements to the auto district
                 specified in the Land Use and Community Design Elements to
                 support business reasons for locating and expanding in El Monte.
      ED-8.6     Land Regulations. Revise land use regulations to minimize or
                 eliminate discretionary regulatory actions for new-car retailers
                 and to preclude used-car dealers in the auto district.
      ED-8.7     Model Signage. Create model signage regulations to create a
                 unified image of the auto district, both from the freeway and
                 within the district itself.
      ED-8.8     Business Associations. Plan the district to enhance the customer
                 experience of buying a car and improve the public image of El
                 Monte to residents, businesses, and visitors.

8. Public Services and Facilities
   Element
   Introduction
   Vision El Monte… a safe City that provides residents, visitors, and
   businesses a safe and secure place to live, work, and play; a quality
   environment that offers clean water, clean air, and proper wastewater and
   stormwater practices; a City of exemplary community services, offering
   cultural, educational, and human service programs for residents; and a
   fiscally strong City, with proper investment in facilities and infrastructure.
   PROVIDING QUALITY SERVICES
   The Public Services and Facilities Element is about ensuring that adequate
   services—public safety, environmental services, community services, and
   infrastructure—are in place to support quality of life in El Monte. This
   Element’s overarching goals are to help El Monte:
      Ensure excellent public safety—providing police and fire safety services
       to the community.
      Create a healthy urban environment—providing healthful water,
       stormwater, and sewer management.
      Support a full range of public services—providing quality community
       services, recreation, education, and health programs for residents.
      Protect the City’s investments—implementing a regular program of
       capital improvements, maintenance, and repair of essential
       infrastructure.
      Engage the community—participating in the planning, design,
       implementation, and monitoring of programs and services.

                                     Public Services and Facilities Element
                                     PURPOSE OF ELEMENT
                                     The backbone of a community is its public services and facilities. In fact,
                                     quality of life is often dependent not only on schools, parks, libraries, and
                                     police and fire services, but also on physical infrastructure—circulation,
                                     water, sewers, flood control and drainage, and waste systems. Although
                                     these services are often taken for granted because they are not readily seen
                                     by the public, El Monte must proactively plan for their provision to meet
                                     the needs of its growing and changing population.
                                     The Public Services Element therefore covers five interrelated areas of
                                     public services and facilities. These include: 1) public safety programs; 2)
                                     environmental services; 3) infrastructure; 4) community, social, and health
                                     services; and 5) neighborhood improvement. Parks and recreation programs

                                     The Public Services and Facilities Element is related to other elements of
                                     the General Plan and to the City’s budgeting process. The need for
                                     infrastructure, community services, and public safety are determined by the
   Consolidated Plan                 location, type, and intensity of development in the Land Use Element. The

                                     Every year, the City adopts an annual budget that provides for the funding
                                     of a wide variety of programs and activities. The Public Services and

EL MONTE SPEAKS
The General Plan Vision calls for a “vibrant and safe community with a
high quality of life…where people can access community facilities…and
services.” The direct link between quality of life and quality of community
services is clear. And the Public Services and Facilities Element works to
achieve the General Plan vision by creating and maintaining quality public
services and facilities for residents, businesses, and visitors.
City outreach programs and community workshops helped identify what
residents and businesses regard as the most important ways to achieve the
City’s vision. These efforts, along with extensive interviews with City staff
and officials, reflect the consistent desire to accomplish the following:
   Public Safety. Continue to protect residents, businesses, and visitors to
    El Monte through the provision of exemplary and responsive police
    services, fire protection, and other public safety services to minimize
    personal injury or damage to property.
   Environmental Service. Continue to ensure that adequate water, sewer,
    solid waste, and other environmental service programs are implemented
    in compliance with state law and standards for exemplary public health.
   Infrastructure Investment. Protect the City’s financial investments in
    its water, sewer, roadways, parks and recreation, and other public
    facility infrastructure through sound fiscal management and proactive
    planning.
   Community Services. Develop responsive community service programs
    that meet the diverse needs of all segments of the community and
    support the development of high-quality schools, libraries, and
    community centers.
   Neighborhood Planning. Engage residents, businesses, and stakeholders
    in the planning of public services and facilities for the community and
    each neighborhood, setting of priorities, and implementation of
    programs.
In summary, a great community is one where the public sector, in
partnership with the private sector, provides the fullest range of public
services and facilities to serve residents, business, and visitors. Figure PSF-
1 shows the vital connections between these basic services and facilities and
the community they serve.

      Public Services and Facilities Element
      Public Services and Facilities Context
      Like aesthetics, public services and facilities can distinguish a community
      as a more desirable place to live. We often take for granted that police and
      fire services will respond in time of emergency; that our water is safe to
      drink; that refuse is disposed of and recycled in a safe manner; and that the
      stormwater system, sewers, and roadways continue to provide high levels of
      service. Though easy to overlook, the absence or deficiency of these basic
      community building blocks is an obstacle to a City’s growth and success.
      PUBLIC SERVICE COMPONENTS
      The following summarizes the key community building blocks discussed
      in this element. Please refer to other elements of the General Plan for
      additional discussions and programmatic initiatives.
      Police Safety
      El Monte considers
      public safety a top
      priority. The City’s
      commitment to providing
      safe     and      nurturing
      neighborhoods        begins
      with timely and effective
      response to emergencies.
      Through its community
      policing program, the
      police department is
      engaged        with      and
      responsive to our city.
      The Public Services and Facilities Element strives to continue El Monte’s
      tradition of putting people first and creating a safe environment. To that
      end, fundamental goals of this element are to:
          Ensure that public safety functions have the highest levels of facilities,
           staffing, and funding necessary to fulfill their mission.
          Provide exemplary levels of public service with the highest standards of
           professional care and excellence.
          Continue to work with youth and children to offer meaningful
           educational, cultural, vocational, and community service alternatives.

Fire Safety
The Los Angeles County
Fire Department provides
fire     prevention       and
suppression,      paramedic
response, and hazard
mitigation services. The
Red Cross and other
nonprofit organizations
feed, shelter, and connect
us to vital information
during disasters.
The Public Services and Facilities Element strives to continue El Monte’s
tradition of maintaining a fire-safe environment for residents, businesses,
and visitors. To that end, fundamental goals of this element are to:
    Ensure the safe handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of
     hazardous materials and wastes in El Monte.
    Provide the highest level of emergency medical service response
     according to state and national standards.
    Work in partnership with the community to keep residents, businesses,
     and visitors safe from fire and safety hazards.
Environmental Services
City provides a wide range of waste management services that are designed
to divert or recycle refuse before it enters the landfill, properly dispose of
hazardous waste and materials, and keep streets clean. Our stormwater
management programs help reduce pollution and clean contaminants that
may affect the groundwater. Meanwhile, working in partnership with other
water companies, our water system is designed to provide an adequate and
continuous supply of clean and healthful water. This requires a continued
commitment to exemplary environmental services, as evidenced by:
    Sensitivity to the importance of environmental management as an
     essential component of ensuring a high quality of life for El Monte.
    Continued investment in the physical infrastructure needed to provide       Tree-Planting Day
     water, waste management, and storm/wastewater management.                   Tree planting is just one of the many activities
                                                                                 El Monte residents participate in to improve
    Investment in technology, people, equipment, and facilities necessary to    our neighborhoods and environment.
     provide exemplary levels of community services.

                                              Infrastructure
                                              In many cities, one of the greatest unfunded liabilities is infrastructure.
                                              Infrastructure includes the roadways, sidewalks, water and sewer pipelines,
                                              public facilities (including parks), utilities, drainage facilities, lighting, and
                                              trees, among others. Jurisdictions must, through proactive capital planning
                                              and financing, ensure that sufficient infrastructure is in place, regularly
                                              maintained, and coordinated into capital improvement budgets.
                                              El Monte is committed to maintaining its financial investment in physical
                                              infrastructure. Fundamental goals are to:
                                                 Complete an inventory of water, sewer, and roadway infrastructure,
                                                  including streets, sidewalks, trees, and other appurtenances, and prepare
                                                  a five-year capital replacement plan.
                                                 Encourage the development of financing plans (e.g., user fees, benefit
                                                  assessments, etc.) and ensure that new development projects pay their

                                              Community Services
                                              Community services enhance quality of life by enriching individuals
                                              through educational, recreational, health, social service, and other family
                                              services. The provision of health and social services supports the needs of
                                              residents of all income levels. The Community Services Department is
                                              responsible for providing and coordinating a range of programs for
                                              residents of all ages. The County of Los Angeles also provides a wide range

what the Public Services and Facilities Element is all about. Each topic is
introduced with a summary of key planning information, followed by a goal
statement and policies to guide the implementation process. Appendix A

City’s commitment to maintaining a safe community for residents.
Crime Suppression
The police department’s
fundamental charge is to
provide a safe City for
residents, businesses, and
visitors      through      the
enforcement of laws. To that
end, the police department
enforces local, state, and
federal     laws,   performs
investigations and makes
arrests, and responds to all
City emergencies. The police
department’s main station is
located at 11333 Valley Boulevard. The police department also commands
an air-support unit office at El Monte Airport, where helicopter support is
provided to surrounding communities.

                                   Since     most      crimes        are
                                   committed by people less than
                                   25 years of age, effective crime
                                   prevention is essentially a
                                   youth-building effort. The
                                   police department works with
                                   schools, local businesses, and
                                   citizen groups to involve young

                                   service. The police department
                                   works with schools to prevent gang involvement through job placement,
                                   training, and counseling. The police department provides counseling to
                                   residents referred by local schools, court/probation officers, and

Traffic Control
The police traffic unit patrols more than 150 miles of roadways, enforcing
vehicular laws, providing pedestrian and bicycle safety education, enforcing
parking, and patrolling roadways to reduce speeding. The police
department staffs an interdepartmental traffic committee that periodically
tours the City to evaluate requests for traffic control enhancements (e.g.,
stop signs, red curbs, speed humps), meets with stakeholders and the
public, and recommend a wide variety of traffic-related safety
improvements, including sidewalks, traffic lights, crosswalks, and other
improvements.
School Safety
The police department actively supports its safe school programs and has 5
officers dedicated to El Monte public schools. Police school resource
officers conduct hundreds of home visits per year to resolve issues that may
extend from school back to a student’s home. Officers provide student
counseling and guidance, family counseling, mediation, and function as
liaisons between the police department and schools. In addition to teaching
classes on subject matter such as drugs, resource officers provide campus
safety and training for teachers and administrators, mentor students, and
participate in school activities and sports programs.
Special Emergency Response
The El Monte Police Department’s SWAT Team was formed in 1996.
SWAT was formed to provide protection to the El Monte public from
unforeseen and potentially violent incidents within the community. SWAT
also provides mutual aid to law enforcement agencies in the San Gabriel
Valley area. The mission of SWAT is to provide a quick response to
specialized emergency situations involving law enforcement public safety
incidents that require personnel, coordination, equipment and training
beyond the scope of regular patrol forces. SWAT is available if situations
require immediate resources or tactical personnel.
Park Safety
The El Monte Police Department routinely patrols parks and other public
places. The Emerald Necklace Safety and Security Task Force was created
in response to community-based research in El Monte, which identified
safety and security in park areas as the most pressing concern. The task
force leads river clean-up and homeless sweeps, where agencies connect
river dwellers to social service agencies. The task force also implements a
security plan to ensure safety and security along the river. This work allows
students safe and easy access to after-school recreational opportunities.

FIRE PROTECTION
Ensuring adequate fire protection saves lives, provides residents a sense of
security and safety, improves property values, and reduces insurance costs
for homeowners and the business community. Responding to fires and
emergencies as quickly as possible can minimize loss of life and property.
However, preventing fire incidents in the first place is the best strategy.
                                                                                 Fire Department

For purposes of underwriting fire insurance, communities are classified
with respect to their fire defenses, physical characteristics, and capability of
preventing and responding to fire. Additionally, the Insurance Service
Office (ISO) evaluates municipal fire protection efforts through a rating
scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the highest rating. The ISO rating consists of
three components—fire dispatch, fire department operations, and
sufficiency of water supply and infrastructure. The City maintains an ISO
rating of 3, which is typical for cities in the southern California area.
Fire Prevention
Fire prevention services focus on educating the community about the
benefits of safety practices and identifying and eliminating hazardous
conditions that pose a threat to life, the environment, and property. The
fire department conducts safety inspections and issues permits for major
plants that manufacture, use, and store hazardous materials and explosives.      Fire Services
The department also conducts annual fire/life safety inspections in all
                                                                                 El Monte is served by Los Angeles County

The Fire Prevention Section also has the responsibility of reviewing fire
safety plans for many businesses. The department performs nonstructural
fire safety plan review and approves architectural plans for various complex
occupancies; provides plan review service for all structures requiring an
automatic fire sprinkler system, fire pump, or on-site hydrants; and reviews
plans for all structures requiring a fire alarm or smoke management
systems. The department also provides a wide variety of public outreach
efforts designed to improve public awareness of fire prevention.

                                     close to business areas. The County Fire Department is responsible for
                                     administering the Hazardous Waste Generator Program, the Hazardous

                                     The department also permits and inspects businesses that handle, treat,
                                     transport, and dispose of hazardous wastes and provides 24-hour emergency
                                     response to hazardous materials incidents. The department administers and
                                     enforces the CalARP Program at high-risk facilities that handle regulated
                                     substances. CalARP staff review and approve risk management plans
                                     submitted by these businesses and conduct site inspections to verify
                                     compliance. The Site Mitigation Unit reviews and approves assessment and
                                     mitigation work plans for sites contaminated with hazardous substances.
                                     Emergency Services
                                     The fire department also conducts emergency medical service response.
                                     The City’s paramedic squad is stationed at Fire Station 166 on Santa Anita

                                     LACoFD does not have an officially adopted emergency response time
                                     standard, though fire staff have a policy to respond within five minutes,
                                     which is a recognized standard of the National Fire Protection Association.
                                     LACoFD also offers a community emergency response team program that

Stormwater
Water quality has special meaning for El Monte. The Rio Hondo and San
Gabriel River flood control channels surrounding El Monte are fed by six
washes that emanate from municipalities throughout the region. Rainwater
that flows down a gutter typically carries trash, litter, silt, automotive
chemicals, and other contaminants into the storm drain system. Storm
drains are designed to carry only stormwater, and typically are not equipped
with filters or systems to clean contaminants. Without these filters, the
contaminated water eventually flows into the ocean.
The regional water quality control board is responsible to implement the
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) goals to clean
up water resources by reducing the amount of stormwater runoff. Under the
NPDES Stormwater Permit issued to the County of Los Angeles and its co-
permittees (including El Monte), the City requires most new development
projects to incorporate best management practices to minimize pollutant
levels in runoff. The Public Works Department enforces NPDES
requirements adopted in the El Monte Municipal Code.
To reduce the amount and concentration of pollutants entering the rivers,
the City implements and continually refines its programs to reduce the total
maximum daily loads of contaminants that enter the channels. The City
maintains 233 storm drains and six underpass pumps on a regular basis.
These drains and catch basins are essential in alleviating flooding during
periods of heavy rains. The City of El Monte is also called on to assist in
cleaning up hazardous spills on City streets so that they do not enter the
storm drains or percolate into drinking water aquifers.
Wastewater
Wastewater collection facilities that serve the City are owned, operated, and
maintained by the City Public Works Department. The City maintains 125
miles of pipeline and seven pump stations. El Monte is one of 17
jurisdictions that are signatory to the Joint Outfall Agreement. The
agreement provides for a regional interconnected system of facilities and a
cooperative agreement to own, operate, and maintain facilities collectively.
The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County treat wastewater at the
Whittier Narrows Water Reclamation Plant, located south of the City, and
then recycle the water for irrigation and groundwater recharge.
As is the case with all physical infrastructure, wastewater lines deteriorate
over time and require periodic maintenance, repair, and replacement. In
order to prevent costly repairs, adequate maintenance is essential. The
City’s wastewater plan identifies approximately 25 miles of wastewater
mains that are in need of replacement, either due to inadequate size or
                                                          El Monte General Plan PSF-17

       deteriorated conditions. The City’s Environmental Service Division is
       responsible for performing periodic maintenance of City-owned sewer lines
       and drainage facilities. Wastewater line repairs and improvements are
       funded as part of annual capital improvement plans.
       Although state and federal law regulate treatment plants, power generation,
       potable water, and drainage systems, little has been done to regulate sewer
       collection systems. State law now requires all jurisdictions in California to
       develop and implement a sewer system management plan to maintain and
       improve wastewater collection systems, minimize infiltration and inflow
       from sewer lines, and provide adequate sewer capacity, while minimizing
       the number and impact of sanitary sewer overflows. The Environmental
       Services Division is responsible for developing and implementing the plan.

       Three major water companies supply the majority of water to El Monte.
       The City’s water system serves 20 percent of the City’s land area,
       comprising 3,342 connections that serve 22,446 residents. The San Gabriel
       Valley Water Company (SGVWC) is based in El Monte and provides water
       service to customers in El Monte. California American Water (Cal-Am)
       provides water service to 1,000 customers west of the Rio Hondo Channel,
       such as the Northwest Industrial District and Flair Business Park. Eight
       smaller mutual water companies serve the remainder of El Monte.
       The City is one of the only southern California cities almost completely
       surrounded by two rivers—the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel rivers. Before
       their conversion into concrete-lined channels as part of regional flood
       control projects, the City of El Monte’s habitat was lush riparian woodland.
       Today it is a large, mostly residential suburb that depends on groundwater
       supplies to meet its needs. In compliance with state and federal
       environmental laws, the City’s drinking water meets or surpasses all
       applicable health and safety requirements.
       Southern California’s frequent droughts underscore the importance of
       water conservation. Typically, conservation programs have focused on
       reducing the unnecessary use of water through drought-tolerant
       landscaping or the replacement of water-inefficient appliances. Cities are
       now employing more creative approaches. Although the costs of infra-
       structure are still prohibitive, the City could pursue the recycling of
       wastewater from the Whittier Narrows Area for irrigation purposes. Green
       infrastructure can also be installed to help replenish groundwater resources,
       minimizing the need to purchase water from other sources.

       Public Services and Facilities Element
       INFRASTRUCTURE
       Physical infrastructure, if not properly maintained and improved, can be
       one of the greatest liabilities facing communities. Furthermore, proper
       infrastructure management practices are the key to implementing the vision
       of the City and achieving fiscal stability. Infrastructure includes roadways,
       sidewalks, water and sewer pipelines, public facilities, utilities, drainage
       facilities, lighting, and trees. Through proactive capital planning and
       financing, El Monte must ensure that sufficient infrastructure is in place,
       regularly maintained, and coordinated into the budget processes.
       Infrastructure Planning
       Proper maintenance of infrastructure requires that programs be in place.
       The City should prepare and periodically update master plans for its water,
       sewer, and roadway infrastructure. The City prepares an urban water
       management plan, yet additional information must be known about the
       condition of the infrastructure and requirements for repair or replacement.
       State law will soon require all cities to prepare a sewer system management
       plan, and the City has completed its first comprehensive sewer inventory.
       The City operates a pavement management system that tracks the condition
       of pavement, replacement needs, and costs and timing for repair.
       Significant efforts need to continue in infrastructure planning. This includes
       the funding of a water, sewer, and drainage infrastructure master plan; a
       parks and recreation master plan that addresses actual needs and deferred
       maintenance at each park; a community forest master plan; and a public
       buildings master plan for the civic center, police department, and other
       public facilities. To implement the City’s vision for different areas of the
       community—Flair Park, Northwest Industrial District, corridors, and
       Greater Downtown—the City will also need infrastructure master plans.
       Once these plans are prepared, they must be integrated into a formal capital
       improvement plan so that annual budget allocations can be made and the
       public clearly understands the relationship of the improvements to the
       goals set forth in the City’s Vision. Finally, the City’s responsibilities not
       only pertain to its ability to construct new public facilities and
       infrastructure, they also include the responsibility to maintain
       infrastructure in good working order over time. Simply put, routine
       preventive maintenance is more cost-effective than asset replacement. For
       example, the cost of replacing one square foot of pavement is at least five
       times the cost of slurry sealing the same segment annually for seven years.
PSF-20 El Monte General Plan

Infrastructure Financing
Maintaining adequate funding requires that financial reserves be factored
into rate structures for services. El Monte is committed to maintaining an
operating reserve to provide working capital for operations and
maintenance costs, a rate stabilization reserve to guard against
unanticipated economic consequences, and a capital project reserve for
replacing or upgrading existing facilities. The optimal amount of financial
reserves will be maintained in accordance with the level of depreciation,
deferred maintenance, and replacement and recapitalization needs.
The City will need additional funds to invest in its infrastructure. The
Northwest Industrial District needs significant improvements to its
internal and external network of roadways and drainage systems. Upgrades
in water, sewer, and drainage infrastructure are needed to facilitate the
construction of the El Monte Gateway, a project that is critical to the
financial health of the City. According to the City’s sewer study, approxi-
mately 10 percent of all sewer lines may require replacement. Flair Park
also requires significant roadway improvements.
Financing mechanisms will need to be implemented to pay for the
incremental impacts of housing, commercial, and industrial development
and deferred maintenance that have accumulated over the past 30 years.
These include traffic mitigation fees, benefit assessments, grants and loans
from the federal government, redevelopment tax increment, bonds, and
even special taxes or general funds if needed. In other cases, the City may
need to update and monitor its development impact fees to ensure that they
are accurately tied to the cost of needed improvements.
The City has implemented several tools to finance infrastructure upgrades.
In 2007, a capital projects fund was established to being to fund
improvements to roadways, parks, public facilities, and other infrastructure.
In 2006, the City established a sewer enterprise fund to finance costs to
comply with State Water Resources Control Board mandates, and the
additional costs of maintaining and repairing the sewer system. The City
has also amended the Water Authority Enterprise Management Agreement
to provide a minimum level of $500,000 for capital improvements.
As El Monte develops, additional financial policies and programs will be
necessary to provide a modern and efficient infrastructure system that will
support the economic revitalization of the community and maintain it in
sound fiscal condition. This will include the development of adequate
operating reserves within individual enterprise funds, rate stabilization
reserves to guard against unknown contingencies, and other best
management practices. The following policies provide guidance for
continued reinvestment in El Monte’s public facilities and infrastructure.

       Well-managed network of infrastructure evidenced by rigorous capital
       improvement planning, preventive maintenance, and equitable financing.
       Policies
       PSF-4.1 Resources. Provide resources for technology (e.g., computerized
                  tracking systems), staffing, and other tools necessary to automate
                  and modernize the process of maintaining, monitoring, and
                  protecting the City’s investment in its infrastructure.
       PSF-4.2 Master Plans. Prepare comprehensive master plans for all major
                  infrastructure (e.g., roads, water, sewer, and public facilities) and
                  ensure that findings are explicitly tied into capital improvement
                  plans, the annual budgeting process, and the City’s Vision.
       PSF-4.3 Fair Share. Require development to pay the full cost of
                  improving water, wastewater, road, parks, or other infrastructure
                  necessitated by their projects, unless findings are made that the
                  fair share requirement should be waived due to overriding public
                  benefit.
       PSF-4.4 Fee Structures. Review development fees, impact fees,                and
                  monthly service charges on an annual basis to ensure             that
                  adequate revenue is collected to fund the operation               and
                  maintenance of existing facilities and construction of           new
                  facilities.
       PSF-4.5 Benefit Assessments. Require the formation of benefit,
                  maintenance, or community facilities districts for large projects,
                  specific plan areas, or neighborhood areas that desire or require
                  additional maintenance, facilities, or levels of service.
       PSF-4.6 Financial Reserves. Adopt a reserve policy that allows for the
                  full recapitalization of infrastructure in compliance with
                  guidelines of the Government Officers Finance Association and
                  accepted industry norms for the replacement of infrastructure
                  components.
       PSF-4.7 Specific Plans. Require that specific plans contain
                  comprehensive infrastructure master plans that detail
                  infrastructure conditions and needs; prepare a financing plan to
                  fund improvements and a cost-sharing arrangement for property
                  owners to pay for infrastructure.

Education
The El Monte community is served by three public school districts.
Mountain View School District operates 10 schools serving 8,400 primary
and elementary age students in southern El Monte. Founded in the 1880s,
the El Monte City School District operates 16 kindergarten through 8th
grade schools with an enrollment of 9,700 students. Established in 1901, the
El Monte Union High School District operates six high schools serving
7,000 students, and a community day school. El Monte also is home to
many fine private schools providing K–12 education to its youth.
Like all public school systems in California, the City of El Monte public
schools face several important issues in addressing student needs. As a
result of the Williams Settlement, the State of California earmarked funds
for school districts to further equal access to instructional materials, safe
and decent school facilities, and qualified teachers. Many of the school
districts in El Monte have prepared master plans to upgrade and modernize
facilities to address overcrowding, future enrollment growth, curricular
needs, health and safety, and other program/code requirements.
The El Monte-Rosemead Adult Education Center, Rio Hondo College, and
other adult educational institutions play a critical role in education today.
Adults may experience many job changes over their working years that
require a wide range of skills. Rapid changes in technology and work
processes, the reality of both parents working, and later retirement ages
point toward the need to train and retrain working people. These institu-
tions continue to play a vital role by offering a wide range of coursework      Education
and on-the-job training in a number of professions.                             The El Monte-Rosemead Center offers one of

                                                 by higher levels of preventable diseases, including diabetes and respiratory
                                                 conditions, among all age groups. The City is just beginning to understand
                                                 the relative health conditions of El Monte residents in comparison to
                                                 surrounding communities in the region.
                                                 These adverse health conditions are created by the environment (air
                                                 pollution), land use planning (including the lack of parks and recreational

                                                 gynecology, family medicine, an HIV clinic, and other services.
                                                 Many of these local hospitals create benefit plans that set forth programs to
                                                 benefit the communities they serve. As the City’s goal is to improve the
                                                 health and welfare of its residents, and as resources for health services are
                                                 limited, the City will strive to work with each hospital within Service

                                                 prevention programs. This will require unprecedented levels of cooperation
                                                 with surrounding health care providers and potential restructuring of the

                                                 Angeles County, one of the greatest concerns is the limited access to trauma
                                                 facilities. Federal and state reimbursement policies for services provided at
                                                 emergency and trauma rooms have led to many trauma facilities closing
                                                 throughout the county. The two closest trauma care facilities are the LA
                                                 County-USC Medical Center in Boyle Heights (13 miles west) and the
                                                 Pomona Valley Hospital and Medical Center (16 miles east). These facilities
                                                 are insufficient in size and proximity to cover all San Gabriel Valley cities.

Creating Effective Partnerships
The City, libraries, school districts, health care providers, business, and
nonprofit groups play an important role in delivering services in El Monte.
Opportunities for partnership are numerous. One such concept is the
development of joint use facilities located near residents, such as schools.
Joint-use facilities can provide park, recreation, educational, and public
services for students during school hours and for residents during after-
school hours. Joint-use facilities may include parks, libraries, gymnasiums,
auditoriums, health clinics, performing arts space, and other uses.
Creating effective partnerships is also an important part of providing a
more comprehensive system of community services. Because of the extent
and range of human services, no single entity has the expertise to provide
the full range of services. Instead, numerous agencies fill the gap. This
uncoordinated approach lends itself to service deficiencies, unnecessary
duplication of services, and the loss of opportunities to leverage resources.
The City’s 2005–2009 Consolidated Plan reiterates the importance of
coordinating service providers to maximize service delivery.
The Community Services Department currently provides a variety of social
services, focusing primarily on recreation, leisure, and senior services.
However, the City has the opportunity to facilitate a more integrated
approach that can address a range of social-service, educational, employ-
ment, and related needs. This requires the City to serve not only as a direct
service provider, but also as a facilitator and coordinator of services. This
role offers the opportunity to coordinate the effective delivery of a greater
range of community services needed by residents of all ages.
Goal PSF-5
A comprehensive array of quality social and human services, educational
opportunities, and cultural services that enrich the lives of El Monte
children, youth, adults, and seniors.

                  quantity and quality of health care services to residents.
       PSF-5.8 Partnerships. Seek to expand the role of the Community Services
                  Department so that it is not only a direct service provider, but
                  also a facilitator, collaborator, and coordinator with other social,
                  health, and educational providers within the City.

9.  Cultural Resources Element
   Introduction
    Vision El Monte… A community of diverse cultures and peoples, who
    share common values of family and service to the community, and who
    share the vision that El Monte, a city of rich cultural history, represents a
    place of hope, opportunity, and achievement for the future.
    El Monte has a diverse population and a rich history. For over seven
    generations, immigrant families have brought knowledge and traditions to
    the city and region from around the globe. Tongva, Spanish, Mexican,
    American Pioneers, and the Asian Pacific peoples: all have contributed to
    El Monte’s history. These influences have created a multicultural city in
    the San Gabriel Valley with a unique focus on community.
    This Element celebrates El Monte history and culture and seeks to define
    and shape the community’s future through:
       Built environment—imbuing the city’s infrastructure and built
        environment—crosswalks, sidewalks, intersections, greenways, street
        lights, and signs—with reminders of the City’s culture and heritage.
       Natural environment—reclaiming the City’s environmental and
        cultural legacy by the restoration, preservation, and maintenance of its
        trees, rivers, and landscape amenities.
       Preservation of heritage—preserving, enhancing, and renewing any
        remaining buildings of historic significance or extant traces of city
        fabric that are significant locally and statewide.
       Contemporary culture—imagining, creating, and supporting powerful
        events for celebrating children, family, and leaders of the community,
        past and present, all of whom leave an imprint.
                                                             El Monte General Plan CR-1

     Cultural Resources Element
     PURPOSE AND FUNCTION
     The Cultural Resources Element is not required by state law. However, the
     people of El Monte recognize that affirming their diversity and history can
     enhance quality of life in the City and guide future development. Therefore,
     this element is intended to celebrate El Monte’s story and provide direction
     on how to bring the cultural values, heritage, and meaningful lives of
     residents into focus in the City on a daily basis. This element also guides
     the City’s vision for future development, provides a uniting spark for its
     citizens, and establishes an aesthetic feel and spirit specific to the City.
     This element recognizes that cultural resources add richness to community
     life, provide meaning and relevance to our diverse past, and orient us
     toward a common future. This identity may lie in the reflection of a spirit
     of community in the built environment, the restoration of our
     environmental heritage and legacy, the creation of meaningful public spaces
     for civic gathering, and the imagination for powerful events that celebrate
     children, family, and seasons of life. This element is designed to define a
     unique, positive, and powerful cultural identity and a special focus on
     creating a city where youth and community values are celebrated.
     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
     This element incorporates and distills research done for the cultural
     resources index and through community outreach. Moreover, the Cultural
     Resources Element embraces the work and knowledge of a wide range of
     organizations and groups in El Monte, such as the El Monte Historical
     Society, La Historia, Tongva Tribal Council, Chamber of Commerce,
     Amigos de los Rios, and other organizations. Finally, numerous individuals
     provided a history of traditions and memories that enrich this element.
     Cultural resources do not exist in a vacuum, and this element is closely
     linked to others in the General Plan. The preservation of historic structures
     and creation of a matrix of city landmarks is an important consideration in
     the Community Design Element. Expanding recreational and cultural
     opportunities, such as along the Emerald Necklace, is fundamental to the
     Parks and Recreation Element. The Circulation Element addresses key
     infrastructure components that double as cultural interpretive corridors.
     Even the Land Use Element guides land use that respects and builds on
     past land use policies within the community.
CR-2 El Monte General Plan

EL MONTE SPEAKS
Fundamental to this element is the recognition and appreciation that El
Monte has a great story to tell. It is a story of a colorful past and a vibrant
present. It is not limited to historic buildings and monuments, but also
includes oral traditions, art, and community events. It embraces both the
built and the natural environment. Cultural history exists in historic
structures and in the hearts and minds of El Monte’s residents. Residents
have expressed a desire to share their story, reconnect to their past, and
build upon its richness to define their future.
As part of the General Plan update, the City conducted extensive surveys of
the community that included schools, City officials, residents, historical
groups, and businesses. Local historical groups surveyed included the El
Monte Historical Society, La Historia, Tongva Tribal Council, and
Chamber of Commerce. Hundreds of residents were surveyed about what
constitutes a cultural resource. The City also held a public cultural
resources workshop to communicate the results of the outreach process.
The survey was carefully designed to elicit responses on what makes El
Monte special and what constitutes a cultural resource. Recognizing that
people of different backgrounds, age levels, and experiences have different
perceptions of what constitutes a cultural or historical resource, the survey
parameters were deliberately left wide open. This inductive process drew a
passionate response from residents of all ages and resulted in a living
document called the El Monte’s Cultural Resources Index.
Eight categories of cultural resources were established to structure the input
received from the hundreds of participants in the process. However, the
index is much more than a list of significant places, features, and buildings.
It represents a dynamic process, reflecting the collective identity and values
of the City and its residents, and should be updated over time.
The following cultural resources index categories are listed below and
defined on the following pages.
    Historic Structures
    Infrastructure, Urban Fabric, and Traces
    Characteristics Establishments and Economic History
    Key Landscape Features and Natural History

                                    of whether they are eligible for official registration with the federal or state
                                    government, provide a historical context for how the City has developed.

                                    reevaluated as critical features in the City.

Urban Fabric/Traces
Some traces of historic settlements and cultures are only partially preserved
in the contemporary urban fabric, or preserved as fragments of street
patterns, as no complete historic districts exist.

Cultural Resources Context
Many families have chosen El Monte because the City is a place of hope and
promise, opportunity and achievement. The City’s population reflects
myriad waves of folks who risked their lives to make their way to California
and El Monte to find a better life. Another common thread is the
importance of family and shared sense of community that connects diverse
populations throughout the City. Residents share a desire to create unique
and wonderful opportunities for their children and families.
Driving from one end of the City to the other today, few would grasp the
richness and diversity of the population and the important cultural
milestones the City and its people have experienced. The built environment
is relatively homogenous from street to street. But the City is and has been
home to a diverse population, world-renowned businesses, and rich
historical eras and events. In such an environment, the challenge is to
recreate in a meaningful way “odes to the people, places, and events” that
are of critical importance to El Monte’s residents.
To that end, the best place to start is the beginning. Over El Monte’s
eventful history, seven eras are apparent, each leaving an imprint on El
Monte today. This section traces El Monte’s history through these eras:
    Prehistory. The Tongva culture that lived along the San Gabriel and
     Rio Hondo Rivers and the Catalina Islands.
    Mission and Rancho Period (1770s to 1840s). The Spanish mission
     settlements of early California, and later Mexican government.
    Early California Settlement (1860s to 1900s). The pioneers who settled
     in El Monte and saw its expansion into a township.
    Garden City of the Valley (1900s to 1930s). The development of the
     agricultural industry in El Monte.
    Emerging Cultures (1910s to 1950s). Chinese laborers, the Mexican-
     American barrios, Japanese immigration, and cultural assimilation.
    Industrial Eras (1940s to 1970s). World War II industry and the
     suburbanization of El Monte.
    Contemporary El Monte (1980s to present). Urbanization and defining
     a new direction.

      Cultural Resources Element
      PREHISTORY – THE TONGVA
      El Monte’s early history is not confined to the
      present city boundaries. El Monte has a special
      natural setting, as a fertile island between the
      Rio Hondo and the San Gabriel River, and one
      of the most diverse ecosystems in the San
      Gabriel Valley. In fact, the term “el monte”
      means “wooded place.” This oasis attracted
      settlers and visitors throughout history, and the
      rivers continue to shape and characterize the
      City to this day.
      The Tongva peoples brought the first culture to
      the Los Angeles region. Tongva means "people
      of the earth." The Tongva are also referred to as
      the Gabrieleño/Tongva or Gabrielino/Tongva
      tribe. They occupied the land from the San
      Gabriel Mountains to the southern Channel
      Islands from as early as 7000 BC to the time of
      Spanish settlement more than two centuries
      ago (1770s). Major village sites were established
      near      El    Monte      (Houtngna),     Azusa
      (Azuksangna), Covina (Weniingna), La Puente
                                                        Photos courtesy of the Tongva Tribal
      (Awingna), and Whittier (Sejatngna).              Council
      The Tongva derived their sustenance and culture from the rivers. They
      traveled throughout the watershed, using reed canoes for hunting, fishing,
      and gathering, and they venerated the rivers in ritual bathing ceremonies.
      The Tongva sustained themselves on a wide variety of ecosystems. The
      basin prairie provided deer, pronghorn antelope, elk, and migratory birds.
      The mountains offered autumn harvests of pine nuts. The rivers provided
      fish and medicinal herbs from riparian plants. But the Tongva’s primary
      food was acorns from the oak woodlands, which they tended like orchards,
      pruning, weeding, and even using controlled burning to clear underbrush
      and fertilize the trees.
      Today, there are 300 enrolled members of the Gabrieleno/Tongva Council
      of San Gabriel and an estimated few thousand that still live in California. In
      El Monte, the Tongva have established a Young People's Village (Youth
      Center at 4528 Baldwin Avenue in El Monte).

MISSION PERIOD INFLUENCE
Mission Period
From 1770 to 1821, Spanish missionaries and soldiers used the El Monte
area as a camp. In 1771, just south of present-day El Monte, the first
Mission San Gabriel Arcangel, or La Mision Vieja, was established on the
banks of the Rio Hondo as a stopping point between the missions in San
Diego and Carmel. Severe flooding, along with hostility between Spanish
soldiers and a local village, eventually forced the mission to move to its
present location in the City of San Gabriel in 1775.
Many Tongva were brought in to live at the mission and required to
abandon their native traditions. They became Catholic converts, laboring to
maintain and expand the mission by learning to farm in the European style.
They tilled land and dug irrigation trenches to plant wheat, corn, and
vegetables. Others were trained to tend cattle, butcher meat, and tan hides.
Women were responsible for feeding the mission community, making soap
and candles, and weaving rope. Fed by the waters of the San Gabriel River
and the labor of the Tongva, the mission became the most productive             El Monte’s History

Rancho Period
In 1821 the area now constituting El Monte became part of the Mexican
Republic. The mission era came to an end with a decree from the Mexican
Congress that stated missions were to be reduced to parish churches.
Included in this law was a provision that the missionaries be offered posts
as priests, mission buildings be converted to Native American pueblos, and
Native Americans receive enough land “for their support and wellbeing.”
However, the officials charged with overseeing the missions divided the
land into private ranchos and valuables were sold off, decimating the wealth
of the missions in a decade. The Tongva who had become dependent on the
missions for survival subsequently lived on the fringes of society.
Although the mission era had formally ended, the area now constituting El
Monte was still an important stop along the Santa Fe Trail, an ancient route
that originally terminated in Santa Fe, Mexico. Traders and merchants
                                                                                Spanish and Mexican Ranchos
continued to use the trail, exchanging American manufactured goods for
furs and other items. Traders sent caravans to Missouri as part of this         El Monte was part of the original Spanish and

      EARLY CALIFORNIA SETTLEMENTS
      El Monte played a significant part in California’s early pioneer history. The
      area was the location of the first encampments along the extension of the
      old Spanish trail from Missouri to Santa Fe. On January 13, 1847,
      California became part of the United States with the signing of the Treaty
      at Cahuenga. By the 1850s some began to refer to El Monte as the “end of
      the Santa Fe Trail,” as it became the western extension of the trail that
      originally ended in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
      By midcentury, pioneers
      traveling from the Midwest
      were drawn to California by
      the Gold Rush and the
      prospects of riches. Although
      few found such riches, the El
      Monte         region     offered
      abundant land, fertile alluvial
      soil, and water for agriculture.
      The first pioneer family to
      arrive in El Monte from across the United States—the Thompsons of
      Iowa—settled here in 1851 after a 14-month journey. Subsequently, the
      charismatic Captain Johnson of Lexington, Kentucky, led another group of
      pioneers to El Monte in 1852 and established a settlement named after his
      home town.
      The area of El Monte was designated a township in 1866 by the state
      legislature in an effort to organize the state into smaller, more defined
      governmental units. In 1868 the township’s name was changed from
      Lexington to El Monte. Valley Boulevard was an extension of the Santa Fe
      Trail, and was used throughout the 1870s by the Butterfield Stage, which
      connected Los Angeles to Riverside. El Monte boasted the stagecoaches’
      first official stop—the Thompson family’s Willow Grove Inn.
      El Monte grew exponentially when the Southern Pacific Railroad built the
      first tracks through the city in 1873. In 1876, the first weekly newspaper
      was founded, the El Monte Herald. Main Street was paved in 1906; and one
      year later, the Pacific Electric Red Cars were serving as public
      transportation for the town. The Red Cars traversed the city from east to
      west along the Ramona Boulevard corridor. El Monte was incorporated in
      1912.

GARDEN CITY OF THE VALLEY
Burgeoning Agriculture
El Monte’s successful early small farms cultivated fruit, hops, cotton, castor
beans, grain, honey, wool, and bacon. The turn of the century saw
continued bounty from the land. In the early 20th century, El Monte was
known as the “Garden City of the Valley.” Walnuts, fruit, berries,
vegetables, and flowers grew in abundance and supplied areas across the
country. With the rich alluvial soils of the rivers, El Monte was a fertile
place to grow anything. The official logo of the City of El Monte included
walnuts.
Bodger Seed, Ltd., leased large swaths of
land in southern El Monte to grow
flowers. The brilliant-colored rows
became a regional draw and an
international legend as these products of
California horticulture were exported to
Europe. Local farmers claimed that
anything would grow that you put in the
ground. Orchards, groves, and a growing
dairy industry began to replace field crops. The thriving agricultural
industry required more water than was locally available, thus began the
importation of water.
Roaring Twenties to Depression
The renowned Gay’s Lion Farm—the Disneyland of the 20s and 30s—
opened to the public in 1927 with 57 lions. The farm was on the present site
of Valley Boulevard and Peck Road. It raised lions for the growing film
industry and put on shows for visitors. Hundreds enjoyed the farm and its
roaring creatures. Jackie, one of Gay’s prize animals, was chosen for the
MGM logo, and the local high school adopted the lion as its mascot.
Although the farm is long closed, its memory lives on with statues of Jackie
at the Aquatic Center and at Valley Boulevard and Peck Road.
During the Depression, El Monte was chosen as the location of a unique
federally funded program, an experimental subsistence program called
Rurban Homesteads. The government purchased a walnut farm east of Peck
road and subdivided it into 100 single-acre lots. Each lot offered a home
with enough land to produce vegetables and raise livestock. The project was
successful and repeated across the country. Some of the original Rurban
Homesteads and the layout of the visionary development are still visible
along the The Wye in the northeast quadrant of the City.

                                    However, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1862 largely reduced the Chinese
                                    influence, forcing many Chinese immigrants to leave their homes in the
                                    San Gabriel Valley, although some stayed in the area. Johnson Sting, a
    Mexican-American                native Chinese, owned the largest asparagus farm in southern California.

                                    citizens and brought waves of immigrants into California over the following
                                    decades. Many of these immigrants found work in El Monte in the dairy,
                                    walnut, and berry farming industries. They brought with them great
                                    knowledge of agriculture and a strong equestrian tradition—the Charros
                                    legacy—that is still strongly felt in certain parts of the city. By the 1930s,
                                    Mexican immigrants constituted 20 percent of El Monte’s population.
                                    City ordinances required that Mexican immigrants live in designated areas;
                                    thus nurturing a unique Mexican American culture for more than 40 years.
                                    Approximately nine barrios were established in El Monte, such as Hicks
                                    Camp, Wiggin’s Camp, Garvey Camp, Chino Camp, La Granada, and
                                    Medina Court. Houses were small wooden or even cardboard structures,
                                    usually with two or three rooms. Most families had an outhouse, although a
                                    few people had plumbing. Families had gardens and tended animals. Each
                                    barrio had its own stores, churches, and cultural establishments.
                                    The barrios were a unique part of El Monte’s history that continues to leave
                                    an imprint on community life. Although most of the barrios were
                                    demolished between 1953 and 1970, many of the residents stayed in the area
                                    to raise families and start businesses. The one remaining barrio is Medina
                                    Court, which was originally established around Our Lady of Guadalupe
                                    Church. Medina Court has provided El Monte with a long line of civic and
                                    business leaders, establishing the neighborhood’s reputation as a “Gateway
                                    to the American Dream” for generations of new Americans.

WORLD WAR AND INDUSTRIAL ERA
World War II brought dramatic
changes to El Monte. It brought
the defense industry, harkening
a shift from agriculture to
industry. Aircraft parts factories
and manufacturing began to
emerge. Dairies and agricultural
uses gave way to modern
industry. Some of the best-
known companies included
Sargent Fletcher and Navcom.
Local workers produced parts for small planes, bombs, and other aircraft.
At this time the industrial area now called Flair Park was established, as
well as the northwest industrial area where Ball Glass opened to produce
glass containers of all varieties.
The City of El Monte continued to expand as a suburb of the greater Los
Angeles Region. To accommodate this population and reduce the threat of
flooding, the Army Corps of Engineers cemented the river channels to
allow for housing and industry within the flood plain. The quarry industry
adjacent to El Monte to the north began in 1950 and still remains today.
Much of the present freeway system was also established during this time .
Much of the natural landscape was permanently replaced by flood control
channels, freeways, quarries, and industrial uses, leaving a legacy of
environmental issues.
El Monte’s regional popularity increased with the opening of Valley Mall
and its integrated music venue that drew international talent for the
enjoyment of all—the El Monte Legion Stadium. El Monte RV, begun in
1970, became one of the nation’s premier RV rental companies, represented
by several hundred travel companies worldwide. Establishment of the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority Bus Terminal and Metrolink
commuter rail helped establish El Monte as a transit hub of the San Gabriel
Valley. As in the rest of southern California, the culture of the automobile
took over, and El Monte became a regional destination to purchase cars.
As is the case with early industrialization and suburbanization throughout
the southern California region, unintended legacies remain from this era.
City leaders today face pollution from past industrial activities,
underground water contamination, congestion from an overtaxed
transportation system, and public health challenges of modern life in the
Los Angeles metropolitan area.

      Cultural Resources Element
      CONTEMPORARY EL MONTE – 1980S TO PRESENT
      The City of El Monte has a colorful
      past, made up of many generations of
      individuals and families who
      traveled across the world to settle in
      El Monte. Although diverse in
      background, El Monte residents
      today share a special civic spirit of
      conviviality based on a belief in
      family and community. The City
      celebrates its younger citizens in a
      series of yearly events designed to delight the young and young at heart:
      Holiday House, the Art Festival, and Children’s Parade. The Parks
      Department hosts an excellent set of recreation opportunities for youth, and
      the state-of-the-art Aquatics Center is a major asset to the health and well-
      being of residents.
      El Monte’s special identity is found in acknowledging and embracing the
      richness and the inextricable relation between the cultural and natural
      history of the community. Any time a foundation is dug for a new building
      in El Monte, the rich alluvial soils the San Gabriel River and Rio Hondo
      once deposited across the valley floor are unearthed. A critical part of the
      cultural resources program will be to re-establish a balance between the
      natural environment that gave the City its identity throughout history as a
      “wooded place – a meadow between rivers” and future development.
      El Monte has taken a leadership role in the Emerald Necklace, a vision for
      restoring the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River channels. The City wishes
      to revitalize its downtown core, beautify and open up its rivers, and
      strengthen the economy. In this renewal process, the city anticipates future
      growth, opportunity, and continued celebration of diversity. The strategic
      position of the city as a central hub where regional bus, Metrolink,
      highway, and local trolley services converge is a great strength and offers
      opportunity to develop world class transit-oriented developments.
      El Monte will always be remembered for its colorful past and its unique
      contribution to the history of California. Contemporary El Monte, however,
      will be defined by its future. Civic leaders have the opportunity to define a
      legacy that respects and leverages its past. This new legacy will be one that
      embraces a clean and healthy environment, that recognizes and affirms its
      cultures and places and imbues the physical and natural environment with
      reminders, that cherishes it residents and families, and that offers people of
      all cultures a place of security, and promise and a launching point for
      realizing their dreams. El Monte is at a pivotal moment in its history and
      evolution.
CR-16 El Monte General Plan

Goals and Policies
 El Monte is committed to acknowledging, celebrating, protecting, and
 enhancing its cultural resources throughout the City in a variety of ways.
General Plan goals and policies support this commitment. The first goal
and policies establish a broad-based cultural resources program. Goals 2, 3,
and 4 address the importance of incorporating cultural resources into the
built and natural environment. The fifth goal and supporting policies
enhance support for the important yearly civic events that the City                Urban
                                                                                   History
sponsors. The cultural resources index informs the proposed policies and
goals in different ways, serving as useful references, tools, and sources of
inspiration for cultural resource policy.

Although the land the City occupies is known to have been widely                  Features
inhabited by the Tongva tribe, there are no material remnants of this living
culture. Buildings and structures relating to the period of the first Mission,
early settlers who followed the Santa Fe Trail to California, the barrios, and
other historical eras have been erased. Much of El Monte’s history is alive
only in street names, photographs, journals, and collective memories of
inhabitants. All told, there are many important memories but relatively few      Community
                                                                                   Events
official historical buildings or monuments.
By comparison, peer cities may have a higher concentration of classified
historic places and official historic buildings. Citizens of El Monte as a
collective are interested in the contemporary relevance of their shared
history. In El Monte, the residents in multiple areas are carefully preserving
knowledge of historic urban fabric and the associated culture. Examples of
                                                                                   Urban
this include Barrio History at La Historia, the early settlements and           Fabric/Traces
pioneer culture preserved at El Monte Historical Museum, and subsistence
gardening history from residents of the Rurban Homesteads.
The guiding principle of the Cultural Resources Element is that El Monte’s
cultural resources are dynamic and multifaceted, involving many aspects of        Economic
community life. Unlike other cities with many examples of historic                 History
resources, the challenge for a city like El Monte is how to re-create in a
meaningful way a contemporary presence of the layers of history that are no
longer physically present, but remain in the hearts and minds of residents.
This is not a traditional preservation processes but a challenge to
acknowledge the importance of people and events in the history in the City
in a myriad of innovative ways.

      Given that cultural resources involve every facet of community life, and
      that the City of El Monte now has a cultural resources index, perhaps the
      most fundamental task is to establish a formal cultural resources program.
      Such a program would acknowledge the leadership, achievements,
      accomplishments, and histories of its residents and provide a galvanizing
      force for the City. The program could also forge a new identity rooted in
      reclaiming the balance and heritage of El Monte. The following goal and
      policies provide a starting point for such an endeavor.
CR-18 El Monte General Plan

Goal CR-1
A multifaceted program for enhancing cultural resources in the City as a
means to acknowledge and celebrate the leadership, achievements,
accomplishments, and diverse histories of its residents.
Policies
CR-1.1 Cultural Resources Index. Ratify the cultural resources index as a
         living document recording people, places, and events of local
         significance to the City of El Monte, and establish a protocol for
         updates and additions.
CR-1.2   Cultural Resources Map. Create a cultural resources map
         capturing the dynamic layers of El Monte’s history; locate the
         original map at a major civic institution and use reproductions
         throughout the city as appropriate.
CR-1.3   Cultural Heritage Commission. Establish a commission to
         develop and oversee cultural resources programs, including
         public art programs, annual cultural resources awards,
         collaborative school curriculum, and special events.
CR-1.4   Cultural Resources Ordinances. Update the El Monte
         Municipal Code to include authorizing ordinances that govern
         the designation, preservation, and recognition of cultural
         resources in El Monte and to delineate the roles of commissions.
CR-1.5   Cultural Resources Plan. Create a comprehensive cultural
         resources plan, based on the cultural resource index and map, to
         imbue the natural and built environment with symbols and
         improvements drawing from El Monte’s rich cultural heritage.
CR-1.6   Cultural Resources Education. Inspire public support and
         recognition of cultural resources through a public education
         program, including school district curriculum, public art, library
         corners, displays in local museums, and special events.
CR-1.7   Government Role. Fully support the establishment of a cultural
         resources program and provide funding, staffing, and other
         mechanisms to maintain the program.

      ORAL HISTORY
      Telling stories of the City’s critical cultural and historical events and places
      enriches residents’ lives and is a source of pride, entertainment, and
      education. Oral history brings places alive and encourages citizens to
      consider where their city has been and where it is going. In the rush of
      modern living, oral histories allow us to pause and reflect. There are many
      waves of history and cultures that have influenced El Monte, but a few time
      periods of time stand out for many residents. In citizen surveys, the
      following key elements were the most commonly cited:
          Tongva Gabrieleno Culture. This widespread Native American culture
           used the Rio Hondo and adjoining areas for hunting, fishing, and
           gathering for thousands of years.
          Lexington School. This was the first public school in California and El
           Monte’s only public school until 1923. Its story of segregation and
           desegregation reflect changing values and social activism.
          Gay’s Lion Farm. This lion zoo and training center for Tarzan movies
           was one of the Southland’s biggest attractions before World War II. The
           lion has become the City’s most visible and endearing symbol.
          El Monte Legion Stadium. First a school gymnasium, then bought by
           Northrop Aviation before becoming an American Legion Hall, it
           became a noted venue for sporting events before bringing in live music.

      El Monte’s cultural history exists both on the ground and in the collective
      memory of its citizens. Traces of urban fabric are patterns of streets and
      urban elements within the contemporary landscape that remain as
      remnants of earlier settlements of cultural significance.
      As cities grow and change, physical remnants of street patterns, buildings,
      and other elements often remain. In many cases, however, change is so
      pervasive that all traces of a historical event or time period are lost. In the
      case of El Monte, both conditions are true. Where significant examples in
      the landscape survive they should be preserved; where they do not, more
      creative approaches are needed to keep cultural history alive.
      The highest ranked traces of urban fabric in the City are noted below.
      Other aspects of cultural history have been totally erased by modern
      development, but could be brought back with appropriate markers,
      displays, or symbols.
          Valley Boulevard/Valley Mall. El Monte’s original Main Street and a
           key route between Los Angeles and San Bernardino, this area is the best
           known place to enjoy a walkable and relaxed shopping experience.
          Streets Named for Pioneers and First Settlers. El Monte was first
           settled by pioneers whose names are commemorated as street names
           throughout the City.
          Medina Court. The last of the original nine El Monte barrios, its
           nucleus was the Lady of Guadalupe Church and it produced a rich
           legacy of city leaders, workers, and citizens
          Rurban Homesteads. This Depression-era program encouraged
           subsistence living in a semiurban setting. The unusual lots, ample open
           space, and unique street patterns persist.
          Hicks and Wiggins Labor Camps. These camps were built along the
           Rio Hondo in the early 1900s. The camps were demolished but their
           story is indicative of the social and economic life of the era.
      Preserving traces of urban fabric can also be a stimulus for the creation of
      cultural resource districts throughout the City (see Community Design
      Element). Based on cultural and historic development patterns, several
      districts have already been identified and could serve as the basis for
      streetscape improvements, public art, and cultural displays.

El Monte General Plan CR-2
      Cultural Resources Element
      Goal CR-2
      A community that embraces the rich diversity of residents and the cultural
      heritage they bring from all over the world by incorporating local cultural
      history and special places into the fabric of the built environment.
      Policies
      CR-2.1      Cultural Districts. Designate cultural districts based on
                  historical development and cultural settlement patterns. Where
                  little historical precedent exists, evaluate the creation of a district
                  from existing site or urban design characteristics.
      CR-2.2      Historic Overlay Zones. Assess the feasibility of creating
                  historic overlay zones, as relevant, that contain elements of
                  potential historic significance such as the Valley Mall, El Monte
                  Theatre, Wye Street/Rurban Homestead area, and Medina Court.
      CR-2.3      Cultural Elements. Develop elements relevant to defining traces
                  of urban fabric: elements may include new gateways, streetscape
                  elements such as kiosks with maps, special street signs, distinct
                  textures for crosswalks or sidewalks, landscaping specific to
                  districts, relevant public art, and interpretive signs.
      CR-2.4      Public Spaces. Assess the feasibility of creating distinctive
                  public space and walking routes in each district and Citywide,
                  with a central gathering place and an interpretive map of the
                  history of El Monte. An example of this would be the El Monte
                  Historic Plaza between the Valley Mall and Valley Boulevard.
      CR-2.5      Capital Improvements. Create a plan for making infrastructure
                  improvements (e.g., signage, historical markers, park
                  improvements, public art, and other media) that incorporate
                  relevant images of El Monte’s cultural heritage.
      CR-2.6      Cultural Icons. Develop a program for placement of City
                  symbols on sidewalks, street signs, retaining walls, freeway
                  ramps, crosswalks, and other infrastructure to signify El Monte’s
                  unique cultural heritage.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The City of El Monte is one of the few urban places in southern California
that has been so influenced by its natural environment. El Monte’s most
important natural features—its surrounding rivers—have affected its
culture and continue to do so. Known as the “wooded place between the
rivers,” El Monte existence and culture have long depended on water.
Before the rivers were channelized, seasonal waters deposited rich, alluvial
soils along their banks, making El Monte the Garden City of the Valley.
These rivers provided enough fertile soil and water to produce the largest
agricultural center in California at the height of the Mission era. The rivers
attracted early California settlers and fed the robust walnut, dairy, fruit,
vegetable and flower industries that brought fame to the region in the early
20th century. And they were the center of social life for Mexican farm
workers, who are responsible in large measure for the present cultural
identity of El Monte. In a sense, the Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River have
woven the disparate and unique cultures of El Monte’s heritage together.
The dream of restoring these rivers has coalesced in the Emerald Necklace
Vision Plan (see Parks and Recreation Element), a 17-mile loop of parks
and greenways. This is a far-reaching, multibenefit plan was modeled after
the Emerald Necklace, designed by 19th century architect Frederick Law
Olmstead in Boston. This regional plan will link natural and cultural
resources in a truly world-class urban park system, combining habitat
restoration, water quality, recreation, open space, and cultural educational
opportunities. El Monte’s portion of the Emerald Necklace is the heart of
the plan and its cultural aspect is the primary concern of this element.
As mentioned earlier, El Monte’s name derives from its legacy as a meadow
and wooded place. The San Gabriel River and Rio Hondo flowing from the
mountains fed marshes and provided habitat for rich riparian woodland.
Restoring some of this natural environment and integrating it into the
modern suburban fabric of El Monte is an important way to evoke the
cultural heritage of the community. As further described in the Parks and
Recreation and Community Design Elements, El Monte is committed to
creating a network of greenways, lush community forests, community and
neighborhood parks, community gardens, and linear parks.
El Monte envisions the enhancement of its natural environment as a means
to not only improve the environment, but also to tangibly express its
cultural and historical heritage as a wooded place between the rivers.

Policies
CR-3.1     Community Forest. Develop a community forest program that
           balances indigenous trees and plants and modern requirements
           for maintenance, water conservation, and aesthetics, as a visual
           reminder of the City’s heritage and natural environment.
CR-3.2     Landscape Amenities. Create an integrated network of
           greenways, medians, parkways, and other landscaped amenities
           using a consistent and meaningful palette that balances the need
           for maintenance and cultural significance.
CR-3.3     Emerald Necklace. Continue to support, through a cooperative
           public/private/regional partnership, the realization of the
           Emerald Necklace Vision Plan (see Parks and Recreation
           Element for more detail).
CR-3.4     Cultural Exhibits. Include cultural exhibits and displays within
           linear parks, along greenways, and at other recreational facilities
           of the Emerald Necklace and City parks to acknowledge the
           unique contributions of people of all backgrounds.
CR-3.5     Cultural Walk. Create an El Monte cultural history river history
           walk linking key sites throughout the City with representative
           symbols, displays, and information acknowledging each cultural
           heritage of the city.
CR-3.6     School Curriculum. Create an educational packet for El Monte
           public schools explaining the role of the watershed in the City’s
           historical and cultural heritage, including its historical use,
           watershed management, and conservation.
CR-3.7     Yearly Events. Create a series of yearly events and celebrations
           fostering youth and family involvement in the preservation,
           maintenance, and restoration of the cultural and environmental
           landscape of El Monte.

      Cultural Resources Element
      HISTORIC STRUCTURES
      Historic buildings remind us how El Monte developed over time. Although
      many of El Monte’s historic buildings have been lost, the city does have
      some important landmarks, two of which are registered with the state: the
      Santa Fe Trail Historic Park and the Osmond House/Jail at Pioneer Park.
      The former is a state historic landmark representing an early southern
      California settlement by American immigrants along the Old Spanish
      Trail; the latter is an excellent example of early 20th century vernacular.
      These structures embody key aspects of the history of the California, the
      region, and the City and should be preserved, enhanced, and made fully
      accessible to the broadest number of residents.
      In addition to these official landmarks, there are several buildings of
      significance to the history and culture of the city. Buildings of particular
      significance to the community include the El Monte Community Center
      Complex, which contains the beautiful Grace Black auditorium, courtyard,
      and El Monte Historical Society Museum. This site was originally donated
      by the Bodger Seed Company. Contemporary buildings of architectural
      significance such as the El Monte Aquatic Center should be considered for
      inclusion into a list of buildings of local significance.
      Along the Old Valley Mall corridor stands the El Monte Theatre, a
      wonderful art-deco building with a well-remembered wishing well. Not far
      from this location, the Manual Arts Building, remnant of the original El
      Monte High School campus, on Valley Boulevard and the Masonic Lodge
      on Tyler are candidates for preservation and enhancement. If the original
      character of buildings such as these can be preserved within a scheme of
      adaptive reuse, they will give great character to the area and become an
      anchor for cultural history. Similarly, Costa Azul on Peck, a former Medina
      Court restaurant and now an Enterprise Rent-a-Car, is a potential candidate
      for enhancement as a cultural resource.
      The Rurban Homesteads were a formative part of El Monte’s early history.
      Any one of the original wood-frame houses of the Wye District could be
      preserved. In addition, 1920s homes and their original subsistence lots built
      during the Depression could be purchased and restored as a contemporary
      subsistence garden and linked to healthy eating and self reliance. Finally,
      there are wood-frame homes scattered throughout the city from the turn of
      the century through the early 1940s, whose historic character creates a
      pleasant complement and anchor among otherwise modern homes.

El Monte General Plan CR-2
      Cultural Resources Element
      Goal CR-4
      A community that acknowledges, identifies, protects, enhances, and expands
      its inventory of historic buildings, sites, and resources.
      Policies
      CR-4.1      El Monte Historic Register. Establish an El Monte Register of
                  Historic Buildings and Places and seek listing for appropriate
                  properties to the national and state registers of historic places.
      CR-4.2      Architectural Inventory. Survey all potentially historic
                  structures and create an architectural period and styles inventory
                  for El Monte as a means to identify potential historic or locally
                  significant structures.
      CR-4.3      Local List of Historic Places. Create a local list of historic
                  places for properties that do not meet criteria of the national or
                  state Registers but are important to protect in terms of local
                  significance. Tie this to the cultural resources index.
      CR-4.4      Historic Preservation Ordinance. Adopt a preservation
                  ordinance that would require a special permit to demolish or
                  modify a historic resource.
      CR-4.5      Preservation and Rehabilitation. Promote the preservation,
                  rehabilitation, restoration, and reuse of older structures through
                  the Mills Act and other programs.
      CR-4.6      School Curricula. Link El Monte’s Register of Historic Places
                  and national and state monuments to multidisciplinary school
                  curricula (literature, art, and social studies), with a living history
                  component to include guest speakers and local field trips.
      CR-4.7      Adaptive Reuse. Encourage the adaptive reuse of buildings of
                  historical significance to serve meaningful contemporary uses
                  while preserving the character, spirit, and original identity of the
                  structures.
CR-30 El Monte General Plan

COMMUNITY LIFE
El Monte’s culture is embodied not only in the built and natural
environment, but also in the varied expressions of community life. Cultural
resources in community life are expressed in many different ways—through
stories and traditions that are carried down for generations and preserved in
museums; through visual and performing arts that express our thoughts,
concepts of beauty, and personal growth; and through community events
that provide reminders of our collective and diverse heritage and provide
opportunities for El Monte residents to come together.
Arts in Community Life
Visual and performing arts create meaningful educational experiences. A
well-rounded arts program in school can improve school performance, help
improve social skills among youth, nurture creative thinking, and help
students relate better to their schools and community. Arts can reach at-
risk children and youth by giving them a way to express themselves,
develop talents, and improve self-esteem. The arts are also as a unifying
force in communities, by expressing and communicating the challenges and
aspirations faced by all of humanity, regardless of culture or background.
El Monte is expanding opportunities for displaying its cultural resources.
In addition to its most prominent monuments and landmarks—the Gay’s
Lion Farm Statue, Statue of Liberty, and Veterans Memorial—the City has
adopted a street banner program, is encouraging public art, and has begun
to place historical markers and displays in key areas of the City. The school
district also supports arts in its curriculum. The goal is to help foster a
community where artistic expression and cultural diversity can flourish,
and where City leaders support the arts as a part of civic life.
Celebrations in Community Life
Yearly events and celebrations also bring forth and reinforce a spirit of
identification, shared history, and destination for a community. Such
celebrations are also powerful uniting forces for residents. El Monte’s
residents have rich heritages from places all over the globe and have
brought to the City a panoply of traditions and experiences. Yet certain
values are shared regardless of culture. El Monte has therefore made it a
priority to develop, perpetuate, and inspire the creation of powerful and
imaginative events for celebrating children, family, the seasons of life, and
other common values among El Monte residents.
                                                          El Monte General Plan CR-31

      Cultural Resources Element
      The City of El Monte sponsors a wide variety of events for residents to
      celebrate holidays, the community’s cultural heritage, or just socialize with
      close friends and neighbors. The Holiday House has been a tradition for
      over 30 years and draws 15,000 residents annually. During the summer
      months, the Concert in the Park series draws 2,500 residents to each event.
      El Monte also celebrates its commitment to youth through its annual
      Children’s Day Parade and Festival, attended by 10,000 residents. Other
      seasonal events are held throughout the year, such as the Veterans Day
      Parade, Fourth of July events, and many others.
      Education in Community Life
      Cultivating an understanding of El Monte’s cultural resources is a key way
      to appreciate and to personally connect to our rich heritage. We all learn
      from our past and it is our past that helps inform future decisions. As many
      of El Monte’s cultural resources are preserved through stories and pictures,
      the City values the role education can play in remembering the
      contributions of El Monte residents and community leaders. In many ways,
      education can make relevant El Monte’s historical and cultural heritage and
      allow residents and leaders today to draw upon the lessons if offers.
      The City’s museums offer opportunities for cherishing El Monte’s past. The
      El Monte Historical Museum documents the community’s history as a
      destination for pioneers traveling on the Santa Fe Trail, focusing on events
      since 1849. The La Historia Society Museum pays tribute to the City’s
      Latino history, commemorates the nine original barrios in El Monte, and
      highlights contributions from the City’s diverse cultures of Latinos,
      Chinese, Japanese, Tongva, and American pioneers. The City’s growing
      Asian population is represented by the Chinese Culture Center in Flair
      Park, which includes a 60,000-square-foot facility for library uses,
      performing arts and conventions, festivals, and classes. In addition, the
      Chinese culture is also represented by the number of temples and churches
      that have been developed along corridors, like Lower Azusa Road.
      Taken together, the goal is to help foster a civic environment where cultural
      expression and diversity can flourish, and where local government and City
      leaders legitimize and promote cultural resources as an essential component
      of civic support, funding, and decision making.

    Introduction
    Vision El Monte… a safe community, where our residents are safe from
    natural hazards, where our natural environment and watershed is clean and
    healthful; where neighborhoods are protected from the pollution of cars
    and industries; and where we can live in a peaceful residential
    neighborhood away from the noise of industries, cars, and other uses which
    detract from a quality living environment.
    CREATING A SAFE COMMUNITY
    El Monte’s fundamental goal is to provide a safe and secure place to live.
    Without a safe environment, little else really matters. The City has been
    making significant strides to achieve this goal. El Monte’s goals are to:
       Protect residents from natural hazards—minimizing the dangers from
        earthquakes, flooding, and other natural disasters.
       Provide a safe transportation system—making our roadways safe for
        motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
       Clean our natural environment—furthering healthful air, proper
        management of hazardous wastes, and clean groundwater.
       Plan for emergency response—protecting our city from manmade and
        environmental hazards through effective emergency planning.
       Minimize noise—minimizing noise from roadways, railroads, and
        industries to help provide a quiet and peaceful living environment.

                                     Protecting health, personal property, and life from natural and man-made
                                     hazards and health risks is a fundamental responsibility of the City. The
                                     occurrence of natural disasters in southern California makes effective public
                                     safety programs of great importance. Our understanding of the natural
                                     environment also underscores the importance of clean and healthful air and
                                     water. This element assesses the natural and man-made hazards in
                                     El Monte and sets forth responsive goals and policies to address those
                                     hazards.

                                     RELATED PLANS AND PROGRAMS
                                     The Public Health and Safety Element builds upon many federal, state, and
                                     local laws. Some of the more notable laws include the California Environ-
                                     mental Quality Act, California Seismic Safety Codes, and the International
                                     Building Code. These codes, in concert with the Municipal Code, regulate
                                     and/or influence land use and intensity of development in El Monte. These
                                     laws and regulations also help protect our health, safety, and welfare by
                                     ensuring that proper safety analyses are undertaken, and that sound
                                     construction practices are followed.
                                     The Public Health and Safety Element is related to other General Plan
                                     elements. Land uses identified in the Land Use Element are influenced by
                                     the location of potential hazards. Emergency evacuation routes and the
                                     location of critical facilities are influenced by the Circulation Element. The
                                     Public Services and Facilities Element addresses the provision of police and
                                     fire response to minimize personal injury and property damage from
                                     disasters. In addition, the Parks and Recreation Element provides programs
                                     that will improve the natural environment and public health.

EL MONTE SPEAKS
Quality of life is what makes a city a desirable place to live. Quality of life
surely involves the provision of park and recreational opportunities, strong
neighborhoods and quality housing, a vibrant economy and well-paying
jobs, good education, convenient transportation, and beautiful architecture.
Yet the critical aspect of quality of life that makes this possible is safety.
El Monte understands the importance of public safety and health. As the
hub of San Gabriel Valley, public health and safety have always been
important issues. Over the past 50 years, El Monte has seen tremendous
housing, commercial, and industrial growth and, with it, complex planning
issues that affect the health and safety of residents. Flooding hazards, traffic
congestion, and environmental pollution all pose challenges.
As El Monte envisions its future, public safety will remain a concern. We
desire an environment safe from natural disasters. We desire to drive,
bicycle, and walk safely along our streets. We want to know that our air is
safe to breathe and our water is safe to drink. Prioritizing these issues will
help El Monte achieve its vision. City outreach programs and community
workshops help identify what residents regard as important priorities.
A safe El Monte will consist of the following:
   Emergency planning and preparedness for earthquakes, flooding, and
    other natural disasters that can lead to personal injury, property
    damage, and loss of life.
   Transportation safety, so that residents are confident that they can
    safely drive to work or other daily activities, and children can safely
    walk or bicycle to school.
   Clean environment, in which our air is safe to breathe, our water is of
    high quality, and our hazardous wastes are disposed of properly to
    safeguard people, wildlife, and the environment.
   Responsive police and fire services, to create a safe community for all
    ages and protect our residents and businesses from harm. (This topic is
    addressed in the Public Services and Facilities Element.)
   Neighborhoods that are reasonably free from the adverse impacts of
    noise from streets, trucks, commercial and business activities.
The following section presents goal statements and policies to improve the
public health and safety of the El Monte community.
                                                           El Monte General Plan PHS-3

      Public Health and Safety Element
      Public Health and Safety Context
      El Monte’s fundamental mission is to protect public health and safety.
      When we think of “public safety,” most people think of police, fire and
      paramedics, who are the first to respond to emergency circumstances.
      However, the City, county, and state governmental agencies are charged to
      help protect us from environmental and man-made hazards. The following
      highlights the issues addressed in this Safety Element. Each topic will be
      described in detail, followed by responsive goals and policies.
      SEISMIC HAZARDS
      Southern California is prone to periodic earthquakes, mostly recently the
      Whittier Narrows, Northridge, and Landers quakes. While no earthquake
      faults have been found in El Monte, residents clearly experience the
      groundshaking effects from such events. Most of the City is underlain by a
      shallow water table, is subjeect to liquefaction or the settling of soil during
      an earthquake, and therefore will materially experience the movement
      caused by an earthquake.
      El Monte protects the community from seismic hazards through the
      enforcement of modern building technologies, land use, and appropriate
      construction practices. El Monte is committed to continued vigilance in
      ensuring that residents and businesses are safe from seismic events. To
      maintain and improve public safety, this Element will focus on protecting
      residents from potential damage from earthquakees through proactive
      planning, enforcement of building standards, and emergency preparedness.
      WATERSHED MANAGEMENT
      El Monte’s location is at the convergence of the San Gabriel River and the
      Rio Hondo River watersheds, which are fed by six washes and two creeks.
      Although these once meandering rivers were channelized to reduce damage
      caused from flooding in the past, our understanding of watersheds has
      evolved. More than simply flood control, the City now envisions the Rio
      Hondo River and San Gabriel River as vital, healthy watersheds, which
      takes into account a number of mutually supportive goals.
      This element, as supported by the Recreation and Open Space Element,
      seeks to help manage the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo watersheds and
      improve the beneficial uses of the rivers. Goals of the Element are to:
PHS-4 El Monte General Plan

   Improve water quality through the cleanup of the Superfund site,
    reduction of urban runoff, and implementation of green infrastructure.
   Continue to maintain excellent protection from dam inundation and
    improve the City’s drainage system to prevent urban floods.
   Protect water resources and restore habitat for wildlife and birds
    through proper watershed management practices.
AIR QUALITY
El Monte is acutely aware of how air pollution impacts children, families,
and people with health conditions. Unhealthful air has been linked to
diminished lung capacity, higher frequency of asthma, and in extreme cases
cancer and shortened lifespan. Air quality is a complex issue and is affected
not only by our transportation network, but also by certain industrial
activities. Although the federal Clean Air Act has helped to reduce
pollutants, the region has not achieved state and federal air quality
standards, and thus air quality remains a critical concern for El Monte.
Supported by the Land Use and Recreation and Open Space Elements, a
major focus of the Public Health and Safety Element will be to:
   Reduce and eliminate, wherever feasible, conflicts between mobile and
    stationary sources of air pollutants and sensitive land uses, with priority
    given to existing sensitive land uses.
   Concentrate housing along major corridors to reduce the use of
    automobiles, reduce vehicle emissions and improve air quality, and
    promote a more compact form of residential development.
   Create a community forest along all major roadways and on public
    lands, and encourage the planting of trees on private property as a
    means of filtering air pollutants in El Monte.
TRANSPORTATION SAFETY
El Monte is defined by its extensive network of roads, freeways, railroad,
and transit that offers convenient travel modes for residents, workers, and
visitors. While a benefit to the local economy, these transportation modes
also pose considerable threats to public health and safety in El Monte. Safe
routes to school have also become a critical concern to families. In
comparison to other cities, the City has higher rates of accidents involving
vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists. The rate of transportation-related
accidents and personal injury underscores the importance of this issue to
El Monte.
                                                          El Monte General Plan PHS-5

      Public Health and Safety Element
      In conjunction with the Circulation Element, the Public Health and Safety
      Element seeks to improve transportation safety through:
         Implement safe routes to schools, sidewalk improvements, street lights,
          crosswalks, enforcement of traffic laws, and reduction of traffic speeds
          where appropriate.
         Advocate for the improvement of all street-railroad crossings, including
          the implementation of full-grade separtions, at every intersection of the
          railroad and local streets.
         Ensure that new development complies with the provisions of the El
          Monte Airport Land Use Plan so as not to endanger residents and
          business community.
      HAZARDOUS WASTES
      Hazardous waste management has become more important to El Monte. In
      the past, heavy industries produced significant levels of hazardous wastes,
      and the City is dealing with the impact of the cleanup and remediation of
      groundwater contamination at the Superfund site. Certain industries still
      pose risks due to emissions and proximity to residential neighborhoods.
      Hazardous wastes are also generated by the use and disposal of everyday
      products, including solvents, batteries, paint, oil, and electronic equipment.
      In conjunction with the Public Services and Facilities Element and the
      Land Use Element, the goals of this element are to:
         Expedite, through active participation with the San Gabriel Basin
          Water Quality Authority, the full cleanup of the Superfund site situated
          below much of El Monte.
         Discourage siting of businesses that use, store, or transport hazardous
          materials and waste near sensitive land uses unless mitigation measures
          comply with County fire department standards.
         Cooperate actively with federal, state, county, business, and other
          entities to effectively manage hazardous materials and wastes to protect
          the health and safety of residents.
      EMERGENCY RESPONSE
      Natural and man-made disasters (earthquake, flooding, fire, hazardous
      waste spills, etc.), cause significant property damage and loss of life. During
      those times, the City’s state of emergency preparedness makes all the
      difference in how effectively the City responds. While we cannot fully
      insulate ourselves from disasters, maintaining a state of readiness is the key
      to minimizing damage to property, personal injury, or loss of life.
PHS-6 El Monte General Plan

Goals and Policies
Public health and safety involves three different scales—natural hazards,
man-made environment, and personal safety. This element addresses the
first two topics, while police and fire safety issues are addressed in the
Public Services and Facilities Element. Each section begins with a
discussion of the issue, provides El Monte’s goals with respect to public
safety, and follows with policies to further each goal. Appendix A contains a
detailed implementation plan.
SEISMIC SAFETY
Earthquakes represent a major concern for all cities in southern California.
The City of El Monte lies entirely within the flat, alluvial plain of the San   How are earthquakes

Workman Hill, and the Clamshell-Sawpit Canyon faults. These faults can
produce earthquakes that could cause significant property damage and loss
of life. Recent earthquakes affecting El Monte include the Northridge
Earthquake of 1994 (magnitude 6.7), Whittier Earthquake of 1987
(magnitude 5.9); and Landers Quake (magnitude 7.3).
Primary geologic hazards from earthquakes include ground shaking,
ground failure, and surface rupture. Ground shaking causes the most
damage (it is the primary cause of collapsed buildings) and has the potential
for the greatest loss of life. Ground failure involves the loss of cohesion of
soils (liquefaction), which may cause cracking or failure of foundations.
Surface rupture occurs when movement on a fault breaks through to the
surface. In other cases, the slow movement of faults can deform curbs,
streets, buildings, and structures. Although no fault crosses El Monte, the
City may have secondary hazards due to its geology and soil conditions.

      Public Health and Safety Element
      Slope Stability
      Slope stability is determined by a number of factors, including the slope,
      vegetative cover, wildfire, bedrock, soil, precipitation, and human
      alteration. Although landslides can be induced by seismic activity, the
      City’s terrain is relatively flat and the vast majority of El Monte is not
      located in an area where landslides are a hazard. According to the California
      Division of Mines and Geology, only the far northeastern corner (bordering
      Arcadia) contains overlapping areas where earthquake-induced landslides
      and liquefaction could potentially occur based on local geological,
      geotechnical, and groundwater conditions. Other areas of steep slopes are
      beyond the northern boundary, where deep quarries are in Irwindale.
      Liquefaction and Seismic Settlement
      Liquefaction occurs during moderate to great earthquakes, when ground
      shaking causes water-saturated soils to become fluid and loose strength,
      much like quicksand. Liquefaction is often responsible for damage to
      bridges, buildings, buried pipes, and underground storage tanks. Seismic
      settlement occurs when soil is compacted in response to ground shaking.
      Localities susceptible to liquefaction-induced damage are underlain by
      loose, water-saturated, granular sediment within 40 feet of the ground
      surface. Due to soil conditions and historical water table levels, El Monte is
      entirely in an area with a potential for permanent ground displacement, as
      illustrated in Figure PHS-1.
      Expansive and Compressible Soils
      Expansive soils swell when wet and shrink when dry. If the soil is on a
      slope, the top layer of soil can creep downhill or even cause a landslide.
      Poorly consolidated or highly compressible soils have low bearing
      capacities and are liable to differential settlement. Soil compression is an
      increase in stress from construction, foundation, or other means that results
      in a deformation and relocation of soil particles, and expulsion of water or
      air from void spaces. Younger soils, which include textured silty and sandy
      soils, contain less compacted sediments and are more susceptible to
      settlement. Based on soil types in the City, compressible soils may be
      present and a hazard for buildings in El Monte.

PHS-10 El Monte General Plan
Ground Subsidence
Subsidence related to human activities is typically the result of the
withdrawal of subsurface fluids such as oil and groundwater, oxidation of
organic materials such as peat and coal, and by hydroconsolidation (from
excessive irrigation) of loose, dry soils in a semiarid climate. Subsidence can
affect structures sensitive to slight changes in elevation or slope such as
highways, pipelines, sewers, and railroads. The current groundwater level
in El Monte is 30 to 50 feet below historical levels, which indicates that a
potential exists for subsidence. Subsidence could be regional in nature or
may be focused along the boundary of a groundwater basin or a buried
structural feature. Based on the information cited above, the potential for
subsidence-related ground fissures or cracking within the City is low.
Soil Erosion
Soil erosion is a natural process driven by water and wind. Soil erosion may
be a slow process that continues relatively unnoticed, or it may occur at an
alarming rate causing serious loss of topsoil. The rate and magnitude of soil
erosion by water is controlled by rainfall intensity and runoff, soil
erodibility, slope gradient and length, and vegetation cover. The City is
mostly built out, relatively flat, and with no hillsides that would be subject
to substantial soil erosion, landslides, and mudslides. A very small portion
of El Monte in the far northeastern corner bordering Arcadia contains areas
where earthquake-induced landslide could potentially occur. Thus, soil
erosion is not considered a pressing public health and safety issue.
Although we cannot prevent earthquakes, their destructive effects can be
minimized through proactive planning, building regulations, and disaster
preparedness. El Monte protects the public from earthquake damage
through planning, building regulations, inter-jurisdictional coordination,
and public education. The City’s natural hazards mitigation plan outlines
the course of action to be taken in case of a seismic event. The City is
responsible for adopting and enforcing a variety of building codes and
regulations to ensure that buildings are constructed and/or retrofitted
according to the best available building practices. El Monte participates in
multi-jurisdictional efforts to help coordinate emergency response and
planning. The City also provides public information to residents and
businesses.

       Goal PHS-1
       Adequate protection of public health and safety, infrastructure, and City
       facilities and services from earthquakes from geologic and seismic hazards.
       Policies
       PHS-1.1 Building Codes. Ensure that new and retrofitted buildings
                   comply with the most recently adopted City and state building
                   codes governing seismic safety and structural design to minimize
                   the potential for damage, personal injury, and loss from
                   earthquakes.
       PHS-1.2 Geotechnical Study. As necessary, require detailed geologic,
                   geotechnical, or soil investigations in areas of potential seismic or
                   geologic hazards as part of the environmental and/or development
                   review process.
       PHS-1.3 Structural Hazards. Mitigate structural hazards related to
                   seismic events through appropriate methods such as excavating
                   and refilling land with engineered fill, ground improvements,
                   structural design, and other appropriate mitigation.
       PHS-1.4 Critical Structures. Encourage Caltrans, Southern Pacific
                   Railroad, and local utility companies to regularly inspect and
                   strengthen (if needed) bridges, elevated roadways, freeways,
                   utilities, and other infrastructure susceptible to failure during an
                   earthquake.
       PHS-1.5 Critical Facilities. Ensure that police and fire stations,
                   emergency operations centers, communications centers,
                   reservoirs, medical facilities, and other essential structures and
                   facilities remain safe and in a state of readiness for seismic events.
       PHS-1.6 Public Education. Work with local schools, businesses, residents,
                   and community organizations to ensure that adequate
                   information on how to be prepared for hazards is available and
                   routinely distributed to the community.
       PHS-1.7 Emergency Response. Periodically conduct simulated
                   emergency response drills to hazards, concentrating on
                   interagency coordination needed to ensure that services will be
                   available to the community with minimal delay and overlap of
                   services.
PHS-12 El Monte General Plan
WATERSHED MANAGEMENT
El Monte is at the convergence of the San Gabriel River and the Rio Hondo
River watersheds. These rivers are fed by six washes and two creeks, which
originate in the mountains and entered urbanized areas below the foothills.
Historically, these wide, shallow rivers flowing from the mountains created
fertile alluvial plain and riparian woodland. Major storms during the early
1900s led to the implementation of flood control dams, debris basins, and
river channels. During the 1950s to the present, quarry operations further
altered the natural landscape.
Today, our understanding of watershed management has greatly improved
beyond the important function of reducing the potential of flooding.
Watersheds are very important because they provide critical services that
sustain and protect us: they supply drinking water from the San Gabriel
Valley Basin; they sustain habitat for plants and animals in places such as
Peck Water Conservation Park; and they provide areas of natural beauty
and support recreational uses, such as in the Whittier Narrows Area.

                                                El Monte is framed by two major dams and reservoirs that protect the
                                                community from floodwaters from the San Gabriel Mountains. The Santa
                                                Fe Dam and Reservoir is on the San Gabriel River two miles northeast of
                                                the City; the Whittier Narrows Dam is three miles south of the City of
                                                El Monte. The major threat from dams or reservoirs is flood inundation in
                                                the rare case of structural failure or breach. Figure PHS-2 shows the
                                                potential inundation zones that could result from dam failure or breach.
                                                Most of El Monte lies in a potential inundation zone. In the unlikely event
                                                of a dam breach or failure, waters would reach six feet in depth at the City’s

                                                Narrows in three hours from dam breach. The Office of Emergency
                                                Services outlines similar scenarios. Upstream inundation from the Whittier
                                                Narrows Dam could occur if the dam could not release water downstream,
                                                and water flows along the six washes flowed unimpeded into the dam.

                                                assume that the gravel pits do not significantly mitigate the threat or
                                                potential damage resulting from a flooding event.
                                                The Cobey-Alquist Floodplain Management Act encourages the planning,
                                                adoption, and enforcement of land use regulations to protect from flood
                                                hazards. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the
                                                City is designated as “No Special Flood Hazard Area, All Zone C.” This
                                                special designation corresponds to areas that are: (1) outside the 100-year
                                                floodplain; (2) protected from the 100-year flood by levees; or 3) subject to
                                                minimal flooding from sheet flow flooding or 100-year stream flooding. The
                                                City’s designation means that the threat of flooding potential is minimal.

                                                can still result in urban floods. Due to the highly urbanized nature of
   channels built by the Army Corps of          El Monte, a large number of impervious surfaces (e.g., buildings, roadways,

                                                flooding. The City’s six grade-separated railroad crossings are equipped
                                                with underpass pumps to divert flood water to storm drains.

Water Resources
Water supplies for the San Gabriel Valley come from three main sources:
local rainfall, reclaimed water, and imported sources. The San Gabriel
Valley water supply is derived through an intertwined network, which
involves the transport, percolation, storage, and conveyance of imported
sources, surface flows, and groundwater. Groundwater basins are the
primary means for water storage in the region and are recharged through
natural soil percolation, as well as through engineered spreading grounds.
El Monte’s drinking water meets state and federal quality standards.
However, the San Gabriel Water Basin still has five contaminated plumes.
This contamination has resulted in the closure of several wells. As
described later under hazards, the federal and California environmental
protection agencies have designated this site as a federal Superfund site. A
consortium of agencies, under the coordination of the San Gabriel Basin
Water Quality Authority, is coordinating cleanup activities.
El Monte’s water quality is also affected by other sources of pollution from
nonpoint sources, in particular urban runoff. Urban runoff drains from
roads, sidewalks, roofed structures, parking lots, industrial sites, etc. Rain
and/or irrigation can wash away the materials on top of these surfaces—oil,
grease, pesticides, metals, bacteria, toxic chemicals from automobiles or
industrial processes, garbage, and many other contaminants. These
pollutants sink into regional water recharge facilities and percolate into the
groundwater.
To reduce the amount and concentration of pollutants entering the rivers,
the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) mandates that cities
limit and reduce total maximum daily loads of contaminants from entering
the rivers. The RWQCB implements the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) goals to reduce the amount of stormwater
runoff. Under the NPDES Stormwater Permit issued to Los Angeles
County and its co-permittees, the City is required to implement local
programs to reduce urban runoff.
The Public Works Department enforces NPDES requirements in the El
Monte Municipal Code. The City requires most new development projects
to incorporate best management practices that minimize pollutant levels in
runoff and the total amount of runoff from their projects. The City is also
actively involved in educating businesses, residents, schools, and other
entities regarding the importance of proper disposal of waste to prevent
urban runoff into the Rio Hondo River, San Gabriel River, and other inlets.

                                                 its potential is not fully realized. Its 100-acre lake can enhance compliance
                                                 with regional stormwater management and provide recreational water uses.

                                                 for the more than 300 bird species at the park. Restoring this unique park
                                                 will require bold leadership and multi-jurisdictional cooperation.

       AIR QUALITY
       Since passage of the federal Clean Air Act in 1970, we have become
       increasingly concerned about the quality of the air we breathe. For many
       years prior to the Clean Air Act, El Monte residents observed the brownish
       haze that obscured views of the San Gabriel Mountains and made it more
       difficult to breathe during outdoor exercise. In other areas of the City,
       pollution from nearby industries raised concern as well. Although San
       Gabriel Valley’s air quality has improved since then, air quality remains a
       concern of El Monte residents, particularly for children and seniors.
       Air Quality Setting
       El Monte is located within the South Coast Air Basin, a coastal plain with
       connecting broad valleys and low hills. The region lies in the semi–
       permanent high-pressure zone of the eastern Pacific. The San Gabriel
       Valley has occasional periods of extremely hot weather, winter storms, or
       Santa Ana wind conditions. Although the basin has a semiarid climate, the
       presence of a shallow marine layer, low average wind speeds, and frequent
       temperature inversions limit the dispersion of air pollutants. In the San
       Gabriel Valley, the combination of low wind speeds and low-level
       inversions produces the greatest pollutant concentrations.
       Air pollution consists of different components. Ozone is produced when
       pollutants from cars, power plants, industrial activities, and other sources
       react with sunlight. Particulate matter is produced by combustion from
       motor vehicles, forest fires, and industrial processes. Carbon monoxide is
       produced by vehicle emissions and other industrial processes. Sulfur
       dioxide is emitted from power plants and industrial processes that burn
       sulfur-containing fuels like coal and oil. Lead, produced by leaded gasoline
       before state and federal automobile emission standards, often originates
       from utility plants.
       Why care about air pollution? All of us live with air pollution today. Many
       people experience some kind of air pollution–related symptoms such as
       watery eyes, coughing, or wheezing. Even for healthy people, polluted air
       can cause respiratory irritation or breathing difficulties during outdoor
       activities. However, we now understand that unhealthful air has been
       linked to a number of chronic health conditions, including diminished
       lung capacity, higher frequency of asthma, and lower immune responses. In
       extreme cases, air pollution has been linked to cancer and shortened
       lifespan for people exposed to certain pollutants.
PHS-20 El Monte General Plan

Air Quality Hazards
As an urbanized community, El Monte is surrounded by various industries
that produce air pollutants that affect residents and business. This section
describes some of the primary sources of air pollution, while the following
section describes the regulatory framework.
Mobile Sources of Pollution
Mobile sources produce approximately 80 percent of all air pollutants in the
South Coast Air Basin. These include automobiles, trucks, airports,
railroads, and buses. El Monte is well served by roads, freeways, rail and
airport, and air pollution from mobile sources is a critical concern for the El
Monte community. Some of the greatest sources of pollutants are
particulate matter, produced by combustion from motor vehicles
(particularly diesel) and carbon monoxide, also produced by vehicle
emissions. Such pollutants are associated with respiratory ailments and
diminished lung functioning.
Stationary Sources of Pollution
Stationary sources (e.g., manufacturers, quarries) can also produce a wide
variety of pollutants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tracks
toxic chemical releases and waste management activities reported annually
by certain industries and federal facilities. Two dozen businesses in El
Monte emit a wide array of regulated pollutants, including chromium,
nickel, lead, copper, phenol, zinc compounds, and others. These include
manufacturers (chrome platers, landfills, dry cleaners, etc.) and various
other smaller yet important sources of air emissions.
Specific Industries and Mobile Sources
El Monte is also situated near several unique stationary sources of air
emissions. Surrounding El Monte are the Puente and Montebello landfills,
which are known to emit large quantities of methane, carbon dioxide, and
other gases. El Monte is also home to several heavy industrial companies
and manufacturers that contribute to air pollution. Some industries
produce chromium, lead, copper, and other pollutants known to have
adverse health effects. Moreover, gravel quarries are located in communities
surrounding or adjacent to El Monte, and residents have expressed concern
over the unknown long-term impacts of silica and dust.

                                    Regulatory Framework
                                    The federal Clean Air Act (CAA) sets national ambient air quality standards
                                    (NAAQS) for six pollutants: carbon monoxide, ozone, particulates, nitrogen
                                    oxides, sulfur dioxide, and lead. The CAA requires designated agencies in
                                    any region of the nation not meeting NAAQS to prepare a plan to bring the
                                    area into compliance with all national standards. In the Basin, the
                                    designated agency is the South Coast Air Quality Management District
                                    (SCAQMD).
                                    In 1988, the California Legislature enacted the California Clean Air Act.
                                    This act established a legal mandate to achieve health-based state air quality
                                    standards, which are more health protective than national standards, at the

Local Programs
The City recognizes that clean and healthful air quality is of fundamental
importance to our health and quality of life. The City is committed to
ensuring healthful air by reducing or eliminating land use conflicts, making
changes to the natural environment, implementing transportation demand
management programs, and cooperating with other communities to reduce
air pollution and ensure that regulators address issues of local concern.
Land Use
The location and placement of sensitive land uses are not regulated by
regional, state, or federal agencies. Thus, the City must take a leadership
role. CARB’s Air Quality and Land Use Handbook: A Community Health
Perspective provides siting criteria for sensitive land uses. This guide
recommends specific distances between residential uses and high volume
roadways, distribution centers, chrome platers and heavy manufacturers,
dry cleaners using certain chemicals, and large-volume gas stations. The
City will utilize guidelines to assess the potential health risks of certain
land uses and mitigations required.
Clean-Burning Fuels
The City is committed to promoting alternative fuels and transportation
demand programs to meet SCAQMD air quality improvement goals.
El Monte implements specific programs to reduce air pollution from mobile
sources, particularly transit. The City currently operates a fleet of 26
vehicles that run on compressed natural gas rather than fossil fuels. El
Monte also requires its refuse haulers to operate vehicles that use
compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas, dual fuel vehicles, or other
alternative fuel vehicles with similar emission performance standards.
Natural Landscape
A recent study from UCLA’s Institute of the Environment indicates that
many contaminants that affect water quality are initially airborne. Leafy
tree canopies intercept some of these contaminants, preventing them from
ever reaching our water resources. Additionally, plants and trees can absorb
CO2 and other pollutants and offset high emissions from high traffic routes,
such as freeways. The Parks and Recreation Element commits the City to
initiating a reforesting program to reclaim El Monte’s heritage as a wooded
place between the rivers and provide air quality benefits.

       strategies, and cooperation with regional agencies.
       Policies
       PHS-3.1 Land Use. As a condition for siting or expanding operations in
                  El Monte, require air pollution emitters to evaluate and fully
                  mitigate the impacts of their operations on schools, homes,
                  medical facilities, child care centers, and other sensitive
                  receptors.
       PHS-3.2 Sensitive Receptors. Utilize CARB recommendations to evaluate
                  the siting of dry cleaners, chrome platers, large gas stations,
                  freeways, and other high pollutant sources near residences, health
                  care facilities, schools, and other sensitive land uses.
       PHS-3.3 Community Forest. As prescribed in the Parks and Recreation
                  Element, enhance the City’s community forest by planting trees
                  along all roadways as a means to help filter air pollutants, clean
                  the air, and provide other health benefits to the community.
       PHS-3.4 Transportation. Encourage alternative modes of travel to work
                  and school by maximizing transit service, purchasing alternative
                  fuel vehicles, completing all sidewalks, and creating a network of
                  multiuse trails and bicycle paths.
       PHS-3.5 Regional Coordination. Work cooperatively with cities through
                  the San Gabriel Valley Council of Governments to address inter-
                  jurisdictional and regional issues of air quality, including mobile
                  and stationary sources of air pollution.
       PHS-3.6 Health Risk Assessment. Require that projects for new
                  industries or expansion of industries that produce air pollutants
                  conduct a health risk assessment and establish appropriate
                  mitigation prior to approval of new construction, rehabilitation,
                  or expansion permits.
       PHS-3.7 Quarries. Work through regional entities to advocate for the
                  continued monitoring of the quarries, development of
                  technologies for measuring air emissions, and the institution of
                  appropriate mitigation if risks are found.

TRANSPORTATION SAFETY
The City of El Monte has a multifaceted transportation network consisting
of streets, freeways, rail lines, and bicycle and pedestrian routes that
provide a range of choices for residents and businesses. While providing a
high level of mobility, these systems also pose potential safety risks to
residents, visitors, and the local workforce.
Railroad Safety
The City of El Monte has a long history of involvement with railroads,
dating back to the original Red Car that traveled along Ramona Boulevard.
Today, the City of El Monte is home to several railroad lines that cross
through the community and provide freight and passenger service to
residents, business, and commuters. Although railroads create enhanced
transportation options for El Monte, they can also create significant safety
concerns for pedestrians and motor vehicles crossing railroad rights-of-way.
The Alameda Corridor East (ACE) Project is a program to improve railroad
access from the Port of Long Beach to Los Angeles and the Inland Empire.
The City has five grade-separated rail crossings and five at-grade crossings.
                                                                                 Future Grade Separation
Although no railroad accidents have occurred to date, a significant increase
in rail activity presents a potential safety concern. The City is working with   El Monte is working with ACE to complete the
the ACE to improve safety by: first, to create grade-separated rail crossings    future grade separations at key intersections.
and second, to integrate roadway-rail traffic control systems and roadway
traffic management systems that will provide better warning of trains.
Street and Pedestrian Safety
El Monte is largely defined by its extensive roadway network: more than
151 miles of roadways cross the community. The abundance of roads and
various right-of-way alignments make vehicle travel the most common form
of transportation and greatest safety concern. Approximately 1,600 auto
collisions occur each year in El Monte, of which more than one-third
involves injuries. Fifteen critical intersections and roadway segments are
responsible for approximately 75 percent of all accidents.
The City of El Monte Police Department is responsible for patrolling
roadways and enforcing traffic safety laws. The department also makes
presentations to improve street safety. The City’s Traffic Committee, made
up of City department representatives, is also responsible for touring the
City on a periodic basis to evaluate requests for traffic control
enhancements (e.g., stop signs, red curbs, speed bumps), meet with various
stakeholders and the public, and recommend public safety improvements.

                                               plan and will have installed sidewalks throughout the City by 2011.
                                               Crossing guards are placed at critical street intersections to ensure that
                                               children can walk safely to and from school. This General Plan also
                                               proposes alternative bicycle routes along less-congested residential streets.
                                               Finally, crosswalks, speed bumps, and electronic monitors are installed
                                               throughout the community to reduce the incidence of speeding.
                                               Airport Safety
                                               The El Monte Airport is adjacent to the Rio Hondo River and Santa Anita
                                               Boulevard. The Los Angeles County Airport Land Use Commission has
                                               established runway protection zones on either end of the airport, the areas
                                               most likely to experience an airplane crash. Within this zone, the Federal
                                               Aviation Administration recommends restrictions to development height
                                               and type, events that gather people, or activities that could cause or
                                               contribute to damages of airplane crashes. The runway protection zones do
                                               not extend outside the airport property; therefore, it is not anticipated that
                                               land uses would conflict with ongoing aviation operations.
  El Monte Airport
  The El Monte Airport Runway Protection Zone
  runs parallel to the northerly and southerly
  portions of the runway, ending generally at
  the property line abutting the airport.
                                               The following goal and policies are intended to ensure safe and efficient

Goal PHS-4
Adequate protection and safety from the hazards of airway, roadway, and
railroad through a balance of land use patterns, project design, improved
technology, capital improvements, public education, and law enforcement.
Policies
PHS-4.1 Railroad Safety. Maximize the safety of railroads in the
          community by pursuing grade-separated crossing as the first
          priority for reducing street and railroad conflicts; second, by
          pursuing Jump-Start projects; and third, by use of other
          technology.
PHS-4.2 Pedestrian Safety. Enhance pedestrian safety by completing
          sidewalks, identifying areas for crosswalks and signaling, and
          prioritizing the funding, construction, and maintenance of safe
          routes to schools, parks, and public facilities.
PHS-4.3 Bicyclist Safety. Improve bicycle safety by creating well-defined
          bicycle lanes, working with the school districts to educate
          children about safe cycling practices, and providing information
          about safe routes to school.
PHS-4.4 Streetscape Design. Develop detailed standards and guidelines
          for the treatment of public streetscapes to improve safety and
          walkability. Recommendations should address street trees, street
          lighting, street furniture, traffic calming, and related items.
PHS-4.5 Traffic Safety. Improve traffic safety on City streets through the
          use of advanced technology, signal timing, remote sensoring at
          critical intersections, and more frequent sweeps for drivers
          operating vehicles while under the influence of substances.
PHS-4.6 Traffic Safety Committee. Enhance the role and membership of
          the Traffic Safety Committee to include public, private, and
          neighborhood groups to facilitate innovative and proven
          solutions to reduce the incidence of accidents for all
          transportation modes.
PHS-4.7 Airport Safety. Maintain runway protection zones identical to
          the FAA’s zone and prohibit land uses, structures, intensification
          of current land uses, or other activities within that zone that
          could present potential hazard concerns under FAA guidelines.

       Public Health and Safety Element
       HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND WASTE
       Hazardous material is material that, because of its quality, concentration, or
       physical/chemical characteristics, poses a potential significant hazard to
       human health or the environment. Hazardous materials include waste
       labeled as toxic, poisonous, corrosive, flammable, combustible, or irritant.
       These materials require special methods of storage and treatment; improper
       disposal or handling harms people and pollutes the ground, water, and air.
       Industry
       The City of El Monte is home to industries that use large amounts of
       hazardous materials that pose threats to public health. The EPA identifies
       more than 20 businesses that are known to release toxic chemicals via air
       emissions, surface water discharges, releases to land, underground
       injections, and transfers to off-site locations. The EPA monitors these
       industrial facilities to ensure that their annual emission concentrations and
       limits are not exceeded, to protect the health and safety of residents.
       Many businesses use underground storage tanks for hazardous materials
       such as gasoline, solvents, oil, and other chemicals. According to the EPA,
       18 leaking underground fuel tanks are located in El Monte and 37
       underground storage tank sites are on the Spills, Leaks, Investigations and
       Cleanups list, which includes aboveground storage tank sites where soil or
       groundwater contamination has occurred. Safe handling, storage,
       transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes are critical.
       The County Fire Department administers the Hazardous Waste Generator
       Program, Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory,
       California Accidental Release Prevention Program (CalARP), and Storage
       Tank Programs. The department also permits and inspects businesses that
       handle, treat, transport, and dispose of hazardous wastes and provides 24-
       hour emergency response to hazardous materials incidents. The department
       administers and enforces the CalARP Program to ensure that high-risk
       facilities and substances implement appropriate risk management plans.
       Hazardous materials pass through El Monte on local freeways (I-10, SR-60,
       and I-605), rail lines, and various major arterials. The City does not have
       the authority to regulate the transport of hazardous materials. Instead, the
       U.S. Department of Transportation and EPA set standards for transporters
       of hazardous waste, and the State of California regulates the transportation
       of hazardous waste. Transporters are required to display warning placards
       to comply with various state and federal regulations.
PHS-28 El Monte General Plan
Superfund Site
Groundwater contamination has long been an issue for the San Gabriel
Valley. The San Gabriel Basin groundwater is presently contaminated from
the disposal of synthetic organic compounds used primarily as solvents in
industrial and commercial activities. The EPA has therefore designated
portions of the San Gabriel Basin, including El Monte, as federal Superfund
sites for cleanup and remediation. The EPA has established the El Monte
Operable Unit (EMOU) covering affected areas in El Monte and has
prepared a specific plan of preferred methods for treating groundwater.
The EMOU investigation phase is complete and the remedial objectives
specified in an EPA Interim Record of Decision. This operable unit is
characterized by volatile organic compound (VOC) contamination in the
shallow zone that is mostly contained in the upper 100 feet of the aquifer.
Limited amounts of VOC contamination and perchlorate have migrated
into the deeper drinking water supplies. Additional toxic contaminants
have been found, including hexavalent chromium, nitrosodimythlamine,
N-nitrosodimethylamine, and dioxane.
The San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority is responsible to develop,
finance, and implement groundwater treatment programs in the Basin. The
WQA prepares an annual Basin Groundwater Quality Management and
Remediation Plan consistent with EPA’s National Contingency Plan,
Records of Decision, and requirements of the Regional Water Quality
Control Board. The WQA is working with the EPA, water purveyors, and
potentially responsible parties to facilitate the cleanup of groundwater
contamination in the most expedited manner possible.
The City of El Monte is committed to ensuring safe and healthful water
despite these contaminants. As required by state law, the City regularly
monitors the quality of its drinking water supply and it currently meets or
exceeds all water quality standards promulgated by the state and federal
government. The City also conducts monthly water quality testing to
ensure that the water supply remains safe. The City has adequate plans in
place to identify any contaminants and remedy the situation.
Figure PHS-3, following the goals and policies, shows the location of the El
Monte Superfund site, the primary contaminants involved, and the general
extent of contamination. More specific information on the precise location,
type, and extent of groundwater contamination and remedial measures can
be obtained from the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority and the
California Environmental Protection Agency.

DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, RESPONSE, AND RECOVERY
El Monte is subject to environmental and manmade hazards that pose risks
to life and property—underscoring the importance of effective emergency
management. Management of emergencies and disasters consists of three
phases: (1) mitigation of potential hazards and event preparedness;
(2) response during or soon after the event, and (3) postevent recovery. The
City participates in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery as follows.
Intergovernmental Coordination
Emergency response requires coordination of many agencies, including
medical, health, fire and rescue, police, and public works. Thus,
intergovernmental coordination is essential. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency is charged to provide assistance in federally declared
disasters. At the state level, the California Office of Emergency Services
(OES) performs similar services on a smaller scale by assisting cities in
emergency preparedness, response and recovery efforts, public information,
and coordination of the statewide mutual aid system.
Los Angeles County is the emergency operational area coordinator, and is
responsible for coordinating emergency response efforts for all local
governments within its service area and initiating mutual aid services. The
City participates in mutual aid agreements with other public agencies to
meet demands for emergency services, hospital needs, and even protection
from terrorism. The City also participates in the state OES mutual aid and
disaster management program and is currently assigned by the OES to
Operational Area D.
Critical and Essential Facilities and Lifelines
Certain facilities are critical in disaster planning and recovery efforts.
Lifelines are services critical to a city’s health, safety, and functioning, such
as water, sewer, energy, communications, transportation (highways,
bridges, railroads, and airports), etc. Essential facilities include police and
fire stations, emergency operations centers, generators, communications
centers, substations, water supply and transmission infrastructure, and
other facilities needed during and after an emergency. The City’s
emergency operations center is located at City Hall.
Three major hospitals would serve El Monte residents during a disaster.
The Greater El Monte Community Hospital, just south of the City’s border
in South El Monte, is a 117-bed facility with an emergency room. Arcadia
Methodist Hospital is a 450-bed medical facility just minutes north of
El Monte. Kaiser Permanente’s Baldwin Park Medical Campus, near the
                                                              El Monte General Plan PHS-33

       Public Health and Safety Element
       juncture of I-10 and I-605, is a 172-bed, full-fledged medical facility.
       Pasadena also has several hospitals, including Huntington Medical, which
       is located about 30 minutes from the City of El Monte.
       Community Partners
       The American Red Cross provides emergency response support to El Monte
       for situations ranging from a single residential fire to community-wide
       disaster relief. The Red Cross has an area disaster action team coordinator
       who responds to emergencies within an hour of notification to estimate the
       damage and the need for further relief. The Red Cross assists with
       evacuations, works with school districts to assess damage, provides shelter
       for families left homeless by a disaster, and provides referrals to affected
       households that need further assistance from state and federal agencies
       Emergency Planning and Preparedness
       The City of El Monte’s Emergency Services Office plays a key role in
       disaster preparedness, response, and recovery activities in the community.
       The City’s emergency operations center at City Hall is responsible to
       coordinate emergency response efforts. The Office prepares and updates its
       natural hazards mitigation plan, which identifies the most prominent threat
       of natural hazards in El Monte, provides protocols and operations to be
       followed by City agencies and hazard mitigation plans, addresses and
       delegates responsibility from local to national government, divides
       operations procedures into various stages of preparedness and response, and
       provides appropriate evacuation routes. The contents correspond to the
       state’s Standardized Emergency Management System Multi-Hazard
       Functional Plan (SEMS).
       Figure PHS-4 summarizes the emergency planning infrastructure in
       El Monte, and shows the major evacuation routes and critical facilities.
       Following the figure is a presentation of a goal and supporting policies to
       address emergency planning issues in El Monte.

       NOISE LEVELS
       Like all highly urbanized areas, the City of El Monte is subject to noise
       from a myriad of sources. These include roadways, the airport, industry,
       and industry. The presence of these noise sources is particularly acute
       because many of the City’s residential neighborhoods are located in close
       proximity to sources of noise. The major sources of noise in El Monte are:
       Roadways
       The City major arterials include Valley Boulevard, Peck Road, Durfee
       Avenue, Garvey Avenue, Santa Anita Avenue, Ramona Boulevard, Lower
       Azusa Road, Baldwin Avenue, Arden Drive, Tyler Avenue, Cogswell Road,
       and Merced Avenue. Noise from these roads is bounded by less noise
       sensitive commercial uses, except for homes along Lower Azusa, Peck,
       Tyler, and Arden. The City is also bisected by I-10, which produces
       unacceptable levels of noise often exceeding 65 CNEL.
       Railroads
       The Southern Pacific Railroad passes through the center and northwest
       portion of El Monte and carries passenger and freight trains. The Union
       Pacific Railroad (UPRR) also contributes to noise from freight and
       Metrolink commuter trains. The UPRR heads northwest/southeast through
       the center of the City. The Metrolink line follows the I-10 until the Rio
       Hondo River, then heads north to join UPRR. These trains generate noise
       from locomotive engines and railcars often in excess of 65 CNEL.
       El Monte Airport
       El Monte Airport is located along the Rio Hondo River in north El Monte.
       This general aviation airport generates noise primarily along the flight path
       from aircraft landings and departures. Landings and takeoffs occur to the
       north/south with planes generally flying east over the City. Noise from this
       general aviation airport, while noticeable, is less than the noise produced
       from jets at larger commercial airports. Generally, the 1991 General Plan
       found that no residential uses fall within the 65 CNEL noise contour.
       Stationary Sources
       Stationary noise sources include a variety of industrial uses, primarily
       located in the Northwest Redevelopment Project Area. The primary sources
       of stationary noise would be from machinery used in industries, heating-
       ventilation-air conditioning units, generators, and other equipment. Many
       of these industrial uses have scaled back operations or vacated the area.
       Still, the level of noise from industrial uses can be significant and impact
       residential areas located adjacent to them, such as in Arden Village.

Explanatory Notes
      Normally Acceptable: Specified land use is satisfactory based on the assumption that any buildings
      involved are of conventional construction, without special noise insulation requirements.
      Conditionally Acceptable: New construction should be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of
      the noise reduction requirements and needed noise insulation features are included in the design.
      Normally Unacceptable: New construction should be discouraged, unless a detailed analysis of
      noise reduction requirements is made and needed insulation features are fully included in the design.
      Clearly Unacceptable: New construction or development should generally not be undertaken.

       Public Health and Safety Element
       Primary noise sources in the City will not go away. The City will utilize the
       noise/land use compatibility guidelines outlined in Table PHS-1
       (Noise/Land Use Compatibility Criteria) in making land use decisions.
       These compatibility guidelines show a range of noise standards for various
       land use categories. Depending on the ambient environment, these basic
       guidelines may be tailored for existing noise and land use characteristics.
       The matrix defines noise in terms of CNEL and expressed in dB that
       measure sound intensity. Noise levels occurring during nighttime hours are
       weighted more heavily than during the daytime.
       The City Municipal Code sets forth stricter noise standards (Table PHS-2)
       than the State of California and is preempted by the federal government
       from establishing stricter noise standards. City noise standards are not to be
       exceeded by 10 dBA for a cumulative period of 1 minute in any hour, or by
       15 dBA for any period of time (less than one minute in an hour). These
       standards do not apply to noise that is preempted by State or federal
       standards. The City also limits the use of power construction tools or
       equipment to certain timeframes, unless performing emergency work.

       The City has no direct control over noise produced by trucks, cars and
       trains because State and Federal regulations preempt local laws. Given that
       the City cannot control this noise at the source, City noise programs focus
       on reducing the impact of transportation noise along freeways, arterial
       roadways, and rail corridors. Site planning, landscaping, topography and
       the design and construction of noise barriers will be used where feasible to
       minimize noise from vehicular traffic. Setbacks and buffers can also be used
       to achieve noise reduction. Where other noise mitigation methods are
       possible and feasible, the City will consider such methods.
       Figures PHS-5 show the future noise contours in El Monte that may
       determine the need for mitigation. The following goal and policies set the
       City’s priorities for furthering a peaceful living environment in El Monte.

7. Health and Wellness Element
   Introduction
   Vision El Monte… a community where residents live longer, healthier
   lives; a city where superior air quality supports respiratory health; a place with a
   safe and effective transportation system with diverse travel choices; a city that
   promotes physical activity with a complete network of parks, trails, and open
   spaces, as well as extensive walking and cycling routes; an environment that
   provides convenient access to healthy foods; neighborhoods where people feel
   safe; and a community with affordable and high-quality health care and mental
   health services.
   CREATING A HEALTHY COMMUNITY
   The Health and Wellness Element is about improving the health of El Monte’s
   citizens by creating an environment that promotes physical activity, reduces air
   pollution, provides transportation choices, makes healthy foods easy to get,
   maintains public safety, and ensures access to necessary medical services. The
   goals of this element are to:
       Improve the overall health of residents—fostering education,
        collaborations, and partnerships that promote positive health outcomes; and
        investing in the mental and physical health of El Monte residents from
        seniors to small children.
       Enhance land use and community design for health—promoting physical
        activity, encouraging pedestrian- and transit-oriented development patterns,
        reducing concentrations of poverty and overcrowding, and beautifying the
        City.
                                                                  El Monte General Plan HW-1

     Health and Wellness Element
        Create a healthy transportation system—reducing transportation-
         related injuries, expanding walking and bicycle networks, providing
         children with safe access to schools and parks, and promoting active
         transportation choices.
        Increase the amount of parks, trails, and public facilities—building
         new parks, improving existing parks and facilities, and supporting
         recreation programs that help promote physical activity.
        Safe and convenient access to healthy foods—creating an incentive
         program to increase healthy food choices, promoting distribution of
         nutritional information at food outlets, increasing healthy food choices
         at City vending machines and public events, identifying healthy food
         outlets and supporting farmers’ markets.
        Foster respiratory health and improve air quality—enhancing land use
         patterns to reduce driving; minimizing residents’ exposure to air
         contaminants; promoting transit; and walking, cycling and other active
         transportation.
        Increase access to healthcare and mental health care—encouraging
         early preventative care, providing transportation and mobile access to
         health care, and encouraging co-location of new health facilities with
         health and mental services.
        Involve the public in the decision-making process—encouraging greater
         participation from citizens by sponsoring events, festivals, and
         education programs; communicating with residents regarding planning
         and transportation issues; and fostering social cohesion.
     PURPOSE OF ELEMENT
     One of the City government’s primary roles is to create a safe and healthy
     community for El Monte residents. The goals and policies in this element
     promote a healthy environment by addressing public health issues that
     have major intersections with planning. Altering land use patterns to
     increase physical activity, improve air quality, and create a healthy
     transportation system are all ways to ensure a healthier population.
     Moreover, providing access to healthy foods, ensuring public safety, and
     providing health and mental health care services can also help grow a
     healthier, more vibrant community. The Health and Wellness Element
     offers policies for moving El Monte towards a healthier future.
HW-2 El Monte General Plan

EL MONTE SPEAKS
The El Monte community and key stakeholders were deeply involved with
the formulation of the Health and Wellness Element. Public input was
provided by a Technical Advisory Group and public workshops. The
Technical Advisory Group had over 60 members drawn from key El Monte
institutions including the school districts; the business community;
ministerial; community non-profits; and private, public, non-profit health
care providers. City staff from all key departments were also on the
committee. The Technical Advisory Group met four times during the
course of the development of the Health and Wellness Element to identify
key issues, develop policy direction and review the draft Element.
Community members provided additional input at two public workshops.
Approximately 150 community members attended the first workshop where
they identified key issues facing the community and articulated their vision
for a healthy El Monte. The following list summarizes the key issues from
the meeting:
   High rates of obesity, diabetes and asthma
   Lack of supermarkets and healthy food stores
   Lack of street lighting
   Unsafe areas of the community
   Lack of programs and activities for youth and seniors
   Lack of park space
   Lack of safe pathways to exercise and walk
   Overcrowding in residential areas
   Too many fast food restaurants
   Lack of sidewalks and bike lanes
   Stray dogs
   Unattractive and blighted areas of the City
   Air pollution, especially near some parks and residential areas
   Too much traffic
   Speeding on City streets, especially in residential areas

     Health and Wellness Element
     These key issues were used by the consultant team to define potential goals
     and policies, which were included in the Health and Wellness Element. At
     the second public workshop, the community responded to the proposed
     policies and identified their top priorities for the community. The highest
     priority goals identified by the public at the second workshop were to:
     1. Reduce air pollution throughout the City.
     2. Increase community facilities and programs in El Monte that promote
         healthy and active living.
     3. Ensure that children have safe access to schools and parks.
     4. Continue outreach and public education programs to improve health.
     5. Develop land use patterns that encourage physical activity.
     6. Facilitate safe, convenient access to healthy foods.
     7. Create a high quality pedestrian network so residents can walk and bike
         safely and comfortably.
     The input from the workshops and from the Technical Advisory Group
     guided the development of the Health and Wellness Element. The goals
     flow directly from the priorities received from the public and the policies
     seek to implement the changes desired in critical health areas.
HW-4 El Monte General Plan
Health and Wellness Context
This section provides background information and existing conditions for
El Monte on a variety of topics related to health and development patterns
of the City. It includes a discussion of how the built environment impacts
health outcomes and the existing health conditions in El Monte.
BACKGROUND ON HEALTH AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
The increased prevalence of chronic diseases in the United States—
including diabetes, obesity, heart disease and respiratory illnesses—has
been widely recognized as one of the nation’s major social and economic
challenges. Recent research has found that people’s environments—where
they live and work, how they travel, what they eat and where and when they
play, socialize, and are physically active—have a major impact on their
health and well-being. Although poor city design is not the single cause of
chronic health problems in the United States, there is increasing evidence
that it is often a contributing factor. Some examples of the connections
between these chronic diseases include:
   Heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes are among the top ten causes
    of death in California. Limited physical activity and poor nutrition are
    major risk factors for these diseases.
   Research indicates that separating residential and commercial uses,
    low-density development, streets constructed primarily for automobiles,
    and limited transportation choices discourage physical activity.
   Neighborhoods lacking parks and active recreation facilities also have
    lower levels of physical activity.
   Development policies can also have an impact on access to nutritious
    food sources. Limited access to grocery stores, farmers’ markets,
    community gardens and other sources of nutritious foods and high
    concentrations of unhealthy food sources—such as fast food restaurants
    and corner stores with limited fresh food choices–can exacerbate poor
    nutritional intake.
   Physical inactivity and poor nutrition are also a primary risk factor for
    obesity (the fastest-growing disease in California, along with diabetes),
    and obesity in turn increases the risk of a myriad of chronic diseases.
Land uses and city design have other health impacts as well. Development
patterns and access to transportation choices have been shown to
                                                          El Monte General Plan HW-5

                                    Health and Wellness Element
                                    significantly impact the number of miles traveled by automobile, which in
                                    turn have been linked to levels of vehicle emissions and traffic accidents.
                                    Emissions from transportation sources are strongly linked with respiratory
                                    diseases, while automobile accidents consistently kill over 40,000

OVERALL HEALTH IN EL MONTE
The overall health and wellness of the population of El Monte is analyzed
in this section through a number of indicators including:
   Obesity and overweight statistics
   Diabetes
   Heart disease
   Levels of physical activity
This section focuses on assessing health issues that have been linked to
environmental factors.
Obesity
Obesity and overweight have significant consequences for health and            Overweight is defined as a body

increases to reach the levels referred to as "overweight" and "obese," risks   higher.

   Coronary heart disease                                                     Obese is defined as a BMI of 30

   Type 2 diabetes
   Cancer
   Hypertension
   Stroke
   Asthma and many other chronic illnessesiii
More than two-thirds (66.8%) of adults in El Monte were either obese or
overweight in 2007. iv This percentage is higher than that of adults in Los
Angeles (LA County) and the State as a whole, which had rates of
overweight and obesity of 58.1% and 61.3%, respectively. The percentage of
adults in El Monte that are obese (37.1%) is considerably higher than adults
in California (22.6%) and in the nation (30%). The rates of obesity and
overweight are also very high in El Monte. Nearly half (47.7%) of children
are either obese or overweight. v Of these, 27.9 % are obese compared to
22.9% of children in LA County as a whole. vi Overall, these trends indicate
that El Monte residents are at a higher risk for many chronic diseases.

     Chronic Disease
     As with obesity and overweight, diabetes is associated with an increased
     risk for a number of serious, sometimes life-threatening, complications.
     Like obesity and overweight, diabetes appears to be a problem in El Monte
     as approximately 12.5% of adults were diagnosed with diabetes in 2007. vii
     This percentage is approximately 50% higher than the County (8.7%), State
     (8.5%), and national percentages (8.2%).viii

     residents are at a higher risk for many chronic diseases.
HW-8 El Monte General Plan
Another significant health issue in El Monte appears to be undiagnosed
heart disease. In El Monte, 25% of adults were diagnosed with
hypertension in 2007. ix This percentage is comparable to LA County
where 24.7% of adults were diagnosed with the disease. However, data on
hospitalizations for heart attacks is much higher in El Monte than in the
County as a whole. As is shown in Table 1, the age-adjusted rate for heart
attack-related hospitalizations for adults over 45 was significantly higher in
El Monte zip codes than in the County. These figures may indicate that
there are significant number of undiagnosed cases of hypertension and
heart disease in El Monte.

  LA County                           39.9%
Physical Activity
A final indicator of health conditions is the level of physical activity of
residents. Lack of physical activity is a primary risk factor for heart disease,
cancer, stroke, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease—five of the top ten causes
of death in California and in El Monte. It is also a primary risk factor for
obesity and diabetes, the fastest-growing diseases in the State and a major
issue in El Monte.
In El Monte, only 57.7% of adults meet physical activity guidelines and
36.8% are not active at all. Although this number shows that El Monte
residents are a bit more active than residents of the State and County, it also
indicates that many people need additional exercise to meet minimum
health standards. For children, approximately 30% get the minimum
amount of exercise recommended by the Centers for Disease Control. This
number is significantly lower than the percentage for children in LA
County overall (37.6%). This lower level of activity in El Monte’s children
is a matter for concern because a pattern of inactivity often begins early in
life.

      Health and Wellness Element
      LAND USE AND COMMUNITY DESIGN
      As discussed in the Background on Health and the Built Environment
      sections, land use and community design can contribute to negative health
      outcomes. Healthier land use patterns, however, can be achieved by
      encouraging infill and locating destinations closer to housing, focusing
      development in mixed use districts and along major transit corridors,
      constructing a diverse mix of uses throughout the City, and encouraging
      land use patterns that promote walking, bicycling and transit use.
      Three key indicators of land use and community design for healthy
      communities were used to assess the development patterns in El Monte
      relative to health. These indicators are:
              The density and intensity of development
              Access to neighborhood destinations (or how well complementary
               land uses are mixed)
              Block size
      Density and Intensity of Development
      Most of the residential areas of El Monte have a population density between
      13 and 26 people per acre and some parts of the City have even higher
      residential densities—from 26 to 52 people per acre. These densities are
      sufficient to support walking as a major form of transportation if the rest of
      the walking environment (e.g., land use mix, quality of the walking
      environment, street network and other elements discussed in this report) is
      sufficiently high quality. While the walking environment in some parts of
      the City is conducive to walking, many areas of El Monte lack the necessary
      amenities to be considered an attractive walking environment.
      Mixed Use
      In El Monte, 91% of the City’s residential parcels are within one-quarter
      mile of neighborhood services. In addition, with the exception of some
      parts of Norwood Cherrylee, River East and Park El Monte, most
      residential areas of the City are within one-quarter mile of a school. Overall,
      the mix of uses within walking distance of most residences is a very positive
      aspect of El Monte.
      Block Size
      Block size is yet another component of the built environment that
      determines the walkability of a city. Block size (that is the area of a city
      block) and block side length together determine how far people must walk
HW-10 El Monte General Plan

between street intersections. In general, shorter block side lengths (less
than 800 feet) and block sizes (less than 4 acres) are considered more
walkable than longer blocks. In El Monte, the Downtown is the only area of
town with an average block size of close to 4 acres (4.35 acres on average).
The average size of blocks throughout the rest of the City is 12 acres
(522,720 square feet), which is too large to be considered walkable. Such
large blocks, particularly in the predominantly residential subareas of the
City, reduce the appeal of walking to neighborhood destinations.
                                                         El Monte General Plan HW-11
      Health and Wellness Element
      TRANSPORTATION NETWORK
      The layout and safety of the transportation network can have a significant
      impact on the travel choices people make and thus on levels of physical
      activity, air pollution, and social capital in a community. Design and
      engineering also can have a significant effect on the safety of the
      transportation network. Communities that encourage a car-dependent
      lifestyle, marked by long commutes to work and significant distance from
      retail stores and public amenities, are prone to higher levels of health
      problems including air pollution, obesity, and social isolation. Conversely,
      communities that encourage multiple modes of transportation—by
      providing a complete, well-connected street network with multiple
      destinations and facilities for transit, bicycling and walking—can decrease
      vehicle miles traveled (VMT), decrease air pollution and increase physical
      activity in the community. The number of traffic-related accidents has also
      been linked to rates of VMT, automobile speed and traffic volumes. As
      these rates rise, so do accident rates. Thus, development patterns that
      increase VMT, vehicle speed, and traffic volume also increase accident
      rates.
      Prevalence of Automobile Use
      One measure of the health of the transportation system is the prevalence of
      automobile use (as measured in VMT) and the mode split (the percentage of
      driving versus other modes). More than half (51.3%) of LA County adults
      and almost two-thirds (65%) of El Monte Health District adults drive their
      cars to run errands within one mile of their homes. About ¼ of LA County
      adults (24.3%) report that they walk to do such errands. In addition, a
      higher percentage of El Monte residents walk (3.4%), take public
      transportation (5.5%), or other means (2.7%) than in the United States as a
      whole (2.9%, 4.8%, and 1.7% respectively)xi. Conversely, fewer El Monte
      residents drive alone to work than the average person in LA County (70.2%
      compared to 72. 3%). This information, along with interviews with
      stakeholders, indicates that walking, transit, and other modes such as
      bicycling are important means of transportation in the City of El Monte. xii
      Access to Transit
      Access to transit is another critical component of a healthy transportation
      system. The City of El Monte is well served by transit operators including
      Metro (the LA County Metropolitan Transportation Authority), Foothill
      Transit, Metrolink (commuter rail), and the City of El Monte’s Transit
      System. Two major regional transit facilities serve El Monte including the
      El Monte Bus Station and the El Monte Commuter Rail Station, which is a
      stop on the regional commuter rail line.xiii
HW-12 El Monte General Plan

Bicycle and Pedestrian Networks
Another measure of how well the transportation system will support health
is the presence and scope of bicycle and pedestrian networks. Combined
with an appropriate density and mix of uses, bicycle and pedestrian
networks can significantly increase the rates of bicycling and walking for
transportation purposes and result in positive health outcomes. Pedestrian
amenities to encourage walking (such as benches, shaded walkways, etc.) are
generally very limited in El Monte.
City staff estimates that approximately 35% of the City streets do not have
sidewalks. Other than sidewalks, there is no identified pedestrian trail
system connecting neighborhoods to each other or to major
destinations/activity centers.xiv In terms of bicycle facilities, the City of El
Monte currently has only two designated bicycle routes: one is located to
the east of the Rio Hondo channel; the other is on the west side of the San
Gabriel River. These paths are part of the regional system established and
maintained by LA County. The Parks and Recreation and Circulation
Elements of this General Plan provide a plan for an enlarged and enhanced
bicycle network.xv
Safety of the Transportation System
The final measure of how the transportation system affects health is the
overall safety of the system. Motor vehicle collisions are the leading cause of
accidental death in California; and being hit by a car while walking, is the
third leading cause of death for children under 12. For every mile traveled,
a pedestrian’s risk of dying is more than 15 times that of drivers, providing
a legitimate disincentive for walking. In El Monte between 2003 and 2007,
there were 28 motor vehicle collisions with fatalities. These collisions
mostly occurred on large arterial streets and were relatively evenly spaced
throughout the City. El Monte ranked in the top half of cities in the County
for collisions involving pedestrian injuries. Between 2003 and 2007, El
Monte had 238 motor vehicle collisions involving pedestrians; 229 of these
resulted in pedestrian injuries and 9 resulted in pedestrian fatalities.
Finally, El Monte ranked among the top third of cities in the County with
the highest bicycle injury and fatality rates per 10,000 residents. Between
2003 and 2007, El Monte had 319 motor vehicle collisions involving
bicycles; 317 of these resulted in bicyclist injuries and 2 resulted in bicyclist
fatalities.

      Health and Wellness Element
      PARKS AND OPEN SPACE
      Convenient, safe access to recreational facilities is directly correlated to an
      increase in the amount that people exercise. Creating new places for
      physical activity or improving their accessibility can increase the
      proportion of residents who exercise three times a week by 25%.xvi In
      addition to parks for active recreation, the mere presence of street trees,
      shrubs, and green open spaces can provide an important amenity for people.
      It is important for positive health outcomes that all urban environments,
      regardless of density or location, provide high-quality green spaces such as
      public parks and trails, street trees, and community gardens.
      El Monte has 11 local parks covering approximately 50 acres of land. The
      local park network includes three 10-acre parks (Lambert Park, Mountain
      View Park, and Pioneer Park). The remaining eight parks are each less than
      five acres in size. In addition, City residents have access to nearby regional
      parks including Peck Road Water Conservation Park, Whittier Narrows
      Recreation Area, and Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area.
      Measure of Parks
      One measure of the adequacy of parks is the ratio of acres of parks per
      thousand residents. The Trust for Public Land defines an area as “Park
      Deficient” if it has less than 3 acres per 1,000 residents. xvii The City of El
      Monte has 0.41 acres of park space per 1,000 residents. This ratio increases
      to approximately 0.94 acres of parks per 1,000 people if adjacent regional
      open space facilities are included in the calculation. Thus, El Monte has a
      deficiency of park space.
      Proximity of Parks to Residential Areas
      Another important measure of parks is the physical proximity of park
      space to where people live. Studies have found that people who live within
      walking distance (one-quarter mile) of a park are 25% more likely to meet
      the minimum weekly exercise recommendation of 30 minutes three times a
      week.xviii In El Monte, only 36% of El Monte’s residential parcels are within
      one-quarter mile of a park—a number that could be improved through
      targeted investment in smaller neighborhood parks throughout the
      community.

ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS
Unhealthy eating habits are a primary risk factor for five of the top ten
causes of death in California and three of the top ten causes of death in El
Monte. In LA County overall, there are over four times as many
“unhealthy” food outlets (e.g., fast food chains, restaurants, and
                                                                                  Food retailer is defined as any

      AIR QUALITY AND RESPIRATORY HEALTH
      Respiratory illnesses, including asthma, pneumonia, chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema and other chronic conditions, are a
      significant public health problem in the United States. Asthma and COPD
      are among the ten leading chronic conditions causing restricted physical
      activity. Between 2001 and 2005, the adult asthma rate increased by 12% in
      California; and the childhood asthma rate increased by 15%.xxvi In LA
      County, approximately 1,173,000 children and adults have been diagnosed
      with asthma. There are proportionally more people in El Monte diagnosed
      with asthma. In 2005, 9.8% of adults in El Monte were diagnosed with
      asthma compared to 6.5% of adults in LA County. Asthma hospitalizations
      and emergency department visits were also higher in El Monte, as shown in
      Table 3. This indicates that asthma is a major issue in the City.

      Sources of Pollution
      Polluted air, from stationary and mobile sources such as trucks and
      automobiles on freeways, is a primary trigger for asthma attacks and a
      major cause of asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, leukemia, and other
      respiratory illnesses. The two major sources of pollutants are heavy
      industrial areas and motor vehicles. Air and water pollutants have been
      linked to cancer, respiratory illness, reduced school performance, and other
      negative health impacts.xxviii The location and mix of land uses and
      transportation investments can all have an impact on environmental health.
      In particular, locating homes, schools and other sensitive land uses near
      (within 300 to 500 feet) heavy industrial areas and roads with high volumes
      of traffic can result in high levels of exposure to dangerous pollutants.
HW-18 El Monte General Plan
In El Monte, most residential parcels and schools are further than 500 feet
from heavy industry or truck routes, which are the primary source of local
air pollution in the City. However, in some parts of the City, sensitive uses
such as housing, school sites, or special care facilities, are located next to
industrial areas and the I-10, a major source of air pollution, runs through
the City. For example, in the Downtown area, approximately 25% of all
residential parcels are within 500 feet of a known source of air pollution.
                                                           El Monte General Plan HW-19
      Health and Wellness Element
      ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FACILITIES
      Affordable and accessible healthcare and mental health care services are
      important for achieving timely intervention with health issues and
      preventive services to reduce the severity of illnesses. Preventive measures–
      such as screening for common health problems such as diabetes and
      respiratory illnesses, dental care, and vaccinations–have been shown to
      reduce incidences and severity of illnesses. xxix
      Adequate access to healthcare is more strongly tied to socio-economic and
      political trends than to land use. Although increased proximity to health
      care facilities can increase access to healthcare, physical proximity to a
      health care facility has a limited effect if residents cannot afford insurance
      or services at these facilities or if they do not take appropriate preventative
      measures. For that reason, overcoming socio-economic barriers–by
      providing affordable primary or preventative clinics or Emergency Medical
      Services; increasing awareness of existing services; providing preventative
      and insurance programs; attracting high quality health care professionals;
      or attracting other programs or resources to the City–are an important
      companion to locating health care facilities near residents, particularly in
      communities with a lower-than-average level of income.
      The level of access to health care services in a community is determined by
      three major factors:
      1. The presence or absence of medical service providers
      2. The affordability of those services to community members
      3. The ability for community members to physically get to the health care
          service by driving, transit or other means
      Medical Service Providers
      In terms of the first factor, the physical location of medical services,
      facilities need not be located directly in the City to be accessible. A
      reasonable geographic proximity combined with access to facilities via
      public transportation is all that is necessary for enabling residents to
      actually get to a doctor or clinic. There are numerous health care facilities
      within and near El Monte including the AltaMed Medical Group (El
      Monte), Greater El Monte Community Hospital (South El Monte), Kaiser
      Permanente Medical Center (Baldwin Park), the El Monte Comprehensive
      Health Center and many clinics and private practices. The presence of these
      facilities is a resource for the community.
HW-20 El Monte General Plan

Affordability
Affordability of medical services is a far more challenging obstacle to access,
particularly in low-to moderate-income communities such as El Monte. In
El Monte, over one-third of adults have no health insurance–a rate that is
50% higher than in LA County as a whole, and 7.4% of children have no
health insurance–a rate that is slightly higher than LA County (where 7.0%
of children have no health insurance). Thus, health insurance is a major
issue for El Monte residents.
Access
Finally, physically being able to access health care facilities is critical.
According to stakeholder interviews conducted as part of the General Plan
process, transit service to medical facilities is insufficient to serve the
population’s needs.

      Goals and Policies
      This section describes the health and wellness goals and policies. It should
      be used in conjunction with other elements of the General Plan to create a
      comprehensive and holistic approach to improving health outcomes in the
      community.
         The Land Use Element addresses the built environment including the
          mix of uses, density and intensity and creating a walkable environment.
         The Circulation Element includes goals and policies on creating a
          multi-modal transportation system.
         The Parks and Recreation Element lays out goals and policies to
          improve the amount of, access to, and quality of parks and open spaces
          in El Monte.
         The Public Health and Safety Element includes a range of health topics
          on protecting the community from man-made and natural hazards.
      The goals and policies in all the Elements of the General Plan reinforce and
      support each other and work toward making El Monte a safer, healthier
      community with a high quality of life.
