                      Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
                        Regarding the Environmental Effects from Approval of
                                  The Beaumont General Plan Update
                                         (EIR SCH # 2004061001)
    I.      INTRODUCTION
    The City Council of the City of Beaumont (“Council”) in approving the Beaumont General Plan
    Update project (“Project”), makes the findings described below and adopts the Statement of
    Overriding Considerations presented at the end of the Findings. These Findings are based upon the
    entire record before this Council, including the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) prepared for
    the Project. The EIR was prepared by the City of Beaumont acting as the lead agency under the
    California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”). The Initial Study, Notice of Preparation, Draft
    EIR and Technical Appendices dated March 2005, the Final EIR containing the Comments and
    Responses to Comments, and the Mitigation Monitoring Plan constitute the EIR for this Project.
    These documents are referred to collectively herein as the EIR.
    II.     PROJECT SUMMARY
    A.      Project Description
    The Project considered is the City of Beaumont General Plan Update (General Plan Update). The
    geographic area considered in the General Plan Update includes the City of Beaumont and its
    designated Sphere of Influence (SOI), collectively referred to herein as the General Plan Area. The
    EIR acknowledges and comprehensively addresses combined environmental effects of existing
    development within the General Plan Area, entitled but as yet unrealized development, and changes
    anticipated pursuant to the proposed General Plan Update. Included in the EIR Analysis are
    potential effects of annexation actions that are proposed concurrent with adoption of the General
    Plan Update.
    B.      Project Objectives
    The City Council has established objectives that, when achieved, would provide for successful
    realization of the City’s near-term plans, and would facilitate implementation of land uses,
    supporting infrastructure, and services envisioned under buildout conditions. The City’s objectives
    are as follows:
            !       To accommodate the substantial growth that will occur in coming years as individual
                                               Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

               developments that were previously approved, are constructed;
        !      To guide the development of areas within the City and the Sphere of Influence for
               which no plans have been previously prepared.
        !      To oversee the development of a roadway and infrastructure system that will address
               existing deficiencies and accommodate future demand;
        !      To promote new commercial and industrial development that will capitalize on the
               City’s location near major transportation corridors;
        !      To continue to promote the development of quality housing for all segments of the
               population and those households with special needs;
        !      To ensure that residents are provided a safe and healthful environment in which to
               live and work; and,
        !      To preserve those amenities that make Beaumont an attractive place to live and
               work.
!       C. Project Location
The City of Beaumont and the General Plan Area are located in north-central Riverside County,
at the summit of the San Gorgonio Pass, north and south of Interstate 10. The land area within
the City’s corporate boundaries currently comprises approximately 26 square miles. The City
and its designated Sphere of Influence, which collectively define the General Plan Area,
encompass approximately 48.38 square miles.
The City and associated General Plan Area are bounded on the west by the City of Calimesa and
unincorporated areas of Riverside County; on the north by unincorporated County areas (Cherry
Valley); on the south by unincorporated County areas and the City of San Jacinto; and on the
east by the City of Banning. Beaumont is located approximately 70 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles; 21 miles northeast of the City of Riverside; and 21 miles southeast of the City of San
Bernardino.
III.    ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The City of Beaumont has conducted an extensive environmental review for this Project, which
included an EIR with technical reports concerning traffic and circulation impacts; air quality
impacts, and noise impacts. The following is a summary of the City’s environmental review and
opportunities for public participation for this Project:

                                                                                                       131

           ! A General Plan Committee, including selected members of the City Council, the
             Planning Commission and the community at large, was appointed by the City upon
             initiation of the General Plan Update process. This group has met intermittently over
             the past 18 months.
           ! The Notice of Preparation announcing the City’s intent to prepare an Environmental
             Impact Report (EIR) was published in the Record Gazette on May 28, 2004.
           ! An Initial Study identifying the scope of environmental issues was distributed to
             numerous state, federal, and local agencies and organizations on May 28, 2004. A
             total of three comment letters were received from State and regional agencies. Copies
             of those comment letters are included in Appendix A of the Draft EIR (under
             separate cover). Relevant comments received in response to the NOP/Initial Study
             were incorporated into the Draft EIR.
           ! The Draft EIR was distributed for public review on March 7, 2005, for a 45-day
             review period with the comment period expiring on April 20, 2005. Copies of the
             Draft EIR in its entirety were distributed for review by the City of Beaumont to 38
             public agencies and private organizations, including federal, state, county, regional,
             city and local entities. Additionally, the State Clearinghouse distributed copies to
             twelve departments within the State of California for review. Nineteen comment
             letters on the Draft EIR were received from agencies, organizations and individuals
             during the public comment period, which the City extended until April 26, 2005 to
             accommodate those attending a General Plan Public Workshop on that date. In
             addition, copies of two “form letters” addressing the General Plan Update were
             received. The first of these letters, identified as Multiple-Party Letters in the Final
             EIR, was signed and submitted by 32 individuals, and the second letter was signed
             and submitted by 17 individuals.
           ! A General Plan Public Workshop was advertised in the Record Gazette on March 11,
             2005, and held on April 26, 2005. Approximately 100 people attended this
             workshop.
           ! On June 28, 2005, the Beaumont Planning Commission held a hearing and
             recommended amendments to the Southeastern and Southwestern Planning Areas of
             the General Plan Update.
           ! In December 2006, a Revised EIR was prepared for the project pursuant to CEQA
             Guidelines Section 15088.5, which contained “significant new information,” and as
             such, was recirculated for a period of 45 days beginning on December 22, 2006 and
             ending on February 5, 2007.

            A. Independent Judgment
    The City retained the independent consulting firm of Applied Planning, Inc. to prepare the
    Revised EIR for the Project. The EIR was prepared under the supervision and direction of the
    City of Beaumont Planning Department Staff. This Council is the final decision-making body
    for the certification of the Project EIR. The City of Beaumont Planning Commission has also
    received and reviewed the EIR, and forwarded recommendations to the Council.
                Findings:           The EIR reflects the City’s independent judgment. The City has
                exercised independent judgment in accordance with Public Resources Code, Section
                21082.1(c)(3) in retaining its own environmental consultant, directing the consultant in
                preparation of the EIR as well as reviewing, analyzing, and revising material prepared
                by the consultant.
    !       B. Custodian and Location of Record
                Findings: The documents and other materials, which constitute the record of
                proceedings for the City Council’s approval of this project, are located at the City of
                Beaumont, 550 East Sixth Street, Beaumont CA 92223. The City is the custodian of all
                documents.
            IV.          ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND FINDINGS
    City staff reports, the Project EIR, written and oral testimony at public meetings or hearings,
    responses to comments, these Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations, and other
    information in the administrative record serve as the basis for the City’s environmental
    determination. The Final EIR includes revisions to the Draft EIR, public comments and the City’s
    responses, and the Notice of Determination. The detailed analyses of potential environmental
    impacts and proposed mitigation measures for the General Plan Update are presented in Section 4.0
    of the Final EIR. Written comments and the City’s responses are provided in Section 3.0 of the Final
    EIR.
    The EIR evaluated fifteen major environmental categories (land use, development and agricultural
    resources; population and housing; aesthetics/visual resources; air quality; biological resources,
    cultural resources; earth resources and geology; hazards/risk of upset; hydrology, drainage, and
    flood control; mineral resources; noise; public services and utilities; recreation; transportation and
    circulation; and water resources) for potential significant adverse environmental impacts. Both
    Project-specific and cumulative impacts were evaluated. Of these environmental categories, the
    Council concurs with the conclusions in the EIR that the issues and sub-issues discussed below can
    be mitigated below a level of significance, and for those issues which cannot be mitigated below a
    level of significance, overriding considerations exist because the benefits of adopting the General
                                                Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 5                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001

Plan outweigh the potentially significant adverse impacts.
Of the fifteen major environmental categories addressed in the EIR, the analysis concluded that the
Project did not have the potential to result in a significant impact in twelve major categories (land
use, development and agricultural resources; population and housing; biological resources, cultural
resources; earth resources and geology; hazards/risk of upset; hydrology, drainage, and flood
control; mineral resources; noise; public services and utilities; recreation; and water resources). The
Council concurs with the conclusions regarding these categories as outlined in the EIR and
specifically in responses to comments on these issues, and finds that no significant impacts have
been identified as to those categories identified in the EIR and no further analysis is required, for
the reasons set forth in Section A, below.
        A. IMPACTS IDENTIFIED IN THE EIR AS LESS-THAN-SIGNIFICANT
        REQUIRING NO MITIGATION
Based on substantial evidence and analysis contained in the final EIR, the Council hereby finds that
the following issues have no potential to cause significant impact and therefore require no Project-
specific mitigation. In the following presentation, each resource issue is identified and the potential
for significant adverse environmental effects is discussed.
        1. LAND USE, DEVELOPMENT AND AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES
        a. Conflict with General Plan Designation or Zoning
Potential Significant Impact: The proposed Project could result in disruption or division of the
physical arrangement of an established community.
                Finding:        Potential impacts to existing community land uses are discussed in
                Section 4.1 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concluded, and this Council finds, that the
                Project’s potential to disrupt or divide the physical arrangement of an established
                community is less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: The policy statements articulated in the Community Development
Element of the General Plan Update act to preclude or reduce the potential for disruption of division
of established communities. As individual future development projects are proposed within the
General Plan Area, Goals, Policies and Implementation Programs identified in the General Plan
Update, including environmental review, assurance of zoning conformity, and building code review,
will ensure that projects implemented pursuant to the General Plan Update will not result in division
or disruption of established communities.
        b. Conflict with Existing Land Use Plans/Policies

                                                                                                        135

    the agency with jurisdiction over the project adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
    environmental effect.
                Finding:           Potential impacts with regard to land use policies and consistency are
                discussed in Section 4.1 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concluded, and this Council
                finds, that implementation and occupation of the Project will not create inconsistencies
                with the goals and policies of the City or other applicable land use regulations.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: The General Plan Update provides for, and recognizes
    modification of other City policies and regulations to ensure internal consistency between land use
    plans and policies. Specifically, within 12 months of General Plan Update adoption, the City Zoning
    Ordinance and Maps will be amended to provide consistency with the land use designations,
    policies, and implementation programs proposed under the General Plan Update. It is also
    recognized that within the General Plan Area, the unincorporated Sphere of Influence properties are
    currently regulated by plans and policies of Riverside County. As development proposals are
    submitted for these properties, prezoning should be part of Zoning Ordinance update with the
    General Plan Update land use-designations, proposed for annexation into the City, and if approved,
    will be developed consistent with Goals, Policies, and Implementation Programs of the General Plan
    Update.
    Within the General Plan Area, it is recognized that certain properties or activities which serve
    regional needs, but are located within the General Plan Area, will remain under the jurisdiction of
    Agencies other than City. Notably, the Lamb Canyon Landfill located within the southwesterly
    portion of the City’s Sphere of Influence, will be maintained as an unincorporated County enclave
    within the General Plan Area, and will continue to be operated and maintained by the Riverside
    County Waste Management Department (RCWMD). The City and RCWMD would review any
    adjacent land use or development proposals to ensure that potential land use conflicts are avoided.
    Land uses proposed under the General Plan Update may also affect, or be affected by, broader
    areawide or regional plans. In this regard, the CEQA Guidelines, Section 15125 (d) requires that
    any potential inconsistencies between a project and regional plans be discussed. Notable regional
    agencies and correlating plans potentially affecting, or affected by, the Project include: Riverside
    County-Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP); Santa Ana Regional Water Quality
    Control Board-Basin Water Quality Plan (SARWQCB-Basin Plan); and South Coast Air Quality
    Management District – Air Quality Management Plan (SCAQMD-AQMP).
    As discussed in EIR Section 4.5 Biological Resources, the City of Beaumont has adopted the
    MSHCP and will comply with all of its applicable requirements when considering actions associated
    with, or resulting from, the General Plan Update. Based on the preceding discussion, the Project
    is determined to be consistent with applicable provisions of the Riverside County MSHCP.
                                                Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

136

Similarly, discussions addressing Project consistency with the AQMP and RWQCB Basin Plans are
presented in Section 4.4, Air Quality, and Section 4.9 Hydrology, Drainage and Flood Control,
respectively. As determined in the EIR, build-out pursuant to the proposed General Plan Update
is determined to be consistent with population modeling for the region prepared by the Southern
California Association of Governments (SCAG), and therefore would not conflict with applicable
policies or provisions of the AQMP. Similarly, project consistency with the RWQCB Basin Plan
is implemented through mandated compliance with the RWQCB requirements, including
development of, and adherence to, an approved Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) and
Water Quality Management Plan (WQMP) for projects within the General Plan Area.
        c. Incompatible with Existing Habitat or Natural Community Conservation Plans
Potential Significant Impact: The proposed Project could conflict with applicable habitat
conservation plan(s) or natural community conservation plan(s).
            Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to land use compatibility are discussed in
            Section 4.1 of the Draft EIR. Based upon the analysis contained in the Draft EIR, this
            Council finds that the Project will not be incompatible with existing or proposed habitat
            or natural community conservation plan(s). No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: The General Plan Study Area lies within the boundaries of the
Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MSHCP or Plan). The MSHCP is
a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional Habitat Conservation Plan focusing on conservation of species
and their habitats. Land use plans and policies articulated within the General Plan Update have been
developed consistent with provisions of the MSHCP. In this regard, the General Plan Update land
use plan preserves and maintains significant contiguous habitat areas providing for protection and
preservation of valuable biological resources. More specifically, General Plan Update Resource
Management Element Policies 11 through 13, and supporting implementation programs, provide for
the promotion of development concepts that preserve sensitive biological resources, including open
space areas and conservation areas.
        d. Affect Agricultural Resources or Operations
Potential Significant Impact: Conversion of prime farmland, unique farmland, or farmland of
statewide importance, to urban uses; conflict with existing zoning for agricultural use, or a
Williamson Act contract; changes to the existing environment that may result in the conversion of
farmland to non-agricultural uses.
            Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to agricultural resources are discussed in
            Section 4.1 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the
            proposed Project will not affect agricultural resources or operations, nor will it result in
            the conversion of designated “Farmlands” to non-agricultural use. No mitigation is
                                            Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 8                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                         137

                required.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: Within the larger General Plan Area, approximately 9,000 acres
    is vacant and undeveloped. Many of these vacant properties are considered to be generally suitable
    for agricultural uses. However, ongoing development pressures have acted to severely constrain any
    profitable agricultural production within these areas. No agricultural properties within the General
    Plan Area are currently covered under the provisions of a Williamson Act Contract, nor are any
    properties designated as prime farmlands, unique farmlands, or farmlands of statewide importance.
    No properties within the current City limits are zoned for agricultural uses.
    Land uses proposed under the General Plan Update recognize ongoing urbanization within the
    General Plan Area, and in this respect provide no specific allocation nor land use designations
    related to agricultural uses. The General Plan Update does, however, acknowledge active
    agricultural uses that may occur within the General Plan Area. Specifically, Resource Management
    Element Policy No. 2 states that " . . . The City of Beaumont will support the maintenance of
    existing agricultural resources in the City to the extent feasible." Environmental Review programs
    adopted by the City provide for implementation of this policy. This policy supports the presence
    of current agricultural uses, but realistically recognizes ongoing urbanization and conversion of
    agricultural uses consistent with the General Plan Update land use plan. It is also recognized that
    other Resource Management Element policies and supporting implementation programs provide for
    maintenance and preservation of open space areas and soils generally associated with agricultural
    uses.
            2. POPULATION AND HOUSING
            a. Directly or Indirectly Induce Substantial Population Growth
    Potential Significant Impact: Induce substantial population growth, either directly through the
    creation of new homes and businesses, or indirectly through the extension of new infrastructure
    systems.
                Finding:           Potential impacts relevant to population growth are discussed in
                Section 4.2 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the
                potential for the General Plan Update to directly or indirectly induce substantial
                population growth is less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: New housing, business development, and supporting
    infrastructure improvements described within the General Plan Update buildout scenario reflect, and
    respond to anticipated population growth of the City and region. In this regard, the General Plan
    Update is not considered growth inducing, but rather is a responsive planning tool which identifies
    the plans, policies, and programs necessary to accommodate anticipated growth within the City and
                                                 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 9                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
138
surrounding region. Growth estimates based on buildout pursuant to the General Plan Update,
including associated planning for housing, businesses and infrastructure systems, are generally
consistent with adopted SCAG growth forecasts. In this sense, the plans, policies, and programs
articulated within the General Plan Update will not provide substantial excess capacity beyond that
which is needed to support anticipated growth. As such, the General Plan Update, and its
component elements are not considered growth inducing, and growth planned for and anticipated
under the General Plan Update will not substantially exceed adopted SCAG growth forecasts for the
City and region.
        b. Displace Substantial Numbers of Residential Units
Potential Significant Impact: Displacement of substantial numbers of residential units, requiring
the construction of replacement housing elsewhere.
            Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to the provision of housing are discussed
            in Section 4.2 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the
            potential for the General Plan Update to displace substantial numbers of residences is
            less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: As a component of the General Plan Update process, the City
previously developed and adopted a Housing Element. None of the actions programmed or
anticipated under the City’s adopted Housing Element will result in the displacement or demolition
of existing housing assets, nor will residents be displaced under actions or programs expressed in
the Housing Element. None of the actions programmed or anticipated under the adopted Housing
Element will result in the displacement or demolition of existing housing assets, nor will residents
be displaced under actions or programs expressed in the Housing Element. Other Elements of the
proposed General Plan Update are consistent with, and support the adopted Housing Element.
        c. Displace Substantial Numbers of Persons
Potential Significant Impact: Displacement of a substantial number of persons, necessitating the
construction of replacement housing.
            Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to the provision of housing are discussed
            in Section 4.2 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the
            potential for the General Plan Update to displace substantial numbers of persons is less-
            than-significant. No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: Development projects realized under General Plan buildout
conditions may, in some instances, necessitate the limited displacement of residents and businesses.
Existing policies, programs and requirements appropriately address potential displacement of
residents and businesses. These measures include, but are not limited to: relocation assistance
                                            Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 10                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                       139

    provided under programs established by the City Community Redevelopment Agency, and
    relocation assistance required under the State of California Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real
    Property Acquisition Policies Act. These measures would similarly apply to any potential
    displacement of residents or business resulting from buildout pursuant to the General Plan Update.
             3. AIR QUALITY
             a. Exceed Local Micro-Scale Concentration Standards
    Potential Significant Impact: Result in exceedance of local, micro-scale carbon monoxide (CO)
    concentration standards thresholds.
                Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to air quality are discussed in Section 4.4
                of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the potential for
                the General Plan Update to exceed local micro-scale CO concentration thresholds is
                less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD)
    has established a baseline figure for the City for carbon monoxide concentrations or “CO hotspots”
    (measured in parts per million or ppm) for the one-hour period. The EIR Traffic Study was
    consulted to identify those critical intersections that would be handling traffic volumes that could
    potentially result in traffic congestion and resulting CO “hot spots.” The micro-scale analysis
    focused on those intersections that would have a level of service (LOS) “D” in the build-out year.
    These intersections would typically be handling more traffic and be experiencing greater delay times
    at the signals. This analysis indicated that the State’s one-hour standards for CO concentrations will
    not be exceeded at the City’s most congested intersections under buildout conditions.
             b. Creation of Objectionable Odors
    Potential Significant Impact: Result in the creation of objectionable odors affecting a substantial
    number of people.
                Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to odor generation are discussed in Section
                4.4 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the potential
                for the General Plan Update to result in objectionable odors that would affect substantial
                numbers of people is less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: The General Plan Update EIR includes a listing from the CEQA
    Air Quality Handbook that identifies land use types and activities that typically create odors that lead
    to complaints from the public. The General Plan Update Land Use Element does not propose, nor
    does it anticipate, any uses that would typically be associated with the generation of significant
                                                  Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 11                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
140

sources of objectionable odors. Further, as part of project-specific basis, the City will review new
development proposals to ensure that they do not create and are not exposed to potential odor
sources.
        c. Conflict with Applicable Air Quality Plan
Potential Significant Impact: Conflict with or obstruct the implementation of the applicable air
quality plan.
            Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to air quality plan compliance are discussed
            in Section 4.4 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the
            potential for the General Plan Update to conflict with or obstruct the implementation of
            applicable air quality plans is less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: The Draft EIR notes that the SCAQMD is charged with the
implementation of air quality regulations, and is responsible for the implementation of the protocols
of the State and Federal Clean Air Acts. In addition, the SCAQMD is responsible for ensuring that
the more stringent California clean air standards are met.
Specific criteria for determining a project’s conformity with the Air Quality Management Plan
(AQMP) are defined in Chapter 12 of the AQMP. Section 12.3 of the Handbook also provides
direction in determining General Plan consistency with the AQMP. Buildout pursuant to the
proposed General Plan Update is considered to be consistent with population modeling for the
region prepared by the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG). Since the AQMP
emissions inventory is based on SCAG projections, and the General Plan Update is considered to
be consistent with SCAG projections, the General Plan Update is also considered to be consistent
with the AQMP and AQMP emissions inventory. As a result, the proposed General Plan Update
will not result in any inconsistencies with the AQMP.
        4. BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES
        a. Impacts to Rare or Endangered Species of Wildlife, Plants, or Habitat
Potential Significant Impact: Substantially affect a rare or endangered species of animal or plant
or the habitat of the species; threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community; cause a fish or
wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels; reduce the number or restrict the range of
a rare or endangered plant or animal; interfere substantially with the movement of any resident or
migratory fish or wildlife species; or substantially diminish habitat for fish, wildlife or plants.
            Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to biological resources are discussed in
            Section 4.5 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that based
            on approval and implementation of the MSHCP and application of General Plan
            Resource Management Element Policies and implementation programs, the proposed
                                             Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 12                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                        141

                General Plan Update will not substantially affect a rare or endangered species of animal
                or plant or the habitat of the species; threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community;
                cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels; reduce the
                number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal; or substantially
                diminish habitat for fish, wildlife or plants. No mitigation is required.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: It is recognized that buildout of the City pursuant to the proposed
    General Plan Update will alter the existing rural character of the area, and will result in urbanization
    of currently undeveloped properties. Within currently undeveloped properties there exist
    biologically significant resources, as discussed in the Biological Resources section of the Draft EIR.
    The recently adopted Riverside County MSHCP identifies biologically significant species and
    habitat within the General Plan Area. The MSHCP also establishes applicable localized criteria
    providing for protection and preservation of biologically significant resources. As a Local
    Permittee, the City will be implement all plans, programs and requirements of the MSHCP, thereby
    precluding significant biological resources impacts. The General Plan Update supports the
    provisions and requirements of the MSHCP, and incorporates Policies and Implementation Programs
    providing for protection and preservation of biologically significant resources. Please refer to
    General Plan Update Resource Management Element Policies and supporting Implementation
    Programs.
            5. CULTURAL RESOURCES
            a. Disturbance of Archaeological or Paleontological Resources
    Potential Significant Impact: Development allowed by implementation of the proposed General
    Plan could have the potential to disturb cultural resources, including historic, prehistoric, and
    paleontological resources; or to disturb human remains, including those interred outside of formal
    cemeteries.
                Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to cultural resources are discussed in
                Section 4.6 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that
                implementation of the General Plan policies and compliance with existing State
                guidelines will reduce potential cultural resource impacts to a less-than-significant level.
                No mitigation is required.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: As development allowed by implementation of the General Plan
    Update occurs, there is a potential for disturbance of prehistoric and historic resources present in a
    buried setting. Goals, Policies, and implementation Programs, as summarized in Table 4.6-1 of the
    Draft EIR, act to ensure that as yet unidentified archaeological or paleontological resources, which
    may be encountered during development activities, will be, as applicable, catalogued, protected,
    and/or preserved. Further, the applicable Goals, Policies, and Implementation Programs mandate
                                                 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 13                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
142
compliance with CEQA Guidelines for excavation monitoring and salvage work such as may be
required. Therefore, realization of Goals, Policies, and Implementation Programs articulated within
the General Plan Update, as well as compliance with existing State guidelines addressing the
potential disturbance of cultural resources or human remains, will reduce potential cultural resources
impacts below significant thresholds.
        b. Disturbance of Historic Resources
Potential Significant Impact: Development associated with the proposed General Plan would
require the disturbance of vacant lands and possible conversion of existing structures into various
land uses (e.g., historic homes into office space). Development allowed by implementation of the
proposed General Plan could cause the destruction of or loss of an historical resource, as defined in
CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.5.
             Finding:           Potential impacts relevant to historic resources are discussed in
             Section 4.6 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that
             implementation of the General Plan policies and compliance with existing State
             guidelines will reduce potential impacts on historic resources to a less-than-significant
             level. No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: Compliance with existing State and federal regulations in regard
to historic resources (e.g., National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 Guidelines) will prevent
development from disturbing or destroying designated historical resources located within the City
of Beaumont and surrounding areas. Additionally, proposed policies and implementation programs
of the General Plan Update will serve to increase awareness of the importance of historic resources
within the community.
        6. EARTH RESOURCES AND GEOLOGY
        a. Exposure to Known Earthquake Faults
Potential Significant Impact: Exposure of people or structures to potential substantial adverse
effects, including the risk of loss or death related to fault rupture from a known earthquake fault.
             Finding:           Potential impacts relevant to fault rupture are discussed in Section 4.7
             of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that based on
             compliance with existing policies, in combination with the Policies and Implementation
             Programs articulated in the General Plan Update, potential impacts will be less-than-
             significant. No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: Existing policies adopted by the City, together with Policies and
Implementation Programs proposed under the General Plan Update act to avoid or minimize the
                                             Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 14                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                         143
    potential for property loss, injury, or death that could result from fault rupture. These policies
    include, but are not limited to: State-mandated compliance with provisions of the Alquist-Priolo
    Fault Zoning Act, Natural Hazards Disclosure Act, and Building Earthquake Safety Act. At the
    local level, the Goals, Policies and Implementation Programs realized under the General Plan Update
    provide for identification of locally significant fault zones through environmental review processes,
    and act to preclude development in areas subject to potentially significant fault hazards. Further,
    the City Building and Safety Department provides technical expertise in reviewing and enforcing
    the seismic design and engineering requirements of the Uniform Building Code, thereby ensuring
    that proposed development projects incorporate and reflect seismic design and construction elements
    which act to reduce risks due to earthquake fault hazards.
            b. Soil Erosion
    Potential Significant Impact: Substantial soil erosion resulting in the loss of topsoil.
                 Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to soils and potential for erosion are
                 discussed in Section 4.7 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council
                 finds, that based on compliance with existing policies, in combination with the Policies
                 and Implementation Programs articulated in the General Plan Update, potential impacts
                 will be less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: Goals, Policies and Implementation Programs established under
    the General Plan Update act to protect groundcover and soils. Supporting these Goals, Policies, and
    Implementation Programs, the City has implementated regulations and procedures related to
    construction activities that act to protect and preserve soils. Examples in this regard include, but are
    not limited to: City environmental review of project effects on soils consistent with provisions of
    the CEQA Guidelines; review and approval of grading permits to ensure that grading plans provide
    for protection of exposed soils to include erosion prevention, sediment control plans and interim
    storm water drainage management plans; and application of Best Management Practices (BMPs)
    throughout development activities to ensure that projects provide for erosion protection. Based on
    compliance with adopted regulations and realization of Goals, Policies, and Implementation
    Programs outlines within this Section, the potential for buildout pursuant to the General Plan Update
    to cause substantial soil erosion resulting in the loss of topsoil is considered less than significant.
            c. Soil Instability
    Potential Significant Impact: Development within a geologic or soils unit that is unstable,
    potentially resulting in on-site or off-site landslide, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction or
    collapse; or development on expansive soils, creating substantial risks to life or property.
                 Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to soil instability are discussed in Section
                                                  Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 15                                       Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001

            4.7 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that based on
            compliance with existing regulations and requirements, in combination with the Goals,
            Policies and Implementation Programs articulated within the General Plan Update,
            potential impacts will be less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: Potential impacts associated with unstable soils, landslides, lateral
spreading, subsidence, liquefaction, soils collapse and expansive soils are addressed first through
mapping and avoidance of these hazards. The City implements hazard avoidance procedures
through adopted Land Use Plans, Planning Policies, and Environmental Review procedures. Where
exposure to these hazards cannot be entirely avoided, State and City Building Codes establish
engineering and construction criteria designed to mitigate potential impacts associated with unstable
soils, landslides, lateral spreading, subsidence, liquefaction, soils collapse, and expansive soils.
Goals, Policies and Implementation Programs articulated within the General Plan Update support
these Building Code regulations and requirements, and provide for education of Area residents
regarding avoidance of such hazards, as well as available and appropriate response mechanisms if
exposed to such hazards. Please refer to General Plan Update Safety Element Policies 1 through 5.
         d. Inadequate Soils
Potential Significant Impact: Development on soils incapable of adequately supporting the use
of septic tanks or alternative disposal systems.
            Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to soils are discussed in Section 4.7 of the
            Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that implementation of the
            City’s Sewer Master Plan will avoid the need for additional septic tank use within the
            study area. Potential impacts in this regard are less-than-significant. No mitigation is
            required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: Limited portions of the General Plan Area are currently served
by individual septic systems. However, consistent with existing City development policies and
regulations, new development within the General Plan Area will be served through connection to
the City sewer system and wastewater treatment plant. Sewer system and wastewater treatment
plant expansion and improvements necessary to serve buildout of the General Plan Area will be
realized consistent with the City Sewer Master Plans, and will by funded through development
participation in Community Facilities Districts and other available funding sources.
         7. HAZARDS / RISK OF UPSET
         a. Handling of Hazardous Materials
Potential Significant Impact: Creation of a significant hazard to the public or the environment
through the routine transport, use, or disposal of hazardous materials.
                                            Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

                                                                                                        145

                 Finding:           Potential impacts relevant to hazardous materials handling are
                 discussed in Section 4.8 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council
                 finds, that based on compliance with existing policies, in combination with the Goals,
                 Policies and Implementation Programs articulated in the General Plan Update, potential
                 impacts will be less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: The transport, storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials
    and hazardous wastes is extensively regulated at the federal, State, and local levels. Development
    projects and land uses realized under the proposed General Plan Update is required to comply with
    these regulations, reducing potential impacts below significance thresholds. Safety Element Policies
    22 and 23 proposed under the General Plan Update further reduce the potential for creation of
    potentially significant hazards associated with hazardous materials.
             b. Hazardous Materials Upset
    Potential Significant Impact: Creation of a significant hazard to the public or the environment
    through reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous
    materials into the environment.
                 Finding:           Potential impacts relevant to risk of hazardous materials upset are
                 discussed in Section 4.8 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds,
                 that based on compliance with existing policies, in combination with the Policies and
                 Implementation Programs articulated in the General Plan Update, potential impacts will
                 be less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: The General Plan Update does not propose land uses or other
    elements that would be considered a significant hazard to the public or the environment that would
    result in or cause a “reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of
    hazardous materials into the environment.” Land uses proposed under the General Plan Update
    respond largely to anticipated residential growth of the City and region. In this regard, land uses
    within the General Plan Area are typically residential in character, with supporting
    commercial/retail, industrial, public services, recreation and open space land uses. Sites, or land
    uses known to be sources of hazardous materials or hazardous wastes, including the Lambs Canyon
    Landfill operated by Riverside County, are separated and buffered from potentially sensitive land
    uses, and all transport, storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials/hazardous wastes will be
    realized consistent with applicable federal, State and local regulations. Further, prior to
    implementation of new projects, site-specific Phase I Environmental assessments and related
    environmental reviews are conducted in order to determine if previously unknown or suspected
    sources of hazardous materials or hazardous wastes, such as contaminated soils, improperly
    abandoned wells, asbestos and/or lead paints may be present. Consistent with adopted regulations,
    if such materials (or other hazardous materials) are identified, necessary project revisions,
    mitigation, and/or remediation activities are completed prior to project implementation. Safety
                                                 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

146

Element Policies 22 and 23 proposed under the General Plan Update further reduce the potential for
creation of a significant hazard to the public or the environment.
         c. Hazardous Emissions; Hazardous Waste Handling Within 1/4 Mile of School
Potential Significant Impact: Creation of a source of hazardous emissions, or the handling of
hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste within one-quarter mile of an
existing or proposed school.
             Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to hazardous emissions and wastes are
             discussed in Section 4.8 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council
             finds, buildout pursuant to the General Plan Update will not create a source of hazardous
             emissions, or handling of hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste
             within on-quarter mile of an existing or proposed school. Potential impacts are
             considered less than significant.
Facts in Support of the Finding: The General Plan Update does not propose land uses or other
elements that would create a source of hazardous emissions, or that would otherwise allow or
facilitate the handling of hazardous or acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste within one-
quarter mile of an existing or proposed school. Consistent with the requirements of AB 3205, and
as part of the school site selection and CEQA review processes, school districts independently
determine and certify that proposed school locations are not located within one-quarter mile of
known or proposed source of hazardous emissions.
         d. Emergency Response/Evacuation Plan(s)
Potential Significant Impact: Impairment of the implementation of, or physical interference with,
an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan.
             Findings:           Potential impacts relevant to implementation of, or physical
             interference with, an adopted emergency response plan are discussed in Section 4.8 of
             the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the General Plan
             Update will not include elements that would conflict or interfere with adopted
             emergency response or evacuation plans. Potential impacts are considered less than
             significant
Facts in Support of the Finding: The Circulation Element component of the General Plan Update
provides for appropriate access and circulation throughout the General Plan Area thereby facilitating
rapid response to emergency situations and appropriate routes for evacuation purposes.
Additionally, Goals, Policies, and Implementation Programs established under the General Plan
Update support and provide for public education related to emergency conditions and emergency
preparedness, response, and evacuation plans. Potential impacts are considered less than significant.
                                             Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

                                                                                                        147
            e. Wildland Fire
    Potential Significant Impact: Exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury
    or death involving wildland fire, including where wildlands are adjacent to urbanized areas, or where
    residences are intermixed with wildlands.
                Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to risk associated with wildland fire are
                discussed in Section 4.8 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council
                finds, the potential for buildout pursuant to the General Plan Update to expose people
                or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires,
                including where wildlands adjoin urbanized areas, or where residences are intermixed
                with wildlands is considered less than significant.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: Primary fire protection services within the General Plan Area are
    provided by the Riverside County Fire Department, and are supplemented by the California
    Department of Forestry station in Beaumont. For new or existing development, protection from
    wildland fires is realized through creation of defensible areas around structures, and use or fire-
    resistant building materials. Proposed development within the General Plan Area also is subject to
    environmental and building permit review procedures to ensure adequate and appropriate site design
    and construction methods are employed in order to reduce wildland fire risks. Safety Element
    Policies 18 through 20, promote public awareness of wildland fire hazards and appropriate
    protection from these hazards. These Policies also act to ensure that new development is realized
    consistent with fire-defensible land use/site planning recommendations and fire-resistant
    construction requirements.
            f. High Winds
    Potential Significant Impact: The exposure of people or structures to a significant risk of loss,
    injury or death due to high winds; exposure to other potentially adverse effects associated with high
    winds, including exposure of persons or property to blowing dust, and wind-driven soil erosion.
                Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to risk associated with high winds are
                discussed in Section 4.8 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council
                finds, that the potential for buildout pursuant to the General Plan Update to expose
                people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death due to high winds or
                otherwise result in exposure to potentially adverse effects associated with high winds,
                including exposure of persons or property to bowing dust, and wind-driven soil erosion,
                is considered less than significant.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: High winds may cause potentially adverse effects within the
    General Plan Area, either through structural damage or wind-driven dust pollution and soils erosion.
                                                Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 19                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
148
Potential structural damage due to winds are considered and addressed through adopted City
building permit review processes. In this regard, all proposed structures within the General Plan
Area are required to be designed and constructed consistent with provisions of the latest edition of
the Uniform and California Building Codes. Design and construction of structures consistent with
adopted Code requirements is considered to adequately address potential structural damage due to
high winds. Potential effects of wind-driven dust and soils erosion in the design and construction
of buildings, and appropriate design and are implemented by the City through environmental review
processes and compliance with AQMD policies that provide for dust suppression and soils
protection during construction activities. In addition to the above requirements, Safety Element
Policies 29 and 30 support appropriate design and construction methods to prevent or minimize
potential wind-caused structural and environmental damage.
        8. HYDROLOGY, DRAINAGE AND FLOOD CONTROL
        a. Degradation of Water Quality
Potential Significant Impact: Violate any water quality standards or waste discharge requirements;
substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area, including through the alteration
of the course of a stream or river, in a manner which would result in substantial erosion or siltation
on- or off-site; or otherwise substantially degrade water quality.
            Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to water quality are discussed in Section
            4.9 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds that compliance
            with applicable National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and Southern
            California Regional Water Quality Control Board requirements will minimize potential
            erosion impacts of buildout pursuant to the General Plan Update to a less than significant
            level.
Facts in Support of the Finding: New development projects within the General Plan Area are
required to develop construction activities erosion control plans in accordance with NPDES
requirements, in order to alleviate potential sedimentation and storm water discharge contamination
impacts of new development. A General Permit for storm water discharge from the Southern
California Regional Water Quality Control Board is also required for new development projects, in
accordance with the Notice of Intent instructions. Under the General Permit, discharge of materials
other than storm water is prohibited. Additionally, development projects are required to prepare and
implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) which identifies the sources of
sediments and other pollutants that affect the quality of storm water discharge, and implement
practices to reduce sediment and other pollutants to storm water discharge. The City is also required
to comply with the provisions specified in the Riverside County NPDES permit, which provide for
proper management and long-term disposal of urban runoff from existing and future development
within the General Plan Area.

                                                                                                        149
            b. Groundwater Depletion
    Potential Significant Impact: Substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere substantially
    with groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering
    of the local groundwater table level.
                Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to groundwater are referenced in Section
                4.9 of the Draft EIR, and discussed in further detail in Section 4.15, “Water Resources.”
                The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the potential for adoption and
                implementation of the General Plan Update to: substantially alter the existing drainage
                patterns; substantially increase rates or amounts of surface runoff; create or contribute
                runoff water which would exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater
                drainage systems; or provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff is
                determined to be less than significant.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: As demonstrated in EIR Section 4.15, “Water Resources,” there
    is adequate water available to support buildout of the General Plan Area pursuant to the proposed
    General Plan Update, without adversely affecting groundwater resources.
            c. Stormwater Drainage
    Potential Significant Impact: Substantially alter the existing drainage pattern of the site or area,
    including through the alteration of the course of a stream or river, or substantially increase the rate
    or amount of surface runoff in a manner which would result in flooding on- or off-site; create or
    contribute runoff water which would exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage
    systems or provide substantial additional sources of polluted runoff.
                Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to stormwater drainage and flooding are
                discussed in Section 4.9 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council
                finds, that based on compliance with existing regulations and requirements, the General
                Plan Update would not substantially alter the existing drainage patterns or substantially
                increase rates or amounts of surface runoff or create or contribute runoff water which
                would exceed the capacity of existing or planned stormwater drainage systems, and is
                therefore determined to have a less than significant impact.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: On an area-wide and regional basis, implementation of the City
    Master Plan of Drainage and related City Capital Improvements Programs will ensure that future
    increases in the peak rates of runoff will be managed and maintained within acceptable parameters.
    Master Plan of Drainage facilities will be implemented and modified as required based on ultimate
    development of the City. On a project-specific level, appropriate land use and site plan review,
    environmental review, and implementation of necessary project drainage improvements and
                                                 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 21                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001

associated storm water Best Management Practices, will ensure that projects are designed to
appropriately convey storm water runoff without adversely affecting upstream or downstream
drainage characteristics. Additionally, General Plan Update Community Development Policies 31-
33, and Safety Element Policies 6, 9, 10, and 11, along with relevant implementation programs, act
to preclude or reduce potential adverse drainage and stormwater runoff hazards within the General
Plan Area.
        d. Flood Hazards
Potential Significant Impact: Place housing within a 100-year flood hazard area as mapped on a
federal Flood Hazard Boundary or Flood Insurance Rate Map or other flood hazard delineation map;
place within a 100-year flood hazard area structures which would impede or redirect flood flows;
expose people or structures to a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving flooding, including
flooding as a result of the failure of a levee or dam; expose populations or properties to inundation
by seiche, tsunami, or mudflow.
            Finding:             Potential impacts relevant to flood hazards are discussed in Section
            4.9 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that based on
            compliance with existing policies, in combination with the Goals, Policies and
            Implementation Programs articulated in the General Plan Update, no impacts to people
            or structures from flood related hazards will occur.
Facts in Support of the Finding: Environmental and design review at the project level will ensure
that new developments are not exposed to significant flood hazards, and further that these projects
will not create nor modify drainage patterns that would impede or redirect flood flows, thereby
resulting in off-site flood hazards. The General Plan Area is not exposed to significant hazards due
to dam or levee failure(s); nor is the City subject to potential hazards associated with inundation by
seiche, tsunami, or mudflow. General Plan Update Safety Element Policies 6, 9, 10, and 11 and
related implementation programs act to preclude or reduce potential flood hazards within the
General Plan Area.
        9. MINERAL RESOURCES
        a. Loss of Mineral Resources
Potential Significant Impact: Result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource that
would be of value to the region and the residents of the State.
            Finding:             Potential impacts relevant to mineral resources are discussed in
            Section 4.10 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that based
            on the lack of identified mineral resources within the General Plan area, potential
            impacts will be less-than-significant. No mitigation is required.
                                             Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 22                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                         151
    Facts in Support of the Finding: There are no known or identified mineral resources of regional
    or Statewide importance within the General Plan Area. Development pursuant to the General Plan
    Update will not restrict access to mineral resources outside of the General Plan Area.
             b. Mineral Resource Recovery Site(s)
    Potential Significant Impact: Result in the loss of availability of a locally important mineral
    resource recovery site delineated on a local general plan, specific plan, or other land use plan.
                  Finding:           Potential impacts relevant to mineral resource sites are discussed in
                  Section 4.10 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that
                  implementation of the General Plan Update to result in the loss of availability of a locally
                  important mineral resource recovery site delineated on a local general plan, specific plan,
                  or other land use plan is determined to be less than significant.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: There are no delineated sites or locations of mineral resources
    within the General Plan Area. However, there are likely accretions of aggregate along watercourses
    and drainage ways within the General Plan Area. These aggregate resources may be of value locally
    for construction associated with build-out of the General Plan Update. Resource Management
    Policy No. 1 provides for the maintenance of open space, or undeveloped areas, as a component of
    the General Plan Update. Where mineral extraction does not conflict with other policies or land
    uses, undeveloped portions of the General Plan Area may yield sand, gravel, and aggregate that can
    be employed in local construction activities. Mining and use of locally available aggregate
    resources will also reduce necessary importation of these materials, with corollary reductions in
    traffic, air emissions, and noise impacts attributable to aggregate trucking operations.
             10. NOISE
             a. Excessive Noise
    Potential Significant Impact: Exposure of persons to, or the generation of noise levels in excess
    of standards established in the local general plan or noise ordinance or applicable standards of other
    agencies.
                  Finding:           Potential impacts relevant to noise are discussed in Section 4.11 of the
                  Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the potential for the
                  General Plan Update to expose persons to, or generate noise levels in excess of,
                  standards established in the local general plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards
                  of other agencies is determined to be less than significant.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: The proposed General Plan Update includes guidelines for land
                                                  Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 23                                       Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
152
use and noise compatibility. These guidelines identify appropriate land uses that may be realized
within differing noise environments. The General Plan Update noise compatibility guidelines are
consistent with, and reflect State requirements in this regard. To reduce or eliminate potential noise
impacts resulting from, or affecting land uses within the General Plan Area, the proposed General
Plan Update Safety Element Policies 25 and 26 provide land use/planning policy direction
addressing noise concerns. Inclusion of noise mitigation measures, which shall be identified as part
of project-specific CEQA review, will ensure that new development projects meet adopted noise
standards.
        b. Temporary Noise Increases
Potential Significant Impact: A substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels
in the project vicinity above levels existing without the project.
            Finding:            Potential impacts due to temporary noise are discussed in Section 4.10
            of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that realization of the
            General Plan Update Goals, Policies, and Implementation Programs, and compliance
            with adopted City performance standards, will reduce potential construction noise
            impacts below significant thresholds.
Facts in Support of the Finding: General Plan Update Safety Element Policies 24 and 27 provide
for protection of sensitive land uses from the effects of construction noise through environmental
review, development review, and implementation of the City Noise Control Ordinance.
Environmental and development review of projects affords the City the opportunity to identify
specific situations where construction noise may affect nearby land uses, and to require project and
site-specific noise impact mitigation measures. Similarly, implementation of the City Noise Control
Ordinance provides for establishment and enforcement of laws regulating noise generating activities,
including construction activities occurring within the General Plan Area.
        c. Permanent Noise Increases
Potential Significant Impact: A substantial permanent increase in ambient noise levels in the
vicinity of the project above levels existing without the project.
            Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to community noise levels are discussed in
            Section 4.11 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the
            General Plan Update establishes goals, and provides policy direction and supporting
            implementation program to ensure that potential noise impacts are avoided to the extent
            feasible, and/or mitigated consistent with performance standards present in the General
            Plan Update Safety Element. Therefore, potential impacts due to increased noise levels
            within the General Plan Area are determined to be less than significant.
Facts in Support of the Finding: Implementation of the General Plan Update will alter the existing
                                            Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 24                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                       153
    noise environment, and result in generally increased noise levels throughout the General Plan Area.
    Additionally, planned roadways will introduce new sources of vehicular noise within currently
    undeveloped portions of the General Plan Area. However, incremental vehicular noise level
    increases due to project-specific traffic volumes will likely be indiscernible against ambient
    conditions. Where new development may result in, or be affected by, adverse noise levels, the
    General Plan Update provides policy direction and supporting implementation programs to ensure
    that potential noise impacts are avoided to the extent feasible, and/or mitigated consistent with
    performance standards presented in the General Plan Update Safety Element.
            11. PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES
            a. Increased Demand for Services
    Potential Significant Impact: Substantial adverse physical effects due to increased demands on
    existing fire protection services, police protection services, school services, or other public services.
    Substantial adverse physical effects from the construction of new or altered government facilities
    needed to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance objectives for fire
    protection services, police protection services, school services, or other public services.
                 Finding:           Potential impacts to public services are discussed in Section 4.12 of
                 the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that based on existing
                 funding mechanisms, including applicable revenues, development impact fees and school
                 development fees, potential impacts to public services fromo implementation of the
                 General Plan Update will be less than significant.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: In regard to Fire Protection Services, as part of the General Plan
    Implementation process for the Fire Review Program and the Safety Development Review Program,
    the Fire Department will review all new development plans and any new development will be
    required to conform to applicable fire protection and prevention requirements including, but not
    limited to, building setbacks, emergency access, and interior sprinklers. This will minimize, but not
    eliminate the need for additional fire protection facilities. Beaumont City Ordinance 795 requires
    new development to pay a one-time mitigation fee (currently $181 per dwelling unit) to support the
    development of new fire station facilities. Additionally, a separate fee is collected by the City of
    Beaumont for emergency preparedness (currently $700 per dwelling unit, or $0.21 per square foot
    of commercial or industrial development) under City Ordinance 814. A portion of this fee will be
    used to provide water storage for fire suppression purposes. Fee justification studies have been
    prepared to determine the fees required to finance these improvements, and to provide a ‘nexus’
    between new development and the need for new facilities. Applicable revenues will be made
    available to the County Fire Department to supplement existing levels of service, as required.
    In regard to Law Enforcement Services, City General Fund revenues are typically employed to
                                                 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 25                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
154

provide and supplement police services, as required. As directed by the City, revenues from new
development would be allocated to finance increases in police protection service demands. City
Ordinance 506 requires new development to pay a one-time “basic service facility fee” (currently
$500 per dwelling unit) to “maintain present basic services and to offset the ever increasing demand
caused in part by construction of new residential development . . . necessary for the preservation of
the public peace, health and safety.” Compliance with this ordinance will ensure that funds for new
police personnel and facilities are available as new development occurs.
In support of public school facilities, new development within the City will be required to pay
applicable development fees. In accordance with California Education Code Section 17620 et seq.,
the statutory California school impact fee as of November 2004 is $2.71 per square foot of
residential construction, and $0.36 per square foot of new commercial/industrial construction. These
impact fees are subject to biennial adjustment for inflation, and have been increased regularly since
the adoption of SB50 in 1998. Payment of required school development fees is considered sufficient
in mitigating the impacts of new development on schools.
        b. Wastewater Treatment
Potential Significant Impact: Significant environmental effects due to the need for new or
expanded wastewater treatment facilities.
             Finding:           Potential impacts to existing wastewater facilities are discussed in
             Section 4.12 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the
             ongoing, incremental expansion of the City’s existing wastewater treatment facilities,
             supported by established financing mechanisms, will reduce potential impacts to a less-
             than-significant level. No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: Incremental expansion of the City’s existing wastewater
treatment plant is programmed to keep pace with and anticipate development within the General
Plan Area. Financing of treatment plant expansion(s) is realized through payment of developer
impact fees, and financing mechanisms established under the City’s Community Facility District.
At buildout, the wastewater treatment plant will provide a minimum treatment capacity of 8.0
million gallons per day (MGD), with treatment to be realized consistent with Santa Ana Regional
Water Quality Control Board (SARWQCB) requirements. Planning and implementation of near-term
and long-term treatment plant improvements will be reviewed and assessed consistent with
applicable CEQA requirements, and mitigation of potential impacts associated with plant
expansion(s) will be provided as required.
        c. Landfill Capacity
Potential Significant Impact: Significant exceedance of permitted landfill capacity to
accommodate solid waste disposal needs.
                                            Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 26                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                       155

                 Finding:            Potential impacts relevant to solid waste generation are discussed in
                 Section 4.12 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that based
                 on compliance with adopted Source Reduction and Recycling Element (SRRE) target
                 waste reduction and recycling goals, and proper management and disposal of waste
                 streams within the County, the implementation of the General plan Update to exceed
                 permitted landfill capacities is considered less than significant.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: Lambs Canyon Landfill is currently undergoing a permitting
    process to increase capacity and extend the life of the facility. However, disposal of the municipal
    waste generated within the General Plan Area is ultimately the responsibility of the County of
    Riverside and as such, the County will direct the waste to any of the available disposal sites. This
    could be accomplished through direct transport to an alternative landfill or through the construction
    and operation of a transfer facility. Wastes generated under build-out conditions will be directed
    to landfills with available capacity, as determined by the County. Solid waste generation, under
    build-out conditions, represents less than three percent of the County’s total solid waste stream, and
    is considered to be within the range of disposal estimates reflected in the area wide solid waste
    management and disposal plans developed by the RCWMD. Landfill capacity exists and/or is
    planned and programmed that will accommodate solid waste management requirements pursuant
    to build-out conditions under the General Plan Update.
             12. RECREATION
             a. Degradation of Existing Parks
    Potential Significant Impact: Use of existing neighborhood and regional parks or other recreational
    facilities such that substantial physical deterioration of the facility would occur or be accelerated.
                 Finding:            Potential impacts to existing recreation facilities are discussed in
                 Section 4.13 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that Goals,
                 Policies, and Implementation Programs contained in the General Plan Update will
                 provide for adequate and appropriate recreational facilities throughout the General Plan
                 Area. Realization of these Goals, Policies and Implementation Programs also precludes
                 or minimizes potentially adverse effects to recreational facilities and services.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: Substantial population growth anticipated based on
    implementation of the General Plan Update will lead to increased demand for public park and
    recreation facilities and services. New development within the City will be required to provide
    parkland dedications or appropriate “in lieu” fees, consistent with Goals, Policies and
    Implementation Programs identified in the General Plan Update, and as defined by the City’s Local
    Park Code and the State of California Quimby Act requirements. Further, a portion of the “Basic
    Service and Facility” fees collected from new development in the City can be used to fund the
                                                 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 27                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
156

maintenance of park facilities. These fees and/or dedications are considered sufficient to provide
adequate and appropriate parks and recreational facilities to support build-out of the General Plan
Area.
        b. Expanded Recreation Facilities
Potential Significant Impact: Construction or expansion of recreational facilities, which might
have an adverse physical effect on the environment.
            Finding:            Potential impacts to future recreational facilities are discussed in
            Section 4.13 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that
            project-level environmental review of future recreational facilities will reduce potential
            impacts to a less-than-significant level. No mitigation is required.
Facts in Support of the Finding: As components of larger development projects, or on an
individual basis, parks and recreational facilities that may be realized pursuant to implementation
of the General Plan Update are subject to environmental review by the City and as provided for
under CEQA. As parks and recreational facilities are planned and implemented, project-level
environmental review of these facilities, to include provision of any necessary mitigation measures,
will ensure that construction or expansion of recreational facilities will result in adverse physical
effects on the environment.
        13. TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION
        a. Roadway Levels of Service
Potential Significant Impact: Degradation of Roadway Levels of Service.
            Finding:            Potential impacts to existing roadways are discussed in Section 4.14
            of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the potential for
            the General plan Update to substantially degrade roadway levels of service is considered
            less than significant.
Facts in Support of the Finding: Future growth associated with the implementation of the
proposed General Plan Update will result in a substantial increase in the traffic that is generated
throughout the City. The General Plan Update Traffic Study compares existing traffic conditions
with forecasts for year 2030 and ultimate General Plan buildout conditions. Roadway improvements
realized pursuant to the proposed General Plan Update Circulation Element will provide LOS “D”
or better conditions at all Study Area key intersections, in both the year 2030 and under post-2030
General Plan buildout conditions. Improvements to regional roadways will be addressed through
continued cooperation with Caltrans, Riverside County and other neighboring jurisdictions, as set
forth in General Plan Update Circulation Element Policies 1 through 8. Realization of General Plan
Update Policies and Implementation Programs, in combination with transportation system
                                            Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 28                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                       157

    improvements reflected in the General Plan Update Circulation Element and specified in the General
    Plan EIR Traffic Study will ensure that adequate LOS conditions are maintained within the General
    Plan Area.
            b. Parking
    Potential Significant Impact: Inadequate parking.
                Finding:           Potential impacts relative to parking are discussed in Section 4.14 of
                the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the General Plan
                Update Goals, Policies, and Implementation Programs will provide adequate and
                appropriate parking facilities within the General Plan Area. Therefore the potential for
                adoption and implementation of the General Plan Update to result in inadequate or
                improper parking facilities is considered less than significant.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: The General Plan Circulation Element acknowledges that a lack
    of parking in the community impacts residents and visitors to the City by contributing to traffic
    congestion. Parking limitations also have the potential to limit the success of commercial
    businesses. Implementation of General Plan Update Circulation Element Policies 17 through 19 will
    ensure that adequate parking is provided for future development, and Circulation Element Policy
    20 will ensure existing parking is adequate within the City’s downtown central business district.
            c. Alternative Transportation
    Potential Significant Impact: Conflict with adopted policies, plans or programs supporting
    alternative transportation.
                Finding:           Potential impacts relative to alternative transportation are discussed
                in Section 4.14 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that
                implementation of proposed General Plan Policies will ensure implementation of the
                General plan Update does not adversely impact alternative modes of transportation.
                Potential impacts are considered less than significant.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: Because regional plans are formulated based on adopted General
    Plans, inherent conflicts between the City of Beaumont General Plan Update and adopted regional
    policies, plans and programs may exist since the buildout scenario for the General Plan Area is being
    modified. These conflicts will exist until any affected regional plans are updated to acknowledge
    and incorporate the updates to the Beaumont General Plan. Policies 6, 12, and 24 through 29 of the
    General Plan Update’s Circulation Element specifically address and support alternative
    transportation modes, including buses and related transit improvements, bike trails, walking trails
    and connection to regional open spaces via trails within and adjacent to existing trails. Related
                                                Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

158

Implementation Programs identified in the General Plan Update act to ensure timely and appropriate
realization of these Policies.
        14. WATER RESOURCES
        a. Expanded Water Supply
Potential Significant Impact: Require new or expanded water supplies.
Finding: Potential impacts relative to water supply are discussed in Section 4.15 of the Draft EIR.
The analysis concludes, and this Council finds, that the potential impacts regarding requirements
for new or additional water supplies are therefore determined to be less than significant.
Facts in Support of the Finding: As part of the adopted BCVWD Urban Water Management Plan,
and consistent with the provisions of the Adjudication Agreement, existing water supplies will be
augmented to support anticipated development within the General Plan Area. Existing and
anticipated sources of water available to the General Plan Area include: groundwater, recycled
water, new capture of stormwater for recharge of the Basin, and purchase of State Water Project
water. Buildout pursuant to the proposed General Plan Update is fully supported by existing and
anticipated water supplies identified under the BCVWD Urban Water Management Plan and
Adjudication Agreement. On this basis, although new and expanded water supplies will be required
to support buildout conditions anticipated under the General Plan Update, these water supplies are
identified and accounted for under the adopted UWMP, and will be available as specified under the
Adjudication Agreement.
        B. FINDINGS REGARDING IMPACTS ANALYZED IN THE EIR AND
        DETERMINED TO BE MITIGATED TO LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT LEVELS
This section includes findings for project impacts, which are potentially significant, but can be
mitigated to a less than significant level with the imposition of mitigation measures. This Council
finds that all potentially significant impacts of the project listed below can and will be mitigated,
reduced or avoided by imposition of the mitigation measures, and these mitigation measures are set
forth in the Mitigation Monitoring Plan adopted by the Council. Specific findings of the Council
for each category of such impacts are set forth in detail below.
Public Resources Code Section 21081 states that no public agency shall approve or carry out a
project for which an Environmental Impact Report has been completed which identifies one or more
significant effects unless the public agency makes one or more of the following findings:
        !       Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project, which
                mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment.
                                            Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 30                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                       159
            !       Those changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another
                    public agency and have been, or can and should be, adopted by that other agency.
            !       Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations make
                    infeasible the mitigation measures or alternatives identified in the EIR.
    The Council hereby finds, pursuant to Section 21081, that the following potential significant
    environmental impacts can and will be mitigated to below a level of significance, based upon the
    implementation of the mitigation measures in the Final EIR. Each mitigation measure discussed in
    this section of the findings is assigned a code letter correlating it with the environmental category
    used in the Mitigation Monitoring Program included in the Final EIR.
    1.      AESTHETICS/VISUAL RESOURCES
    a.      Scenic Vistas
    Potential Significant Impact: Substantial effect on a scenic vista, substantially damage scenic
    resources, or substantially degrade the existing visual character or quality of the site and its
    surroundings.
    Finding: The proposed Project's potential impacts on aesthetics and visual resources are analyzed
                in Section 4.3 of the Draft EIR. The EIR analysis concludes that the conversion of open
                space to urban uses that would be realized under the General Plan Update would have
                potentially significant visual impacts, either by causing the obstruction of existing views,
                or by potentially obstructing distant panoramic views from existing development.
                Specifically, ridgelines within the General Plan Area could be altered by new
                development, resulting in visual degradation of those areas, and obstruction of the distant
                or panoramic views beyond ridgelines. The following measure will mitigate this impact
                to below a level of significance.
                Mitigation Measure 4.3.1: The City shall adopt a Hillside Development Ordinance
                addressing potential visual effects of development on hillsides and ridgelines.
                Hillside/Ridgeline development and protection criteria, and related design solutions may
                be developed and implemented through City’s Specific Plan and design review
                processes.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: The General Plan Area does not contain any specifically
    designated scenic vistas that would be affected by implementation of the proposed General Plan
    Update. However, the General Plan Update envisions development that will affect largely
    undeveloped and rural areas lying within the current City Sphere of Influence. Future development
    within the General Plan Area would result in the intensification of existing urban uses as well as
                                                 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 31                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001

conversion of open space into urban land uses. Project-specific design review of future development
proposals will afford the City the opportunity to review and consider scenic views and localized
resources on a case-by-case basis. Special attention will be given to development proposals within
the Badlands area, and projects that could affect views of, or otherwise alter ridgelines, as reflected
in Mitigation Measure 4.3.1. This measure is considered sufficient to reduce aesthetic/visual
resource impacts to a less-than-significant level.
1.          HAZARDS/RISK OF UPSET
a.                  Development on Known Hazardous Material Sites
Potential Significant Impact: Creation of a significant hazard to the public or the environment
through reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of hazardous
materials into the environment. Development on a site that is included on a list of hazardous
material sites complied pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5 resulting in a significant
hazard to the public or the environment.
Finding: Potential impacts relevant to development on identified hazardous material sites are
            discussed in Section 4.8 of the Draft EIR. The analysis concludes, and this Council finds
            that the General Plan Update does not specifically address the potential for the Project
            to result in undue exposure of persons and property due to accidental release of
            hazardous materials. To ensure potential impacts and associated issues are reduced, the
            following Safety Element Policy and associated Implementation Programs shall be
            incorporated in the General Plan Update, as presented in the following mitigation
            measure:
            Mitigation Measure 4.8.1: Policy Statement: The City of Beaumont shall ensure that
            potentially sensitive receptors and land uses are not located proximate to, or otherwise
            unduly exposed to, hazards or hazardous materials. Further, the City shall ensure that
            development does not occur on or proximate to a site that is included on a list of
            hazardous materials sites compiled pursuant to Government Code Section 65962.5.
            Similarly, the City shall ensure that sources of potentially hazardous materials or
            potentially hazardous land uses are not located proximate to, or would otherwise result
            in undue exposure of, potentially sensitive land uses to hazards or hazardous materials.
            Implementation Programs: Hazardous Materials Control; Envrionental Review;
            Emergency Preparedness Plan; Zoning conformity; Building Code Review; Code
            Enforcement.
Facts in Support of the Finding: The General Plan Update does not propose land uses or other
elements that would be considered to constitute a significant hazard to the public or the environment
that would result in or cause a “reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the
                                            Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

                                                                                                        161

    release of hazardous materials into the environment.” Development projects realized pursuant to the
    proposed General Plan Update will be subject to environmental review process mandated under
    CEQA and implemented by the City. These review processes require the identification of known
    hazardous material sites that will affect, or be affected by, development projects. Prior to
    implementation of new projects, site-specific Phase I Environmental assessments and related
    environmental reviews are conducted in order to determine if previously unknown sources of
    hazardous materials or hazardous wastes may be present. Consistent with adopted regulations, if
    such materials are identified, necessary project revisions, mitigation, and/or remediation activities
    are completed prior to project implementation. Implementation of Mitigation Measure 4.8.1 and
    Implementation Programs are considered sufficient to reduce impacts to a less-than-significant level.
    1.          NOISE
    a.   Ground-borne Vibration/Noise
    Potential Significant Impact: Exposure of people to, or generation of, excessive ground-borne
    vibration or noise levels.
    Finding:        Based on the whole record, this Council finds that the impacts associated with
                    ground-borne noise can be reduced to less than significant with implementation of
                    changes to existing policies, in the form of Mitigation Measure 4.11.1, within the
                    General Plan Update.
    Mitigation Measure 4.11.1 Safety Element Policy Nos. 25 and 27 (following), shall be amended
    as indicated by bold italics:
    Safety Element Policy 25 The City of Beaumont will incorporate noise and vibration
    considerations into land use planning decisions.
    Safety Element Policy 27        The City of Beaumont shall promote the effective enforcement of City,
    State and Federal noise and vibration standards by all appropriate City divisions.
    Facts in Support of the Finding: Within the General Plan Area, train traffic is considered to be
    the primary source and generator of ground-borne vibration and ground-borne noise. Within the
    General Plan Area, existing railways parallel major roadways. In combination, roadway and railway
    right-of-ways typically establish a sufficient buffer zone (150 feet in width or more), beyond which
    effects of ground-borne vibration and noise are typically imperceptible. It is also noted that land
    uses along these roadway/railway corridors are either vacant, or developed with industrial or
    commercial uses, which are less sensitive to ground-borne vibration/noise than residential uses.
    With application of Mitigation Measure 4.11.1, potential impacts due to, or resulting from,
    generation of ground-borne vibration and noise are determined to be less than significant.

162

4.       TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION
a.       Roadway Safety Hazards
         Potential Significant Impact: Increased safety hazards due to improper roadway design or
         inadequate emergency access.
Finding: The proposed Project's potential roadway design impacts are analyzed in Section 4.14 of the Draft
                     EIR. The EIR analysis concludes and this Council finds that the addition of a new policy
                     to the General Plan Circulation Element, in the form of Mitigation Measure 4.14.1, will
                     ensure that the coordination needed to maintain safe roadway transitions occurs,
                     reducing potential impacts to a less-than-significant level.
                     Mitigation Measure 4.14.1 Policy Statement: The City of Beaumont will work
                     cooperatively with the County of Riverside and the Riverside County Transportation
                     Commission (RCTC) to reconcile differences in roadway systems by amending the RCIP
                     system when the opportunity arises.
         Facts in Support of the Finding:        The proposed Circulation Element of the General Plan Update
         designates a hierarchy of streets throughout the Study Area. As areas develop or as the City
         identifies the need, streets will be developed to their ultimate configuration. Incompatibilities
         between adjoining street sections are sometimes created when streets within the City extend into
         neighboring cities or into unincorporated County areas. This type of incompatibility can cause
         impacts to roadway capacities by restricting traffic flow at the point of convergence. Traffic
         inefficiencies occur when there is a transition in the number of travel lanes or when the adjoining
         street sections vary in the number of lanes, size of lanes or size of the adjacent parkways and/or
         medians. Coordination between local agencies will effectively eliminate potential safety hazards
         due to roadway design incompatibilities.
         5.      WATER
         a.      Groundwater Supplies
         Potential Significant Impact: Substantially deplete groundwater supplies or interfere substantially
         with groundwater recharge such that there would be a net deficit in aquifer volume or a lowering
         of the local groundwater table level.
         Finding: The analysis concludes and this Council finds, that the current Beaumont-Cherry Valley
                     Water District (BCVWD) 2005 Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) does not
                     reflect full build-out of the General Plan Area under post year-2030 conditions, and
                     therefore does not provide the basis for determining post-2030 potential impacts to
                     groundwater resources. Therefore additional policy direction in the form of Mitigation
                                                     Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
         Page 34                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                                163
                Measure 4.15.1, and applicable Implementation Programs, shall be included in the
                General Plan Update, and will ensure potentially significant impacts to groundwater
                resources are reduced to a less than significant level.
                Mitigation Measure 4.15.1 Policy Statement: The City and BCVWD shall mutually
                reconcile and assure that future updates to the UWMP, and related UWMP analysis for
                post-2030 conditions, reflect the most recent General plan buildout population and
                development projects. Projects not reflected or considered in the then current UWMP
                shall not be approved by the City.
                Implementation Programs:           Environmental Review; Redevelopment; Zoning
                Conformity
    Facts in Support of the Finding: The 2005 UWMP is considered to accurately assess potential
    water supplies available to, and water consumption resulting from, development within the General
    Plan Area through the year 2030. As identified in the BCVWD Urban Water Management Plan, the
    BCVWD water supply plan can easily meet future water demands within the General Plan Area
    through 2030. Under year 2030 conditions, the BCVWD Urban Water Management Plan projects,
    and can support the water demands for a population of 92,300 persons within the General Plan Area.
    However, post-2030 conditions assumed under the General Plan Update buildout scenario are
    predicated on a resident population of approximately 107,200 persons; an approximately 16 percent
    additional increment in growth than that reflected in the 2030 UWMP population projections.
    Increased water demands based on the General Plan Update’s post-2030 population estimates will
    ultimately be met through increased conservation efforts, increased use of recycled water, additional
    water purchases, water rights transfer, and policies/implementation programs as identified by the
    City and BCVWD.
    C.      IMPACTS ANALYZED IN THE EIR AND DETERMINED TO BE SIGNIFICANT
            AND UNAVOIDABLE
    With the implementation of all available and feasible mitigation measures recommended in the EIR,
    the following adverse impacts of the Project stated below are considered to be significant and
    unavoidable, both individually and cumulatively, based upon information in the Project EIR, in the
    record, and based upon testimony provided during the public hearings on this Project. These
    impacts are considered significant and unavoidable despite the mitigation measures which are
    imposed and which will reduce impacts to the extent feasible.
    1.      AIR QUALITY
    a.      Short-Term, Construction-Related Impacts
                                               Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
    Page 35                                    Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
164

Significant Unavoidable Impact: A violation of an air quality standard or substantial contribution
to an existing or projected air quality violation.
Finding: Based on the whole record, this Council finds that even with application of project-
            specific mitigation measures for future development and compliance with local, State,
            SCAQMD and federal air quality regulations, it is anticipated that cumulative
            construction-related emissions will exceed SCAQMD thresholds for PM10, N0x and
            ROG. Cumulative construction-related emissions will remain significant and
            unavoidable. This impact is overridden by the Project benefits as set forth in the
            Statement of Overriding Considerations.
            Mitigation Measure 4.4.1 Policy Statement: All applicable SCAQMD rules and
            recommendations which act to reduce construction emissions will be incorporated in
            new development proposals.
            Implementation Programs: Air Quality Planning; Energy Conservation; Environmental
            Review; Building Code Review; Code Enforcement; Zoning Conformity.
Facts In Support of Findings: The Air Quality Analysis for the General Plan Update anticipates
that cumulative construction-related emissions associated with build-out of the General Plan Area
will exceed SCAQMD thresholds for the following criteria pollutants: particulate matter of less than
ten microns in diameter (PM10), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and reactive organic gases (ROG). To
aid in the reduction of construction-related air pollutant emissions, the City will require separate
environmental analysis and development-specific air quality mitigation measure for discretionary
development projects, which types of projects will constitute the majority of future development
within the General Plan Area. However, even with application of development-specific mitigation
measures, and compliance with local, State, SCAQMD and federal air quality regulations,
construction-related air pollutant emissions impacts will remain significant and unavoidable.
b.          Long-Term, Mobile and Stationary Source Impacts
Significant Unavoidable Impact: A cumulatively considerable net increase of any criteria pollutant
for which the project region is non-attainment under an applicable federal or state ambient air
quality standard (including releasing emissions which exceed quantitative thresholds for ozone
precursors).
Finding: Based on the whole record this Council finds that based on current emissions thresholds
                    criteria, long-term operational emissions from individual development projects
                    realized under implementation of the General Plan Update will likely result in
                    exceedances of daily and/or quarterly thresholds for CO, ROG, and NOx. Despite
                    application of project-specific mitigation measures for future development,
                                            Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 36                                     Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                       165
                        significant unavoidable impacts remain. These impacts are overridden by the
                        Project benefits as set forth in the Statement of Overriding Considerations.
                Mitigation Measure 4.4.2 Policy Statement: To the satisfaction of the City, all
                applicable SCAQMD rules and recommendations which act to reduce operational
                emissions impacts will be incorporated in new development proposals.
                Implementation Programs: Air Quality Planning; Energy Conservation; Environmental
                Review; Building Code Review; Code Enforcement; Zoning Conformity.
    Facts In Support of Findings: Long-term emissions refer to those air quality impacts that will
    occur once the land uses proposed under the General Plan Update are implemented, operational, and
    occupied. These impacts will continue over the operational life of any future development. The
    long-term air quality impacts associated with potential future development include mobile emissions
    associated with vehicular traffic; on-site stationary emissions related to the operation of machinery
    and other equipment; and off-site stationary emissions associated with the generation of natural gas
    and electricity to serve future development. Vehicle emissions typically account for more than 95
    percent of all criteria pollutants within the South Coast Air Basin, and residential travel patterns
    (e.g., home-to-work commutes, shopping trips, and errands) will account for the vast majority of the
    vehicle miles traveled (VMT) within the General Plan Area.               The majority of the future
    development that occurs under the General Plan Update will involve discretionary review including
    separate environmental review and project-specific air quality mitigation measures. However, even
    with application of mitigation measures, and compliance with local, State, SCAQMD and Federal
    Air Quality regulations, it is anticipated that individual and cumulative operational emissions will
    exceed SCAQMD thresholds for CO, ROG, and NOx.

2.      V. PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
Three project alternatives are discussed in Chapter 6 of the Draft EIR, and the potential significance
for each of the alternatives is analyzed in Section 6 of the Draft EIR. The Council has considered
these alternatives to the General Plan Update Project and makes the following findings.
2.      No Project Alternative
Under this Alternative, the General Plan Update would not be adopted, and the current General Plan
would be implemented. Under the No Project Alternative, and consistent with the current General
Plan, it is also assumed that the City is not a participatory party to the Multiple Species Habitat
Conservation Plan (MSHCP). This Alternative would tend to reduce the severity of air quality
impacts identified under the Project. However, buildout of the General Plan Area pursuant to a No
Project Alternative would still likely result in cumulatively significant exceedances of ROG, NOx,
and PM10 emissions. Additionally, it is anticipated that operational emissions realized pursuant to
a No Project Alternative would individually and cumulatively exceed daily and quarterly
significance thresholds for ROG, CO, and NOx emissions. Potential biological resources impacts
would need to be addressed in some manner other than is provided for under the MSHCP.
Finding: Based on the whole record, this Council finds that the “No Project Alternative” is not
             practical because it does not consider post-2030 buildout of the City, and does not reflect
             changing physical conditions within the planning area. Further, this alternative does not
             reflect the City’s current vision for buildout, and does not accommodate the regional
             population projection for the General Plan area.
2.      No Build/No Annexation Alternative
Under the No Build/No Annexation Alternative, no further development within the City would occur
and no undeveloped Sphere Of Influence (SOI) properties would be annexed to the City. Under this
Alternative it is assumed that environmental review of existing and entitled development would have
previously addressed those projects’ potential environmental effects, including potential air quality
impacts. No new or additional air quality impacts would result due to currently approved
entitlements.
Finding: Based on the whole record, this Council finds that the “No Build/No Annexation
             Alternative” was rejected as an alternative to the Project because it does not achieve the
             stated objectives of the Project, (1) to accommodate the substantial growth that will
             occur in coming years as individual developments that were previously approved are
             constructed; (2) to guide the development of areas within the City and the sphere of
             influence for which no plans have been previously prepared; (3) to promote new
             commercial and industrial development that will capitalize on the City’s location near
             major transportation corridors; and (4) to continue to promote the development of quality
             housing for all segments of the population and those households with special needs.
                                             Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
Page 38                                      Beaumont General Plan Update EIR - SCH No. 2004061001
                                                                                                         167

    2.      Reduced Regional Commercial Center Alternative
    This alternative recognizes that much of the General Plan Area is already entitled with active or
    tentative development proposals. However, one of the more substantive, and as yet unrealized land
    uses proposed under the General Plan Update is the comprehensive planning of a new mixed-use
    regional commercial center at the SR-60/I-10 confluence. This land use is designated “Urban
    Village Overlay” under the Project. Under the Reduced Regional Commercial Center Alternative,
    the total scope of development proposed in this area would be reduced in intensity. This Alternative
    would tend to reduce traffic volumes in the area of major existing and proposed intersections, and
    would therefore tend to improve LOS conditions. This Alternative would also tend to reduce the
    severity of significant air quality impacts that are anticipated under the Project. However, as with
    the Project, these air quality impacts would remain significant and unavoidable.
    Finding: Based on the whole records, this Council finds that the “Reduced Regional Commercial
                 Center Alternative” is not practical because it would curtail full attainment of the
                 following stated objectives of the General Plan Update including: (1) to accommodate
                 the substantial growth that will occur in coming years as individual developments that
                 were previously approved are constructed; (2) to promote new commercial and industrial
                 development that will capitalize on the City’s location near major transportation
                 corridors; and (3) to continue to promote the development of quality housing for all
                 segments of the population and those households with special needs.
    2.      VI.          PROJECT BENEFITS
    Benefits from the approval of the Beaumont General Plan Update Project will be derived from the
    establishment of a comprehensive vision for buildout of the General Plan Area, which appropriately
    plans for growth and provides for orderly development of the City and its Sphere of Influence.
    Implementation of the General Plan Update would result in the following benefits.
            !        Provides for orderly growth consistent with regional and Statewide population
                     estimates, and additional housing consistent with Regional Housing Needs
                     Assessment;
            !        Provides for revitalization of the City’s historic downtown area;
            !        Provides for the transportation needs of anticipated growth consistent with plans for
                     local and areawide development;
            !        Provides for consistency of policies and development standards between existing
                     City properties and outlying areas;
            !        Provides for extension of urban services in an orderly fashion;
            !        Establishes biological preserve areas consistent with the Riverside County Multiple
                     Species Habitat Conservation Plan (MHSCP);
            !        Provides for identification and preservation of locally defined visual resources,
                     including significant ridgelines and “Badlands” areas;
            !        Provides for identification and preservation of locally significant historical and
                                                 Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

                cultural resources;
        !       Provides for local review and approval of development entitlements by the Beaumont
                City Council; and
        !       Assures that residents will enjoy comprehensively planned and funded facilities and
                services.
!       VII.        STATEMENT OF OVERRIDING CONSIDERATIONS
The City Council of the City of Beaumont adopts this Statement of Overriding Considerations with
respect to the significant unavoidable impacts identified in the EIR, specifically (1) air quality
impacts related to (a) increased local and regional air pollution emissions from construction of future
development anticipated under the General Plan Update, and (b) increased local and regional air
pollutant emissions from implementation and operation of future development within the General
Plan area.
This section of findings specifically addresses the requirements of Section 15093 of the CEQA
Guidelines, which require the lead agency to balance the benefits of a proposed project against its
unavoidable significant impacts and to determine whether the impacts are acceptably overridden by
the project benefits. The Council finds that the previously stated major project benefits, see Section
VI above, of the City of Beaumont General Plan Update, outweigh the unavoidable significant
adverse environmental impacts noted above. Each of the separate benefits of the General Plan
Update cited in Section VI above, is hereby determined to be, in itself and independent of the other
Project benefits, a basis for overriding all unavoidable environmental impacts identified in the EIR
and in these findings.
The Council's findings set forth in the preceding sections have identified all of the adverse
environmental impacts and the feasible mitigation measures which can reduce impacts to less-than-
significant levels where feasible, or to the lowest feasible levels where significant impacts remain.
The findings have also analyzed three alternatives to determine whether there are reasonable or
feasible alternatives to the proposed action or whether they might reduce or eliminate the significant
adverse impacts of the proposed Project. The EIR presents evidence that the adoption of the City
of Beaumont General Plan Update will cause significant adverse impacts, which cannot be
substantially mitigated to non-significant levels. These significant impacts have been outlined above
and the Council makes the following finding:
Finding: Based on the whole record and having considered the unavoidable adverse impacts of
            the City of Beaumont General Plan Update, the Council hereby finds that all feasible
            mitigation has been adopted to reduce or avoid the potentially significant impacts
            identified in the EIR, and that no additional feasible mitigation is available to further
            reduce significant impacts. Further, the Council finds that the beneficial public policy,
            social, and other considerations of the City of Beaumont General Plan Update outweigh
            the unavoidable adverse impacts described above. The reasons for accepting these
                                             Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

                                                                                                        169
                 remaining unmitigated impacts are described below. In making this finding, the Council
                 has balanced the benefits of the proposed Project against its unavoidable environmental
                 impacts and has indicated its willingness to accept those risks.
    Furthermore, the Council has considered the alternatives to the Project, and makes the following
    finding:
    Finding: Based on the whole record this Council finds that feasible alternatives to the proposed
                 Project which are capable of reducing identified impacts have been considered and
                 rejected because the alternatives offer a reduced level of benefit when compared to the
                 Project.
    The Council further finds that the Project's benefits are substantial and override each unavoidable
    impact of the Project, as follows:
    !       Findings Regarding Air Quality Impacts
    Short-Term Construction-Related Emissions.
    The Project's construction-related emissions will increase local and regional air pollutants despite
    the imposition of project-specific mitigation measures and implementation of best available control
    technology. The proposed Project construction activities are expected to result in emissions that will
    exceed SCAQMD thresholds for criteria pollutant ROG, NOx, and PM10. Increases in local and
    regional pollutants are not entirely avoidable, as development activities within this region will
    continue to increase the amount of pollutants both locally and on a regional basis. However, the
    benefits obtained from the adoption of a comprehensive plan for orderly growth and development
    necessary to meet the demands of a growing population within the region, are sufficient to justify
    approval of the Project. These impacts are overridden by Project benefits described in Section VI
    of this document.
    Long-Term Operational Impacts.
    Long-term, stationary and mobile source emissions will exceed the SCAQMD thresholds for criteria
    pollutants CO, ROG and NOx despite the imposition of project-specific mitigation measures and
    implementation of best available control technology. The primary generators of long-term
    operational emissions include vehicles, heating, ventilation, air conditioning equipment, and
    consumer products. As stated in the Draft EIR, SCAQMD thresholds are expected to be exceeded
    relative to emissions for criteria pollutants CO, ROG and NOx. However, the benefits obtained from
    the adoption of a comprehensive plan for orderly growth and development necessary to meet the
    demands of a growing population within the region, are sufficient to justify approval of the Project.
    These impacts are overridden by Project benefits described in Section VI of this document.
    As the CEQA Lead Agency for the proposed action, the City of Beaumont has reviewed the Project
                                                  Facts, Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

description and the EIR and fully understands the General Plan Update. Further, the Council finds
that all potential adverse environmental impacts and all feasible mitigation measures to reduce these
impacts have been identified in the Draft EIR, the Final EIR and public testimony. These impacts
and mitigation measures are discussed in Section IV, above. The Council also finds that a
reasonable range of alternatives was considered in the EIR and in Section V above, and that no
feasible alternatives, which substantially lessen Project impacts are available for adoption.
The Council has identified social benefits and important public policy objectives, Section VI above,
which will result from implementing the proposed Project. The Council has balanced these
substantial benefits against the unavoidable significant adverse effects of the proposed Project.
Given the substantial benefits that will accrue to the City of Beaumont, and the region, from
implementation of the City of Beaumont General Plan Update, the Council finds that the benefits
identified herein override the unavoidable environmental effects.
California Public Resources Code 21002 provides: "In the event specific economic, social, and
other conditions make infeasible such Project alternatives or such mitigation measures, individual
projects can be approved in spite of one or more significant effects thereof." Section 21002.1(c)
provides: "In the event that economic, social, or other conditions make it infeasible to mitigate one
or more significant effects of a project on the environment, the project may nonetheless be approved
or carried out at the discretion of a public agency...." Finally, California Administrative Code, Title
14, 15093(a) states: "If the benefits of a proposed project outweigh the unavoidable adverse
environmental effects, the adverse environmental effects may be considered 'acceptable.' "
VIII. ADOPTION OF A MONITORING PLAN FOR THE CEQA MITIGATION
         MEASURES
Section 21081.6 of the Public Resources Code requires this Council to adopt a monitoring or
reporting program regarding the changes in the Project and mitigation measures imposed to lessen
or avoid significant effects on the environment. The Mitigation Monitoring Plan, included as
Section 4 in the Final EIR, (MMP) is adopted because it fulfills the CEQA mitigation monitoring
requirements:
a)       The MMP is designed to ensure compliance with the changes in the Project and mitigation
         measures imposed on the Project during Project implementation; and
b)       Measures to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment are fully enforceable
         through permit conditions, agreements or other measures.
