1.  Introduction
                                                                               Section 1
  1.1 - Housing Element Purpose
  As required by the California State Department of Housing and Community Development
  (HCD) every jurisdiction in California must adopt a General Plan, including a Housing
  Element. The Housing Element as part of the West Covina General Plan ensures that the
  City establishes policies, procedures and incentives in its land use planning and
  redevelopment activities that result in the maintenance and expansion of the housing
  supply to adequately accommodate households currently living and expected to live in
  West Covina. While jurisdictions must review and revise elements of their General Plan
  regularly, State law is much more specific to the Housing Element, requiring an update at
  least every eight years. West Covina’s Housing Element is thus an eight-year plan extending
  from 2014 to 2021. The Housing Element institutes policies that will guide City decision-
  making, and establishes an action program to implement housing goals through the year
  2021.
  The Housing Element has been designed to address key housing issues in the City. It
  identifies strategies and programs that focus on the preservation and improvement of
  housing and neighborhoods, providing adequate housing sites, assisting in the provision of
  affordable housing, removing governmental and other constraints to housing investment,
  and promoting fair and equal housing opportunities. Consequently, the Housing Element
  makes provisions for affordable and accessible housing for special needs groups in the
  community, and is designed to provide guidance in the maintenance of existing affordable
  housing. These commitments are an expression of the statewide housing goal of “early
  attainment of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian”, as
  well as an expression of the City of West Covina’s goal for the attainment of a suitable living
  environment for every household.
  1.2 - State Policy and Authority
  In accordance with State Government Code Article 10.6 (65580), the legislature has
  declared that the attainment of decent housing and the provision of a suitable living
  environment to meet the needs of all economic segments of the population are of the
  highest priority. The legislature also recognizes that to meet this statewide goal, cooperation
  between government and the private sector is necessary, and that local and State
  City of West Covina                                                                     1

governments have a responsibility to utilize the powers vested in them to facilitate the
development and improvement of housing.
1.3 - Consistency with State Planning Law
The Housing Element is one of the seven mandatory elements of the General Plan. State
law requires inclusion of a Housing Element in the General Plan in recognition of the role
that land use planning plays in the production of affordable housing. The Housing Element
will guide City decision-making through an action program including policies, procedures,
and incentives for maintaining and expanding the housing supply in the City of West Covina
for all income groups. The Housing Element also takes into consideration the other six State
mandated Elements during the planning process to ensure consistency.
The California Legislature has declared that a decent home and suitable living environment
for every resident is the primary housing goal for the State. Specifically, Section 65580 of the
California Government Codes sets forth the Legislature’s findings as follow:
     1. The availability of housing is of vital statewide importance, and the early attainment
         of decent housing and a suitable living environment for every Californian, including
         farm workers, is a priority of the highest order.
     2. The early attainment of this goal requires the cooperative participation of
         government and the private sector in an effort to expand housing opportunities and
         accommodate the housing needs of Californians of all economic levels.
     3. The provision of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income households
         requires the cooperation of all levels of government.
     4. Local and State governments have a responsibility to use the powers vested in them
         to facilitate the improvement and development of housing to make adequate
         provision for housing needs of all economic segments of the community.
     5. The Legislature recognizes that in carrying out this responsibility, each local
         government also has the responsibility to consider economic, environmental, and
         fiscal factors and community goals set forth in the General Plan and to cooperate
         with other local governments and the State in addressing regional housing needs.
Section 65581 of the California Government Code reflects the Legislative intent for
mandating that each city and county prepare a Housing Element:
     1. To assure that counties and cities recognize their responsibilities in contributing to the
         attainment of the State housing goal.
     2. To assure that counties and cities will prepare and implement housing elements
         which, along with Federal and State programs, will move toward attainment of the
         State housing goals.
2                                                                    2014-2021 Housing Element

    3. To recognize that each locality is best capable of determining what efforts are
         required by it to contribute to the attainment of the State housing goal, provided
         such a determination is compatible with the State housing goal and regional housing
         needs.
    4. To ensure that each local government cooperates with other local governments in
         order to address regional housing needs.
In order to achieve these ends, the California Government Code makes certain provisions
of the Housing Element mandatory. These provisions include:
        Identification and analysis of existing and projected housing needs, resources and
         constraints.
        A statement of goals, policies, quantified objectives, and scheduled programs for
         preservation, improvement and development of housing.
        Identification of adequate sites for housing.
        Adequate provision for existing and projected needs of all economic segments of
         the community.
Specific requirements for data collection and analysis necessary to prepare the Housing
Element are set forth in Government Code Section 65583 and are discussed later in this
document. The Government Code also requires that each draft Housing Element be
reviewed by the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD)
and that the Department’s findings be incorporated prior to adoption, or that specified
findings be made in response to the Department’s comments.
As a mandatory component of the General Plan, the Housing Element should be reviewed
on an annual basis in order to monitor progress in implementation of the programs identified
to meet the housing needs of the community. However, the Housing Element must be
revised every eight years as indicated in State statute.
1.4 - General Plan Consistency
The Housing Element is one of the required seven elements of the West Covina General
Plan. The goals, policies, standards and proposals within this element relate directly to, and
are consistent with, all other elements. The City’s Housing Element identifies programs and
resources required for the preservation, improvement and development of housing to meet
the existing and projected needs of its population. Through the regulation of the amount
and variety of open space and recreation areas, acceptable noise levels in residential
areas, and programs to provide for the safety of the residents, policies contained in General
Plan elements directly affect the quality of life for all West Covina citizens.
The Housing Element is affected by development policies contained in the Land Use
Element, which establishes the location, type, intensity and distribution of land uses
throughout the City, and defines the land use build-out potential. In designating residential
development, the Land Use Element places an upper limit on the number and types of
housing units constructed in the City. The acreage designated for a range of commercial
 City of West Covina                                                                       3

and office uses creates employment opportunities for various income groups. The presence
and potential for jobs affects the current and future demand for housing at the various
income levels in the City.
The Circulation Element of the General Plan also affects the implementation of the Housing
Element. The Circulation Element establishes policies for a balanced circulation system in
the City. The element also provides policies for essential infrastructure to all developed
housing units along with mitigating the effects of growth in the City.
The Housing Element utilizes the most current data available, which generally focuses on
2010 Census data and the 2007-2011 American Community Survey estimates. All figures
represented in the Housing Element are consistent with existing and projected population,
employment and housing figures presented by county, State, national and non-profit
agencies.
The Housing Element has been reviewed for consistency with the City’s other General Plan
elements, and the policies and programs in this Element are consistent with the policy
direction contained in other parts of the General Plan. As portions of the General Plan are
amended in the future, the Housing Element will be reviewed to ensure that internal
consistency is maintained.
1.5 - New State Legislation
The Housing Element addresses new State legislation, which mandates that the following
reforms be included in the Housing Element update to facilitate and expedite the
construction of affordable housing.
       AB 162: Requires the City, upon adoption of the Housing Element, to identify specific
        flood hazard zones in the Land Use Element and specific floodwater and
        groundwater recharge areas in the Conservation and Safety Elements.
       SB 244: Requires the City, upon the adoption of a Housing Element, to update the
        Land Use Element to include data and analysis, goals, and implementation
        measures regarding unincorporated island, fringe, or legacy communities and their
        infrastructure needs.
       SB 812: In addition to the existing special needs groups, the City must include an
        analysis of the housing needs for developmentally disabled persons.
       AB 1867: Under certain conditions, the City can now count multi-unit homeownership
        units that have been converted to affordable units toward their RHNA allocation.
       SB 375 Implications: For jurisdictions that do not submit their adopted 2014-2021
        housing element update within 120 days of the October 2013 deadline, their housing
        element updates revert to a four-year cycle.
       AB 2135: Prescribes procedures for the sale or disposition of surplus land by local
        agencies to prioritize use of surplus properties to increase the supply of housing
        affordable to lower income households.
4                                                                   2014-2021 Housing Element

1.6 - Citizen Participation
California Government Code requires that local governments make a diligent effort to
achieve public participation from all economic segments of the community in the
development of the housing element. In the preparation of the Housing Element Update, a
number of organizations and agencies that provide housing, or housing related services,
were contacted.         Responses from these groups helped guide the Housing Needs
Assessment portion of the Housing Element, as well as the housing plan. Responses from the
community workshop were documented and a list was compiled that categorized the
issues and concerns of City residents. This list was then presented to City staff to determine
which programs, policies, and implementation actions the City needed to incorporate into
the Housing Element that would address community issues and concerns expressed during
the community workshops.
A public workshop was held to inform City Council, Planning Commission, West Covina’s
residents, and interested stakeholders of the current Housing Element update process. The
goal of the workshop was to receive any feedback related to the current and future
housing needs of the City. A public workshop with the Planning Commission was held May
14, 2013 to provide general information on the Housing Element process. All workshops were
advertised for the general public through City notices. Flyers were sent to stakeholder
groups and posted in public places to solicit community participation. For all workshops,
official notices were also posted at City Hall and at other City facilities that serve as
community focus points. The full list of stakeholders invited is shown in Appendix A which
included, but was limited to:
       Baldwin Park Housing Authority                    Catholic Charities/West Covina
       San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center                ESGV Coalition for the Homeless
       Housing Rights Center                             Assistance League of Covina Valley
       Lamp Community Drop In Center                     Action Food Pantry
       L.A. County Public Social Services                Citrus Valley Health Foundation
       American Red Cross/San Gabriel Valley             San Gabriel Valley WINGS Shelter
In addition to the groups listed the City sent flyers to all the housing developments that have
units with affordability covenants and a number of affordable housing developers.
At the public workshop attendance there were a number of residents present and four
individuals spoke during the public comment period. The majority of comments were
questions regarding the Element specifically regarding the progress the City has made
toward their 2008-2014 Housing Plan goals. Specific inquiries were made regarding:
        The City’s intent to encourage energy efficient design;
        How the City plans to accommodate their 2014 RHNA allocation;
        The application and implementation of the Downtown Plan and Code;
        How HOME and CDBG funds are being spent by the City; and
        Specific housing programs available to residents.
 City of West Covina                                                                          5

City Staff and the consultant team were available to address all comments and generally
the meeting was positive with the primary feedback being praise for the document format
leading the Planning Commission to recommend that the document be submitted to the
State for their 60-day review. Following the May 14th meeting the Element was submitted to
the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD).
On June 28, 2013, HCD issued confirmation that the Housing Element was found to be in
compliance with State law. On August 27, 2013 the Planning Commission recommended
adoption of the Housing Element to City Council and on October 1, 2013 the Housing
Element was present to the City Council for adoption. These meetings were noticed and
open for public comment on the final Housing Element draft. After adoption, the Final
Housing Element was sent to the State Department of Housing and Community
Development (HCD) for final State certification.
Subsequent to Housing Element adoption, the City embarked on a focused General Plan
update in conjunction with a Downtown Plan and Code. The planning process for PlanWC,
which began in fall 2014, was designed around extensive, thoughtful input from the local
community.       Opportunities to participate included large public meetings to small
stakeholder roundtables, surveys, project web page updates, MindMixer social media
engagement, email notifications, Facebook, Google Plus and Twitter posts. Each method
encouraged the public to learn and convey their opinions on what was important for the
city to consider over the next 20 years, including housing. An estimated thousand plus
individuals attended these meetings, contributing ideas and insight. Online participation
was equally extensive and captured an audience that doesn’t typically attend public
meetings. Over 35 individuals registered with the MindMixer site, contributing 55 ideas on
various topics.
1.7 - Housing Element Organization
This Housing Element updates the Housing Element drafted by the City for the 2008-2014
planning period. The Housing Element is designed to meet several key objectives. These
include provisions to: ensure internal consistency with the recently adopted General Plan;
meet recently enacted statutory requirements; introduce updated housing, population and
needs analysis; and incorporate the suggested staff responses to HCD comments.
There is no single approved format for a Housing Element. Instead, State law defines
components of issues that must be addressed. A housing element should clearly identify
and address, at a minimum, each component listed below.
    1. Review of Existing Housing Element.
    2. An assessment of existing and projected housing and employment trends to assess a
       locality’s housing needs for all income levels.
    3. An inventory of resources relevant to meeting housing needs.
    4. An inventory of constraints relevant to the meeting of these needs.
6                                                                  2014-2021 Housing Element

    5. A statement of the community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies relative to
         the maintenance, preservation, improvement and development of housing.
    6. A program that sets forth an eight-year schedule of actions the local government is
         undertaking or intends to undertake to implement the policies and achieve the
         goals and objectives of the housing element.
To address the State requirements, the Housing Element has been divided into the following
seven sections:
    1. Housing Plan to address West Covina's identified housing needs, including housing
         goals, policies and programs.
    2. Quantified Objectives to estimate anticipated and potential affordable housing
         development during the planning period;
    3. Community Profile with an analysis of the City's population, household and
         employment base, and the characteristics of the housing stock;
    4. Housing Needs including an updated evaluation of housing need, including the
         housing needs of very low-income households and the disabled;
    5. Housing Constraints examining governmental and non-governmental constraints on
         the production, maintenance, and affordability of housing;
    6. Housing Resources presenting an inventory of potential housing sites in the
         community; and
    7. Progress Report to assess past housing accomplishments.

2.  Housing Plan
                                                                              Section 2
  The Housing Plan includes goals, policies, and actions related to housing and are presented
  in this section. The policies are established to guide the development and preservation of a
  balanced inventory of housing to meet the needs of present and future residents of the
  City. This section includes goals that are intended to help accommodate and facilitate the
  development and maintenance of affordable housing. Generally, West Covina’s housing
  goals address the following five major areas:
      1. Preservation of the City’s existing housing stock;
      2. Increased affordable housing opportunities;
      3. Removal of constraints to the construction of housing opportunities;
      4. Provide equal housing opportunity;
      5. Identification of adequate sites to achieve a variety and diversity of housing.
  For each of the five goals identified, specific policies and programs are summarized within
  the Housing Plan. Individual policies and programs included in this Element are intended to
  provide a wide variety of programs and tools to implement the City’s General Plan goals.
  The Housing Plan includes programs currently in existence as well as new actions which
  have been added to provide and facilitate housing opportunities. Actual programs will be
  implemented at the discretion of the City in order to meet established objectives. It should
  be noted that the listing of a potential funding source of a particular program and/or
  action does not signify that money has been allocated or appropriated as a source of
  funding for such a program and/or action.

GOAL 1:             Maintain and enhance the quality of existing housing
and residential neighborhoods in West Covina.
Continued maintenance and preservation of the existing housing stock in West Covina is
crucial to ensure quality neighborhoods. Housing programs focused on the achievement of
this goal include rehabilitation of single- and multi-family housing units, code enforcement,
and efforts to preserve assisted housing units that may be at risk of converting to market-
rate housing. Through code enforcement, neighborhood, and home improvement
programs, the City is able to maintain the condition of existing housing units.
Policy 1.1:    When available, provide financial assistance to rehabilitate dwelling units
               owned or occupied by seniors and low-income individuals.
Policy 1.2:    Encourage citizen involvement in property maintenance and efforts to
               improve the housing stock and overall neighborhood quality.
Policy 1.3:    Cooperate with non-profit housing providers in the acquisition, rehabilitation,
               and maintenance of older apartment complexes, and single-family houses to
               be preserved as long-term affordable housing.
Policy 1.4:    Continue to monitor affordable housing developments, second units, and
               vacant units within the City.
Policy 1.5:    Preserve the existing affordable housing stock, including mobile homes,
               through the implementation of City regulations, on-going monitoring and the
               provision of financial assistance.
Policy 1.8:    Continue to support the provision of rental assistance to lower-income
               households and encourage property owners to list units with the Housing
               Authority.

PROGRAMS
Program 1.1 – Housing Preservation Program
West Covina places a high priority on maintaining the quality of its housing stock. The
Housing Preservation Program (HPP) for moderate income households provides residents
with small loans of up to $10,000 to complete a variety of home improvements including,
but not limited to: room additions, handicap modifications, structural repairs, exterior
enhancements, interior improvements, electrical and/or plumbing work. Homeowners can
apply for loans of up to $10,000; however approved loans are typically for smaller amounts
allowing for more residents to take advantage of the program. An interest rate of 5% is
applied by the City on loans made to residents. Historically, the HPP was funded using
Redevelopment Set-Aside funds; however the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency
has resulted in the loss of a permanent funding source for this program. For the 2014-2021
planning period the City will annually evaluate new funding opportunities and administer
funds as they become available. If, and when, a permanent funding source is identified,
the City will provide information about the program at City Hall, on the City’s website and in
other public places to increase awareness and solicit applications.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Community Development Commission
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Sources: CDBG funds, Additional funding sources needed.
                                          Objectives:
       Investigate new funding sources, annually evaluate opportunities, and administer
        funds as they become available.
       Promote energy efficiency improvements to households participating in the Housing
        Preservation Program.
       Continue to provide informational materials about the HPP at City Hall, on the City’s
        website and in other public places to increase awareness.
       When funding is available, advertise the HPP and other programs in the City’s
        newsletter (Discover West Covina).
Program 1.2 – Home Improvement Loan Program (HILP)
The Housing Improvement Loan Program (HILP) focuses on improving housing stock within
the City of West Covina, making no-interest loans available to low-income homeowners
that are in need of interior and exterior improvements. Similar to the Housing Preservation
Program, the City offers small loans of up to $10,000 for the rehabilitation of owner-occupied
residences. The program allows for a variety of home improvements including, but not
limited to: room additions, handicap modifications, structural repairs, exterior
enhancements, interior improvements, electrical and/or plumbing work. Homeowners can
apply for loans of up to $10,000; however unlike the HPP no interest is accrued on loans
issued. Historically, the HILP was funded using Redevelopment Set-Aside funds; however the
elimination of the Redevelopment Agency has resulted in the loss of a permanent funding
source for this program. For the 2014-2021 planning period the City will annually evaluate
new funding opportunities and administer funds as they become available. If, and when, a
City of West Covina                                                                        11

         West Covina).
Program 1.3 – Monitor and Preserve Affordable Housing
The City of West Covina currently has four affordable multifamily housing complexes and
five additional deed-restricted complexes that are reserved for seniors. In total the City has
687 units with covenants that do not expire until after 2029. There are no deed-restrictions
set to expire during the planning period. To determine how effective the City’s housing
programs have been in the development and maintenance of affordable housing, the City
will monitor these affordable units to ensure that the rent payments charged are consistent
with levels appropriate for the identified income category. The City has posted their AB 987
Affordable Housing database on its website and will continue to track affordable housing
units citywide through the annual certification process. In addition, as the City develops
additional affordable units these properties will be added to the table and will be
monitored annually to ensure they meet affordability requirements.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Community Development Commission
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Sources: General Fund
Objectives:
        Maintain a list of affordable units throughout the City including affordability
         information to ensure landlords are compliant with deed restrictions and to preserve
         affordable units.
12                                                                  2014-2021 Housing Element

Program 1.4 – Energy Efficient Design
The City will review ordinances and recommend changes where necessary to encourage
energy efficient housing design and practices that are consistent with state regulations. The
City will periodically distribute literature or post information on their website regarding
energy conservation, including solar power, energy efficient insulation, and subsidies
available from utility companies, and encourage homeowners and landlords to incorporate
these features into construction and remodeling projects. When possible the City will
encourage energy conservation devices including, but not limited to lighting, water heater
treatments, and solar energy systems for all new and existing residential projects. The City
will encourage maximum utilization of Federal, State, and local government programs,
including the County of Los Angeles Home Weatherization Program that are intended to
help homeowners implement energy conservation measures. Additionally, as part of the
Housing Preservation Program and the Home Improvement Loan Program, outlined above,
residents can apply for loans to increase the energy efficiency of their home.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Planning Department
Time Frame: Ongoing, 2014-2021. The City will continue to monitor technology advances
and new materials and equipment and review new ordinances when appropriate.
Potential Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives:
       Maintain and distribute literature on energy conservation, including solar power,
        additional insulation, and subsidies available from utility companies, and encourage
        homeowners and landlords to incorporate these features into construction and
        remodeling projects.
       Encourage energy conservation devices, including but not limited to lighting, water
        heater treatments, and solar energy systems for all residential projects.
       Encourage maximum utilization of Federal, State, and local government programs,
        such as the County of Los Angeles Home Weatherization Program, that assist
        homeowners in providing energy conservation measures.
       Continue to provide information on home loan programs available through the City
        and encourage residents to use the programs to implement energy efficient design.
        Continue to partner with Southern California Edison to offer homeowners
        opportunities to reduce energy usage and in turn the City’s carbon footprint.
City of West Covina                                                                       13

Program 1.5 – Code Enforcement
Code enforcement is essential to ensuring housing preservation and rehabilitation. The City
will undertake the enforcement of the Property Maintenance Ordinance, which is intended
to preserve existing residential and nonresidential structures in attractive, safe, and sanitary
conditions. The City will enforce, on a complaint or request basis, local zoning; housing, fire,
and building codes; and standards for landscaping under its Community Enhancement
Program to maintain safe and decent housing. Property owners with code violations who
meet eligibility requirements for participation in the City’s Home Improvement Program will
be offered an opportunity to correct code violations through financial assistance from the
Program, when funds are available. The primary goal of the regulation is to provide
reasonable controls for the maintenance, rehabilitation, preservation, and conservation of
existing commercial and residential properties. The City anticipates that approximately
$100,000 of CDBG funding will be available annually to provide code enforcement
assistance.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Community Enhancement Division
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Source: Departmental Budget, CDBG funds
                                          Objectives:
       Continue to implement the Community Enhancement program to bring substandard
        housing units into compliance with City building and property maintenance codes.
       Enforce and expand where necessary, the property maintenance provisions
        embodied in the California Green Building Code and the Zoning Ordinance in order
        to conserve and improve the quality of the housing units in the City.
14                                                                   2014-2021 Housing Element

GOAL 2:               Provide a variety of housing types to accommodate
all economic segments of the City.
West Covina strives to provide a variety of housing types, with housing units available for all
income segments of the population. The existing housing stock offers many affordable
options throughout the City. The intent of this goal is to assist in the provision of adequate
housing to meet the needs of the community, including the needs of both renter and owner
households.
Policy 2.1:    Continue to participate in State and federally sponsored programs designed
               to maintain housing affordability, including the Section 8 Housing Choice
               Voucher program.
Policy 2.2:    Continue to support non-profit and for-profit organizations in their efforts to
               construct, acquire, and improve housing to accommodate households with
               lower and moderate incomes.
Policy 2.3:    Facilitate development of affordable housing through use of financial and/or
               regulatory incentives.
Policy 2.4:    Provide high quality housing for current and future residents at all income
               levels to achieve a “balanced” community.
Policy 2.5:    Encourage the provision of housing to address the City of West Covina’s
               growing senior population, including design that supports “aging in place,”
               senior housing with supportive services, assisted living facilities and second
               units.
Policy 2.6:    Facilitate the provision of second units as a means of providing affordable
               rental housing in existing neighborhoods. Ensure compatibility with the primary
               unit and surrounding neighborhood.
PROGRAMS
Program 2.1 – Acquisition and Rehabilitation
One of the most significant barriers to affordable housing is the acquisition of the property
on which to construct affordable housing. The City can assist in the provision of affordable
housing by utilizing available funds to write down the cost of land for development of
affordable housing. The City will encourage the acquisition and rehabilitation of existing,
underutilized and substandard residential units and motels. As part of the land write-down
program, the City may also assist in the acquiring and assembling property and in
subsidizing on- and off-site improvements. The City will establish and maintain contacts with
non-profits in the area to solicit interest in participating in programs and projects in West
Covina. This program will contribute to the improvement of the City by providing affordable
units, eliminating blighted properties, and encouraging private investment.          During the
previous planning period, the City partnered with the Regional Occupation Program to
City of West Covina                                                                         15

construct a single family low income unit. The City plans to continue its efforts to identify
additional partnerships in the future.
During the previous planning period, the elimination of the City’s Redevelopment Agency,
has resulted in a loss of a permanent funding source for this program. For the 2014-2021
planning period the City will annually evaluate and investigate new funding opportunities
and administer funds as they become available. If and when a permanent funding source
is identified, the City will provide information about the program at City Hall, on the City’s
website and in other public places to increase awareness.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Planning Department and Community Development

Timeframe: Ongoing; 2014-2021.
Funding Sources: New funding sources needed.
Objectives:
       Investigate new funding sources, annually evaluate opportunities, and administer
        funds as they become available. If, and when, a permanent funding source is
        identified, the City will provide information at City Hall, on the City’s website and in
        other public places to increase awareness.
       Continue to provide financial and regulatory incentives to increase the supply of
        affordable housing.
       Assist developers in the assemblage of property and, as appropriate and necessary;
        provide land write-downs for affordable housing developments.
Program 2.2 – Affordable Housing Financing
For more than 35 years, the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA) has supported the
needs of renters and first-time homebuyers by providing financing and programs that
create safe, decent and affordable housing opportunities for low and moderate income
Californians. Established in 1975, CalHFA was chartered as the State's affordable housing
bank to make low interest rate loans through the sale of tax-exempt bonds. CalHFA offers a
variety of programs for multi-family developers to first time home buyers. As the City of West
Covina has little control over how CalFHA’s programs are administered, the City will be
responsible for providing program information on the City’s website, in the City’s newsletter
(Discover West Covina) and at City Hall.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Community Development Commission
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives:
       Provide informational materials about the program at City Hall, on the City’s website,
        in the City’s newsletter (Discover West Covina) and in other public place to increase
        awareness.
       On an annual basis solicit qualified developers and financial institutions that are
        interested in participating.

Program 2.3 – Alternative Housing Models
The City recognizes that the housing needs of senior, disabled and developmentally
disabled residents may require alternative forms of residential development. To meet the
needs of these specific groups, the City will encourage the provision of more innovative
housing types that may be suitable for the community, including community care facilities,
supportive housing, and assisted living for seniors and the disabled. Assisted living facilities
are designed for individuals needing assistance with activities of daily living but desiring to
live independently for as long as possible. Such facilities bridge the gap between
independent living and nursing homes, and offer residents help with daily activities such as
eating bathing, dressing, laundry, housekeeping, and assistance with medications. Assisted
living can help to meet the housing and supportive services needs of West Covina’s senior
and disabled population.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Planning Department and Community Development
Commission
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Funding Sources: Departmental Budgets
Objectives:
       Facilitate the development of alternative housing models suited to the community
        housing needs through the provision of flexible zoning regulations.
       Continue to provide appropriate standards to encourage development of senior
        housing to meet the needs of the City’s growing senior population.
       Promote alternative housing models during discussions with developers.
       Actively promote outside funding opportunities and regulatory incentives such as
        density bonuses to offset the costs of providing affordable units.
City of West Covina                                                                        17

Program 2.4 – Los Angeles County Partnership
As a means of further leveraging housing assistance, the City will cooperate with the Los
Angeles County Community Development Commission (CDC) and Los Angeles County
Housing Authority to promote resident awareness and application for County run housing
assistance programs. These programs include:
       Mortgage Credit Certificate Program (MCC),
       Home Ownership Program (HOP),
       First Home Mortgage Program,
       Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers,
       Multi-Family Bond Program,
       Multi-Family Rental Program,
       The Single Family Grant Program (SFGP), and
       The Single Family Rehabilitation Loan Program.
The County offers a variety of housing assistance programs that can supplement the City’s
current housing programs. As the City has little control over how the County’s programs are
administered the City will be responsible for providing program information on the City’s
website, in the City’s new letter (Discover West Covina) and at City Hall.
Responsible Agency: Community Development Commission
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Source: General Fund
Objective:
       Increase resident awareness about housing programs offered by the County by
        advertising them on the City’s website, periodically in the City’s newsletter (Discover
        West Covina) and by offering Staff assistance at City Hall.

GOAL 3:                 Minimize the impact of governmental constraints
on housing production and affordability.
Market factors and governmental regulations may at times constrain the development of
adequate and affordable housing. These factors tend to disproportionately impact lower-
and moderate-income households due to their limited resources for absorbing the costs.
The City is committed to removing governmental constraints that hinder the production of
housing and offers a “one-stop” streamlined permitting process to facilitate efficient
entitlement and building permit processing.
Policy 3.1:    Support innovative public, private and non-profit efforts toward the
               development of affordable housing.
Policy 3.2:    Periodically review and revise the City’s development standards, if necessary,
               to facilitate quality housing that is affordable to all income levels.
Policy 3.3:    When feasible, consider reducing, subsidizing, or deferring development fees
               to facilitate the provision of affordable housing.
Policy 3.4:    Continue the provision of incentives, including the density bonus incentive
               program, which encourages developers to include affordable units in their
               projects.
Policy 3.5:    Allow second residential units in specific area districts of the single-family
               residential zone as a means of providing additional infill housing opportunities.
Policy 3.6:    Identify funding to be used to lower land costs of proposed projects, to
               ensure that affordable units are incorporated within the development.
Policy 3.7:    Provide flexibility in development standards to accommodate alternative
               approaches to provide affordable housing such as mixed- use projects.
City of West Covina                                                                         19

PROGRAMS
Program 3.1 – Remove Development Constraints
City staff will specifically review the development standards for the residential zones to
identify standards that may constrain the development of affordable housing and housing
for special groups, such as disabled individuals. The City of West Covina is flexible and is
committed to working with developers to build affordable units, which may require
modifications to constraining standards. During the previous planning period, flexible
development standards in residential and mix use zones were established to promote higher
quality multi-family residential development; to encourage innovative design, efficient use
of land; consolidation of parcels; and to permit developments to be judged on individual
merits. The flexible development standards provision allows for variation of the
development/design standards required by the multi-family zones when affordable units are
included in the development. The modifications include such standards as parking, unit size,
lot size, lot dimensions, setbacks, common open space, art in public spaces standard/fees
and public works improvements.
The City has a recent history of granting park fee reductions, modifying parking standards
and working with developers to attain densities up to 75 dwelling units per acre on
redeveloped sites. The City will further review any standards identified in Chapter 6 of the
Housing Element that may have been deemed to be a constraint and alter them as
necessary to ensure that the development of affordable housing is feasible. The City will also
continue to provide development standard modifications, fast track processing for
applications related to the creation of affordable housing, and will offer fee modifications
for projects including affordable units that are required to apply for variations to the existing
development standards. Incentives for extremely low income housing will be encouraged
to prioritize the development of units for this income group.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Planning Department
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives:
        On an annual basis, review development standards to ensure that the development
         of lower income housing can occur. Revise the development code to address all
         constraints identified in Section 6 of the Housing Element.
        Continue to use flexible development standards to facilitate the development of
         affordable housing through promotion of maximum development densities in the
         multi-family zone and the Downtown Plan and Code.

Program 3.2 – Density Bonus Ordinance
In accordance with State law, the West Covina Municipal Code includes a section titled
“Low and Moderate Income and Senior Citizen Housing.” This section specifically allows for
density bonuses from between 25% and 160% in an effort to offset land and construction
costs. In addition, that section of the code allows for the modification of development
standards to render the development economically feasible. This action is intended to
facilitate the development of housing for low and very-low income households that is
restricted for a period of no less than 45 years for owners and 55 years for renters. The City
will specifically promote the use of the density bonus ordinance for senior housing, and in
conjunction with mixed use projects and within Specific Plans.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Planning Department
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives:
       Continue to promote the City’s density bonus ordinance that offers bonuses for the
        provision of affordable housing, depending on the amount and type provided,
        consistent with revised Government Code §65915.
       Provide informational materials about the density bonus ordinance at City Hall, on
        the City’s website and in other public places to increase awareness.
Program 3.3 – Fast-track/Priority Application Processing
Affordable housing developers often face constraints in developing affordable housing
projects. One way the City can assist such developers is by providing fast-track/priority
processing for low-income and special needs housing projects. This service can encourage
affordable housing development by allowing developers to go through the approval and
permitting process quicker keeping costs down and units affordable. It is important that
following the construction of the project that units are monitored to ensure that subsequent
tenants are households with special needs and/or lower income.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Planning Department and Public Works Department
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives:
       The City will assign senior staff to handle the projects, and staff assistance may be
        provided to prepare the necessary documents in half the typical processing time.
       Provide informational materials about fast track processing at City Hall, on the City’s
        website and in other public places to increase awareness.

Program 3.4 – Second-Unit Ordinance
Allowing for the development of second-units on single family lots offers a valuable
affordable housing option to specific types of residents within the community. Second-units
can benefit seniors, students and single persons that desire to live in a more suburban
setting. Allowing for second-units can also provide property owners with a source of income
which can benefit middle class residents and elderly homeowners. Approximately 175 acres
of land are developed with older subdivisions in West Covina containing lots large enough
to permit a second-unit under existing single-family zoning regulations. During the previous
planning period, the City of West Covina modified the Zoning Code to remove the
Conditional Use Permit requirement to allow for second-units in residential zones to be
administerally approved by City Staff
The City recognizes that second units can be an effective way of providing affordable units
particularly for elderly residents and will amend their Zoning Code prior to Housing Element
certification to ensure consistency with State legislation. The City also ensures that provisions
in their second-unit ordinances relating to matters including unit size, parking, fees and other
requirements, are not arbitrary, excessive, or burdensome so as to unreasonably restrict the
ability of homeowners to create second units in zones in which they are authorized by local
ordinance. Staff will continue administer and promote their second unit ordinance at City
Hall and on the City’s website during the planning period.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Planning Department
Timeframe: Adopt a Zoning Code update in conjunction with Housing Element certification.
Administer and promote the ordinance throughout the planning period.
Potential Funding Sources: Departmental Budget
Objectives:
        Develop a database of second units throughout the City.
        Provide informational materials about the second unit ordinance at City Hall, on the
         City’s website and in other public places to increase awareness.
Program 3.5 – Manufactured Housing Mobile Home Rent Control
Manufactured housing and mobile home parks represent affordable housing resources for
the City’s low-income and elderly households. Manufactured housing units in West Covina
are found in two mobile home parks. The City has adopted the Mobile Home Rent Control
Ordinance and restricts conversion of mobile home parks to other uses. State law requires
local jurisdictions to permit manufactured housing and mobile homes in all residential zones.
The City will continue to permit new mobile home parks in multi-family zones and
manufactured homes on permanent foundations on individual lots or in new manufactured
home subdivisions.        Manufactured homes on single-family lots must comply with
development standards applicable to the single-family zones in which they are located.

Objectives:
       Encourage the provision of affordable housing by allowing manufactured housing
        (including mobile homes) in single family residential zones, subject to the conditions
        consistent with State law.
       Maintain the Mobile Home Rent Control Ordinance of 1984 to limit rent increases for
        mobile home spaces to retain mobile home parks as a continued source of
        affordable housing in the City.
Program 3.6 – Water and Sewer Service Providers
In accordance with Government Code Section 65589.7 as revised in 2005, immediately
following City Council adoption, the City must deliver a copy of the 2014-2021 Housing
Element to all public agencies or private entities that provide water or sewer services to
properties within West Covina.

Program 3.7 - Flood Management
In accordance with Government Code Section 65302, as part of the next General Plan
update process the City shall review and revise where appropriate the Conservation and
Safety Elements to consider flood risks when making land use decisions. Specifically, the City
shall upon the next revision of the housing element on or after January 1, 2009, the
Conservation Element shall identify rivers, creeks, streams, flood corridors, riparian habitats,
and land that may accommodate floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge and
storm water management.

GOAL 4: Promote equal housing opportunity for all residents.
To fully meet the community’s housing needs, the City must assure that housing is accessible
to all residents, regardless of age, race, religion, family status, or physical disability. The City,
attempts to achieve this through reasonable accommodation and through a partnership
with the Housing Rights Center.
Policy 4.1:     Continue to enforce fair housing laws prohibiting discrimination in the
                building, financing, selling, or renting of housing on the basis of race, ethnicity,
                ancestry, national origin, religion, sex, disability, age, marital status, familial
                status, source of income, sexual orientation, or any other arbitrary factor.
Policy 4.2:     Promote greater awareness of tenant and landlord rights and obligations.
Policy 4.3:     Provide that displacement of low-income households is avoided and, where
                necessary, is carried out in an equitable manner.
Policy 4.4:     Encourage housing construction or alteration to meet the needs of residents
                with special needs such as large families, the elderly and disabled.
PROGRAMS
Program 4.1 – Fair Housing Program
The City will continue to contract with the Housing Rights Center to provide residents with
fair housing services using Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. Fair housing
services provided by the Housing Rights Center include counseling and mediation between
tenants and landlords. The Housing Rights Center also conducts seminars and information
activities throughout the region. The City will refer fair housing complaints to the Housing
Rights Center SGVFHC as appropriate. The City will assist in program outreach through
placement of fair housing program brochures in both English and Spanish at the public
counter, City library, post office, and other community locations such as the City’s senior
center.

Program 4.2 – Reasonable Accommodation
Pursuant to Senate Bill 520, jurisdictions are required to analyze constraints to the
development, maintenance, and improvement of housing for persons with disabilities and
take measures to remove constraints (i.e. institutional barriers). The Fair Housing Act, as
amended in 1988, requires that cities and counties provide reasonable accommodation to
rules, policies, practices, and procedures where such accommodation may be necessary
to afford individuals with disabilities equal housing opportunities. Reasonable
accommodation provides a basis for residents with disabilities to request flexibility in the
application of land use and zoning regulations or, in some instances, even a waiver of
certain restrictions or requirements from the local government to ensure equal access to
housing opportunities. Cities and counties are required to consider requests for
accommodations related to housing for people with disabilities and provide the
accommodation when it is determined to be “reasonable” based on fair housing laws and
case law interpreting the statutes. The City of West Covina encourages and promotes
accessible housing for persons with disabilities and through Ordinance 2235 approved in
August 2012 established a formal procedure to consider requests for reasonable
accommodation. This includes the retrofitting of existing dwelling units and enforcement of
the State accessibility standards for new residential construction. Removal of architectural
barriers is also an eligible improvement under the City’s Home Improvement Loan Program.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Planning Department
Timeframe: Ongoing 2014-2021
Potential Funding Source: Departmental Budget
Objectives:
       Provide information to residents on reasonable accommodation procedures at
        public counters and on the City website.
       Promote the Home Improvement Loan Program as a potential funding source for the
        disabled or elderly to utilize to make accessibility improvements to their homes.
Program 4.3 – Senior Center Shared Housing Program
The Senior Citizens’ Center at Cortez Avenue offers a variety of services aimed at senior
residents, including: help in finding home care/home chore workers; transportation; services
to help those who would like help in maintaining independence in their homes, including
case management; assistance with Social Security and Medicare forms/questions;
volunteer opportunities; and support groups. These services are intended to allow senior
residents to be independent in their own homes as an alternative to group care facilities.
The City currently advertises the program on their website and will continue to administer
funds as they become available.
Responsible Agency: Department of Community Services
Time Frame: Ongoing, 2014-2021, subject to the availability of funds

Program 4.4 – Homeless Assistance Program
The City will continue to use CDBG funds to support agencies providing services to the
homeless, persons at risk of becoming homeless and non-homeless persons with special
needs. The City will continue to support efforts by local non-profits to expand the services
provided to at-risk population groups. On an annual basis, the City provides CDBG funds for
supportive services and transitional and temporary housing providers serving West Covina
residents. The City has provided CDBG funds to assist non-profits such as East San Gabriel
Valley Coalition for the Homeless, YWCA (Meals on Wheels) and food pantries. In addition,
the City also issues vouchers for shelters to homeless persons at nearby motels to
complement the Salvation Army.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Community Development Commission
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Source: General Fund and Community Development Block Grants
Objectives:
        Provide approximately $100,000 annually in CDBG funding to care providers and
         associated facilities.
        Provide referrals to the local organizations that serve the homeless (i.e. Wings through
         the YWCA and the East San Gabriel Valley Coalition for the Homeless). Also provide
         informational materials about tenant and landlord housing rights at City Hall, in the
         City’s newsletter (Discover West Covina), on the City’s website and in other public
         places to increase awareness.
Program 4.5 – Foreclosures
With the recent improvements in the economy and more specifically the housing market,
cities throughout Southern California are dealing with a lower number of foreclosed homes
than the previous planning period. Despite the change in the economic climate the City of
West Covina will continue to direct residents to available resources to address and prevent
foreclosure. Additionally, West Covina will direct residents to the Los Angeles County
Department of Consumer Affairs, HUD and local non-profit organizations that offer services
including counseling and/or informational fairs.

Program 4.6 – Housing for Developmentally Disabled Persons Program
The housing needs of persons with disabilities, including persons with developmental
disabilities are typically not addressed by Title 24 Regulations. The housing needs of persons
with disabilities, in addition to basic affordability, range from slightly modifying existing units
to requiring a varying range of supportive housing facilities. To accommodate residents with
developmental disabilities the City will seek State and Federal monies, as funding becomes
available, in support of housing construction and rehabilitation targeted for persons with
disabilities, including developmental disabilities. West Covina will also provide regulatory
incentives, such as expedited permit processing and fee waivers and deferrals, to projects
targeted for persons with disabilities, including persons with developmental disabilities. To
further facilitate the development of units to accommodate persons with developmental
disabilities, the City shall reach out annually to developers of supportive housing to
encourage development of projects targeted for special needs groups. Finally, as housing is
developed or identified, West Covina will work with the San Gabriel/Pomona Regional
Center to implement an outreach program informing families within the City of housing and
services available for persons with developmental disabilities. Information will be made
available on the City's website.
Responsible Agency: The Planning Division

GOAL 5: Identify Adequate Sites to Achieve Housing Variety.
Meeting the housing needs of all residents of the community requires the identification of
adequate sites for all types of housing. By capitalizing on the allowances in the
Development Code and continuing to maintain an inventory of potential sites, the City will
assure that adequate residentially-zoned and mixed use sites are available.
Policy 5.1:      Provide for a range of residential development types in West Covina,
                 including low density single-family homes, moderate density townhomes,
                 higher density multi-family units, and residential/commercial mixed use in
                 order to address the City’s share of regional housing needs.
Policy 5.2:      Create mixed use opportunities along key commercial corridors as a means
                 of enhancing pedestrian activity and community interaction.
Policy 5.3:      Maintain zoning regulations that permit by right, in designated zones, housing
                 that meets temporary and short-term housing needs for individuals and
                 families.
Policy 5.4:      Provide incentives to facilitate the development of senior housing options.
Policy 5.5:      Require that housing constructed expressly for low- and moderate-income
                 households not be concentrated in any single portion of the City.
Policy 5.6:      Explore opportunities for new residential development within those areas of
                 the City occupied by vacant or underutilized, obsolete commercial and
                 industrial uses.
PROGRAMS
Program 5.1 – Ensure Adequate Sites to Accommodate the RHNA
To facilitate the development of affordable housing and accommodate the City’s RHNA
allocation for the 2014-2021 planning period, the City has identified sites within the
Downtown that permit high density infill development. Development in the Downtown is
guided by the Downtown Plan and Code, which requires and encourages the
development of high density residential uses and allows for a mixture of residential and non-
residential development on approximately 70 acres. The Downtown Plan and Code
identifies sites that require residential development at a minimum density of 21 dwelling units
per acre up to a maximum of 54 dwelling units per acre. While the Downtown Plan and
Code will be applied to the entire Downtown which totals 250 acres, the City has identified
8 specific sites that are prime for redevelopment and most realistic and appropriate to
accommodate their RHNA.
The eight sites identified in the Housing Resources section, totaling 53 acres, are
underutilized sites and can accommodate higher density development. To encourage the
development of residential projects with affordable units, the City will meet with land
28                                                                    2014-2021 Housing Element

owners to facilitate redevelopment on vacant sites and severely underutilized sites within
the Downtown. To further encourage development, the City may offer land owners and
developers a menu of incentives including: development fee modifications, fast track
processing, density bonus incentives, flexible development standards, and funding for off-
site improvements, as indicated in the Housing Plan. Funding for these regulatory and
financial incentives will be provided through CDBG and grant funds. The City will also
prioritize funding for projects that incorporate units for extremely low income households.
To ensure sufficient residential capacity to accommodate the identified regional need for
lower-income households is maintained within the Downtown, the City will develop and
implement a formal monitoring program. The program will track development (residential,
commercial or mixed use) approvals on identified sites and for those that result in a
reduction of potential affordable units below the residential capacity assumed in Table 7-
10, the City will identify and designate additional sites, if necessary, to ensure that no net
loss occurs. This means that if any one of the identified sites is not developed in
accordance with the development requirements outlined for the Downtown, an alternative
site or sites must be identified and rezoned to maintain the overall affordable unit capacity.
The City will report on the progress of this amendment in its annual progress reports required
pursuant to Government Code Section 65400 and due on April 1st of each year.
Responsible Agency: West Covina Planning Department
Timeframe: Ongoing, 2014-2021
Potential Funding Source: General Fund
Objectives:
        Make the vacant and underutilized residential sites inventory available to non-profit
         and for-profit housing developers on the City’s website.
        Monitor the sites available for new residential development.
Program 5.2 – Lot Consolidation Program
Parcels identified as housing opportunity sites within the Downtown range in size from
approximately 0.5 acres to 7 acres and in some cases are narrow or shallow in size, which
could be seen as an additional constraint to the development of housing. To encourage
the development of residential and mixed use projects, the City encourages lot
consolidation through incentives such as a reduction in development standards (i.e. lot size,
parking, and open space requirements) to merge adjacent lots. When funds are available,
the City may also offer to subsidize a portion of development fees to encourage lot
consolidation and to promote more intense residential and mixed use development on
vacant and underutilized sites within the Downtown. The City will promote the program at
City Hall, on its website and will evaluate requests for funding on a case by case basis.

       Encourage lot consolidation of smaller parcels to accommodate projects including
        a minimum of 16 units at a density of at least 30 dwelling units per acre or higher.
Program 5.3 – Local Agency Sale of Surplus Land
During the disposal of surplus land, the local agency shall negotiate in good faith with
entities that respond to the local agency’s offer to sell or rent surplus property, pursuant to
Government Code Sections 54222. Land sold for affordable housing shall be required to
provide 25 percent of the units at affordable housing cost to lower-income households and
to maintain the affordable housing units within the development at a cost to lower income
households for a period of at least 55 years.

3.  Quantified Objectives
                                                                                                                   Section 3
  State Housing Law requires that each jurisdiction establish the number of housing units that
  will be constructed, rehabilitated, and preserved over the planning period. The Quantified
  Objectives for the Housing Element reflect the planning period from January 1, 2014 to June
  30, 2021.
  It is important to note that while the Quantified Objectives of the RHNA are required to be
  part of the Housing Element and the City will strive to obtain these objectives, West Covina
  cannot guarantee that these needs will be met give limited financial and staff resources,
  and the increasing gap in affordability of housing resources and incomes. Satisfaction of
  the City’s regional housing needs will partially depend on the cooperation of private
  funding sources and resources of the State, Federal and County programs that are used to
  support the needs of the extremely low-, very low-, low-, and moderate-income households.
  Additionally, outside economic forces heavily influence the housing market. State law
  recognizes that a locality may not be able to accommodate its regional fair share housing
  need.
  The Quantified Objectives assume optimum conditions for the production of housing.
  However, environmental, physical and market conditions influences the timing, type and
  cost of housing production in a community. Below is an estimate quantified objectives for
  the number of housing units, broken down by income category, over the 2014-2021
  timeframe.

                                                                            Section 4
  4.1 - Introduction
  Incorporated in 1923 the development of West Covina began in earnest with the post-
  World War II housing boom. The growth of the City continued through the 1950s and 1960s
  paralleling the suburbanization of the eastern half of San Gabriel Valley. Suburbanization
  played a large role in shaping the development of the City, shifting the City away from a
  more traditional development consisting of a densely concentrated commercial center
  downtown surrounded by housing whose age increases the further the unit is from the
  downtown. The City is instead, characterized as a series of residential neighborhoods, with
  commercial districts along arterial streets and large, regional commercial (primarily retail)
  centers along either side of the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10).
  Although the City of West Covina was incorporated in the 1920s, there are few remaining
  structures in the City that pre-date the 1940s. The western and northern portions of the City
  bordering Baldwin Park and Covina more predominately contain the neighborhoods with
  older homes. These sections of the city include residences on smaller lots, many of which
  have lower property values. Some of the residences in these older neighborhoods are in
  poor condition and are in need of improvements and rehabilitation due to their age. In
  contrast, the eastern portion of the City is characterized by newer more expensive housing
  typically on larger lots. These wealthier neighborhoods are most commonly located the
  hillside areas bordering the City of Walnut where many of the neighborhoods were
  developed from the subdivision of old estates and ranches.
  Historically, the City of West Covina has provided affordable housing alternatives to the
  “closer in” Los Angeles communities of Pasadena, San Marino, Monterey Park, and Arcadia.
  For much of the twentieth century it was relatively easy for the average household to find a
  reasonably priced home in the City. This changed, however, by the 1980s, as the disparity
  between income and housing cost had increased rapidly largely due to the increased
  demand for housing throughout the Southern California region. The gap between housing
  and income increased further in the latter part of the 1990s when Southern California
  experienced a significant economic boom. The beginning of the twenty first century
  brought with it a significant economic upturn and consequently housing prices in West
  Covina more than doubled between 2000 and 2007. The beginning of 2007, however,
  marked a plateau and decline in the housing market. Following several years of economic
  decline, the local economy seems to have stabilized in 2012 with the housing market
  entering an upward swing once again.
  City of West Covina                                                                  33

The economic base of West Covina is dominated by regional and local retail, service-
oriented businesses, and health care establishments. While other types of commercial and
industrial land uses exist in the City, roughly two-thirds of the jobs in West Covina are retail
and service-related. Despite this, a large percentage of West Covina residents do not work
for local companies and instead hold jobs in various managerial and technical professions
in the surrounding region. Consequently, the average income in the City ($68,308) is higher
than the countywide average ($56,226), and greater than would be expected for the local
economic base.
In the previous decade the most significant changes in the community have been:
       The continued development of hillside areas bordering the City of Walnut, primarily
        through the subdivision of former estate and ranch properties and including some
        infill;
       The redevelopment and expansion of older regional commercial centers along the
        San Bernardino Freeway;
       The development of additional senior housing to accommodate the increase in the
        senior population;
       Extreme fluctuations in home prices, which has increased and decreased the
        affordability of homes in the City;
       Changes in household composition as younger families with children replace older
        adults without children resulting in a significant rise in school enrollment; and
       Rising household incomes as a result of changes in household composition.
4.2 - Data Sources
Data sources used for the following Needs Assessment include: the U.S. Census (1990 2000,
and 2010 Censuses), 2007-2011 American Community Survey (ACS) Five-Year Estimates, and
various other sources. For demographic data, ACS estimates are used to show changes in
conditions since the 2010 U.S. Census. Additional information has been drawn from the
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS), which is also based on Census 2000
reports. CHAS reports were created using special tabulations of sample Census data,
developed for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Thus, the
number of households in each category often deviates slightly from the 100% count due to
extrapolations to the total household level. Because of this, interpretations of CHAS data
should focus on proportions and percentages, rather than on precise numbers.

4.3 - Housing Assistance Summary
Periodically the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provides data
summarizing the state of housing for jurisdictions. This report is based on 2000 US Census data
and is part of the Comprehensive Housing Assessment Strategy (CHAS) Databook. Table 4-1
summarizes the assistance needs of all households in West Covina based on the most
recent CHAS data. This data is broken down by household tenure (renter/owner), household
type, and “housing problems.” Households with “housing problems” includes units that: 1)
have physical defects (lacking complete kitchen or bathroom); 2) are overcrowded
(housing units with more than one person per room); 3) have a housing cost burden
exceeding 30% of gross income; or 4) have a severe housing cost burden exceeding 50
percent of gross income.

According to the CHAS Databook, nearly 50% of all households in the City of West Covina
experienced some form of housing problem. The percentage of total households that
experienced some type of housing problem was greater among renters than owners. This
may reflect the fact that there are more single-family homes than multi-family units in the
City. The statistics identified in Table 4-1 indicate that housing cost burden is a contributing
factor to housing problems, particularly for extremely low and very low income households.
The issues and information provided in this table will be further examined in this section of
the Housing Element.
4.4 - Population Trends and Characteristics
According to the US Census between 1990 and 2000 the population in West Covina grew
by 9.4%; from 96,086 to 105,886. This is comparable to the growth rate of Los Angeles
County which was approximately 10% from 1990 to 2000. In 2011, the ACS estimated that
the population had grown to 105,810 persons, a slight decrease from the 2000 Census
count. The 2007-2011 ACS estimates also indicate that the population shifted from being
divided almost evenly between male and female residents (49 percent and 51 percent
respectively) to more heavily female (53 percent female as compared to 47 percent male).
Figure 4-1 shows the changes in population between 1990 and 2000 and also projects the
population by decade until 2035, based on SCAG’s projections from the 2013 Regional
Transportation Plan.

           American Community Survey Estimates, SCAG RTP 2013.
Looking forward, the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) projects that
by 2035 the population of West Covina will increase to 120,200 residents, a 14 percent
increase from the 2010 Census population count. With little remaining vacant land, the
population growth expected in the following decades may require new strategies for
housing in areas of the City.
West Covina is centrally located in the eastern half of Los Angeles County. Figure 4.2 below
reflects the population of West Covina in comparison to neighboring jurisdictions. According
36                                                                         2014-2021 Housing Element

to the 2007-2011 ACS, West Covina was twice as large as many of the jurisdictions in the
immediate surrounding area.

4.4.1 - Age Composition
        The age composition of a population is an important factor in evaluating housing
        needs. The traditional assumption in many communities is that young adults tend to
        prefer apartments, low- to moderate-cost condominiums, and smaller or more
        affordable single-family units. In comparison, it is assumed that mature adults provide
        the market for moderate- to high-end condominiums and single-family homes.
        Finally, the senior population (65 years and older) tend to generate demand for low-
        to moderate-cost apartments and condominiums, community residential settings,
        and mobile homes.
        Based on the 2007-2011 ACS estimates, Los Angeles County as a whole can be
        characterized as having a young population, with a median age of 35.0 years in
        2011. West Covina is representative of this characteristic with a median age of 35.8
        years in 2011, an increase from 32.7 years in 2006. Table 4-2 below summarizes the
        age distribution citywide in 2000 and 2011.

     There have been subtle changes in the City’s age distribution since 2000. According
     to the American Community Survey, from 2000 to 2011 there was a slight increase in
     the number of school age children (5-17 years old) and senior adults (65 years and
     older), and a more significant increase in middle age adults (45-64 years old). In
     contrast, the City experienced a decrease in college age (18-24 years old) and
     young adults (25-44 years old). These changes in the City’s age distribution may be
     linked to the recent increases in housing prices that have excluded many young
     adults from purchasing property, but have presented opportunities for established
     adults with capital.
4.4.2 - Race/Ethnic Composition
     The racial and ethnic composition of a community affects housing needs due to the
     particular household characteristics of different groups. Table 4-3 shows the
     changes in the racial/ethnic composition of West Covina residents between 2000
     and 2010.

       1 Those reporting that they are of Hispanic origin may be of any race and are, therefore, included in a separate
       category.
       Between 2000 and 2010, there was a continuing shift in the racial/ethnic composition
       of the population, most significantly a further increase in the number of Hispanic
       residents. The 2010 Census indicates that approximately 54 percent of the total
       population of the City of West Covina is of Hispanic decent, an increase of 7.9
       percent from 2000. The second most predominant group in the City were White
       residents, comprising approximately 37 percent of the population, followed by Asian
       residents comprising 25 percent of the population, in 2011. Generally, most racial
       groups experienced a decline as the Hispanic population has continued to grow.
4.4.3 - Employment Characteristics
       Employment and income are two important factors that largely determine a
       household’s ability to secure housing. The civilian labor force of West Covina was
       estimated at 47,609 in 2011 up from 44,969 at the time of the 2000 Census.
       West Covina residents are employed in a variety of industries, with the largest
       percent of the population employed in the education, health and social services
       sector (22.5%). The second most common sector is manufacturing, with over 12
       percent of the residents employed in the industry. According to the 2011 American
       Community Survey, retail trade and professional and business services are two
       additional industries, that when combined, total over 20 percent of the City’s total
       employment. The retail sector is important to consider when assessing housing
       affordability as salaries tend to be lower, which decreases the amount of income
       available for housing. The retail sector also generally does not offer health and other
       employment benefits, further increasing economic strain on families. Employment
       and income are two important factors that largely determine a household’s ability to
       secure housing.

   The “jobs-housing balance” analysis is a general measure of a community’s
   employment opportunities with respect to its residents’ housing needs. An ideally
   balanced community would reach equilibrium between employment and housing
   opportunities so that a majority of residents could also work within West Covina.
   The Southern California Association of Government’s employment projections for
   West Covina indicate there were approximately 27,700 jobs in the City in 2008 as
   compared to 31,600 housing units. These estimates indicate a jobs-to-housing ratio of
   0.87 jobs for every 1 housing unit in 2008. Looking forward this number is expected to
   increase to 29,300 in 2020 and 30,900 jobs by 2035, indicating slow growth in
   employment for the City over the next two decades. Table 4-4 lists major employers
   throughout West Covina.

4.5 - Household Characteristics
Before current housing problems can be understood and future needs anticipated, housing
occupancy characteristics need to be identified in the City. The following is an analysis of
household types and sizes, income levels, and other household characteristics that may
affect access and demand for housing and housing programs. This section details the
various household characteristics in West Covina.
4.5.1 - Persons per Household
       A household is defined by the Census as all persons occupying a housing unit.
       Families are a subset of households and include all persons living together who are
       related by blood, marriage, or adoption. Single households include persons living
       alone in housing units, but do not include persons in group quarters such as
       convalescent homes or dormitories. According to the US Census, other households
       include unrelated people living together, such as roommates.
       Of the 31,372 households identified by the 2007-2011 ACS, Table 4-5 indicates that
       the highest percentages of households in the City of West Covina (26 percent) were
       still two-person households. For the last twenty years, three and four person
       households combined made up approximately 37 percent of the City’s total, which
       was greater than the number for Los Angeles County, (approximately 31 percent
       respectively). The County in comparison to West Covina had a greater number of
       single person households (25 percent) as well as two person households (27 percent).

       The distribution of households as indicated by 2010 Census data indicates that more
       than three-fourths of households in West Covina are families. Families headed by
       single parents made up 23 percent of all households. Table 4-6 shows the change in
       the number of households from 1990 to 2010.

4.5.2 - Household Size
     Household composition and size are often two interrelated factors as communities
     with a large proportion of families with children tend to have a large average
     household size. Such communities have a greater need for larger units with
     adequate open space and recreational opportunities for children. Household size in
     West Covina remains slightly higher than that of Los Angeles County. The City of West
     Covina average household size in 2010 was 3.35 according to the 2007-2011 ACS, as
     compared to the County average household size of 2.9.
     To better understand types of households in West Covina, Table 4-7 describes
     household size by renter and owner. Based on 2010 data, it appears that among
     both renters and owners, there is a strong need for two and three bedroom units to
     accommodate the larger number of two to four person households. The Census also
     indicates that roughly one-fifth of the City’s households have five or more persons.
     For these households, units with three or more bedrooms are best able to meet their
     needs. Generally there was a slight decrease in the number of larger households
     since the 2000 Census.

4.5.3 - Household Income
       According to the 2007-2011 ACS the median household income in the year 2011 for
       Los Angeles County was $56,266, up from $42,189 in 2000. Similarly, the median family
       income was reported to be $62,595 in 2011, a substantial increase from $46,452 in
       2000. A more recent calculation completed by the Department of Housing and
       Urban Development (HUD) indicates that the median family income for Los Angeles
       County was $61,622 in 2013. In comparison to the County, the Census indicates that
       the City of West Covina experiences higher household and family median incomes
       of $68,308 and $75,610 respectively. The income estimates for West Covina total
       households/families for the year 2010, are found in Table 4-8.

4.6 - Housing Inventory and Market Conditions
This section summarizes the existing housing stock in the City of West Covina and prevailing
market conditions. Analysis of past trends influencing the housing market provides a
foundation for projecting the future housing needs of West Covina.
4.6.1 - Housing Inventory
        Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and State Department of Finance indicate that
        the housing stock in the City increased by 758 units between 2000 and 2007 at a rate
        just under 1 percent. As shown in Table 4-9 the slow growth rate in the City may be
        attributed to the lack of vacant land left in the City and that the City is almost
        entirely built out. In comparison to other jurisdictions in the region, between 1990 and
        2010 the City’s housing growth rate (4.9%) falls in the middle and is several

        Table 4-10 below describes housing occupancy by tenure and housing type in 2010.
        Sixty-six percent of the total occupied housing units were owner-occupied; the
        remaining 34 percent of the occupied housing stock were renter-occupied. In West
        Covina an estimated 68 percent of all units in the City contain three or more
        bedrooms, while 20 percent are two bedroom and 12 percent are one bedroom or
        studios. It is important to note that over 80 percent of units with three or more
        bedrooms are found within owner-occupied housing stock, comprising 88 percent of
        all ownership units. The majority of rental units are either studio or 1-2 bedroom units.
        Given the number of large families in the city as shown in Table 4-7, there is a need
        to ensure that an adequate number of rental units with 3 or more bedrooms exist.
        Despite the apparent availability of units, it is essential to determine whether local
        levels of housing are keeping pace with the special needs and affordability
        characteristics of the overall demand.

       1 The Census records tenure based on the number of bedrooms in a housing unit; however the Census does not
       record the number of bedrooms in a vacant housing unit.
       An evaluation of the adequacy of a community’s housing stock requires
       consideration of the type and size of housing provided to meet the specific needs of
       the community, as well as the affordability of these units. As shown previously in Table
       4-7, 40 percent of owner-occupied households were comprised of three to four
       persons, while roughly 18 percent were large households with 5 or more persons. For
       renter-occupied households the percentage of households with three or more
       persons was about the same at 36 percent, while renter-occupied households with
       five or more persons made up 20 percent of all renters. Based on Table 4-10, the
       City’s housing stock appears to provide a sufficient amount of housing units with
       three or more bedrooms to meet the demand generated by larger families. The
       majority of these units, however, are ownership units, and may be financially
       unattainable for many large households, particularly those that are considered to be
       extremely low, very-low and low income.
4.6.2 - Housing Stock Diversity
       Diversity in the types of housing available within a community promotes equal
       housing opportunity for persons of all income levels. A balanced housing stock allows
       households of all income levels, age, and size the opportunity to find housing suited
       to their needs. According to the US Census, there were 32,640 housing units in the
       City in 2010. West Covina is a predominately built-out city and in recent years, has
       experienced only slight growth in its housing stock. Table 4-11 summarizes the
       composition of the housing stock for the years 1990, 2000 and 2010. Between 1990
       and 2000 there was an increase of 946 units and similarly between 2000 and 2010
       there was an increase of 582 units.

     Table 4-11 indicates that detached single-family homes have remained the most
     prominent type of housing unit throughout the City; comprising around two-thirds of
     the total units in the city. Multi-family structures with five or more units are the second
     most common type of housing unit containing over 20 percent of the total housing
     stock in 2010. Single-family attached units constituted 9 percent of total units in 2010,
     while multi-family housing (2-4 units) and mobile homes round out the City’s housing
     stock with 5 percent and 1 percent of total units in the City, respectively.
     Examining the actual number of dwelling units in the City, the data indicates that
     between 2000 and 2010 there were only small changes, if any in the number of each
     housing unit type. Table 4-11 indicates that there were slight increases in all housing
     unit types over the last decade. Since 1990, the majority of the units constructed in
     the City were single-family detached housing units. This is likely due to the growing
     demand for these units as the number of families able to afford single-family homes
     increased, and weak demand for production of market-rate rental housing in the
     City.
4.6.3 - Tenure
     Housing tenure refers to whether a given unit is owned or rented. At the time of the
     2010 Census, approximately two-thirds of occupied housing units in West Covina
     were owner-occupied. Majority owner-occupied units were single-family units, with
     97 percent of the City’s housing stock falling into this classification. The remaining 5
     percent of owner occupied units were spilt between multi-family structures with 2-4
     units (1.2%), multi-family structures with 5 or more units (0.7%) and mobile homes
     (1.2%). Rental units were distributed differently among the housing types. The most
     common type of rental unit was multi-family structures with 5 or more units (57%),
     followed by single-family units (33%). Multi-family structures with 2-4 units made up 10
     percent of the total while mobile homes and other types of units combined were less
     than 1 percent. Table 4-12 identifies occupied housing units by tenure in 2010.

4.6.4 - Vacancy Rates
       Vacancy rates indicate how well the types of housing units that exist in the City meet
       the current market demand for housing. A low vacancy rate suggests that
       households may have difficulty finding a unit within their price range due to a limited
       supply of available housing. Low vacancy rates may also be related to
       overcrowding, as discussed in later sections. In contrast, a high vacancy rate may
       indicate either the existence of a high number of units undesirable for occupancy, or
       an oversupply of housing units. In West Covina vacancies can more likely be
       explained by the former over the latter as the City has not added a significant
       number of units in recent years while the population has continued to gradually
       increase.
       According to SCAG a vacancy rate between two percent and three percent for
       ownership housing and five percent to six percent for rental housing is considered a
       “healthy” vacancy rate. These rate limits ensure the continued upkeep of rental
       properties while keeping housing costs down. As shown previously in Table 4-10,
       there were approximately 1,268 housing units were vacant in 2010, an overall
       vacancy rate of 3.9 percent. By comparison, the Los Angeles County vacancy rate
       was 6.4 percent. The owner-occupied vacancy rate reported by the Census Bureau
       in 2010 was 0.9 percent, while the rental vacancy rate was 3.7 percent, indicating a
       tight housing market for the City.
       According to Zillow, in March of 2013, there were approximately 424 properties in the
       City of West Covina that were some phase of foreclosure. This is 1.3 percent of all
       households in the City and is a decrease from 858 properties in foreclosure in 2008.
       Of the total reported, 388 properties were in pre-foreclosure, 36 were bank owned
       properties. With the economy improving, and the housing market demand
       exceeding supply, foreclosures are expected to be less of a concern in the early
       part of the planning period.
City of West Covina                                                                      47

4.6.5 - Age of Housing Stock
     The age and condition of the City’s housing stock provides an additional measure of
     housing adequacy and availability in many communities. Although age does not
     always correlate with substandard housing conditions, neighborhoods with a large
     proportion of the housing stock over 40 years old are more likely than newer
     neighborhoods to have a concentration of housing problems related to deferred
     maintenance, inadequate landscaping care, outdated utilities or interior amenities,
     and a need for housing rehabilitation.
     The year a structure was built can be an indicator of the current condition of the
     housing unit. Well-constructed homes typically show signs of deterioration and
     require repair after 30 years if not adequately maintained. This timeframe can be
     shortened depending on the construction techniques used and region’s weather
     conditions. Table 4-13 indicates that almost 60 percent of the City’s housing stock
     was built before 1970 and an additional 25 percent was added from 1970 to 1980.

     In the last decade there has been a variety of new housing development in West
     Covina. Table 4-14 shows the number of finaled and approved building permits for
     new units for the 1998-2005 planning period and the previous 2008-2014 planning
     period. While the majority of housing units (863 units) built during the previous
     planning period were single-family units, there were also a significant number of
     multi-family units (708 units) constructed. Of the 708 multi-family units constructed
     roughly 516 units offered affordable rents to low and very-low income families. The
     development activity in the City is summarized in Table 4-14 and will be discussed

4.6.6 - Housing Condition
       Housing is considered to be substandard when physical conditions are below the
       minimum standards of living defined by Section 1001 of the Uniform Housing Code.
       Residents living in substandard conditions are considered to be in need of housing
       assistance even if they are not actively seeking alternative housing arrangements.
       In general housing units range in the types of features they offer and depending on
       the year they were built and the quality of construction they can lack basic
       amenities such as a complete kitchen, and/or plumbing facilities. According to the
       2010 Census of the 32,640 residences in West Covina it is estimated that only 259
       dwelling units, which is less than one percent of the housing stock, lack proper
       kitchen and plumbing facilities. Many of these substandard dwellings may not have
       complete facilities because they are considered guest houses. While the
       overwhelming majority of units in the City had adequate plumbing facilities, other
       basic maintenance such as roof repairs, new paint, and cleanliness should be
       encouraged to keep the housing stock viable.
       While a housing condition survey of the City has not been conducted in recent
       years, the majority of known substandard units and the units needing repair or
       replacement can be estimated by code enforcement activity and the number of
       housing units built before 1970. Since roughly 80 percent of the City’s housing stock is
       more than 40 years old it is likely that a larger number of homes are in need of
       rehabilitation, even if there are no recorded code violations or outward signs of
       deterioration. A general reconnaissance of older neighborhoods in the City suggests
       that between two and three percent of the City’s housing stock is in need of repair,
       while fewer than a dozen homes may be in need of replacement.

4.7 - Housing Costs
The following section discusses resale costs of existing housing in West Covina and the
surrounding area. The information provided was obtained from reliable real estate industry
data sources, including: the 2010 Census, the 2007-2011 American Community Survey,
DataQuick, Trulia.com, and data provided by the City.
Housing costs in West Covina can vary substantially by neighborhood. In general, western
and northern portions of the City that border Baldwin Park and Covina contain
neighborhoods with housing that is older and substantially lower in cost than neighborhoods
in eastern and southern portions of the community bordering the City of Walnut. The latter
parts of West Covina include hillside areas that have developed from former ranches and
large estates. Consequently larger, more expensive homes on larger lots are common. In
general, housing in eastern and southern West Covina is newer than in the western and
northern parts of the City. There are exceptions where redevelopment of residential areas
has occurred.
Table 4-15 lists the value of housing units in the City for the years 2000 and 2010. The 2000
Census documented a median housing unit value of $190,200 in West Covina, which was
close to the County median value of $209,800 in the same year. Table 4-15 also indicates
that from 2000 to 2010 the price of homes in West Covina skyrocketed. According to the
2007-2011 American Community Survey, the median home price jumped more than 200
percent from $190,200 to over $426,100 within a 10-year timeframe.

Table 4-15 indicates that in 2011, roughly 5 percent of the houses were valued at less than
$200,000; 8 percent were valued between $200,000 and $299,000, 56 percent were valued
between $300,000 and $499,000, while roughly 30 percent were priced at $500,000 and
above. This is a significant change from the 2000 Census, when the majority of the units in
the City were valued between $150,000 and $200,000. The cost of housing in West Covina

parallels the housing trends occurring throughout Southern California. Despite the drastic
increase in home values from 2000 to 2006, values declined significantly following the
economic downturn of 2008. It is only recently, in 2012 and 2013, that housing values have
once again started to increase as the economy recovers.
DataQuick Information Services publishes an online housing affordability index which
records the number and price of home sales on an annual basis. Table 4-16 reflects the
median home prices for West Covina and neighboring jurisdictions in February and
compares the median price to the same month in the previous year. For all of the
jurisdictions including Los Angeles County there has generally been an increase in home
prices between 10 and 20 percent. In comparison to the surrounding localities, the median
home price in West Covina is higher than majority of the neighboring cities and comparable
to Los Angeles County overall. Of the 48 single family homes sold in West Covina in February
2013, the median price increased 18 percent to $361,600.

As the economy recovers and housing demand continues to surpass supply, the cost of
housing in Southern California will remain high in comparison to the nation as a whole. This is
of great concern not only for low income families who often cannot afford a large down
payment, but is increasingly impacting middle class and workforce families (i.e. teachers,
firefighters etc.) that are struggling to afford a decent home.
4.7.1 - Rental Prices
         Similar to home price trends in West Covina the median contract rent increased from
         $771 in 2000 to $1,224 in 2011. Table 4-17 lists the rental ranges per the 2007-2011
         ACS and the number of units that rented for within that particular price range.
         Majority of the units in the City in 2011 were rented for more than $1000, indicating
         an overall increase in rents as compared to the 2000 Census when the majority of
         units rented for $750-$1,000 a month.

   To obtain a better understanding of the current rental market situation in West
   Covina a survey of rental unit rates for ten different apartment complexes located in
   different geographic areas of the City was completed. The apartment complexes
   included in the survey were easily accessible on the internet and offered a variety of
   different size units. Table 4-18 lists the lowest rent asked for units of varying size for
   each of the ten surveyed complexes. According to the 2007-2011 ACS, the median
   rent asked in West Covina was $1,224. The rental survey suggests that the median
   rent asked has increased significantly regardless of the unit size. In 2013 the median
   rent asked for a one bedroom apartment was $1,210 ranging between $1,065 and
   $1,519. For a two bedroom apartment $1,457 was the median and the prices ranged
   from $1,310 and $1,753. Finally for a three bedroom apartment $1,798 was the
   median asking price and the range of price extended from $1,570 to $2,075.

4.7.2 - Housing Affordability Gap Analysis
       Affordability is determined by comparing the cost of housing to the income of local
       households. HUD defines affordable housing costs as contract rents or mortgage
       payments, including taxes and insurance, but not utilities, that are equal to or less
       than 30 percent of the gross income of very low-, low-, and moderate-income
       households.
       Households spending more than 30 percent of gross annual income on housing
       experience a housing cost burden, which occurs when housing costs increase faster
       than household income. When a household spends more than 30 percent of its
       income on housing costs, it has less disposable income for other necessities such as
       health care. Lower income households with a burdensome housing cost are more
       likely to become homeless or experience overcrowding. Homeowners with a housing
       cost burden have the option of selling the homes and becoming renters. Renters,
       however, are vulnerable and subject to constant changes in the housing market.
       For purposes of determining housing affordability, the California Health and Safety
       Code Section 50052.5 provides the following definition of affordable housing cost
       based on the area median income (AMI), which is adjusted by family size and
       income level for each multi-family income (MFI) range. These definitions are shown in
       Table 4-19.

       Using these affordability thresholds, current housing affordability can be estimated
       for the various income groups as identified in Table 4-19 above based on the 2013
       Los Angeles County Median Family Income (MFI). The results of this analysis are
       shown in Table 4-20.
       Comparing housing costs to maximum affordable prices for low-income households
       reveals that low-income households are being priced out of the Los Angeles County
       rental and ownership markets. Given the median home prices presented in Table 4-
       16, single-family home ownership is also beyond the reach of many moderate-
       income households. Even condominiums are likely to be too expensive to be
       bought by moderate income households without incurring a cost burden.
       In the rental market, lower-income households generally cannot afford the market
       rents in West Covina unless they find a modestly priced studio apartment. While
       moderate-income households may be able to afford one-bedroom units in the City,
City of West Covina                                                                         53
                such units are too small for large households. Similarly moderate-income large
                families are unlikely to be able to afford even reasonably priced rental units.

4.8 - Community Housing Summary
4.8.1 - Ownership Analysis
       A comparison between the maximum affordable purchase prices in Table 4-20 and
       the actual 2012 housing values for the City prove that homeownership is unlikely for
       all four income groups. Table 4-15 shows that while homes were affordable in West
       Covina and the surrounding jurisdictions in the year 2000 the significant increase in
       home prices over the last decade has created an affordability gap preventing
       home ownership.
       In February 2013, the median price for a two bedroom house was around $360,000,
       which is not affordable to any of the income categories based on the Los Angeles
       County median. While in West Covina there has been limited new construction of
       units, majority of the units that were constructed are affordable primarily to above
       moderate-income households. Similarly larger homes, of over 2,500 square feet or
       more, are typically only affordable to above moderate-income households, whether
       new or existing stock. When considering that affordability limits are based on a family
       of four, and that HCD and HUD have suggested that more than one person per
       room creates overcrowding, this reduces the inventory of resale stock suitable for a
       larger family to two and three bedroom units. This suggests that there is a need to
       augment the existing housing stock to accommodate households with incomes
       below the County median. There is also potential to offer homeownership
       opportunities (through down payment assistance, tax credits, etc.) for households
       with incomes below the County median in order to maximize the wealth of existing
       older units in the City available at affordable prices.
4.8.2 - Rental Analysis
       In West Covina, it appears as though the market is not able to satisfy the
       comprehensive rental housing needs for the majority of lower income households.
       According to the 2007-2011 ACS, the average rental unit in the City was priced at
       $1,224 per month. Rental housing in the City can generally be considered affordable
       for most moderate income families annually earning 110% of the Los Angeles County
       median income limit ($61,620) and above. The remaining three income groups,
       including extremely low, very low and low income, are unable to afford even a one
       bedroom market rate unit. Returning to Table 4-8, which summarizes the number
       households earning within each income bracket, it is apparent that roughly 70
       percent of the City’s households are unable to afford the median rent asked.
       All of the one bedroom units that were found to be available in the rental survey
       were priced at $1,000 or more. HUD and HCD have established that a one bedroom
       unit is not acceptable for a four-person family. To avoid overcrowded conditions
       (more than one person per room), a family of four must find housing with three rooms
       or more, making the West Covina rental market particularly challenging for lower
       income families. Similarly, the majority of two bedroom units in apartment complexes
       were priced starting at approximately $1,200 per month. While many of the two
       bedroom units were priced closer to $1,350, some units reached as high as $1,475 a
       month. In addition, of the complexes with three bedroom units, most offered rents
       that exceeded even a large family moderate-income household’s ability to pay.
City of West Covina                                                                     55

   With few exceptions, single-family rentals and two bedroom units were all outside of
   the financial capacity of a lower income household. Extremely low, very low- and
   low-income households have few rental options available to them apart from
   boarding or sharing rental expenses with roommates, which may result in
   overcrowded conditions. These options are also not reasonable for families with
   children.
   The recent housing price increases in Southern California appear to have
   significantly affected the Los Angeles area resulting in a lack of available affordable
   units to meet the needs of the lower income families. While it is possible that there
   are properties in the City offering lower rents, the survey covered properties that
   were easily found on the internet and well-advertised. It is unlikely that a significant
   number of other affordable units are available to meet the needs of the City’s lower
   income population.

5.  Housing Needs
                                                                              Section 5
  5.1 - Introduction
  The Housing Needs section provides an analysis of current housing conditions in the City,
  focusing on the demographics outlined in the previous section and housing concerns
  related to the various population groups of West Covina. Several factors are projected to
  influence the degree of demand, or "need," for new housing in the City in coming years. In
  this element the housing needs of four groups are taken into consideration. These groups
  include:
          New population growth, both in the City and the surrounding region;
          Residents living in overcrowded units;
          Households paying more than they can afford for housing; and
          Special needs groups, including the elderly, large families, female-headed
           households, households with a disabled person, farm workers, and the homeless.
  An analysis of demographic and market conditions in the City indicates that the number of
  households at the high and low ends of the income spectrum will continue to grow, while
  the traditional middle income segments’ participation in the housing market will continue to
  decline. Consequently, analysis of specific housing needs and the necessary assistance for
  first-time homebuyers will become critical to assist low and moderate-income population in
  achieving home ownership. Lower income groups will require the most assistance in order to
  meet the increasing cost burden associated with owning a home. While many new homes
  are for the most part above the financial attainment of lower income households, there are
  limited homeownership opportunities for low and moderate-income households with the
  City’s existing stock of older resale homes. In regards to rental households, there appears to
  be a need for additional rental resources of all sizes at rates affordable to lower income
  households.

5.2 - Summary of Special Needs Groups
Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy data, developed by the Census for HUD
provides detailed information on housing needs (e.g. housing cost burden) by income level
for different types of households in West Covina. Table 5-1 below summarizes the CHAS
data on housing assistance needs of lower income households (less than 80% of MFI) for
special needs groups in West Covina by household tenure, household type (elderly,
small/large families), and “housing problems.” The count of households with “housing
problems” includes those who: 1) occupy units with physical defects (lacking complete
kitchen or bathroom); 2) live in overcrowded conditions (housing units with more than one
person per room); 3) have a housing cost burden exceeding 30% of gross income; or 4)
have a severe housing cost burden exceeding 50% of gross income.

Table 5-1 indicates that in general, renters experience more housing problems than
homeowners. Renters were more likely to have a physically incomplete residence, live in
overcrowded conditions and experience a cost burden of up to 50 percent. The highest
percentage of lower income households experiencing housing problems were large family
renter and owner households. Approximately 90 percent of renter and owner households
experienced some type of housing problem. These percentages demonstrate that large
family households are at the greatest need for housing programs assistance.

5.3 - Existing Need
State housing policy recognizes that cooperative participation between the private and
public sectors is necessary to expand housing opportunities to all economic segments of the
community. A primary State goal is the provision of decent housing and suitable living
environment for Californians of all economic levels. Historically, the private sector has
responded to the majority of the community's housing needs through the production of
market-rate housing. However, the percentage of the population on a statewide basis who
can afford market rate housing is declining. Special needs groups are consequently
experiencing additional housing challenges associated with their unique characteristics.
The following subsections analyze the households in West Covina which experience some
type of problem in their housing situation: overcrowding; overpayment; and special needs
groups including the elderly, large-families, female headed households, the disabled, the
homeless and farm workers.
5.3.1 - Overcrowding
        In response to higher home prices, lower income households must often be satisfied
        with smaller, less adequate housing. This can result in overcrowding, which places a
        strain on physical facilities, does not provide a satisfying living environment, and can
        have an effect on local neighborhoods. The US Census defines overcrowding as 1.01
        or more persons per room, and extreme overcrowding as more than 1.5 persons per
        room. Overcrowding typically results when:
       A family or household is living in too small a dwelling;
       Familial household includes extended family members; and/or
       A family is renting living space to non-family members.
        Overcrowding is often symptomatic of greater affordability issues. Some scenarios of
        how a lack of affordability promotes overcrowded conditions include:
       Large households unable to afford larger dwellings that must then move into smaller
        than acceptable units;
       Older children wishing to leave home who are prohibited from doing so because
        they cannot qualify for a home loan and/or are unable to make rental payments; or
       Grandparents or elders on fixed incomes who are unable to afford housing suitable
        for their physical handicaps, and must often move in with their grown children or
        other family members.

   Table 5.2 summarizes the status of overcrowding in West Covina. Six percent of the
   City’s total occupied housing units were considered to be overcrowded to some
   degree. This is compared to 26 percent of Los Angeles County’s occupied housing
   units. In 2011, there were 952 (5%) owner-occupied and 1,134 (11%) renter-occupied
   units defined as overcrowded in the City. Similarly, the 2007-2011 ACS estimates
   indicate that there were 323 units (3%) of renter-occupied and 204 units (1%) of
   owner-occupied units that could be considered severely overcrowded.                    In
   comparison to Los Angeles County the rate of overcrowding in the City was
   significantly lower.        Despite assumptions that the number of overcrowded
   households in the City may rise in coming years in response to regional housing
   market pressures, the City has experienced a decrease in the percentage of
   overcrowded households since the 2000 Census.
   According to SCAG, low and moderate-income households experience the most
   overcrowding. The overall distribution differs when analyzed by tenure, however.
   Very low-income (less than 50% of median income) rental households experience
   the most overcrowding. In terms of owner households, low and moderate-income
   households experience the most overcrowding. It appears as if overcrowding is a
   more significant issue among lower and moderate-income owner occupied
   households. In both cases, the cost for rent or purchase of a unit which provides
   adequate bedrooms to meet the needs of the household may exceed the
   householder’s ability to pay.

5.3.2 - Overpayment
        State and Federal standards specify that households spending more than 30 percent
        of gross annual income on housing are experiencing a cost burden. Housing cost
        burdens occur when housing costs increase faster than household income. When a
        household spends more than 30 percent of its income on housing costs, it has less
        disposable income for other necessities.
        Consistent with HUD’s “threshold of overpayment” definition, California’s housing
        administration has determined that, “affordable housing costs with respect to very
        low, low and moderate-income households shall not exceed 30 percent of gross
        household income." (Health and Safety Code, Section 50052.9). That is, when
        households must contribute 30% of their incomes for rent or mortgage payments,
        they are left with insufficient funds for other necessities, such as food, health care,
        clothing, and utilities.
        Exceeding 30 percent of income for rent or mortgage may cause a series of related
        financial problems, and can result in a deterioration of housing stock. Funds that
        would be allocated for maintenance are instead sacrificed for more immediate
        expenses (e.g. food, clothing, medical care, and utilities). Overpayment also
        promotes overcrowding, which leads to a variety of problems, from accelerating the
        rate of deterioration, to children’s decreased performance in school, to code
        enforcement issues. HUD recognizes, however, that upper-income households are
        generally more able to secure housing within their budgets, and are more capable
        of paying a larger proportion of their income for housing. Therefore, housing
        overpayment estimates usually focus on lower income groups.
        Table 5-3 summarizes the percentage of income rental households in West Covina
        are contributing to rent on a monthly basis. The data indicates that a large
        percentage of households (52 percent) that rent in the City are paying up to 30
        percent of their income on housing. While this is within the HUD definition of
        affordability it is also important to note that combined 47 percent of the households
        in the City are paying over 30% of their income for housing.

   Table 5-4 lists the percentage of renters and homeowners spending more than 30
   percent of their monthly gross income on housing, as reported by the 2007-2011 ACS.
   As an example, in 2011, there were a total of 2,015 owner-occupied households that
   had gross incomes between $20,000 and $34,999 and approximately 53 percent
   spent more than 30 percent or more of their gross income on housing. In comparison
   there were a total of 1,928 renter-occupied households with gross incomes between
   $20,000 and $34,999 and approximately 99.5 percent experienced housing costs that
   were 30 percent or more of their total gross income.

        The income group with the highest percentage of overpayment was renters with
        incomes between $20,000 and $35,000 a year (99 percent), followed by households
        earning between $35,000 and $49,999 (87.5 percent). High proportions of owners
        reporting overpayment occurred in the $50,000 to $74,999 range (61 percent)
        followed by households in the $35,000 to $49,999 range (53 percent).
        In looking at Table 5-4 it is important to make the distinction between renter and
        owner housing overpayment. While homeowners may choose to allocate a higher
        percentage of their disposable monthly income on housing costs, this allocation is
        justified in light of investment qualities of ownership. New or young owner households
        may overextend themselves financially to afford a home purchase, however the
        owner maintains the option of selling the home and may realize tax benefits and/or
        appreciation in value. Overpayment among the moderate and above moderate-
        income categories is of lesser concern than the lower income categories. Renters,
        on the other hand, are limited to the rental market, and are generally required to
        pay the rent established by that market. The discrepancy between renter and owner
        households is largely reflective of the tendency for year-round renter households to
        have lower incomes than their owner counterparts.
        Table 5-4 demonstrates that renter households earning less than $20,000 correspond
        to the very low-income category, and are the most impacted group in terms of
        overpayment. This lower income group accounted for nearly 45 percent of all
        households overpaying for housing. Although median incomes have risen, the cost
        of rentals in West Covina as shown in the table, reflect the continued need for
        affordable rental housing in the City, particularly for very low-income households.
5.4 - Special Needs Groups
State Housing Law requires that the special needs of certain disadvantaged groups be
addressed within the Housing Element. These households typically experience difficulty in
securing decent, affordable housing, and are not maintained under market conditions. The
needs of the elderly, handicapped, large families, female heads of household, the
homeless and farm workers are addressed below.
5.4.1 - Elderly
        The special housing needs of the elderly are an important concern in West Covina,
        particularly as the number of elderly in the City increases. The elderly population is a
        crucial focus group as many retired persons are likely to be on fixed low incomes, at
        greater risk of impaction, and/or housing overpayment. The special housing needs of
        the elderly also extend to the construction and location of units. The elderly often
        require ramps, handrails, lower cupboards and counters to allow greater access and
        function. Similarly the elderly often find it more difficult to access public facilities (i.e.,
        medical and shopping) due to limited mobility. Finding reliable means of
        transportation to medical appointments, senior centers, meal sites and shopping also
        remains a serious problem for many seniors. This can be alleviated by locating units
        close to the amenities commonly used by the elderly.
City of West Covina                                                                          63
   According to the 2007-2011 ACS, there were roughly 13,000 residents over the age of
   65 residing in West Covina. This amounts to approximately 12 percent of the City’s
   total population. Of the population over the age of 65, the total includes
   approximately 4,831 homeowner and 1,859 renter households. Therefore, of the
   individuals 65 and over, the majority own their homes (72 percent), while
   approximately one-fourth rent their homes. The percentage of seniors in West
   Covina who own their homes has increased since 1990 which may be due to the
   increase in overall population of individuals aged 65 and up. As the number of
   elderly individuals living in the City continues to increase there is a need for
   rehabilitation programs for aging units, as well as the creation of affordable senior
   housing units.
   In 2011, there were approximately 1,020 elderly persons below the poverty level. The
   incidence of poverty was lower among the population over 65 years of age (9
   percent) than it was for the population between the ages of 18 and 64 (9%). In most
   communities, older adults tend to have a lower poverty rate in comparison to young
   families with children, especially single mothers, who usually have the highest poverty
   rate.
   For elderly residents with a mobility self-care limitation, it can become challenging for
   the City to adequately meet their specific housing needs. While no recent data is
   available through the ACS, the 2000 Census estimates that there were a total of
   1,474 elderly residents in West Covina with either a mobility or self-care limitation. Of
   the total 11,237 senior residents approximately 12 percent had a mobility limitation
   while 15 percent experienced a self-care limitation. It was slightly more common for
   females to have one form of limitation; however this may be related to the higher
   proportion of women in the total senior population. To meet the needs of “limited”
   elderly residents care facilities that combine meal, medical and daily living
   assistance in a residential environment may be necessary. As shown in Table 5-5,
   there are 35 State Department of Social Services licensed elderly care facilities in the
   City that provide housing options for the elderly.

5.4.2 - Large Families
        In the year 2000, the Census reported 7,031 households in the City of West Covina
        that were occupied by five or more persons. According to the 2007-2011ACS this
        number decreased by 15 percent to 5,982 households over the following decade.
        Of the total number of large households, approximately 98 percent were families
        while non-family households made up the remaining 2 percent. Large family
        households require special consideration, because they generally require larger
        dwellings with sufficient bedrooms to meet their housing needs without
        overcrowding.
        Difficulties in securing housing large enough to accommodate all members of a
        household is more challenging for renters, because multi-family rental units are
        typically smaller than single-family ownership units. While apartment complexes in
        the City offering three bedrooms are common, apartments with four or more
        bedroom units are rare. It is more likely that a large family will experience
        overcrowding in comparison to smaller families. Additionally, as shown previously in
        the Housing Costs and Rents Section, the larger single-family rental and ownership
        stock generally is not affordable to the majority of lower income households.
        Table 5-6 reflects the number of persons in large families per housing unit by tenure.
        The table indicates that there are more owner-occupied units (64%) than renter
        occupied units (36%) housing large families. Owner-occupied units account for
        about 19 percent of all owner-occupied housing in the City while large households
        occupying rental units make up roughly 20 percent of the total households. Over half
        of the households that are considered large are made up of five people, while
        households with six and seven or greater households make up a smaller percentage,
        with 21 percent and 22 percent respectively.

5.4.3 - Female-Headed Households
        The third special needs group requiring attention is female-headed households.
        These households are considered a special needs group, because women leading
        families have proportionally lower rates of homeownership, lower incomes and
        higher poverty rates than other family compositions. Table 5-7 indicates
        characteristics of the female-headed households in the City of West Covina.
        According to the Census, in the year 2010 there were 641 female-headed

     households with children that were below the federally established poverty level.
     There were an additional 84 female-headed households without children. In total
     there are 725 female-headed households in the City, which make up roughly 2.9
     percent of the City’s total number of households.

5.4.4 - Disabled Persons
     Access and affordability are the two major housing needs of disabled persons. The
     disabled, like the elderly, have special needs with regard to location. There is
     typically a need and desire to be located near public services, specifically
     transportation facilities that provide service to those who rely on them.
     Physically disabled persons often require specially designed dwelling units to permit
     movement within the unit, as well as access to and from the site. California
     Administrative Code Title 24 sets forth access and adaptability requirements for the
     physically disabled. These regulations apply to public buildings including: motels,
     employee housing, factory built housing and privately funded newly constructed
     apartment houses containing five or more dwelling units. The regulations also require
     that ramp-ways, larger door widths, restroom modifications, etc., be designed which
     enable free access to the handicapped. Such standards, however, are not
     mandatory of new single-family residential construction.
     The 2010 Census defines six types of disability, including individuals with: a hearing
     difficulty, vision difficulty, cognitive difficulty, ambulatory difficulty, self-care difficulty,
     and an independent living difficulty. Difficulties are defined as mental, physical or
     health conditions that last over six months. Table 5-8 reflects the percentage of
     persons in the City by disability type and age.

        Source: 2007-2011 American Community Survey.
        Table 5-8 shows that approximately 10 percent of all residents in West Covina and 13
        percent of persons 18 years and older in the City of West Covina experienced some
        form of disability. Generally, as expected the number of residents experiencing a
        disability increased with age. Out of the total disabled persons, roughly 30 percent of
        people aged 65 and older and 4 percent of people aged 18-64 years old had a
        difficulty that hindered their mobility. This figure suggests that a number of these
        residents rely on public transportation to travel. In West Covina, approximately 3
        percent of residents experience a self-care difficulty. A difficulty that is classified as a
        self-care limitation does not necessarily translate into a need for specially
        constructed housing units, which it makes it difficult to estimate an exact number of
        disabled persons in need of housing.
        Both the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and the
        Housing Act impose an affirmative duty on local governments to make reasonable
        accommodations (e.g., modifications or exceptions) in their zoning and other land
        use regulations when such accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled
        persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. For example, it may be
        necessary to grant a deviation in the required setbacks to allow for a ramp to
        accommodate residents with mobility impairments. The City of West Covina allows
        homeowners to build ramps into single-family dwellings to allow first floor access for
        physically disabled residents. Such ramps or guardrails are permitted to encroach
        into the required setbacks under zoning, and are subject only to a building permit.
        This allows flexibility and relief from obtaining a variance. The City also recently
        adopted Ordinance 2235 on August 21, 2012, amending the Zoning Code to
        establish a formal procedure to consider applications for reasonable
        accommodation.

5.4.5 - Developmentally Disabled
     According to Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code a "Developmental
     disability" means a disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years,
     continues, or can be expected to continue, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial
     disability for that individual which includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy,
     epilepsy, and autism. This term shall also include disabling conditions found to be
     closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required
     for individuals with mental retardation, but shall not include other handicapping
     conditions that are solely physical in nature.
     Many developmentally disabled persons can live and work independently within a
     conventional housing environment. More severely disabled individuals require a
     group living environment where supervision is provided. The most severely affected
     individuals may require an institutional environment where medical attention and
     physical therapy are provided. Because developmental disabilities exist before
     adulthood, the first issue in supportive housing for the developmentally disabled is
     the transition from the person’s living situation as a child to an appropriate level of
     independence as an adult.
     The State Department of Developmental Services (DDS) currently provides
     community based services to approximately 243,000 persons with developmental
     disabilities and their families through a statewide system of 21 regional centers, four
     developmental centers, and two community-based facilities. The San
     Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center is one of 21 regional centers in the State of
     California that provides point of entry to services for people with developmental
     disabilities. The center is a private, non-profit community agency that contracts with
     local businesses to offer a wide range of services to individuals with developmental
     disabilities and their families.
     The following information from the San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center provides a
     closer look at the developmentally disabled population. As shown in Table 5-9, there
     are approximately 733 individuals (2.4 percent of the total population) diagnosed
     with a cognitive or developmental disability in the City of West Covina.

        There are numerous housing types that are appropriate for people living with a
        developmental disability: rent subsidized homes, licensed and unlicensed single-
        family homes, inclusionary housing, Section 8 vouchers, special programs for home
        purchase, HUD housing, and SB 962 homes. The design of housing-accessibility
        modifications, the proximity to services and transit, and the availability of group living
        opportunities represent some of the types of considerations that are important in
        serving this need group. Incorporating ‘barrier-free’ design in all, new multi-family
        housing (as required by California and Federal Fair Housing laws) is especially
        important to provide the widest range of choices for disabled residents. Special
        consideration should also be given to the affordability of housing, as people with
        disabilities may be living on a fixed income.
        In order to assist in the housing needs for persons with Developmental Disabilities, the
        City has established Program 2.3 – Alternative Housing Models to ensure that the
        housing needs of developmentally disabled residents are accommodated. The City
        will continue to conduct outreach with the San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center
        and, encourage housing providers to designate a portion of new affordable housing
        developments for persons with disabilities, especially persons with developmental
        disabilities, and pursue funding sources designated for persons with special needs
        and disabilities.
5.4.6 - Extremely Low Income Households
        According to 2005-2009 CHAS data generated for the City, there were
        approximately 3,825 very low-income households living in West Covina. Very low-
        income households are those households that earn 50 percent or less of the median
        family income (MFI) for the statistical region in which they are located. Extremely
        low-income (ELI) households are those households which earn less than 30 percent of
        the MFI. There are approximately 3,200 extremely low income households in West
        Covina including both renters and owners. Table 5-10, includes data characterizing
        affordability and other housing problems in West Covina for very low and extremely
        low income households.

     As shown in Table 5-10 the majority (70 percent) of extremely low income households
     in the City are renters. Given that extremely low income households are often living
     pay check to pay check, it can be difficult to produce a down payment to
     purchase a unit, which explains the difference in tenure. In general, Table 5-10
     presents data indicating that nearly 86 percent of all ELI households experience
     some type of housing problem, 85 percent pay more than 30 percent of their annual
     income on housing costs and 74 percent pay more than 50 percent of their annual
     income toward housing. This is in comparison to 80 percent of very low income
     households with a housing problem, 78 percent paying more than 30 percent of their
     annual income on housing costs and 46 percent pay more than 50 percent of their
     annual income toward housing.
     There are limited opportunities to address the housing needs of extremely low-
     income households in West Covina. However, the needs of this special needs group
     are taken into consideration and are generally addressed through the City’s overall
     programs for housing affordability. The City also provides a number of deed-
     restricted units that offer housing opportunities for ELI households.
5.4.7 - Homeless Population
     Homelessness continues to be a regional as well as a national issue. The Regional
     Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) produced by SCAG defines homelessness as:
        Persons who are living or staying in emergency shelters;
        Persons who sleep outside, in makeshift shelter, in cars or transportation areas
            such as bus or train terminals;
        Persons who are considered “at risk” (i.e., doubled-up, in marginal
         circumstances, motel population with limited stay or general relief recipients
         whose payments have been canceled due to “no forwarding address”).
     Enumerating the total number of homeless is difficult due to the transient nature of
     the population, as well as, the existence of the hidden homeless. The term, hidden
     homeless, refers to individuals that are not necessarily on the street and are often not
     counted in homeless surveys. These individuals typically reside in temporary housing
     situations (e.g. doubling up with another household or in motels).
     To better address and serve the homeless population, the Los Angeles Homeless
     Services Authority (LAHSA) was established in 1993 as an independent agency by
     the County and the City of Los Angeles. LAHSA is the lead agency in the Los Angeles
     Continuum of Care, and coordinates and manages over $70 million dollars annually
     in Federal, State, County and City funds for programs providing shelter, housing and
     services to homeless persons in Los Angeles City and County. The Los Angeles
     Continuum of Care (CoC) includes all of Los Angeles County except the cities of
     Glendale, Long Beach, and Pasadena.
     Every other year, LAHSA, conducts a point in time survey to count the number of
     homeless individuals, sheltered or unsheltered, living throughout the County.
72                                                                 2014-2021 Housing Element

        According to the 2011 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count, it is estimated that
        there are 45,422 homeless persons in Los Angeles Continuum of Care and
        approximately 51,340 homeless individuals living in the County at a given point in
        time. Of the 45,422 reported in the CoC approximately 79 percent were unsheltered
        and 21 percent were living in either emergency shelter or transitional housing
        programs at the time of the survey. Within the San Gabriel Valley sub-area, which
        includes the cities of West Covina, and numerous San Gabriel Valley cities like
        Claremont, Monrovia, San Marino, Industry, and surrounding unincorporated areas, it
        is estimated that there are 4,727 homeless counted during the Point in Time Survey,
        including 3,868 single adults and 943 family members.
        As part of the Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count Report authored by LAHSA, cities
        can participate in the Opt-In Program. The Opt-In Program provides local jurisdictions
        with homeless count numbers specific to their area or city allowing them to obtain
        local homeless count information to more effectively address local homelessness
        and to report progress to federal, state, and county agencies to meet funding
        requirements. Prior to the 2009 homeless count, the methodology did not support this
        need. Beginning in 2009, the study methodology was enhanced to enable opt-in
        cities/communities to coordinate a homeless count within their borders using locally
        recruited volunteers from public and private agencies. In total, 35 areas consisting of
        28 cities and seven communities enumerated all of their census tracts – including the
        City of West Covina. Using the results from the LAHSA shelter and youth counts, cities
        are able to estimate a point-in-time number of the homeless families and individuals
        who are sheltered and unsheltered in their jurisdictions. The most recent data
        available for the City of West Covina is from 2011 and indicates that there are
        approximately 63 individuals living in on the street.
        There are numerous factors that contribute to homelessness in West Covina and Los
        Angeles County. Difficulties in obtaining employment, insufficient education, mental
        illness, and substance abuse are a few of the more traditional factors. During the
        past 15-20 years, new factors, however, are emerging that significantly contribute to
        homelessness.
        The trends that are largely responsible for the rise in homelessness include: a growing
        shortage of affordable housing, and a simultaneous growth in the population of low-
        income renters, which has correlated with high demand and shrinking supply. Both of
        these factors could potentially exacerbate any of the traditional conditions, but may
        increasingly become stand-alone causes of homelessness. The large numbers of
        homeless persons, the rising cost of housing, and the number of persons living in
        poverty combine to create a serious potential for homelessness.
        Emergency and transitional shelters can help to address the needs of the homeless.
        Emergency shelters provide a short-term solution to homelessness and involve limited
        supplemental services. In contrast, transitional shelters are directed toward removing
        the basis for homelessness. Shelter is provided for an extended period and is
        combined with other social services and counseling to assist in the transition to self-
        sufficiency.
        Services and facilities available for the homeless in West Covina are coordinated
        primarily through the Los Angeles County as a continuum of care. The continuum of
City of West Covina                                                                     73

      care begins with assessment of the needs of the homeless individual or family. The
      person/family may then be referred to permanent housing or to transitional housing
      where supportive services are provided to prepare them for independent living. The
      goal of a comprehensive homeless service system is to ensure that homeless
      individuals and families move from homelessness to self-sufficiency, permanent
      housing, and independent living. The following is a list of agencies offering public
      assistance in and around West Covina:
   1. Citrus Valley Health Foundation provides a drop-in center where homeless persons
      can access a wide variety of services. The Foundation also serves the terminally ill
      and those in need of short-term acute care. They are able to serve 10 short-term
      acute care clients at their facility for stays averaging around two weeks and serve
      the terminally ill in their homes. They do not track the number of patients they serve
      from specific cities.
   2. The Institute for Urban Research and Development provides emergency shelter,
      breakfast and dinner, access to showers and toilets, limited case management
      services, and referrals to more comprehensive services to homeless families. IURD is
      housing participants at the Valley Inn in La Puente and the American Inn & Suites in
      Pomona.
   3. Catholic Charities Brother Miguel Center in Pomona provides vouchers/assistance
      referrals for those seeking shelter. They also provide utility disconnection and eviction
      prevention services, along with other counseling, training, and emergency/food
      assistance. Catholic Charities serves low-income families and individuals, but does
      not track the number of residents from specific cities that utilize their services.
   4. YMCA-Wings Shelter for Battered Women located in West Covina provides shelter,
      counseling, and other needs of battered women and their children. They offer 32
      beds, 25 of which are usually occupied. The average stay at this facility is 40 days
      although the YMCA plans to expand the maximum length of stay when funds
      become available. They do not offer rental assistance vouchers, nor do they track
      what cities their clients are from.
   5. The House of Ruth in Claremont provides services to women and their dependent
      children. In 2000, 49 hotline cases and 81 outreach service cases were from West
      Covina. House of Ruth is equipped with 20 beds and is generally 95 to 98 percent
      occupied. The maximum stay at their facility is 30 days; however, typical stays are 15
      to 16 days. Although they do not give rental assistance vouchers, they operate
      three transitional housing units.
   6. Community Food Bank of West Covina provides assistance and emergency help for
      West Covina residents in need of food. On a weekly basis the Food Bank serves 15
      people a day from West Covina and the surrounding areas. On average the Food
      Bank serves roughly 80 residents of West Covina.
   7. The Salvation Army offers temporary shelter and food vouchers and referrals for
      West Covina and San Gabriel residents. Adult rehabilitation centers are among the
      most widely known of all Salvation Army services and comprise the largest resident
      rehabilitation program in the United States. Individuals with identifiable and treatable
74                                                                   2014-2021 Housing Element
        needs are able to check-in to facilities that assist them in becoming healthy. At the
        center they receive adequate housing, nourishing meals and necessary medical
        care, and they engage in work therapy. They also benefit from group therapy,
        spiritual guidance and skilled addictions counseling in clean and wholesome
        surroundings.
    8. Inland Valley Council of Churches serves homeless families through their 19-bed
        shelter and seven unit transitional housing programs. Those in need of shelter are
        able to stay a maximum of 30 days while those using the transitional housing are
        able to stay between 12 and 24 months. They do not give rental assistance
        vouchers and do not track where their clients originate in the area.
    9. The Santa Anita Family Services Senior Center serves seniors age 60 and older.
        They assist low-income elderly with temporary personal care, in-home care during
        illness, respite for family caregivers, employment assistance, housekeeping, and
        assistance in filling out forms or with other legal matters. They also offer minor home
        renovation for low-income seniors with physical limitations.
    10. The East San Gabriel Valley Coalition for the Homeless is a nonprofit organization,
        helping the homeless find shelter. They offer referral services for medical
        appointment, hotel and motel and taxi vouchers, emergency food, sack lunches,
        showers and hygiene kits. They also offer referral assistance for paying rent and
        utilities. On a monthly basis the Coalition generally serves 60 people a day. The
        Coalition also offers a Cold Weather Shelter that runs from mid-November until the
        end of March; during this time period they serve almost 100 people a night. During
        the Christmas season they serve about 300 people.
        In 2007 the California State Senate passed Senate Bill 2 (SB2), which requires
        jurisdictions to addresses homelessness in greater detail within mandated Housing
        Elements. This bill requires cities and counties to identify specific sites with by-right
        zoning to accommodate the community’s need for homeless shelters. It also
        necessitates that cities and counties identify zones where special needs facilities and
        transitional housing are permitted either by right or with a conditional use permit.
        Finally, SB2 prohibits a city or county from disapproving applications for shelters and
        special needs facilities unless specified findings are made. This bill will be addressed
        in further detail within the Housing Element.
        During the 2008-2014 planning period, the West Covina Zoning Code was amended
        to permit emergency housing. Ordinance 2239 approved by the City Council on
        August 28, 2012 to permit single resident occupancy (SRO) units by right without a
        conditional use permit or other discretionary action in the High Density Multi-Family
        (MF-45) zone. As part of Ordinance 2239, the City also amended the Zoning Code so
        that the Light Manufacturing (M-1) zone permits emergency shelters, by right without
        a Conditional Use Permit or other discretionary action. This zone is appropriate to
        accommodate emergency shelters as M-1 areas are typically located along major
        arterial roadways with access to employment centers and near stores and other
        services. There are currently 45 parcels totaling 60.75 acres of land zoned for M-1 in
        the City. Of these sites approximately 11 parcels between 0.5 and 5 acres in size that
        are underutilized and appropriate and able to accommodate a shelter of
        approximately 20 beds if one is proposed. To better accommodate emergency
City of West Covina                                                                      75

        shelters in the City, specific siting standards and conditions for approval will be
        developed in accordance with State Law.
5.4.8 - Farm Workers
        Like many other cities in Southern California, West Covina’s economy was at one
        time linked to agriculture. Changes in the local economy to production and service-
        oriented sectors have virtually eliminated significant agricultural production within
        City limits. While the County of Los Angeles still has areas with agricultural activity,
        farmland in West Covina has been almost entirely converted as the City reaches
        build out. Consequently, many of the remaining agricultural uses are specialty
        nurseries or stables, which do not employ migrant farm workers.
        In 2011, the 2007-2011 ACS reported 272 persons in West Covina employed in
        agriculture, forestry or fishing industries (or related industries). In comparison to the
        2000 Census, which reported 62 individuals involved in agricultural industries, this
        number seems high as the City is largely built out and no new agriculture zones have
        been added to the City. It is likely that the identified individuals are primarily
        employed in plant nurseries, landscaping, or gardening companies. Of those
        residents employed in agriculture, the vast majority are year-round residents of the
        City. Consequently, the City does not foresee a need to provide farm worker
        housing pursuant to the State Employee Housing Act (Section 17000 of the Health
        and Safety Code).
5.5 - At-Risk Housing
State housing law requires an inventory and analysis of government-assisted dwellings units
eligible for conversion from lower income housing to market rate housing during the next
ten years from 2014 to 2024. These units are considered to be “at-risk” units. Reasons for this
conversion may include expiration of subsidies, mortgage pre-payments or pay-offs, and
concurrent expiration of affordability restrictions. Table 5-11 lists the properties at risk in West
Covina according to HUD and the California Housing Partnership Corporation.

Source: City of West Covina AB 987 Table, 2013.
         As shown in Table 5-11, the City of West Covina has nine properties providing almost
         700 units of deed-restricted affordable housing. Of the total 687 units, there are 248
         units for families, including larger units with 3 and 4 bedrooms. The remaining 439
         units are age restricted for residents that are 65 years old or older. The majority of the
         age-restricted units are 1 bedroom, with a few units consisting of two units. As shown
         in the table there are no units deemed at risk within the next 10 years, and there are
         several properties will 99-year covenants or no expiration at all.
         To monitor their existing deed restricted units, the City of West Covina has established
         Action 1.3 in the Housing Plan. When the time comes, the City understands that the
         preservation of the units as affordable may require financial incentives to attract
         project owners to extend low-income use restrictions. Other possible methods of
         preservation could involve acquisition of the affordable units by a non-profit or
         public agency, or local subsidies to offset the difference between affordable and
City of West Covina                                                                        77
     market rents. Preservation of at-risk projects can be achieved in a variety of ways,
     with adequate funding availability. These include:
        Contract extension
        Transfer of ownership to non-profit developers and housing organizations
        Local rental subsidies
        Purchase affordability covenants
     Alternatively, units that are converted to market rate may be replaced with new
     assisted multi-family units with specified affordability timeframes. The City will
     continue to work with property owners and to implement the objectives outlined in
     Action 1.3 to monitor and preserve in the future as many affordable units as possible.
5.5.1 - Contract Extension
     Upon filing of a Notice of Intent (NOI), HUD may offer several incentives to property
     owners to extend their contracts, including re-financing the property mortgage and
     establishing higher rents charged for the project. Pursuant to Section 65863.10 of the
     Government Code, the property owners of these units must also provide one year
     advanced notification to each tenant household if the property owner intends to
     terminate the Section 8 contract. The notice must indicate the anticipated date of
     conversion and anticipated rent increase. The property owner is also required to
     serve notice to the City of West Covina.
     For projects with contracts expiring, three renewal options are available. Options for
     renewal are assumed to be one of the following, although other options may apply
     depending on other project factors:
        Renew at comparable market levels, possibly adjusted upward by operating
         costs, which is the Mark Up to Market option;
        Renew at current rents with no adjustments;
        For any project with rents currently exceeding comparable market rents, as a
         fourth option the owner may request referral to the Office of Multi-family Housing
         Assistance Restructuring (OMHAR) for reduction of Section 8 contract rents with
         or without the restructuring of rents.
5.5.2 - Transfer of Ownership
     Transferring ownership of the affordable units to a non-profit housing organization is a
     viable way to preserve affordable housing for the long term and increases number
     of government resources available to the project. The feasibility of this option
     depends on the willingness of the owner to sell, funding sources to actually buy the
     property, and the existence of a non-profit organization with sufficient administrative
     capacity to manage the property. Additionally, projects in which all units are
     affordable, and not just a portion of units are affordable, can participate in
     ownership transfers more simply and are therefore more likely to be feasible.

5.5.3 - Local Rental Subsidy
        A third option for preservation of at-risk units assisted by either project based Section
        8 funds and/or bond financing is to offer a local rental subsidy to residents. These
        subsidies can be structured to mirror the Section 8 program, whereby the subsidy
        covers the cost of the unit above what is determined to be affordable for the
        tenant’s household income (including a utility allowance) up to the fair market value
        of the apartment. Rent subsidies using State and Local can be used to maintain the
        affordability of these at-risk units.
        The cost of providing subsidies for 330 at-risk units with potential to expire during the
        planning period to maintain subsidized rents assumes that none of the at-risk units are
        preserved. The cost of providing subsidies is based on a comparison between Fair
        Market Rents (FMR) and rents which are affordable to low-income families.
        Affordability is defined as rents that do not exceed 30% of a household’s monthly
        income.
        Under the project based Section 8 program, HUD pays owners the difference
        between what tenants can pay (defined as 30% of household income) and what
        HUD estimates to be Fair Market Rent (FMR) on the unit. The 2013 HUD median
        income for Los Angeles County is $61,600. The current FMRs for Los Angeles County,
        which includes the City of West Covina, are shown in Table 5-12.
                                       Table 5-12: Fair Market Rents
              Efficiency*          1 Bedroom      2 Bedroom        3 Bedroom         4 Bedroom
                  $911                $1,101         $1,421           $1,921            $2,140
        Source: HUD Revised FY 2013 Income Limits
         *Efficiency = Studio Apartment
        Fair Market Rents were created in an effort to control rental costs and ensure
        reasonableness in the Section 8 assisted housing program. For assistance programs
        (i.e. vouchers), higher FMRs mean higher costs per household served and, within a
        fixed budget, fewer households can be assisted. The taxpaying public would
        probably be unwilling to support an assisted housing program that put low-income
        families in housing units that were substantially better than typical rental units.
        Based on 2013 HUD income data for Los Angeles County, the maximum amount of
        rent that is considered to be affordable is $1,101 for a one bedroom unit, $1,421 for a
        two bedroom unit, $1,921 for a three bedroom unit and $2,140 for a four bedroom
        unit. This calculation assumes a one person household for a one bedroom unit, a
        three person household for a two bedroom unit, a four person household in a three
        bedroom unit and five or more persons in a four bedroom unit. If there were at-risk
        units in the City, Staff could identify the number of units converting and calculate the
        additional subsidies required to maintain affordability, based on a comparison
        between FMR and the affordable rents.
City of West Covina                                                                         79

5.5.4 - Incentives to Purchase Affordability Covenants
     A final opportunity for preserving the affordability of at-risk projects is to provide an
     incentive package to the owners to maintain the projects as low-income housing.
     Incentives could include writing down the interest rate on the remaining loan
     balance and/or supplementing the Section 8 subsidy received to market levels. The
     feasibility of this option depends on whether the complexes require rehabilitation or
     are too highly leveraged. By providing lump-sum financial incentives or on-going
     subsidies in rents or reduced mortgage interest rates to the owner, the City can
     ensure that some or all of the units remain affordable.
5.5.5 - Replacement Cost
     If the four strategies discussed above are unable to result in the preservation of the
     at-risk units as affordable units, the City may choose to construct new units to
     replenish its housing stock. The cost of developing new housing depends on a variety
     of factors including density, size of units, construction quality and type, location, and
     land cost.
     Recent construction cost estimates for the Los Angeles and Pasadena regions of
     $140 to $160 per square foot for multi-family units were used to approximate the cost
     of replacing at-risk units. An average of $150 per square foot is used for this analysis
     as land in West Covina remains slightly lower than Los Angeles metro area, but
     slightly higher than Southern California overall. Using average square footages of 600
     square feet for one bedroom units, 700 square feet for two bedroom units, 800
     square feet for three bedroom units, and 900 square feet for four bedroom units, the
     per unit replacement cost can be calculated.
5.5.6 - Preservation Resources
     A variety of Federal, state, and local programs are available to maintain rental and
     purchase affordability to preserve at-risk units. The following summarizes financial
     resources available to the City, private, and non-profit parties to preserve housing
     that is affordable.
Federal Programs
     Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) – This program is intended
     to enhance and preserve the City’s affordable housing stock. Funds are awarded to
     the City on a formula basis for housing activities. Eligible activities include acquisition,
     rehabilitation, economic development, and public services. CDBG grants benefit
     primarily households with incomes not exceeding 80 percent of the County median
     family income.
     HOME Investment Partnership – HOME funding is a flexible grant program which is
     awarded to West Covina on a formula basis for housing activities which takes into
     account local market conditions, inadequate housing, poverty, and housing
     production costs. HOME funding is provided to jurisdictions to either assist rental
     housing or home ownership through acquisition, construction, reconstruction and/or
80                                                                 2014-2021 Housing Element

        rehabilitation of affordable housing. Tenant-based rental assistance, property
        acquisition, site improvements, expenses related to the provision of affordable
        housing, and projects that serve a group identified as having special needs related
        to housing are also available.
        Section 8 Rental Assistance Program – This program provides rental assistance
        payments to owners of private market-rate units on behalf of extremely low- and
        very low-income tenants.
State Programs
        California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) – CHFA sells tax exempt bonds for
        below market rate loans to first-time homebuyers. Program operates through
        participating lenders who originate loans for CHFA purchase.
        Low Income Housing Tax Credits – Tax credits available to individuals and
        corporations that invest in low-income rental housing. Tax credits sold to people with
        high tax liability, and proceeds are used to create housing.
        Multi-Family Housing Program (MHP) – Deferred payment loans for new
        construction, rehabilitation and preservation of rental housing administered by HCD.
Local Resources
        Described below are agencies that can serve as resources in the implementation of
        housing activities in West Covina and Los Angeles County.
        Affordable Housing Developers – An alternative to providing subsidies to existing
        owners to keep units available as affordable housing is for public or nonprofit
        agencies to acquire or construct housing units that would replace at-risk units lost to
        conversion to market rates.
        National CORE – National Community Renaissance is the new name for the
        combined group of companies that includes National Community Renaissance of
        California (formerly Southern California Housing Development Corporation), National
        Community Renaissance Development Corporation (formerly National Housing
        Development Corporation), and the Hope through Housing Foundation. This
        combined agency develops, manages, and provides supportive services to 76
        affordable housing communities nationwide.
        The East Los Angeles Community Union (TELACU) – TELACU is a non-profit
        community development corporation founded in 1968. The non-profit is self-
        sustained by TELACU Industries, a for-profit family of companies which provides the
        economic means to fulfill TELACU's mission. TELACU builds, owns and manages
        affordable housing in cities throughout Southern California, including a senior
        housing project in West Covina.
        Thomas Safran & Associates – Thomas Safran & Associates owns and manages
        over 3,000 units of affordable rental housing in California. Active for over 35 years in
        the affordable housing development field, this organization specializes in developing
City of West Covina                                                                     81

           multi-family and senior housing projects, many of which have won awards from
           prestigious organizations. Thomas Safran & Associates have previously worked in
           West Covina and are a vital resource for the City.
5.6 - Regional Housing Needs Assessment
California’s Housing Element law requires that each city and county develop local housing
programs designed to meet its “fair share” of existing and future housing needs for all
income groups. The division of project housing need between jurisdictions within a greater
region is known as the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA). For the upcoming
planning period, the California Department of Housing and Community Development
determined that the projected housing need for the Southern California region (including
the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, and Imperial) is
412,137 new housing units. Once finalized by HCD, this allocation is further broken down and
reallocated by SCAG to the various cities and unincorporated county areas within the six
county region.
The number of housing units allocated to each jurisdiction through the RHNA is divided into
four income categories: very low, low, moderate, and above moderate. For the 2014-2021
planning period SCAG determined that the City of West Covina’s fair share allocation is 831
new housing units during this planning cycle, with the units distributed among the four
income categories as shown in Table 5-13. The City must demonstrate that its land inventory
is sufficient to facilitate and encourage the development of affordable housing that is
accessible to a variety of income groups.

6.  Housing Constraints
                                                                               Section 6
  Pursuant to State law, a Housing Element shall provide an analysis of existing and potential
  governmental and non-governmental constraints on the improvement, maintenance, and
  development of the housing stock. This analysis must include housing for all segments of
  the population including all income levels and persons with special needs (such as the
  homeless, disabled, and elderly). This analysis of housing constraints considers the following:
         Governmental Constraints refers to those regulations, ordinances, and/or controls
          that may impede the development of new housing or otherwise increase the cost of
          residential development;
         Market Constraints refers to those economic and market factors that may affect the
          cost of new housing development; and,
         Environmental Constraints refers to those aspects of the environment (vacant land,
          utilities, natural hazards, etc.) that may affect the cost and/or feasibility of
          development.
  6.1 - Governmental Constraints
  Local policies and regulations can affect the availability of housing and in particular, the
  provision of affordable housing. Land use controls, site improvement requirements, fees and
  exactions, permit processing procedures, and other factors can affect the maintenance,
  development, and improvement of housing. State, Federal and Regional regulations, which
  the City has no control over, also affect the availability of land for housing and the cost of
  producing housing. Regulations related to environmental protection, building codes, and
  other topics have significant, often adverse impacts on housing cost and availability. While
  constraints exist at other levels of government, this section emphasizes policies and
  regulations that are under the control of the City.
  It is important to note that the City of West Covina’s intent is to find a balance between
  implementing community standards and quality for new residential development, and
  maintaining a development review process and appropriate regulations that do not
  unreasonably constrain new residential construction. The City of West Covina has been
  successful in achieving that balance as evidenced by:                (1) the construction of
  approximately 2,209 new residential units since 1998 despite being built-out, including 1,223
  multiple-family units; and (2) the affordability of many newer market-rate multiple-family
  units (rental and ownership) for moderate-income households. Consequently, the number
  and cost of many newer residences is a clear indicator that the constraints outlined in this
  chapter are not hindering the construction of affordable and market-rate housing in the
  City of West Covina.
  City of West Covina                                                                     83

6.1.1 - Land Use Controls
     Land use controls are policies, regulations, plans, and other methods of regulating
     the possible uses and development of property, including such things as zoning,
     subdivision regulations, and floodplain regulation. The two primary regulatory
     documents in West Covina are the General Plan and Zoning Code (Title 26 of the
     Municipal Code).
General Plan
     The General Plan, required by Government Code Section 65000 et seq., is a
     comprehensive, long-range policy document that guides physical development in
     West Covina. California State law requires seven elements or chapters in the General
     Plan, including the Housing Element. Each of the elements provides policy guidance
     on the built environment; however the Land Use Element has a direct relationship to
     uses on property. The Land Use Element provides the long-term vision and direction
     for land uses and development through a series of goals, policies, and
     implementation measures. The Land Use Element also includes a map with land use
     designations that describe the distribution, density, and location of land uses in the
     City. Consequently, there is a significant relationship between the Land Use Element
     and housing development in a City.
     West Covina’s previous Land Use Element was adopted in 1985 and therefor ready
     for an update to revise the goals and policies guiding development throughout the
     City. In 2014, the City initiated the update process for the General Plan. Also known
     as Plan WC, the General Plan is an overhaul of the 1985 document, updating all
     Elements including a new Land Use Element and an amended Housing Element.
     Plan WC implements the Transect system, which is system of natural-to-urban
     transect zones or ‘human habitats’. For each the transect zone there is an equivalent
     land use designation.
     Through implementation of the General Plan, the City utilizes a number of planning
     tools including Specific Plans, Zoning Regulations, and Subdivision Ordinances. With
     these documents, the City establishes more specific development standards,
     allowable uses, and limitations. The West Covina General Plan provides for seven
     planning designations with corresponding transect zones. General Plan residential
     land use designations express densities as dwelling units per acre (du/ac). Table 6-1
     describes the General Plan land use designations that permit residential uses.

Zoning Code
         California State law (Government Code Section 65454) requires that a City’s General
         Plan and Zoning Code be consistent. This is critical as Zoning regulations serve as a
         key General Plan implementation tool. The City of West Covina Zoning Ordinance
         accommodates a diversity of residential housing types. The Code allows for
         innovation in design, provided that the development does not exceed the overall
         density and dwelling unit capacity shown in Table 6-2. The West Covina Zoning Code
         presently provides for seven residential land use categories. Each of the categories is
         listed below:
              Agricultural Residential (R-A)
              Single Family Residential (R-1)
City of West Covina                                                                                     85

       Low Density Multi-Family, Condominium Zone (MF-8)
       Low-Medium Density Residential (MF-15)
       Medium Density Residential (MF-20)
       High Density Residential (MF-45)
       Planned Community Development (PCD)
   The densities of the zones range from one unit per acre to 54 units per acre with
   affordable housing allowed in the medium density residential, high density residential
   zones. The City’s Zoning Ordinance specifies the standards for the development of
   residential properties in the City. Zoning regulations control development by
   establishing requirements related to density, lot area, floor area ratio, lot coverage,
   yard setbacks, structure height, minimum open space and minimum parking spaces.
   Site development standards ensure a quality living environment for all household
   groups in the City, including special needs groups, and lower and moderate-income
   households.
   Minimum lot size requirements and design standards, including architectural
   enhancements and landscaping may increase the costs of housing. These
   constraints can hinder the creation of affordable housing for low-income and senior
   residents. To minimize constraints and maintain incentive for affordable housing
   developers, the City relies primarily on the application of density bonuses. Affordable
   age-restricted housing projects, for example, may be granted a 160 percent density
   bonus, which the City expects will encourage developers to construct more of this
   specific type of housing. Another strategy to promote the development of
   affordable housing is the use of Specific Plans, which the City currently allows.
   Tables 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 display the City’s zoning requirements for single family and
   multi-family residential zones, while also presenting any standards specific to the
   City’s area districts. The Zoning Ordinance provides for a range of residential
   densities single-family and multi-family zones. Currently, residential uses are not
   permitted in commercial zones. The City’s development standards for residential
   development are not considered to be a constraint to the development of housing.

As mentioned previously, in 2014, the City initiated a comprehensive General Plan update. A
primary focus of the General Plan is the redevelopment and improvement of the City’s
Downtown which includes the Plaza West Covina shopping mall, located south of Interstate
10. As a result, in addition to the General Plan, the City has developed the Downtown Plan
and Code, which presents a community-led vision and specific development standards for
the Downtown area. The City developed standards to encourage and facilitate the
development of higher density residential infill and mixed use projects within the Downtown
by allowing for reduced parking requirements and deviations from the standards required for
multi-family residential zones. Table 6-5 presents the development standards by the
Downtown Plan and Code.

Parking Requirements
         City parking standards for residential developments are tailored to the vehicle
         ownership patterns associated with different residential uses. Parking is very
         expensive to provide and can consume valuable space that could have been
         otherwise used for additional housing or amenities such as common open space or
         private open space. Jurisdictions can implement greater parking requirements to
         avoid parking spillovers in adjacent neighborhoods. This is a common issue related
         to denser, multi-family residential uses that are adjacent to single-family areas.
         The Zoning Code requires parking based on the number of dwellings on the
         property. As shown in Tables 6-2 and 6-3 above, the City of West Covina has
         established following minimum parking requirements:
         1. Single-family residences: two enclosed spaces and 2 non-enclosed spaces
         2. Multi-family condominiums: two enclosed spaces plus 1 guest space per 4 every
             four units
         3. Two additional enclosed spaces for each second unit in a single-family zone
         The City’s parking requirements are typical of suburban communities; however the
         required number of resident parking is higher than what is typically seen in similar size
         cities. The City requires a greater amount of guest and off-street parking in new
         developments to ensure that public streets remain open and free of an
         overabundance of parked vehicles. The City also calls for two enclosed resident
         spaces per dwelling unit regardless of the number of bedrooms.
         While the City of West Covina’s multi-family parking requirements may appear to
         make it more difficult to accommodate affordable housing, the standards have not
         prevented the development of high density multi-family projects in recent years.
         Generally, the precise impact on the number of units and affordability will depend
         on project location, whether the project is for seniors only, and the unit mix (studios,
92                                                                         2014-2021 Housing Element

        one-bedrooms, two-bedrooms, etc.). To better facilitate the development of
        affordable housing the City has established reduced parking standards for senior
        projects and projects with affordability components when located in close proximity
        to transportation routes and public services. In the last two years the City has
        approved two multi-family housing projects at 65 and 75 units per acre that were
        granted modified parking standards as well as a number of other modified
        development standards. The City has also established flexible parking standards for
        the Downtown, to encourage and facilitate higher density residential projects within
        a walkable environment.
        City Staff is committed to work with developers to reduce and modify this
        requirement as necessary to encourage and facilitate the development of
        affordable housing. The City’s parking requirements are not considered to be a
        constraint to the development of housing.
Open Space Requirements
        To improve the character of the City and overall quality of residential
        neighborhoods, localities typically require dwelling units to maintain a certain
        percentage of open space that may include yard area, common space and
        landscaping. In West Covina open space for single family homes is regulated
        through lot coverage, yard coverage and setbacks. The specific regulations that
        apply to open space in single family zones are identified in Table 6-2, Development
        Standards for Single Family Residential and Agricultural Residential by Area District. In
        multi-family zones, open space is regulated by setbacks and the provision of leisure
        space. For each dwelling unit constructed a required 200 square feet of leisure
        space must be constructed. The recreational/leisure space must have a minimum
        dimension of 50 feet if the project is one or two-story and a minimum dimension of 75
        feet if the project is three-story. Required side and rear yards may be included in the
        recreational/leisure calculation. Communal facilities such as swimming pools or
        community rooms may also be included in the area. The specific regulations are
        provided in Table 6-3, Development Standards for Multiple Family Residential Zones.
        Open space requirements could constrain the development of housing as land is
        already at a premium in West Covina, which is largely built out. However, the City’s
        open space requirements are considered standard for most cities in southern
        California and do not act as a considerable constraint to housing development. City
        Staff is committed to work with developers to reduce and modify this requirement as
        necessary to encourage and facilitate the development of affordable housing. In
        recent years, several affordable housing projects, including a senior residential
        facility of 65 units on a 1.05 acre parcel, have been developed and these
        requirements were not considered to be a constraint to development. The City’s
        open space requirements are not considered to be a constraint to the development
        of housing.

Minimum Floor Area Requirements
     In addition to regulating open space, the City of West Covina also identifies a
     minimum square footage for multi-family units. The specific regulations are shown in
     Table 6-4. For residences of varying size the square footage of the unit is required to
     fall in the following range:
         Studio:               500 – 600 square feet
         1-Bedroom:            600 – 1,450 square feet
         2-bedroom:            800 – 1,650 square feet
         3-bedroom:            990 – 1,850 square feet
         4-bedroom:            1,125 – 2,000 square feet
     The minimum floor areas required by the City depend on the unit location and
     zoning. For some units the City’s minimum floor areas may be greater than the area
     that is typically required by private development standards for affordable and senior
     housing.        Regulating square footage ensures that minimum health and safety
     requirements are met and that units are able to adequately accommodate families.
     The ranges allowed by the City are also wide enough to allow for significant variation
     of unit size and have not constrained the development of affordable housing in the
     City. City Staff is committed to working with developers to ensure that this standard
     does not constrain the development of housing in the City and will provide
     modifications when appropriate.

Code Enforcement
     West Covina, like many other jurisdictions, includes property and building
     maintenance standards in its Municipal Code to protect the appearance and
     character of residential neighborhoods. The established standards require property
     owners to maintain landscaped areas for aesthetic, health, and fire safety reasons.
     Building maintenance regulations address abandoned buildings, deteriorating paint,
     deteriorating roofs, or broken windows.              Analysis of the City’s landscape
     maintenance standards for buildings and residential properties reveals that the
     standards imposed are minimal routine maintenance requirements and do not pose
     a significant impediment or act as a constraint to existing residential housing units or
     to the development and maintenance of affordable housing.

6.1.2 - On and Off-Site Improvements
        Site improvements and property dedications are important components of new
        development and contribute to the creation of decent and affordable housing. For
        residential development the required site improvements will typically vary by size and
        location of the proposed development. Possible required improvements may
        include, but are not limited to:
           Street improvements (minor neighborhood streets in the City are a minimum
            thirty-two (32) feet between exterior curbs)
           Adequate distribution lines for domestic water supply
           Sewage collecting system where main lines of an adequate disposal system are
            available
           Roadway paving to the street center line
           Street lighting
           Concrete curbs and gutters
           Full width concrete sidewalks (4-5 feet width)
           Street trees and appropriate irrigation systems
           Adequate grading and surfacing of streets, highways, and alleys
           Fire hydrants at locations recommended by the City Engineer and Fire
            Department
           Traffic control devices
           Necessary barricades and safety devices
           Fees for, or dedication of, parks and recreation facilities
        The City of West Covina maintains a high engineering standard for curbs, gutters,
        sidewalks, and streets, and these standards regulate construction and such items as
        width and grade. In the past, the City has approved residential subdivisions with
        private streets where the standards have been modified to reduce housing costs.
        The City will continue to review the general development standards such as street
        width, parking lanes, and sidewalks, not only to result in lower costs, but also in a
        more pleasing appearance for the subdivision.
        Site improvements, particularly infrastructure, such as upgrades to major and local
        streets; curbs, gutters, and sidewalks; water and sewer lines; storm drains; and street
        lighting can be viewed as a constraint to the development of affordable housing. In
        most cases, these improvements are dedicated to the City, which is then responsible
        for their maintenance. The cost of these facilities is borne by developers, is added to
        the cost of new housing units, and eventually is passed on to the homebuyer or
        property owner. West Covina, like many jurisdictions in Los Angeles County is almost
        entirely built out and already has existing upgraded infrastructure and roadways
        throughout the City. To reduce the impact of potential infrastructure upgrades on
        the development of affordable units, sites identified in the Sites Inventory to
        accommodate very low- and low-income housing are located along existing major
City of West Covina                                                                     95

     roadways that will not require further upgrades if a project is proposed. If
     improvements are necessary, the City has indicated that they will use CDBG monies
     or other available funding, when available, to offset the cost of on- and off-site
     improvements in order to assist affordable housing developers in the production of
     units. Additionally, through its density bonus ordinance the City will continue to
     provide incentives, such as assistance with on- and off-site improvements whenever
     possible.
6.1.3 - Fees and Exactions
     Planning and permitting fees are charged on an at-cost basis to cover staff services
     and administrative expenses for processing development applications.
     Development impact fees are required to provide essential services and
     infrastructure to serve new residents. In addition, developer fees and exactions
     imposed on new development can help to minimize impacts on existing
     infrastructure and enable required upgrades of infrastructure consistent with
     demands of the new development. State law requires that these fees be reasonably
     related to the mitigation of the identified impact, and that they be proportionate to
     the extent of impact associated with any given development project. These
     development fees are typically passed on to renters and homeowners in the
     price/rent of housing, and thus affect housing affordability.
     The City’s Planning Department and Development Fee Schedules are outlined in
     Table 6-7. In 2011 the City performed an analysis and updated the fee schedule,
     resulting in a small increase in the planning related fees that are appropriate given
     the timeframe. The development fees for the City of West Covina are comparable to
     other local jurisdictions and are not considered to be a major constraint to the
     development of affordable or market rate housing. The City’s fees are actually lower
     than fees charged by surrounding jurisdictions including Additional fees, such as
     development impact fees for public facilities and services, drainage, water and
     sewer, and environmental fees are also presented.

   The City also charges a limited number of impact fees to ensure that services and
   infrastructure are in place to serve the planned developments (see Table 6-8). These
   fees have not changed since the previous planning period. Although impact fees
   and requirements for offsite improvements add to the cost of housing, these fees
   and requirements are necessary to maintain the quality of life within a community.
   West Covina’s impact fees include a dwelling unit fee, park fees, and school fees.
   Los Angeles County provides sewer to the City, and charges a related sewer
   connection fee. The dwelling unit fees are applied to pay a portion of the costs
98                                                           2014-2021 Housing Element

        identified for public facilities used for transportation services, storm drain facilities,
        and police and fire services.
        In an effort to promote second dwelling units, affordable housing, and senior
        housing, the City does have parkland fee exemptions and offers fee reductions for
        these uses. New second dwelling units, on a property with one existing single-family
        house, pay only half of the required in-lieu parkland fees. Residential development
        restricted by covenant to occupancy for low- and moderate-income households
        and/or senior citizens are exempted from parkland fees.
        Fees charged in West Covina are comparable to those of surrounding communities
        in Los Angeles County. The processing fees are well under one percent of the total
        development cost. Assuming a 1,000 square foot unit, the total development fees
        (including school district fees) would be approximately $8,500 per single family unit.
        This assumes 20 electrical fixtures, 5 plumbing fixtures, one sewer connection, one
        thousand square feet of floor area and a valuation of approximately $250,000. For a
        comparable multi-family unit the fees would be much lower at $2,650 per unit as the
        impact of the building permit fees, park fees, art fees, and flood control fees would
        be distributed depending on the number of units developed. Development impact
        fees charged in the City have not been identified as a constraint to the
        development of affordable housing.

     Notes:
     1. Art in Public Places Fee only applies to residential development projects with more than ten (10) dwelling
     units, and is based on the amount that is equal to 0.5% of the total building valuation excluding land.
6.1.4 - Processing and Permit Procedures
     Builders and developers frequently cite the cost of holding land during the
     evaluation and review process as a significant factor to the cost of housing. Holding
     costs associated with delays in processing have been estimated to add between
     1.1% and 1.8% to the cost of a dwelling unit for each month of delay. Processing
     times vary with the complexity of the project. Approval for single-family homes,
     multi-family development projects with less than five dwelling units, and other minor
     tenant improvements can usually be processed within thirty days after submission to
     the City. Multi-family development projects with five or more dwelling units are
     subject to review and approval by the City Council, which can add another four to
     six weeks for review. Projects requiring Conditional Use Permits, Zoning Amendments,
     or other discretionary actions necessitate a higher level of review, resulting in a
     longer processing timeline; usually 60 to 90 days.
     The City of West Covina’s development approval process is designed to
     accommodate, not hinder, appropriate development. Table 6-9 provides a list of
     the average processing times for various procedures from application to City
     Council approval of a project. Currently, the City does not have a formal procedure
     for expediting projects with affordability conditions. As supported by reasonable
     processing times, and the relative facility of permit procedure, the City's processing
     and permit procedures are not meant to constrain the development of housing.
     The Planning Department is the lead agency responsible for processing residential
     development applications and coordinating submittals with other City departments
     and agencies. The time required to process a development entitlement application
     can have cost implications for affordable housing. Changes in zoning designations

Permit Processing for Single Story Single-Family Construction
             The permitting approval process for a residential project depends on the intensity
             and number of units requested by the applicant. If a property owner applies for
             permits to construct a single story single-family home their plans are submitted to
             the Planning Department for an initial review to ensure their application is
             complete. The more information an applicant provides, and the quicker they
             correct any revisions on their plans, the shorter the permit processing time. Upon
             completion of their initial review the Planning Department schedules the
             application for review by the Planning Commission Subcommittee for Design
             Review (Subcommittee). The Subcommittee typically reviews the plans for
             architectural and design compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood and
             the character of the City. The Subcommittee has the authority to approve or
             deny the plans or to suggest modifications. Once the plans have been approved
             by the Subcommittee the City notifies the applicant and permits can be issued.
             This review process typically takes between 2 to 4 weeks; however the processing
             time is often dependent on how efficient the applicant is at revising and
             resubmitting plans if corrections are required.
Permit Processing for Multi-Story Single Family Construction
             If a property owner applies for permits to construct a multi-story single-family
             home the plans are approved through a process known as Administrative
             Development Plan Review. Once the applicant submits their application and
             plans, an appointment is scheduled with the Planning Commission Subcommittee
             for Design Review (Subcommittee), which is composed of City Staff and two
             appointed Planning Commissioners. The Subcommittee evaluates the plans for
City of West Covina                                                                       101
        completeness, as well as assessing comments made by the various other City
        departments including, fire, public works and building. The Subcommittee also
        typically reviews the plans for architectural and design compatibility with the
        surrounding neighborhood and consistency with the character of the City.
        In addition to review by the Subcommittee, an Administrative Use Permit also
        requires that notices be sent to property owners living within 300 feet of the
        proposed project. The notice is intended to inform residents of the applicant’s
        plans and to allow them to request a public hearing before the Planning
        Commission to discuss the application and any express concerns. Notices are
        sent out prior to Subcommittee review. If no public hearing is requested the
        Subcommittee is responsible for project approval and the review process can
        take as little as 2-4 weeks. If a public hearing in front of the Planning Commission
        is requested than the process can extend up to 8 weeks and the Planning
        Commission becomes the decision making entity.
Permit Processing for Multi-family Construction
        For a multi-family residential project the permitting procedure can be more
        complex and consequently can result in longer and more variable processing
        times. The City currently has different submittal requirements for multi-family
        developments; one for projects with rental units and another for projects with
        ownership units. If an applicant is planning to construct multi-family rental units a
        Precise Plan is required while for ownership units a Precise Plan as well as a
        Tentative Tract Map is required. Generally the application process is similar for
        both types of units.
        Once the applicant submits their application and plans, an initial meeting is
        schedule with the developer to discuss design and phasing of the project.
        Following this meeting, an appointment with the Planning Commission
        Subcommittee for Design Review (Subcommittee) is scheduled and the plans are
        routed to the various City departments including, fire, public works and building
        for review. The Subcommittee evaluates the plans for completeness as well as
        assessing comments made by the various City departments. The Subcommittee
        also typically reviews the plans for architectural and design compatibility with the
        surrounding neighborhood and consistency with the character of the City. The
        Subcommittee may also determine if any conditions of approval, such as capital
        improvements, are necessary to complete the project. Conditions of approval
        typically protect the health, safety and welfare of the public and ensure a
        project’s consistency with established architectural design guidelines.
        Upon completing their review the Subcommittee’s conditions of approval are
        sent to the applicant. At the applicant’s request a meeting can be scheduled to
        discuss the conditions of approval if necessary. If the applicant understands and
        accepts the findings and conditions the project is sent as a public hearing item
        before the Planning Commission. Findings and conditions do not exceed the
        limits and requirements of the State law. Any finding or conditions are provided
        primarily to ensure that the project is consistent with the City’s General Plan, the
        Zoning Code and Health and Safety codes, Typical findings for a multi-family
        housing project includes analysis of street improvements, fire suppression, and
102                                                                2014-2021 Housing Element

            water quality. In most cases a project would then be approved by the Planning
            Commission and permits would be issued soon after. The processing time for a
            multi-family development typically takes between 10 to 12 weeks. Similar to the
            process for single-family projects, the processing time is often dependent on how
            efficient the applicant is at revising and resubmitting plans if corrections are
            required.
6.1.5 - Housing for Persons with Disabilities
        State law requires jurisdictions to analyze potential and actual constraints upon
        housing for persons with disabilities, demonstrate efforts to remove governmental
        constraints, and include programs to accommodate housing designed for people
        with disabilities. The City has no special zoning or land use restrictions that regulate
        the development of housing for persons with disabilities. However, one of the
        purposes of the City’s Senior Housing Overlay Zone (SHO) is to ensure that federally
        regulated requirements related to the Americans Disabilities Act (ADA) and Universal
        Design principles are incorporated within senior housing developments. During the
        previous planning period, the City of West Covina also established specific
        procedures to ensure that reasonable accommodations are made for persons with
        disabilities. Ordinance 2235 adopted August 21, 2012 establishes a clear procedure
        to address requests for reasonable accommodation.
        In accordance with State law the City requires no discretionary review of small group
        home projects (six or fewer residents). West Covina does not impose additional
        zoning, building code, or permitting procedures on small care facilities other than
        those allowed by State law. West Covina ensures that new housing developments
        including disabled accessibility requirements comply with Tier 1 of the California
        Green Building Code and has not adopted any local amendments to the building
        standards. The City provides information to applicants or those inquiring of City
        regulations regarding accommodations in zoning, permit processes, and application
        of building codes for persons with disabilities. Additionally, the West Covina Zoning
        Code also allows for residential retrofitting to increase the suitability of homes for
        persons with disabilities in compliance with ADA requirements.
        Presently, the City’s zoning laws, policies, and practices are compliant with fair
        housing law allowing for the construction of units that can accommodate the needs
        of residents with disabilities. Examples of ways in which the City facilitates housing for
        persons with disabilities through its regulatory and permitting processes are:
           Reasonable accommodation procedures have been established offering a
            formal clear process to apply for development standard modifications;
           Community care facilities of six or fewer persons are permitted as of right on the
            same basis as other single-family uses;
           Larger community care facilities may be permitted under the City’s conditional
            use permit process, which seeks to ensure the suitability and adequacy of the site
            for the proposed use; adequate utilities and infrastructure is available on-site,
            and compatibility of design with adjacent uses within the district and its
            surroundings.;
           Establishment of standards for parking reduction for special needs housing.
City of West Covina                                                                      103

     Additionally, the Land Use Element in the City’s General Plan does not require, nor
     regulate the siting of special needs housing in relationship to one another. Based on
     its zoning, land use policies, and building code practices, as described above, there
     is no evidence that West Covina has created significant constraints to the location,
     construction, or cost of special needs housing for persons with disabilities.
6.1.6 - Affordable Housing Related Ordinances
     In an effort to provide flexibility within the development standards listed in the West
     Covina Municipal Code there are a number of ordinances aimed at providing
     additional affordable housing in the City. These ordinances allow for density bonuses,
     second unit development, homeless and transitional shelters, and two overlay
     districts. West Covina has implemented these ordinances to assist developers in
     providing quality and affordable housing throughout the City.
Density Bonus
     In response to State mandated requirements and local needs, the City has adopted
     ordinances/regulatory mechanisms that permit higher densities than generally
     permitted. The West Covina Zoning Code provides housing incentives to assist in the
     provision of sound affordable housing for low- and moderate-income households
     and senior citizen households. In accordance with Sections 65915 and 65917 of the
     California Government Code, the density bonus ordinance assists in achieving the
     goals and implementing the policies of the Housing Element of the General Plan and
     Comprehensive Housing Assistance Strategy.
     Known as a “density bonus,” state law allows a developer to increase the density of
     a residential development by up to 25% over the otherwise maximum allowable
     residential density if provisions are made to contain at least any one of the following:
         At least 5 percent of the total units are reserved for and affordable to very low
          income households;
         At least 10 percent of the total units are reserved for and affordable to low
          income households;
         At least 50 percent of the total units are reserved for and affordable to moderate
          income households.
     The West Covina Municipal Code also includes a section titled “Low and Moderate
     Income and Senior Citizen Housing.” This section specifically allows for density
     bonuses from between 25% and 160% in an effort to offset land and construction
     costs.     In addition, this section of the code allows for the modification of
     development standards to render the development economically feasible. This
     section of the Code is intended to facilitate the development of housing for low and
     very-low income households that is restricted for a period of no less than 45 years for
     owners and 55 years for renters. The City promotes the use of the density bonus
     ordinance for senior housing, and in conjunction with mixed use projects and within
     Specific Plans.
104                                                                2014-2021 Housing Element

        Development projects that qualify for a mandatory density bonus will in addition to
        the density increase be granted up to three additional incentives or concessions. A
        developer can receive incentives or concessions based on the proportion of
        affordable units for target groups. Applicants are allowed to request a specific
        incentive be granted, however the final determination shall be made by the West
        Covina Planning Commission. Incentives/concessions are granted to the extent
        determined necessary to render a housing development economically feasible.
        Incentives or concessions may include, but are not limited to:
           Modification of number of required parking spaces
           Modification of minimum unit sizes
           Modification of minimum setbacks
           Modification of architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum
            building standards
           Modification of requirements for public works improvements or other on-site or
            off-site physical improvements
           Expedited case processing
           Waiver or reduction of fees for processing entitlement permits and/or preparation
            of environmental review documents
           Direct financial assistance
Second Unit Requirements
        In response to state mandated requirements and local needs, the City of West
        Covina allows the development of both attached and detached second dwelling
        units. Traditionally intended for elderly or other members of owner-occupant families,
        the example of compact, infill development can be strategy for meeting the
        growing rental housing demands.
        A second unit is a self-contained living unit with cooking, eating, sleeping, and full
        sanitation facilities, either attached to or detached from the primary residential unit
        on a single lot. Second units offer several benefits. They offer affordable rental
        housing for seniors, college students, and single persons that typically rent for less
        than apartment of comparable size. In addition, the primary homeowner receives
        supplemental income, which can help many modest income and elderly
        homeowners remain in or afford their homes.
        In West Covina, one second unit may be constructed or established only on a lot
        containing a first unit located in a single-family residential zone, except in Area
        Districts III, IV, and V, where second units are prohibited. The minimum site sizes for
        second-unit lots are 12,000 square feet for Area District IA, 13,500 square feet for Area
        District I and 15,450 square feet for Area District II/IIA. Second units may be
        constructed above a garage, except when said garage is located in the rear yard.
        Second units are limited to 640 square feet or 15 percent of the floor area of the
        primary dwelling unit if the second unit is attached. One enclosed parking space is
        required for each second unit bedroom, in addition to parking required for the
City of West Covina                                                                     105

     primary dwelling unit. The primary constraints posed by the current second unit
     standards are the large minimum lot sizes in some parts of the City, and parking
     requirement for one enclosed space per bedroom, and payment of park
     development fees. While the City previously required a conditional use permit to
     construct a second unit, the City will amend the Zoning Code in October of 2013 to
     permit second unit approval through a discretionary process, removing a potential
     constraint.
Homeless Shelters and Transitional Housing
     Emergency shelters provide temporary housing for homeless persons for a limited
     period of time. Section 50801 of the Health and Safety Code defines emergency
     shelters as “housing with minimal supportive services for homeless persons that is
     limited to occupancy of six months or less by a homeless person. No individual or
     household may be denied emergency due to an inability to pay.”
     Transitional housing facilities provide support and housing for persons transitioning out
     of homelessness into permanent housing. Section 50801 of the Health and Safety
     Code defines transitional housing as “housing with supportive services for up to 24
     months that is exclusively designated and targeted for recently homeless persons.”
     To achieve certification of 2008-2014 the City of West Covina adopted Ordinance
     2239 on August 28, 2012 to implement the requirements of SB2. The State
     Department of HCD required that the ordinance be in place before issuing their
     certification letter in December 2012. Generally, the West Covina Zoning Code to
     permits the development of emergency shelters, supportive, and transitional housing
     for homeless individuals and families. During the previous planning period, the City
     amended their Zoning Code to permit SRO units by right in the High Density Multi-
     Family (MF-45) zone without a Conditional Use Permit or other discretionary action.
     The City also revised the Zoning Code to permit emergency shelters by right without
     a conditional use permit or other discretionary action in the Light Manufacturing (M-
     1) zone and has established development standards that are no more restrictive
     than the development standards required for other residential uses permitted in
     each zone. This zone is appropriate to accommodate emergency shelters as M-1
     areas are typically located along major arterial roadways with access to
     employment centers and near stores and other services. There are currently 45
     parcels totaling 60.75 acres of land zoned for M-1 in the City. Of these sites
     approximately 11 parcels between 0.5 and 5 acres in size that are underutilized and
     appropriate and able to accommodate a shelter of approximately 20 beds if one is
     proposed. To better accommodate emergency shelters in the City, specific siting
     standards and conditions for approval have been developed in accordance with
     State Law.
Planned Residential Development Overlay Zone
     A Planned Residential Development overlay zone (PRD) may be combined with any
     of the City’s conventional zone districts. The purpose of a PRD overlay zone is to
     allow flexibility in the mixture of land uses and encourage projects that incorporate a
     variety of housing types or combinations of residential uses. This is accomplished by
     allowing for diversification in the relationship of uses, buildings, architectural design,

        lot sizes, yard areas, and open spaces which may not be achievable under other
        zoning districts. PRD overlay zones require a precise plan and are reviewed by both
        the Planning Commission and the City Council.
Special Incentives for Affordable Senior Citizen Housing
        West Covina is specifically concerned with the provision of affordable housing
        options for the growing senior citizen population. Consequently, the City has
        established specific regulations to assist developers in meeting the demand for
        additional units. The City offers two incentives for developers to incorporate dwelling
        units for lower-income senior citizens into their projects. These incentives include a
        modification to the existing parking standard and/or modifications to the minimum
        dwelling unit size.
        A variation on the number of required parking spaces may be granted based on the
        consideration of eight factors. As parking is often a significantly limiting standard, a
        reduction in the required amount of parking could assist a developer in providing
        additional affordable units. The factors taken into consideration by the City to
        reduce the number of parking spaces required include:
           The proportion of dwelling units reserved for lower-income households
           The size of dwelling units by number of bedrooms
           The proposed minimum age limit of residents
           The length of use and affordability restrictions proposed
           The proximity to established transit routes and facilities, and the availability of
            privately provided transit services
           The proximity to retail and service commercial facilities
           Proposed restrictions on the number of vehicles maintained on site by each
            household
        In addition to parking, the required minimum dwelling size required in the City’s
        Municipal Code can also limit the number of affordable units a developer is able to
        provide. In reducing the number of square feet required for a unit the City provides
        developers with more incentive to increase the number of units they build which
        may also lead to a reduction in the cost of the unit to the developer and in turn the
        renter. The City states that the minimum dwelling unit sizes may be reduced, but will
        not be less than the standards shown in Table 6-6.
City of West Covina                                                                     107

6.2 - Non-Governmental Constraints
The construction and labor cost of housing affects the affordability of new housing and can
be a constraint to the creation of affordable housing in the City and greater Los Angeles
County region. Particularly with the tightening of mortgage lending standards and increases
in current rates, homebuilders may be slowing down on the construction of new homes,
which could potentially affect the provision of affordable housing. In addition to the
governmental constraints addressed above market and environmental constraints can also
affect developers’ ability to produce affordable units.
6.2.1 - Market Constraints
       In the production of affordable housing, market constraints can play a large role in
       driving up the cost of unit production leading to an overall lower number of
       affordable units. Three major constraints are identified as critical to address in the
       City of West Covina. These constraints include: land prices, construction costs, and
       labor rates.
       The availability of financing can limit access to homeownership for some low-income
       households. Market-related constraints are part of regional trends related to housing
       and local jurisdictions seldom have any control over these. Although many
       constraints are driven by market conditions, jurisdictions have some leverage in
       instituting policies and programs to address these constraints.
Land Prices
       The cost of land directly influences the cost of housing. Land prices are determined
       by a number of factors, most important of which are land availability and permitted
       development density. As land becomes scarcer, the price for land increases. Land
       prices are also positively correlated with the number of units permitted on each lot.
       Thus, a higher density lot may command a higher price than one designated for
       lower densities, but upon completion the developer may realize a higher profit
       margin based on a greater number of units sold.
       West Covina is typical of the suburban communities surrounding the City of Los
       Angeles in that it is largely built out. There are few parcels remaining that consist of
       raw land, indicating that the City is unable to meet its projected housing demand
       simply by developing vacant land, even at the State mandated default density of 30
       dwelling units per acre. According to local developers the estimated cost of land
       per unit averages around $35-$40 per square foot, or $1.5 to $1.7 million per acre. It is
       similar to the price of land in Los Angeles County. The lack of vacant land however,
       suggests that the development of new units is more likely to occur due to the
       redevelopment and infill of older and underutilized areas. Consequently it is not the
       cost of land that constrains the production of housing in West Covina.

Construction Costs
        The cost of construction depends primarily on the cost of materials and labor, but it is
        also influenced by market demand and market-based changes in the cost of
        materials. The cost of construction also depends on the type of unit being built and
        on the quality of the product being produced. Typically as the number of units
        constructed increases, overall costs generally decrease as builders can benefit from
        the economies of scale. For both single family and multi-family construction there is
        wide variation in price, depending on the size of the unit, the number and quality of
        amenities provided, quality of construction, and the types and quality of materials
        used.
        In recent years total construction costs per square foot, excluding land costs, range
        from $35 for a 1,500 square foot single-family home to $48 for a 3,000 square foot
        single-family construction, depending on the quality and amenities of the home. It is
        estimated that multi-family construction costs in comparison, range from $48 to $65
        per square foot, excluding land cost. Single family and multi-family homes in West
        Covina are made generally of wood or steel frame construction, finished with
        stucco, wood siding or shingles. This type of construction is the least expensive
        conventional method; in comparison to brick, stone and concrete block which are
        more costly.
        A reduction in construction costs can be brought about in several ways. One such
        method involves a reduction in amenities and quality of building materials in new
        homes (still above the minimum acceptability for health, safety and adequate
        performance), which may result in lower sales prices. State Housing Law provides
        that local building departments can authorize the use of materials and construction
        methods if the proposed design is found to be satisfactory and the materials or
        methods are at least equivalent to that prescribed by the applicable State building
        codes.
        In addition, pre-fabricated, factory built housing may provide lower priced products
        by reducing labor and materials costs. As the number of units built in scale
        increases, savings in construction costs over the entire development can be realized,
        particularly when combined with density bonus provisions. The City may implement a
        variety of programs to write down land costs or provide other developer incentives
        such as waivers in development standards or processing fees in order to increase
        affordability, subject to the developer providing a percentage of units with
        affordability restrictions.
Labor Costs
        The cost of labor is based on a number of factors, including housing demand, the
        number of contractors in an area and the unionization of workers, but it is generally
        two to three times the cost of materials. Thus, the cost of labor represents an
        estimated 17% to 20% of the cost of building a unit, which is a substantial portion of
        the overall cost of construction.
City of West Covina                                                                  109
     Prevailing wages may also be an additional constraint on construction costs. In the
     State of California, all public works projects must pay prevailing wages to all workers
     employed on the project. A public works project is any residential or commercial
     project that is funded through public funds, including federally funded or assisted
     residential projects controlled or carried out by an awarding body. The prevailing
     wage rate is the basic hourly rate paid on public works projects to a majority of
     workers engaged in a particular craft, classification, or type of work within the
     locality and in the nearest labor market area.
     Twice a year, prevailing wage rates are determined by the director of the California
     Department of Industrial Relations. A prevailing wage ensures that the ability to get a
     public works contract is not based on paying lower wage rates than a competitor,
     and requires that all bidders use the same wage rates when bidding on a public
     works project. The California Department of Industrial Relations provides a link to the
     current prevailing wages for a journeyman craft or classification for each county in
     California. Prevailing wages may constrain construction of affordable housing
     because they are often higher than normal wages.
     Residential construction cost estimates established by the International Code
     Council (ICC) in February 2012 indicate average costs of labor and materials
     between $94.76 and $142.14 per square foot for multi-family residential depending
     on the type of construction. Single-family residential costs range between $103.92
     and $133.78 per square foot, depending on the type of construction. Construction
     costs may vary based on the type of material used, location of development,
     structural features present, and other factors.
Financing
     Mortgage interest rates have a large influence over the affordability of housing.
     Increases in interest rates decrease the number of persons able to afford a home
     purchase. Decreases in interest rates result in more potential homebuyers introduced
     into the market.
     National policies and economic conditions determine interest rates, and there is little
     that local governments can do to affect these rates. Jurisdictions can, however,
     “leverage” funds by offering interest rate write-downs to extend home purchase
     opportunities to lower income households. In addition, government insured loan
     programs may be available to reduce mortgage down payment requirements.
     First time homebuyers are the most impacted by financing requirements. Mortgage
     interest rates for new home purchases ranged from 3.5% to 5% for a fixed rate-30
     year loan in 2013. Lower initial rates may be available with Graduated Payment
     Mortgages (GPMs), Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM’s), and Buy-Down Mortgages.
     However, variable interest rate mortgages on affordable homes may increase to the
     point that interest rates exceed the cost of living adjustments, which is a constraint
     on affordability. Although interest rates are currently low, they can change
     significantly and substantially impact the affordability of the housing stock.
     Interest rates in 2013 are not a constraint to affordable housing; however more strict
     lending standards could pose a constraint to affordable housing. An increase of
110                                                                2014-2021 Housing Element

        one percentage point can make a monthly payment out of reach for many lower
        income households. As such, financing for long term mortgages is generally
        available in West Covina, subject to normal underwriting standards.
        A more critical impediment to homeownership involves both the affordability of the
        housing stock and the ability of potential buyers to fulfill down payment
        requirements. Typically, conventional home loans will require 80% loan-to-value and
        represents the largest constraint to homebuyers. Other programs, such as those for
        first-time homebuyers, can find down payment requirements between 5% and 20%.
        However, more recent events in the housing market have made it more difficult for
        prospective home buyers to secure a home loan.
        One of the greatest impediments to homeownership, however, is credit worthiness.
        According to the Federal Housing Authority, lenders consider a person’s debt-to-
        income ratio, cash available for down payment, and credit history, when
        determining a maximum loan amount. Many financial institutions are willing to
        significantly decrease down payment requirements and increase loan amounts to
        persons with good credit rating. Persons with poor credit ratings may be forced to
        accept a higher interest rate or a loan amount insufficient to purchase a house. Poor
        credit rating can be especially damaging to lower-income residents, who have
        fewer financial resources with which to qualify for a loan. The FHA is generally more
        flexible than conventional lenders in its qualifying guidelines and allows many
        residents to re-establish a good credit history.
        Under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), lending institutions are required
        to report lending activity by census tract. Analysis of available HMDA reports do not
        indicate documented cases of underserved lower income census tracts in the City.

     The data is for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale MSA, which includes the City of
     West Covina. The data includes purchases of one to four unit homes as well as
     manufactured homes. Over 70 percent of the loan applications were received from
     moderate-income households or above (earning greater than 80% of Median Family
     Income [MFI]). The overall loan origination rate was 64 percent and this rate
     decreased as income decreased. These rates can be expected to contract further
     as a recent national survey conducted by the Federal Reserve found that more than
     half of banks responding reported they had tightened their lending standards for
     sub-prime mortgages.
6.2.2 - Environmental Constraints
Ground Shaking
     The potential for seismic activity and ground shaking in West Covina is determined
     by the City’s proximity to the affected fault and the intensity of the seismic event
     along the fault. Damage associated with earthquakes is dependent on a number of
     variable factors including: the strength or magnitude of the earthquake, the length
     (time) of the shaking, the distance from the earthquake, the substrate that is being
     affected by the quake, and the construction of the structure.
     There are traces of two known faults within the borders of West Covina, these are the
     Walnut Creek fault and the San Jose Hills fault. These two faults are not well defined
     or studied. The Walnut Creek tracing is located under basin sediment that has for
     years been deposited from the San Gabriel and surrounding mountains. The City has
     implemented the Uniform Building Code seismic safety standards for structural
     construction. The City will continue to enact these and other seismic safety
     programs to minimize hazards from earthquakes and other seismic hazards.
Liquefaction
     A secondary effect from earthquakes includes liquefaction. Liquefaction occurs
     when ground shaking causes wet granular soils to change from a solid state to a
     liquid state. This results in the loss of soil strength and the soil's ability to support
     weight. Buildings and their occupants are at risk when the ground can no longer
     support these buildings and structures. Many communities in Southern California are
     built on ancient river bottoms and have sandy soil. In some cases this ground may be
     subject to liquefaction, depending on the depth of the water table. Data provided
     by water service providers around West Covina indicate that a depth to
     groundwater is more than 50 feet, and therefore liquefaction hazards are generally
     low. Liquefaction hazards, where present, can generally be remedied by standard
     engineering practices. Liquefaction is not seen as a constraint to the development
     of affordable or market rate housing.

6.2.3 - Infrastructure Constraints
        In planning for future residential development, it is important to evaluate current
        service levels provided to existing residents, deficiencies in the levels of services
        provided, and the need for additional public services and facilities to support new
        development. This section addresses the ability of water and wastewater utilities to
        serve an increase in population. Generally, infrastructure development is not seen as
        a constraint to the development of affordable or market rate housing.
Water
        Potable water in West Covina is provided by eight water companies depending on
        the location of the residence in the City. Suburban Water Systems (SWS) provides
        water to the majority of the City serving a population of approximately 300,000
        persons. SWS receives wholesale water supplies from the Upper San Gabriel Valley
        Municipal Water District (USGVMWD). The USGVMWD is in turn a member of the
        Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides the USGVMWD
        with approximately 20 percent of its water supply. The remaining water supply is
        supplied locally through groundwater supplies. Based on verbal communication
        with SWS it is anticipated that there is adequate water supply to accommodate the
        City’s RHNA allocation. Project specific analysis may be required when a project is
        proposed to determine if the existing infrastructure and proposed demand need to
        be addressed. Generally, water supply is not seen as a constraint to the
        development of affordable or market rate housing.
Wastewater
        West Covina is located within the service area of Los Angeles County Sanitation
        District No. 15. Wastewater generated within the city is discharged to local sewer
        lines, maintained by the City, for conveyance to the County Sanitation District of Los
        Angeles County truck sewer network. Wastewater is treated at the San Jose Creek
        Water Reclamation Plant (SJCWRP) near the City of Whittier, where it is cleaned and
        reused as groundwater recharge and for the irrigation of parks, schools, and
        greenbelts. Some of the wastewater not used, or flows which exceed capacity of
        the SJCWRP is diverted to the Joint Water Pollution Control Plan in Carson.
        Authorities at the Los Angeles County Sanitation District No. 15 consider the trunk
        system and treatment facilities adequate at the time this Element was prepared.
        Similarly, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works and Sewer
        Maintenance Division consider the sewer line system adequate to handle
        foreseeable future development accommodating the City’s combined RHNA
        allocation.

  This section summarizes the land, financial, and administrative resources available for the
  development and preservation of housing in West Covina. The analysis includes an
  evaluation of the availability of land resources for future housing development; the City’s
  ability to satisfy its share of the region’s future housing needs, the financial resources
  available to support housing activities, and the administrative resources available to assist in
  implementing the City’s housing programs and policies.
  7.1 - Regional Housing Needs Allocation
  West Covina’s Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) for the 2014-2021 planning period
  has been determined by SCAG to be 831 housing units, including 217 units for very low-
  income households, 129 units for low-income households, 138 units for moderate-income
  households, and 347 units for above moderate-income households. It is assumed that the
  City’s extremely low income need is 50 percent of their very low income RHNA allocation of
  217 units, or approximately108 units.
  The housing allocation for each jurisdiction is divided into four household income categories
  used in Federal and State programs: Very Low (50% of AMI); Low (50-80% of AMI); Moderate
  (80-120% of AMI); and Above Moderate-Income (over 120% of AMI). The allocations are
  further adjusted to avoid an over-concentration of lower income households in any one
  jurisdiction. The 2014-2021 Regional Housing Needs Allocation for the City of West Covina is
  shown in Table 7-1.

7.2 - Availability of Sites for Housing
State law requires that a community provide an adequate number of sites to allow for, and
facilitate production of the City’s regional share of housing. To determine whether the City
has sufficient land to accommodate its share of regional housing needs for all income
groups, the City must identify “adequate sites.” Under State law (California Government
Code section 65583) adequate sites are those with appropriate zoning and development
standards, with services, and facilities, needed to facilitate and encourage the
development of a variety of housing for all income levels.
As West Covina does not have a sufficient amount of residentially-zoned, undeveloped
land to accommodate their remaining RHNA allocation, seven sites have been identified in
the Housing Resources Section to accommodate future housing through mixed use
development. The seven sites identified for potential mixed use projects are located in the
City’s Downtown.
7.2.1 - Vacant and Underutilized Sites
        State law requires that jurisdictions demonstrate in the Housing Element a land
        inventory adequate to accommodate their fair share of the region’s projected
        growth. Like many cities in Los Angeles County, West Covina is a well-established
        suburban community approaching build-out will little to no vacant land.
        Consequently, the City will rely on development of new mixed use and infill projects
        on underutilized land in areas that are ripe for revitalization and appropriate for new
        residential development. The City has a documented history of redeveloping
        underutilized sites to allow for the development of high density residential units. The
        City recently developed a 65 unit complex for senior citizens in 2010 and approved a
        450-unit multi-family complex in 2011, which allow densities up to 65 and 75 dwelling
        units per acre respectively. The City will continue this practice and plans to
        streamline the process through the Downtown Plan and Code, discussed below.
7.2.2 - Potential Mixed Use Sites
        The City of West Covina has identified the Downtown, located in the center of the
        City, south of Interstate-10 as a primary focus area for redevelopment and the
        introduction of higher density uses. The Downtown currently includes City Hall, the
        Plaza West Covina shopping center, and a variety of office professional, regional
        commercial, and service commercial uses. Many of the structures pre-date the 1960s
        and are in need of revitalization. The updated West Covina General Plan designates
        the area for high density uses that fall into the Neighborhood Medium and
        Neighborhood High classifications.         Currently, many of the structures in the
        Downtown are single story and maintain large surface parking areas that are rarely
        full, rendering them underutilized. Due to the recent economic down turn many of
        the properties are also experiencing high vacancy rates which has also led to large
        unkempt parking areas.
        The City recognizes that this corridor has great potential to introduce new
        transportation, employment and housing opportunities. Long term the City would like
        to see the area as a multi-modal, mixed use corridor complete with new housing
        and transportation opportunities. To achieve this, the City has begun to approve
116                                                                   2014-2021 Housing Element

        development projects that they feel will serve as catalysts for redevelopment of the
        Downtown. As mentioned previously, in 2011, the City approved a new mixed use
        development in the Downtown that includes 450 units at a density of 75 dwelling
        units per acre. Housing opportunity sites, as identified in the following section, will be
        strategically located near these catalyst sites and at locations that are likely to be
        redeveloped to achieve a successful mixed use corridor within the Downtown.
        To facilitate and encourage the redevelopment of the Downtown the City of West
        Covina has updated the General Plan and drafted a Downtown Plan and Code, to
        be adopted in late 2016. The General Plan and Downtown Plan include land use
        designations and encourage building types that allow densities up to 54 dwelling
        units per acre. To ensure consistency and accommodate the City’s remaining RHNA,
        the City has established development standards for the Downtown that facilitate
        and encourage a variety of housing types.
        The Downtown Plan and Code, developed through a community based process,
        utilizes a form based Transect system to determine what building forms are
        appropriate for infill development. The Plan is structured on the following seven
        concepts:
             1.  Establishing three integrated districts
             2.  A continuous open space network
             3.  Making walkable streets
             4.  An integrated transportation network
             5.  Strategic infill development
             6.  Park once
             7.  Face to the freeway
        The Downtown Code was developed concurrently and is consistent with the revised
        West Covina General Plan, as required by Government Code 650000, et seq.,
        California Statute. The Downtown Code implements the “Downtown First” focus of
        the General Plan and the community supported vision for Downtown District.
        Densities for Downtown parcels are established in the General Plan and
        implemented by the standards in the Downtown Plan and Code. Specifically, the
        Downtown Plan and Code development standards are aimed at generating the
        individual buildings on a block that collectively with other buildings will shape the
        form of the public realm. The standards shape and situate buildings based on their
        physical characteristics and compatibility with the context.
        The successful fit of a new project into an existing context depends on how it relates
        to neighboring buildings to its side and rear in terms of setbacks, height, massing,
        scale, and arrangement of shared and private open spaces. For each zone
        identified on the regulating plan, setback, height, lot size, and parking requirement
        associated with permitted building and frontage types are called out. These
        standards come together to define the distinctive character and intensity of a
        particular zone and are typical regulations imposed by a local jurisdiction. Specific
        development and design standards have been created and projects are subject to
        the same review process as a Precise Plan per Chapter 26-226 - 22-237 (Precise Plan)
        of the West Covina Municipal Code.
City of West Covina                                                                     117

7.2.3 - Calculating Unit Potential
     The City of West Covina determined for the previous planning period, that the
     application of a mixed use overlay would serve as the best approach to meet their
     respective RHNA allocations, while encouraging redevelopment. However, through
     the General Plan update process, the City has established new land use
     designations based on the Transect system and implemented new zoning for the
     Downtown. The City’s land use designations allow for densities up to 54 dwelling units
     per acre. To calculate the realistic capacity of the sites identified in the Housing
     Resources section, the City assumed that sites will be developed as mixed use, 50
     percent residential and 50 percent non-residential and that sites will be built to their
     maximum density. This reflects a conservative estimate that half the site would
     realistically be developed for residential uses and the other half developed for
     commercial or retail uses. In reality, it is likely that more than fifty percent of a site
     would be developed as residential, with a typical project presenting multiple floors of
     residential units over ground floor retail/commercial.
     During the previous planning period the City approved several major multi-family
     projects including a 65 unit development for senior citizens in 2010 and a 450-unit
     multi-family complex in 2011. These projects were developed at 65 and 75 dwelling
     units per acre, respectively. The lack of vacant land in the City has required creative
     redevelopment and infill projects resulting in high density residential projects on
     smaller sites. The City will continue to employ this strategy in order to address their
     remaining RHNA. The City has a proven history of high density development and is
     committed to achieving a range of affordable housing opportunities through the
     Downtown Plan and updated General Plan.
     The following maps identify sites within the City that can potentially accommodate
     new residential development.

Site 1: Garvey Avenue and Interstate-10
Located in the Downtown, south of Interstate-10, Site 1 is comprised of two vacant parcels
totaling 3.7 acres. The site is generally located north of Orange Avenue, west of Garvey
Avenue, Interstate 10 to the north and Cameron Avenue on the west. The site is
predominately surrounded by a mix of commercial, office and business park uses with single
family homes located to the west across Garvey Avenue. Within the updated General Plan
and the Downtown Plan the site is designated as Neighborhood Medium and T4 General
Urban Zone. On the northern parcel is an office professional building constructed in 1980.
Signs outside the building indicate that there are a number of vacancies within the building.
On the southern parcel is an unused paved parking area that was originally created in
1971. The surface parking is lightly used and could be better utilized for higher intensity uses
as allowed by the General Plan and Downtown Plan designation.
122                                                                 2014-2021 Housing Element
Due to its proximity in the Downtown to the Plaza West Covina shopping center, the City
feels that Site 1 is a prime location for mixed use development, including high density
housing. Site 1 is largely underutilized, ripe for redevelopment, and is located in the center
of the City with easy access to transit and Interstate 10. This site is ideal for the development
of affordable and market rate housing based on its proximately to City Hall, the Chamber of
Commerce, a US Post Office, and a number of retail businesses, medical offices, and
service uses. The redevelopment of this site is consistent with the City’s plans to focus higher
intensity mixed uses within the Downtown transportation corridor, preserving the character
of the surrounding suburban neighborhoods. Given the age of the structures and the
increasing vacancy rates in the buildings it is likely that this site could be redeveloped within
the planning period.
Concurrent with Housing Element adoption, the General Plan land use designations and
Downtown Plan zoning will be applied to the site facilitating the development of a mix of
residential and commercial uses. Assuming, conservatively, that fifty percent of the site will
be developed as residential units at a density of 20 dwelling units per acre approximately 38
units can be accommodated on site. It is likely given the proposed density that this site is
appropriate to accommodate a portion of the City’s moderate or above moderate
income RHNA allocation.
To encourage and facilitate the development of affordable housing on Site 1, the City has
the ability to offer potential developers a menu of incentives including: development fee
modifications, fast track processing, density bonus incentives, reductions in development
standards, and funding for off-site improvements, as indicated in the Housing Plan. Funding
for these regulatory and financial incentives will be provided through available CDBG and
HOME funds. The City will also prioritize funding for projects that incorporate units for
extremely low income households. Table 7-2 provides detailed information on the parcels
that are identified as part of Site 1.

Site 2: Cameron Avenue and Orange Avenue
Located in the Downtown, along Cameron Avenue, Site 2 is comprised of 12 parcels
totaling 10.6 acres. Site 2 is loosely bordered by Orange Avenue to the north, Cameron
Avenue on the east, a flood control channel to the south, with single family homes and no
formal boundary on the west. Within the updated General Plan and the Downtown Plan the
site is designated as Neighborhood Medium and T4 General Urban Zone. The site is
surrounded by commercial, office and business park uses with single family homes to the
west. On site there are several existing structures, including a credit union constructed in
1980 and several office buildings developed in 1966. Many of the office suites are currently
vacant and large portions of the site are underutilized as surface parking lots. Based on the
updated General Plan designation and Downtown Plan zoning the site is currently
underutilized and could be developed with higher density uses.
As part of the Downtown the City feels that Site 2 is a prime location for new mixed use
development including high density housing. This site is largely underutilized, ripe for
redevelopment, and is located in the center of the City with easy access to Interstate 10.
This site is ideal for the development of affordable and market rate housing based on its

Site 3: Toluca Avenue and Cameron Avenue
Located in the Downtown in the center of the City, Site 3 includes eight underutilized
parcels totaling 13.6 acres that are ideal for mixed use development. Site 3 is situated west
of Cameron Avenue, south of Toluca Avenue, east of West Covina Parkway, and north of a
flood control channel and Sunset Avenue. The site is primarily surrounded by commercial
and office uses and is designated Neighborhood High within the updated General Plan and
T4 General Urban Zone in the Downtown Plan and Code. Site 3 is currently developed with
commercial and office professional buildings constructed in the early 1960s. The buildings
on site have numerous vacancies and are surrounded by large surface parking lots. The City
would like to see the site redeveloped to accommodate residential uses as well as higher
intensity commercial development.
As part of the Downtown, the City feels that Site 3 is a prime location for new mixed use
development including high density housing. This site is largely underutilized, ripe for
redevelopment, and is located in the center of the City with easy access to transit and
Interstate 10. This site is ideal for the development of affordable and market rate housing
based on its proximately to City Hall, the Chamber of Commerce, a US Post Office, and a
number of retail businesses, medical offices, and service uses. The redevelopment of this site
is consistent with the City’s plans to focus higher intensity mixed uses within the Downtown
transportation corridor, preserving the character of the surrounding suburban

neighborhoods. Given the age of the structures and the increasing vacancy rates in the
buildings it is likely that this site could be redeveloped within the planning period.
Concurrent with Housing Element adoption, the General Plan land use designations and
Downtown Plan zoning will be applied to the site facilitating the development of a mix of
residential and commercial uses. Assuming that fifty percent of the site will be developed
as residential units at a density of 54 dwelling units per acre approximately 366 units can be
accommodated on site. It is likely that given the proposed density that this site is
appropriate to accommodate a portion of the City’s remaining very low or low income
RHNA allocation.
To encourage and facilitate the development of affordable housing on Site 3, the City has
the ability to offer potential developers a menu of incentives including: development fee
modifications, fast track processing, density bonus incentives, reductions in development
standards, and funding for off-site improvements, as indicated in the Housing Plan. Funding
for these regulatory and financial incentives will be provided through available CDBG and
HOME funds. The City will also prioritize funding for projects that incorporate units for
extremely low income households. Table 7-4 provides detailed information on the parcels
that are identified as part of Site 3.

Site 5 is in a prime location for new mixed use development including high density housing
as part of the Downtown. This site is adjacent to the recently approved 450-unit Downtown
catalyst project. The site is also in close proximity to City Hall, the Chamber of Commerce, a
US Post Office, retail businesses, medical offices, and service uses, with easy access to transit
and Interstate 10. As the parcels adjacent to Site 5 are redeveloped the City hopes to
encourage new construction within this opportunity area. The redevelopment of this site is
consistent with the City’s plans to focus higher intensity mixed uses within the Downtown
transportation corridor, preserving the character of the surrounding suburban
neighborhoods. Given the age and condition of the structures and the increasing vacancy
rates in the buildings it is likely that this site could be redeveloped within the planning period.
Concurrent with Housing Element adoption, the new General Plan land use designations
and Downtown Plan zoning will be applied to the site facilitating the development of a mix
of residential and commercial uses. Assuming that fifty percent of the site will be
developed as residential units at a density of 54 dwelling units per acre approximately 158
units can be accommodated on site. It is likely that given the proposed density that this site
is appropriate to accommodate a portion of the City’s remaining very low and low income
RHNA allocation.
To encourage and facilitate the development of affordable housing on Site 5, the City has
the ability to offer potential developers a menu of incentives including: development fee
modifications, fast track processing, density bonus incentives, reductions in development
standards, and funding for off-site improvements, as indicated in the Housing Plan. Funding
for these regulatory and financial incentives will be provided through available CDBG and
HOME funds. The City will also prioritize funding for projects that incorporate units for
extremely low income households. Table 7-6 provides detailed information on the parcels
that are identified as part of Site 5.

7.3 - Summary of Available Sites
As shown in Table 7-9, the City is more than able to accommodate their 2014-2021 RHNA
allocation of 831units. Based on the permitted densities, the seven sites identified within the
Downtown, are more than adequate to accommodate their above moderate, moderate
and lower income RHNA allocations. The seven opportunity sites combined are able to
accommodate 1,094 units at densities ranging between 20 and 54 units per acre, which is
permitted and encouraged through the Downtown Plan and Code. It is possible that sites
may be developed at higher densities through a density bonus incentive. As several of
these sites were previously identified in the 2008-2014 Housing Element, but were not
developed or entitled during the planning period, they remain viable sites for the 2014-2021
planning period.

7.3.1 - Environmental Constraints
Potential environmental constraints to future development of sites identified include the
seismic and liquefaction hazards, which are addressed in the Non-Governmental
Constraints Section of the Housing Element. Locations identified in the Sites Inventory were
compared with all hazards maps included in the City’s Safety Element; none were found to
be within areas that have development restrictions due to risk of damage from disasters
(such as floods, wildfires, or seismic events). The sites inventoried have a land use
designation which was determined based on surrounding land uses and has already
examined potential environmental constraints. Aside from the constraints mentioned
above, there are no additional constraints that would impede the development of new
housing units in the future on the identified sites.
7.3.2 - Infrastructure
The City’s five year Capital Improvement Plan has identified expenditures of City funds used
for public improvement projects, including infrastructure. The City understands that
improvements can be achieved with a comprehensive approach that includes reviewing
infrastructure plans for each application for discretionary approval of General Plan
amendments, tentative parcel or tentative tract maps, or development proposals that
includes extension of an existing street or construction of a new street. The City requires that
project applications for new development be reviewed for adequate infrastructure.
Applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to ensure there is the capacity to
service new developments. Infrastructure requirements and costs are also discussed in the
Non-Governmental Constraints Section of the Housing Element.
7.4 - Housing Resources
7.4.1 - Financial Resources
A variety of Federal, State, and local programs are available to create and/or maintain
rental units and purchase affordability for lower income households and for persons with
special needs. These programs are also available to other jurisdictions for potential
acquisition, subsidy, or replacement of units at-risk. The following summarizes financial
resources available to the City, private, and non-profit parties to preserve/create housing
that is affordable.
A primary source of funding for programs outlined in the Housing Plan was the City’s
Redevelopment Housing Set-Aside Fund. As the State has requested payments from the Set-
Aside Fund, it is no longer a viable source funding for redevelopment and housing
development.
7.4.2 - Administrative Resources
The primary responsibility of the Planning Department is the long-range planning and
physical development of the City to promote livability and appearance. The department
ensures the City's viability through enforcement of land use, construction, health, safety,

and environmental regulations. This involves land use and development standards, building
codes, economic vitality, and adherence to the General Plan. It is also responsible for the
administration of the General Plan and implementation of the Zoning Ordinance and
Specific Plans.

7.5 - Energy Conservation Opportunities
As cities construct more housing to meet growing population demands, the consumption
rate of energy becomes a significant issue. The primary uses of energy in urban areas are for
transportation, lighting, water, heating and space heating and cooling. The high cost of
energy demands that efforts be taken to reduce or minimize the overall level of urban
consumption.
There are many opportunities for conserving energy in new and existing residential units.
Construction of energy efficient buildings does not lower the price of housing. However,
housing with energy conservation features should result in reduced monthly occupancy
costs as consumption of fuel and energy is decreased. Similarly, retrofitting existing
structures with energy conserving features can result in a reduction in utility costs. Examples
of energy conservation opportunities include weatherization programs and home energy
audits; installation of insulation; installation or retrofitting of more efficient appliances, and
mechanical or solar energy systems; and building design and orientation which
incorporates energy conservation considerations. The City enforces all provisions of Title 24
of the California Administrative Code, which provides for energy conservation features in
new residential construction.
Southern California Edison programs: Southern California Edison offers a variety of energy
conservation services under the Low Income Energy Efficiency programs (LIEE), which help
qualified homeowners and renters conserve energy and control electricity costs. Eligible

customers can receive services from local community agencies and licensed contractors
working with Edison. Services include weatherization, efficient lighting and cooling,
refrigerator replacement, and energy education. In addition, Edison participates in the
California Alternative Rates for Energy (CARE) program, which provides a 15% discount
reduction on electric bills for low-income customers and the Family Electric Rate Assistance
Program (FERA) that provides discounts for families with household incomes slightly
exceeding the low-income energy program allowances.
Southern California Gas programs: The Southern California Gas Company offers two direct
assistance programs to limited income customers: (1) a no-cost weatherization (attic
insulation and water heater blankets) and (2) a no-cost furnace repair and replacement
service. The Gas Company also participates in the State LIEE and CARE programs, helping
low-income customers conserve energy and providing them with a discount on their gas
bills.
7.5.1 - Techniques to Conserve
Many modern design methods used to reduce residential energy consumption are based
on proven techniques that have been known to humans since the earliest days of
collective settlement. These methods can be categorized in three ways:
        1. Building design that keeps natural heat in during the winter and out in the
           summer. Designs aim to reduce air conditioning and heating demands. Proven
           building techniques in this category include:
            Orienting windows and openings of a building to follow the path of the sun, in
                order to minimize solar gain in the summer and maximize solar gain in the
                winter;
               Utilizing “thermal mass,” earthen materials such as stone, brick, concrete, and
                tiles that absorb heat during the day and release heat at night;
               “Burying” sections of the structure in a hillside or berm to insulate the home
                against extremes of temperature;
               Application of window coverings, insulation, and other materials to reduce
                heat exchange between the interior and the exterior of the home;
               Strategic placement of openings and the use of ventilating devices that take
                advantage of natural air flow (particularly cool evening breezes); and
               Designing eaves and overhangs above windows to block direct summer solar
                gain during the summer, but allow for solar gain during the winter.
        2. Building orientation that allows natural elements to maintain a comfortable
           interior temperature. Examples include:
               Orienting the long axis of a building in a north-south position;
               Minimizing the southern and western exposure of exterior surfaces; and
               Designing the structure to admit the maximum amount of sunlight into the
                building and to reduce exposure to extreme weather conditions;
144                                                                   2014-2021 Housing Element

                Positioning dwellings to take advantage of natural air circulation and evening
                 breezes.
        3. Use of landscaping features to moderate interior temperatures. Such techniques
             include:
                Planting of deciduous shade trees and other plants to protect the home;
                Design including natural or artificial flowing water; and
                Strategic placement of trees and hedges as windbreaks.
In addition to natural techniques that have been used historically, a number of modern
energy conversion methods have been developed and advanced in more recent years.
These include:
                Implementation of solar panels and other devices to generate electricity;
                Application of solar energy to heat water;
                Employment of window glazing to repel summer heat and trap winter
                 warmth;
                Use of weather-stripping and other insulating devices to reduce heat gain
                 and loss; and
                Acquire energy efficient home appliances.
7.5.2 - State Building Code Standards
        The California Energy Commission was created in 1974 by the Warren-Alquist State
        Energy Resources Conservation and Development Act. Upon its creation the first task
        of the Commission was to adopt energy conservation standards for new
        construction. The first set of residential energy conservation standards were
        developed in the late 1970s (Title 24, Part 6 of the California Code of Regulations)
        and have been periodically revised in the years following. West Covina currently
        utilizes Tier 1 of the California Green Building Code and has not adopted any local
        amendments to the building standards.
        A focus of the Commission’s energy conservation standards is the definition of
        “climate zones”. These zones were created to allow for flexible approaches to
        energy conservation that can be tailored to different geographic regions of the
        State. The City of West Covina is located in Climate Zone 10, which covers the semi-
        arid inland valleys. This climate zone is characterized by a mild winters, hot summers,
        desert winds, and abundant sunshine.
        Because of these climate conditions, a substantial percentage of residential energy
        use goes to space cooling between the months of May and October. Residential
        site design and construction techniques that can reduce the amount of energy used
        for space cooling would significantly reduce overall energy demand. As discussed
        above, a number of traditional and modern techniques can decrease energy
        throughout the City.

  The Progress Report reviews the previous Housing Element’s programs, objectives, and
  actions that were to be implemented during the previous planning period. The City of West
  Covina’s Housing Element identified five goals that the City anticipated to implement
  during the previous planning period. Each goal has specific policies that were to be
  achieved in order to facilitate the construction of affordable housing and to maintain the
  existing affordable housing stock. The City also established a set of objectives with
  corresponding goals to further improve housing opportunities throughout the City. Each of
  the actions and objectives had a timeframe for completion along with a responsible
  agency to monitor the program.
  The action is listed on the right column of the table and displays the quantified or qualified
  objective and the result of the program. Lastly, the action is evaluated on its effectiveness,
  and whether or not the program should continue to be implemented, modified, or
  removed. Section 65588 of the State Housing law requires that all local governments initiate
  a timely review of their housing element to evaluate all of the following:
         The appropriateness of the housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing to
          the attainment of the State’s housing goal;
         The effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the community's housing
          goals and objectives; and,
         The progress of the City in the implementation of the Housing Element.

                                       Progress and Effectiveness: The Housing Preservation Program
                                       (HPP) for moderate income households provides residents with
                                       small loans of up to $10,000 using Redevelopment Set-Aside funds
                                       for the rehabilitation of owner-occupied residences. From 2006
                                       through 2011, the City provided assistance to approximately 62
                                       households. The City provided the following amounts of funding
                                       for each fiscal year:
                                                    FY 2005-06: $107,315

annually and advertise the program     In FY 2011-2012, the City placed the program on hold, in response
on the City’s website and periodically to ABx1 26 and ABx1 27 legislation. In 2012 the City was forced to
in the City’s newsletter.              dissolve their Redevelopment Agency, leaving the HPP without a
                                       permanent funding source. The City still provides information on
                                       the City website, but is not currently accepting applications. The
                                       City was able to achieve their objectives.
                                       Appropriateness: While this program will be included in the 2014-

                                     Progress and Effectiveness: During the previous planning period,
                                     the City adopted Ordinance 2239 on November 20, 2012, which
                                     amended the General Plan and Zoning Code to implement the
                                     Mixed Use Overlay zone. The Mixed Use Overlay zone is intended
                                     to allow for a mixture of residential and commercial land uses at
                                     densities up to 75 dwelling units per acre. Per Ordinance 2240
                                     adopted on December 4, 2012, the City also rezoned
                                     approximately 250 acres in the Central Business District to
                                     accommodate their 2008-2014 RHNA and AB 1233 carryover from
                                     the 2000-2005 planning period. Specifically, to accommodate
                                     their combined RHNA allocation, the City identified 8 sites to be

   West Covina and its water providers are providing leadership
   in water conservation. Some of the measures include:
   •	 Installing “smart” water regulators to prevent sprinkler
         systems from watering parks when weather conditions
         do not require irrigation;
   •	 Replacing grass with drought-tolerant plants;
   •	 On-site recycling of water for Splash Pads in public
         parks;
   •	 Recycling municipal waste water for irrigation;
   •	 Limited irrigation schedule (3-days a week);
   •	 Low water use landscape education;
   •	 Water efficiency audits; and
   •	 Rebates for efficient fixtures like high efficiency toilets.

             Our goal is to direct new growth to the downtown
             area where development pressures are the greatest
             and change is desired, while protecting the stable
             residential areas; target housing and job growth in
             strategic areas along the corridor; and encourage
             pedestrian-oriented mixed-use development, while
             providing vibrant public gathering places.

44 West Covina General Plan

B. Planning Designations and Transect Zones
West Covina includes many different kinds of places, with
very different characters. Character is the overall pattern of
land uses and intensities, ranging from natural, undisturbed
areas, to suburban neighborhoods and shopping centers,
to urban neighborhoods, to downtown. Accommodating
new housing, services, and jobs, and improving health and
livability requires either designed changes to match the
character of the area or carefully and intentionally changing
the character of key locations.
   By acknowledging these different character areas, we can
create land use policies, zoning, subdivisions, and other
development tools to preserve the diverse character of West
Covina.
   The Transect is a system of natural-to-urban transect
zones or ‘human habitats’. The transect zone in this General
Plan is noted with its equivalent land use designation. This
system provides a simple but powerful framework to allow
a community to describe with precision, a broad but con-
tinuous range of environments for human habitation and
activity. These transect categories reflect how intensely land
is used, how buildings relate to streets and open space, and
how neighborhoods are laid out. All aspects of development
and design—such as the placement and scale of buildings,
the type of streets, presence and width of sidewalks, light-
ing, parks, and landscaping—should reinforce the character
of the area. The form and character of the different human
habitats is conceived as a geography of diverse place types
such as neighborhoods, districts, and corridors. West Covina
is a built out city that does not have rural areas (T-2 zone).
Special Districts (SD) are areas in West Covina that usually
should not be regulated by normative Transect Zoning
because of their special purpose or large size. Example of
special districts are hospital campus and BKK.

and maintained, and areas where redevelopment is likely to  to implement the community vision for areas of change.

                                        The basic organizing place types for areas designated for growth are neigh-
                                        borhoods, districts and corridors. Listed below are place types recom-
                                        mended for moderate infill, redevelopment, or infrastructure improvements.
                                        Majority of the new growth will be directed to the downtown areas and the
                                        corridors. The level of change ranges from reinvestment in existing buildings
                                        and minor improvements to utility infrastructure and the public realm, to
                                        the occasional infill development that completes the prevalent development
                                        pattern. In some instances, addition of new streets may be necessary to
                                        break the large scale super-blocks into pedestrian oriented blocks, or com-

                                               Districts consist of streets or areas emphasizing specific types of
                                               activities and exhibiting distinct characteristics. A neighborhood
                                               or parts of neighborhoods can form a district. The following four
                                               districts are depicted on the General Plan Diagram:

                                                       neighborhoods. The integration of the 3 neighborhoods will
                                                       be through a continuous open space network of streets, side-
                                                       walks, crosswalks, greens and plazas. The diversity, quality
   Rendering of Sunset Avenue, Downtown                and richness of these open spaces taken together creates the
                                                       public realm that links the three neighborhoods and encour-
                                                       ages walking from one to the other through verdant and
                                                       beautifully designed spaces. The Plan identifies a number of
                                                       underperforming land parcels, as well as other opportunities
                                                       for new urban infill. This new development will bring a range
                                                       of new uses into the Downtown, while physically completing
                                                       street faces and marking important street intersections.
                                               B       Eastland
                                                       Eastland Center is a multi-tenant retail power center which
   Eastland Center                                     includes a collection of large format retail stores including a
                                                       grocery store. The buildings are surrounded by parking lots
                                                       and outparcels with drive-through establishments. The retail
                                                       center lacks variety of building types (and therefore uses) and
                                                       lack of walkable block structure. Replacing surface parking
                                                       with structured parking would free-up land for office or hotel
                                                       use and a civic space for gathering, events, and outdoor
                                                       seating.

                                                       The West Covina Auto Plaza is a cluster of new and used car
                                                       dealerships located at the intersection of I-10 and Azusa
   Auto Plaza                                          Avenue. Many of the dealerships are located adjacent to res-
                                                       idential neighborhoods. Outdoor operations should provide
                                                       adequate screen and buffer from the residential areas. The
                                                       auto mall occupies highly visible gateway sites and therefore
                                                       offer opportunity for gateway enhancements with artwork,
                                                       signs, lighting, and landscaping.

50 West Covina General Plan
2 Corridors
  Corridors, which can be natural or urban, often form boundaries,
  as well as connections, between neighborhoods and/or districts.
  Natural corridors can be those such as drainage channels or green
  parkways. Urban corridors can be transportation thoroughfares
  that frequently encompass major access routes, especially ones with
  commercial destinations, including transit routes. The following
  three urban corridors are depicted on the General Plan Diagram.
  Each has the potential to evolve into a vibrant mixed-use City street
  with a distinct character borrowed from the neighborhoods that
  share it:
  A      North Azusa Avenue
         Azusa Avenue is the primary north-south corridor that extends
         from the San Gabriel mountains to the north to Powder
         Canyon on the south side.
         The character and intensity of development north and south
         of the I-10 freeway are different. North Azusa is more continu-
         ous urban corridor than South Azusa which is more sub-urban
         with commercial uses concentrated at few key intersections.
                                                                           Retail on North Azusa Avenue
         The corridor consists of mostly car-oriented retail uses, shop-
         ping centers, big boxes, drive-through restaurants, and apart-
         ments. The corridor lacks a consistent walkable structure and
         streetscape design. The street is wide, sidewalks are narrow,
         street trees are missing, on-street parking is sparse, median
         landscaping is inconsistent, many buildings with their large
         parking areas fail to physically define the street. The street is
         not interesting, comfortable, or safe for pedestrians.
         Some of the apartment and retail buildings are located closer
         to the street with parking in the back. However, many retail
         and shopping centers are located behind huge parking areas        Retail on North Azusa Avenue
         which damage the street fabric of North Azusa Avenue.
         A continuous alley serving frontage parcels would allow park-
         ing, access, and service in the rear while eliminating driveways
         along Azusa Avenue.
         Corridor’s retail locations should be focused around transit
         stops rather than diluted along the corridor. Some of the
         underperforming retail could be transformed to multi-family
         residential or office uses.
         The Pioneer Adult center is a large underutilized site on         Retail on North Azusa Avenue
         Rowland Avenue. This site, if redeveloped offers the best
         opportunity for a small park. Redevelopment should provide
         a contextual response to adjacent single-family residences.
         Surface parking areas could be replaced with new fabric infill
         development providing a more engaging street’s edge. A Corri-
         dor Plan and Code should be developed to provide a unifying
         vision and precise and clear standards for development of
         public and private realm.
                                                                           Apartments on North Azusa Avenue
                                                                                            Our Well Planned Community 51

                                              B Glendora Avenue
                                                This arterial has a mix of large ethnic retail center, large format
                                                neighborhood serving retail uses, small shopping strips, and
                                                a range of auto oriented uses such as gas stations, auto sales,
                                                and auto repair facilities. Segments of the corridor also have
                                                single and multi-family residential uses. The corridor lacks a
                                                consistent streetscape design. Corridor buildings with their
                                                large parking areas fail to physically define the street or pro-
                                                vide a safe, comfortable, and interested walking experience
                                                for pedestrians.
   Retail on Glendora Avenue                       The frontage parcels along the corridor back up to residen-
                                                tial neighborhood. Smaller scale infill redevelopment along
                                                the corridor would be contextual to the adjacent single-family
                                                residential scale. Some of the aging and underperforming
                                                retail uses may need to be renovated or repositioned to
                                                remain competitive. A Corridor Plan and Code should be
                                                developed to provide a unifying vision and precise and clear
                                                standards for development of public and private realm.
                                              C Sunset Avenue
                                                The Sunset Avenue Corridor is anchored by Queen of the
                                                Valley hospital campus and supporting medical uses. Besides
   Retail on Glendora Avenue                    meeting the community’s health needs, the hospital provides
                                                high-wage high-value jobs. Sunset Avenue has the potential
                                                to become a dynamic corridor with growth opportunities for
                                                research, medical, and bioscience interests. A Corridor Plan
                                                and Code should be developed to provide a unifying vision
                                                and precise and clear standards that accommodates hospi-

                                                residential areas.
                                              D Valley Boulevard
                                                Valley Boulevard is a high speed corridor that serves as the
                                                southern entrance into West Covina. Valley Boulevard and
   Medical offices on Sunset Avenue             the gateway sites should be designed to create a cohesive
                                                identity and reflect the desired City image. Gateways can
                                                include architecturally significant buildings, infrastructure and

52 West Covina General Plan

3 Neighborhood Centers
  Community evolves from individual conversations and the best
  places to grow community are in individual neighborhoods. Every
  neighborhood should have at least one center where people can
  meet by chance at a local coffee shop, market, bookstore, diner, or
  even hardware store. West Covina’s existing neighborhood centers
  have the opportunity to become such places. The General Plan Dia-
  gram identifies four neighborhood centers – where the development
  of housing alongside commercial uses is specifically encouraged.
  These centers include:
  A     Puente Avenue
        The blocks on either side of Puente Street, between Yaleton
        Avenue and Sunset Avenue have a unusual mix of uses that
        include churches, fire station, liquor store, auto repair facility,
        and multi-family residences. The area around this block is
        predominantly single-family residential.
  B     Aroma Drive and Azusa Avenue
        This intersection has ethnic and convenience retail, office,
        and multi- and single family residential uses. Aroma Drive
        leads to Galster Park. The area has the potential to become a
        mixed-use walkable center for the surrounding neighborhood.         Retail on Puente Avenue
        As sites redevelop, urban infill development with rich public
        realm can further reinforce the significance of the area as a
        center in this neighborhood.
  C     Amar Road and Azusa Avenue
        Both streets are busy arterials and highly used transit routes
        located on the south side of the City. The intersection has a
        large concentration of shopping centers surrounded by higher
        density residential areas. The wide streets with multiple left
        turn lanes and no median makes pedestrian crossing difficult.
        Despite more land being dedicated for surface parking than
        buildings, parking is one of the leading concerns at these
        shopping centers. A parking study should be prepared to ana-        Retail on Amar Road and Azusa Avenue
        lyze parking supply and demand, implement parking policies
        and operational programs, and develop the best local solution
        for the shopping centers. The shopping centers lack a gather-
        ing place where people can stay and spend more time at these
        centers.
           By adding buildings in the commercial core that accommo-
        date office, housing, and civic space, this area can become a
        mixed-use, walkable neighborhood center. A new civic space
        (public square) can improve the awkward traffic flow within
        the shopping center, create a landmark, and a sense of arrival.
           The four corners has the largest collection of Filipino busi-
        nesses in San Gabriel Valley. The distinctive social, commer-
        cial, and ritual activities of Filipino culture can interact here   Retail on South Azusa Avenue
        with the built environment to create and sustain a sense of
        place, foster community identity, and structure social rela-
        tions. Branding this place would recognize the contributions
        of the ethnic businesses; support cultural diversity; and attract
        tourists, a creative workforce, and international investors.

                            E. Housing
                            The availability and production of housing are critical to the social and eco-
                            nomic security and vitality of West Covina and its residents. In recent policy
                            announcements, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
                            (HUD), the State of California and the Southern California Association of
                            Governments (SCAG) have all recognized that planning for housing should
                            be done in conjunction with sustainably-directed regional transportation
                            planning in order to link jobs, housing and other activities through regional
                            transportation systems. This integration is essential to address environmen-
                            tal issues and the social impacts of traffic congestion and implements the
                            General Plan’s Our Well Planned and Our Accessible Community elements.
                            New infill housing is envisioned to be located along major transit corridors,
                            in mixed use developments and within the Downtown providing employ-
                            ment opportunities, shopping, and amenities within walking distance, with
                            particular priority given to providing housing that is affordable to a wide
                            spectrum of households to promote economic, social and cultural diversity.
                               For the 2014-2021 planning period, West Covina’s Housing Element builds
                            upon the achievements of the previous Housing Element, certified in 2008,
                            serving a blueprint for the community to address broad-based, long-range
                            housing needs. The West Covina Housing Element maintains the focus on
                            infill development, complies with all State mandates and is consistent with
                            the overall General Plan.
                               The 2014-2021 Housing Element is influenced by the complex challenges
                            cities currently face in their attempts to create and retain affordable housing.
                            With the economic boom that occurred at the turn of the century, market
                            forces and deregulation of rental vacancies had a significant effect on hous-
                            ing affordability which has have heavily impacted the ability of many work-
                            ing class households in West Covina to find local housing. While this trend
                            was slightly reversed by the 2008 recession, the City has generally experi-
                            enced a rebound and steady upward climb in market-rate rents since 2012,
                            once again decreasing affordability for lower and middle-income house-
                            holds. Generally, the housing market in West Covina has proven to be fairly
                            resilient and home ownership is still elusive for many working class families.
                               West Covina’s challenge to address the housing needs of the community
                            is compounded by the State’s elimination of redevelopment agencies in
                            2011. The West Covina Redevelopment Agency (RDA) had provided a steady
                            income that funded housing assistance programs and maintained the afford-
                            ability of deed-restricted housing units throughout the City. Moving forward,
                            new funding sources will need to be identified to maintain and develop a
                            range of affordable housing stock. Providing a range of housing opportuni-
                            ties at all affordability levels has been and continues to be a core value and
                            priority goal for the City of West Covina, as reflected in the programs of this
                            Housing Element.
                               The General Plan Land Use Plan sets forth a 20-year vision to preserve the
                            character and quality of existing neighborhoods and encourage new housing
                            in the Downtown close to services, jobs, and conveniences. The Land Use
                            Plan is closely tied to the Downtown Plan and Code, which is focused on
                            attracting and retaining talent and jobs while creating a vibrant place to live.
                               Based on extensive community participation and input, the General Plan
                            and the Downtown Plan and Code presents policies and clear and precise
                            regulations that encourage new housing to be provided in walkable mixed-

4. Our Accessible Community
            Our goal is to provides safe access for all users—
            pedestrians, cyclists, public transit users, and
            motorists—of all ages and abilities. Design streets
            that consider both the existing and future context
            of transportation and land use and seek to be in
            harmony with the adjacent area’s history, environ-
            mental resources, and overall aesthetic.
            Accessible places offer choices to
            drive, walk, bike or take transit
            to the destination.
            Safe, convenient and comfortable circu-
            lation and access is fundamental to the
            long-term livability and economic viability
            of the City of West Covina. Over the past few
            decades, the City’s major roadways have
            been developed with a singular focus on the
            facilitation of smoothly flowing automobile
            traffic, to the exclusion of all other needs.

                   Typical cross-sections of each major street in the Down-
                town area, including numbers of general-purpose lanes in
                each direction plus left-turn lanes, parking lanes and bicy-
                cle lanes (where each exists), are shown in Table 4.3. Note
                that landscaped medians, right-turn lanes and sidewalks
                are not shown. Note also that because left-turn lanes are on
                opposite sides of intersections, aligned with one another, the
                total number of lanes on a street with two general-purpose
                lanes and a left-turn lane in each direction (to take the most              Glendora Avenue
                common example) is five, not six.
                   Finally, Table 4.4 shows bi-directional Average Daily Traffic
                (ADT) on street segments.
                   In most cases, these volumes result in a volume-to-capacity
                or V/C ratio of less than 1.0. A street with two general-purpose
                lanes and a left-turn lane in each direction should be able to
                accommodate ADT of 25,000 or more, depending on factors
                including intersection configuration and level of service
                standards. Most such street segments in the Downtown area,                  Toluca Avenue
                however, have ADT below 25,000, and many have volumes                        Street           Segment              ADT

                                                    segments do not. The intersection of Citrus and Workman,
                                                    meanwhile, appears to have excess capacity. Further study on

                                                    Key findings related to existing roadway conditions are as
                                                    follows:
                                                    1.	 Few arterial streets in the Downtown Area currently
                                                          satisfy the City’s street design standards for minimum
                                                          right-of-way and curb-to-curb dimension.
                                                    2.	 However, many of these same streets are over-built rela-
                                                          tive to current traffic volumes (as are parts of key streets
                                                          outside of downtown).
                                                    3.	 Taken together, these findings suggest that:
                                                          •	Some streets should be reclassified, standards should
                                                            be adjusted, or both; and
                                                          •	Because some streets could likely be reconfigured
                                                            with little impact on traffic congestion, reconfiguration
                                                            should be considered.

Figure 4-2 Existing Transit Routes (Downtown)
2                   Transit
                    Existing public transit service in West Covina is provided by Foothill
                    Transit and by the City of West Covina, operating as Go West. Foot-
                    hill Transit is the regional bus service provider for the eastern San
                    Gabriel Valley. The Go West system, meanwhile, consists of three
                    shuttle routes, labeled Red, Blue and Green.
                       Transit service is concentrated in the Downtown area, where
                    Foothill Transit operates a total of eight routes, including one Bus
                    Rapid Transit or BRT service (Silver Streak), six local routes (178, 185,
                    272, 281, 480, 488) and an express service (498). Go West’s Red and
                    Blue routes, meanwhile, also serve the area. The alignments of these
                    routes are shown in Figure 4.2.
                       As Figure 4.2 indicates, eight of the 10 routes operating in the
                    Downtown area overlap on West Covina Parkway between Vincent
                    and Sunset.
                       Outside of downtown, Foothill operates routes on Azusa Avenue
                    (280), Amar Road (486) and La Puente Road and Nogales Street (289),
                    as well as two additional routes connecting to the Eastland Center
                    retail area in the eastern end of the city (284, 851). Go West’s Green
                    route operates in this area, as does Foothill Transit Route 190.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Our Accessible Community                           63

                                           Notably, both Silver Streak and Route 498 provide frequent service
                                        during peak periods to Downtown Los Angeles. Each also operates
                                        on Interstate 10 (I-10) and makes a limited number of stops. Addi-
                                        tionally, Silver Streak operates relatively frequently during off-peak
                                        periods, and operates at all times.
                                           Figure 4.3 shows average weekday numbers of boardings at stops
                                        throughout the Foothill Transit system. As the figure indicates, stops
                                        on West Covina Parkway at California are among the busiest in the
                                        system, with a combined total of 2,091 daily boardings and alight-
                                        ings on all routes. Each of these stops provides limited shelter and
                                        seating. Eastland Center is also a relatively busy location, as is the
                                        major transfer point of Amar and Azusa Ave.

          Sidewalk specifications are addressed in a separate section of the Municipal Code, Sec. 19-29. Sidewalk widths are
          associated with land uses, with four- to five-foot sidewalks required in residential areas and “full width” sidewalks
          in commercial areas. “Full width” sidewalks are defined as extending from the property line to the curbline. Specific
          standards for arterials require rights-of-way 20 feet wider than the minimum distance between exterior curbs; side-
          walk widths along commercial arterials, then, may be up to 10 feet.
             As described in Transportation Context section of this document, the City’s existing street classifications are based
          on the FHWA Highway Functional Classification System. In order to ensure that the City remains eligible for Federal
          funds requiring FHWA classification, existing classification terminology should continue to be used in grant applica-
          tions. However, alternative street classifications are recommended for local, internal usage.

74 West Covina General Plan

     The proposed classifications for local use would explicit taking into account both function and adjacent land use
  context, as well as non-auto users of the street. Specific standards for these classifications would address elements
  of roadway design (e.g., numbers of continuous travel lanes) rather than dimensions, but would address sidewalk
  dimensions in all cases, requiring amendments to Sec. 19-29 (roadway widths would be determined on a case-by-
  case basis by the city engineer, based on lane-width and other standards). They would also specify design speeds
  (as part of this recommendation, Sec. 19-193(d) of the Municipal Code, General Street Standards, would need to be
  amended to reflect these speeds).
     Based on analysis of existing roadway classifications, configurations, traffic volumes and adjacent land uses, the
  classifications and specific standards shown in Table 4.11 are proposed. Note that each classification is designed to
  directly replace/supplement an existing classification, shown in the right-hand column. Classifications that are not
  shown in Table 4.11 (Private Streets and Special Street Design District) would be unchanged.
     Note that other cities including Charlotte, North California, and in California Pasadena and San Mateo have
  adopted or are in the process of adopting alternative street classifications.
     Additionally, modal overlays are recommended that could be applied to street segments on a case-by-case basis
  based on transportation priorities for that segment, and in order to provide guidance in redesign and reallocation of
  the right-of-way. As part of this recommendation, these have been assigned to only a few street segments, as shown.
  Modal priorities for other street segments should be determined as part of future planning processes.

     Figure 4.6 Proposed Classifications for Existing Collectors and Arterials
              Proposed classifications for existing Collectors and Arterials are shown in Figure 4.6.
              As was previously noted, each proposed new classification is designed to directly replace an existing classification,
           and existing classifications could continue to be used in grant applications. For these reasons, these changes may be
           viewed as relatively minor. However, there are good reasons to replace the existing system, which dates to 1968:
           1.	 The existing standards for arterial width are unrealistic. Many existing streets do not meet the standards, and
                could not meet them without major impacts on adjoining properties. The proposed new standards, by contrast,
                reflect existing configurations, which have generally proven more than adequate to accommodate existing traffic
                volumes (in many cases, there is significant excess capacity).
           2.	 Even if the new standards have limited impact on the actual design of streets, it is important as a matter of policy
                to adopt standards acknowledging that streets are not just for the movement of vehicles. The new standards,
                including the modal overlays, acknowledge that streets are used not just by motorists, but by transit passengers,
                pedestrians and cyclists. They also take into account the role of streets as a public realm both influenced by and
                influencing adjacent private properties, and in particular the important role sidewalks play in serving as an inter-
                face between the public and private realms.

 2      Transportation System Metrics
        It is recommended that the City establish a strategy for monitoring and measuring how well it implements and main-
        tains General Plan policies, projects and programs, based on a set of indicators or targets. Recommended metrics are
        shown in Tables 4.13, 4.14, and 4.15. These metrics include: citywide measures; corridor-level measures to be used
        in evaluating “before and after” project performance; and development-related measures, also for use in evaluating
        projects.

                                                    2 Support Systems
                                                      The existing support systems rely heavily on non-renewable resource
                                                      based systems that are resistant to modification over time. These
                                                      systems generate waste and harmful byproducts, and are built for
                                                      obsolescence or replacement.
                                                      Transportation — Conveyance of people, goods, and services relies
                                                      primarily on the use of motor vehicles which directly and indirectly
                                                      causes air pollution, destruction of cultural and natural resources,

                                                      programs and incentives for residents and business community to
                                                      reduce energy consumption. In 2014, the City unveiled its new Go
                                                      West Transit fleet. The fleet includes seven new alternative fuel,
                                                      environmentally-friendly vehicles, that are utilized for both the City’s
                                                      fixed-route shuttle service and the dial-a-ride service.
                                                         The commercial, residential, and transportation sector still relies
                                                      heavily on non-renewable sources. The City should explore oppor-

   Go West Transit fleet uses alternative fuel           The California Green Building Code has provisions requiring that
                                                      extra support systems be in place for future EV charging areas in

                                                      require City-owned facilities to provide EV charging stations.
                                                         The cost to retrofit existing street lights with LED lamps is approx-
                                                      imately $5 million, which makes it cost-prohibitive at present time.
                                                      As the economy recovers and funding becomes available (through
                                                      grants or bond proceeds), the City should explore energy efficiency
                                                      projects such as installing solar panels for City facilities and retrofit-

                                                         The City has adopted the 2013 Edition of the California Building
                                                      Code. Part of the code series is the 2013 California Green Building

   Center                                                In 2012, West Covina was recognized as the first city to reach
                                                      platinum-level status in Southern California Edison’s Energy Leader
                                                      Partnership Program. The program encourages local governments to
                                                      perform energy efficiency retrofits in municipal facilities. Platinum
                                                      status is achieved when city facilities achieve a 20 percent or greater
                                                      reduction of kilowatt-hours. West Covina’s achievements include
                                                      more than 92 million kilowatt-hours of energy savings, or more than
                                                      $235,000 in energy costs.

              safe and healthy lifestyles and maximize the oppor-

              good programming can draw people out of their
              homes and into their community.

            us to connect with our families and with our communities.”

A Active Living
  People who lack access to walkable streets, safe parks, and recreational amenities are
  less likely to carry out recommended levels of physical activity, leaving them at greater
  risk for overweight, obesity, and related diseases like type II diabetes. Many City streets
  are difficult and dangerous for pedestrians to cross and thus discourage physical activ-
  ity. The auto-centric pattern of development has created areas that are unattractive
  and unpleasant for walking. Streetscapes in various parts of the City are not inviting
  to pedestrian activity. Residents’ ability to bicycle, and exercise for recreation is also
  limited by a relative lack of a cohesive bicycle network.
  •	 Proximity to parks, open space, recreation facilities: Most neighborhoods in West
        Covina have access to open space within a quarter mile radius or a 5 minute walk.
        On a survey taken of West Covina residents, the percentage of children whose
        primary caretaker reported easy access to a park was 90.1%.
  •	 Overall level of physical activity: In SPA 3, the percentage of adults who reported
        to getting the recommended minimum of 150 minutes of cardiovascular physical
        activity each week was 58.4%, while only 12.7% reported inactivity. Alternatively,
        only 21.5% of children (ages 6-17) were reported to get the recommended physical
        activity of 60 minutes per day and 15% reported inactivity.
  •	 Intensity and Proximity of land-uses: The existing dispersed and auto-centric
        development and circulation pattern in West Covina requires driving for daily
        needs and discourage walking and biking.
B Mental Health and Social Capital
  Mental health is a growing public health concern. In the Service Planning Area, 19.2%
  residents have been diagnosed with depression and 9.3% have been diagnosed with
  anxiety. Mental illness often has chronic effects that have lasting negative impacts on
  an individuals’ quality of life at home, work, school, and in social settings.
     Social capital is a potent antidote to mental illness. Social capital is a resource that
  people can access through their connections to a social group.
     Built environment can increase social capital by providing shared space & oppor-
  tunities for formal & informal social interactions & community engagement. Physical
  spaces such as parks and comfortable walking environments, community groups and
  their programs that allow opportunities to socialize with neighbors, friends, and family
  strengthens the network of relationships diminishing risk factors such as social isola-
  tion and childhood trauma.
     Walking alleviates mental fatigue and restores a person’s ability to pay attention.
  Children walking to school learn more about their local environment, who their neigh-
  bors are and make friends as they chat to other children on the way to school. Places
  that encourage walking can both prevent and treat depression.
     Safe housing and stable income reduce adversity and increase a sense of security.
C Nutrition and Access to Healthy Food
  Access to fresh and nutritious food from supermarket, farmers’ market, produce
  vendor, or corner store is essential to consuming a balanced diet and reducing the
  prevalence of chronic diseases including obesity and heart disease; the latter of which
  highly affects West Covina.
  •	 Access to fresh fruits and vegetables: While 84.2 % caretakers of children (ages
        0-17) rated access to fresh fruits and vegetables to be good or excellent, 36.9% of
        children consume a sweetened drink per day and 49.1% consume fast food at least
        once a week.
  •	 Obesity rates: The child obesity rate is 21.4% On the other hand, only 14% of adults
        eat the suggested 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day, 51.8% drink alcohol
        (8.2% reported binge drinking), and 11.3% of the city smokes cigarettes. Almost
        20% of adults reported fair or poor health and 26.1% are obese. There is a 29.4%
        prevalence of obesity in the Hispanic population.
                                                                                              Our Healthy and Safe Community 89

     a.	  Since different types of activities appear to be associated with different levels, identification of a maximum level for activity interference may be dif-
          ficult except in those circumstances where speech communication is a critical activity. (See Figure D-2 for noise levels as a function of distance which
          allow satisfactory communication.)
     b.	  Based on lowest level.
     c.	  Based only on hearing loss.
     d.	  An Leq(8) of 75 dB may be identified in these situations so long as the exposure over the remaining 16 hours per day is low enough to result in a negli-
          gible contribution to the 24-hour average, i.e., no greater than an Leq of 60 dB.
     Note: Explanation of identified level for hearing loss: The exposure period which results in hearing loss at the identified level is a period of 40 years.

7. Our Creative Community
             Our goal is to become a vibrant cultural center by
             weaving the arts and local heritage into everyday
             life.
 Applied                 Theatre
             There is growing recognition of the impor-
             tance of creativity, culture and quality of
             place in growing local economies. Enhanc-
             ing quality of place and creating attractive
             amenities can draw talented people, which
             in turn attracts business investment in an    Music
             emerging creative economy characterized
             by higher paying, year-round jobs. Cultural
             resources and experiences also attract visi-
             tors and help grow tourism, an increasingly
             important component of economic develop-
             ment strategies in all communities.

      A. Cultural Mapping
                           Our Creative Community
          Cultural mapping is a systematic approach to identifying and recording West Covina’s tangible and intangible cultural
          resources. The resulting cultural categories and map marks the beginning, not the end of cultural mapping in West
          Covina. Cultural mapping must be understood as an ongoing process that progressively broadens and deepens infor-
          mation on cultural resources in West Covina over time.

C. Driving Forces
1. Creative Economy. The fundamental shift in the regional
economy away from manufacturing and resource-based
industries to a creative economy driven by knowledge and
innovation. Creative industries and occupations encompass
sectors such as science and medicine, financial services,
information and culture, and engineering, among others.
Creative skills and ideas that introduce new processes or
systems and create new products in any industries. Urban
cultural amenities is a key factor for West Covina’s loss of
younger population. Cultural activities will retain and attract
a talented labor pool that is critical component of vibrant
economy.

Part 2
8. Our Active Community
             Our goal is to enhance the value of fitness and cele-
             brate healthy living; improve the existing condition
             of public open spaces and facilities to encourage
             use; and acquire, develop, and maintain quality of
             public open spaces and trails. .
             A. Trends
             1.	 Sedentary Lifestyle: Our lifestyle involves spending more time indoors engaged in
                 sedentary activities. With no or irregular physical activity, this pattern can contribute to
                 many preventable diseases and disabilities and is a leading cause of premature death.
                 The Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics reports that play is essential to
                 the social, emotional, cognitive and physical well-being of children.Encouraging chil-
                 dren and young people to give up even 30 minutes of daily small-screen recreation in
                 exchange for physical activity can make a genuine difference to their physical and mental
                 health, and well-being. Through informal play and shared experiences with peers, open
                 spaces inspire children to explore, discover, learn and become better stewards of the
                 natural environment.
             2.	 Exceptional Drought: Southern California is enduring its worst drought on record.
                 Drought impacts planning, design, construction, maintenance and operations of open
                 spaces. West Covina is providing leadership in pursuing reducing water consumption.
                 Some of the measures include:
                 •	 Removing water thirsty grass with drought-tolerant plants; and
                 •	 Relying on recycled water. Cameron, Cortez, Shadow Oak (lower level), Maverick,
                      Friendship and Woodgrove parks are irrigated with non-potable water. Splash pad
                      uses recycled water.
             3.	 Shrinking Resources: Growing demand and shrinking resources will continue to be a
                 challenge for parks and recreation services in West Covina. With strong leadership and a
                 guiding vision, the City has a unique opportunity to maximize operational resiliency by:
                 •	 Proactively responding to changing demographics, emerging trends, and changing
                      priorities;
                 •	 Collaborating to more efficiently deliver quality services; and
                 •	 Planning for future growth.
                                                                                        Our Active Community  117

C. Types of Open Space
 A neighborhood should have access to a range of private and public open spaces types of varying character and function.
 The different open spaces may be combined. For example, a playground may be within a green. A regional trail system
 should connect the neighborhoods to community and regional level amenities.

3. Public Access to Open Space
To encourage use, the open space circulation system should
integrate and connect with the circulation patterns of the
neighborhood. The entrances and exits should be easy to
locate from inside and outside the open space. Primary
access route through the open space should be clearly iden-
tifiable, well maintained, well lit, and universally accessible.
Care should be taken in positioning of entrances away from
lines of severance such as busy roads and steep gradients
which inhibit access for the elderly and disabled - particu-
larly wheelchair users.

amenity, recreational use and wildlife corridors than isolated
and unrelated landscape elements. They not only serve to
organize larger projects but also create linkages to existing
urban areas, other sites and the wider landscape. Networks
may join up linear parks, playing fields, parks, allotments,
private gardens, buffer planting surface drainage corridors,
and school fields.
    Greenways can be created to run through or alongside
linear elements such as Walnut Creek Wash, Galster and
Heritage Wilderness, and connect with parks and sidewalks
in nearby neighborhoods. These can plug into neighbor-
hood streets with reduced auto trips that are safe for bikes
and have mature street tree planting -creating a network of
‘Greenways’.

conflict between human beings and other plants and ani-

    For public parkland, a balance needs to be struck between
public access and biodiversity. A model open space network
would form a necklace of different public and private open
space types.

       velopment of adjacent parcels. One option, given the street’s relatively short length and role as a way
       access to adjacent parcels, rather than as an important element of the larger street network, would be
       a shared street or “woonerf” configuration in which curbs are eliminated and the roadway is shared by
       all users, including pedestrians. Such designs are appropriate for low-speed environments, are proven
       to be safe if properly located and designed, and can greatly contribute to the urban design character
       of a street by branding it as unique, providing additional opportunities for placemaking and greatly
       improving walkability.
P4.6   Work with transit providers to develop high-quality facilities for transit users, including access facilities.
A4.6a  Explore a free or discount fare zone for transit Downtown. Existing transit service within the Downtown       Short-term CS, Foothill Transit  General fund
       segment of West Covina Parkway is relatively frequent, especially during peak periods. However, exist-
       ing fare policy limits the use of this service for short trips, including trips within West Covina or within
       the Downtown area. Notably, Foothill Transit’s frequent Silver Streak service charges a $2.45 cash fare.
       While the City of West Covina does not set fare policy for Foothill Transit, it could work with the opera-
       tor to explore options for facilitating such trips in support of new planned development.
A4.6b  Work with Foothill Transit to formalize parking for park-and-ride patrons. Similarly, the City could work     Short-term CED, Foothill         General fund,

       Parkway Transit Mall, if it were built, while discouraging illegal “hide-and-ride” parking in restricted

       area, potentially with a transit store and retail uses on the ground floor.
A4.6c  Explore changes to Go West routes. Go West service could be improved by modifying routes and                  Short-term CS                    General fund
       layover/recovery policy to allow for a regular, easy-to-remember “clockface” headway or frequency

       Line headway is 65 minutes. The Blue Line route may have to be shortened slightly, or other measures
       taken to reduce running time.
A4.6d  Implement bus-only lanes and high-quality bus stops on West Covina Parkway between Sunset and                 Short-term Foothill Transit, PW, Transportation

       turn lanes alternating with landscaped medians. Average Daily Traffic is in the 15,000 to 17,000 range,
       well below the maximum that can be accommodated in a single general-purpose lane each way, plus
       left-turn lanes. Transit volumes are up to 20 vehicles per hour, per direction. This level of transit service
       and a single lane of traffic can accommodate roughly the same number of trips. To improve reliability
       for the thousands of daily passengers aboard these buses and to enhance the visibility of existing
       transit service, the curbside general-purpose lanes should be converted to transit-only lanes. Private
       vehicles could continue to legally use the lanes to turn right at intersections or curb cuts, maintaining
       throughput in the general-purpose lanes. As part of this change, the existing 13-foot general-purpose
       lanes should be narrowed slightly, to provide a traffic-calming effect (while still easily accommodating
       large trucks). The City and Foothill Transit should partner to improve the existing Silver Streak stops
       at California using expanded shelters, real-time arrival information displays, informational kiosks and
       other amenities for passengers.
