                                                                        CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Chapter 1: Introduction
Purpose and Content
State law recognizes the vital role local governments play in the supply and affordability of
housing. Each local government in California is required to adopt a comprehensive, long-term
general plan for the physical development of their city or county. The housing element is one of
the seven mandated elements of the general plan. State law requires local government plans to
address the existing and projected housing needs of all economic segments of the community
through their housing elements. The law acknowledges that in order for the private market to
adequately address housing needs and demand, local governments must adopt land use plans
and regulatory systems that provide opportunities for, and do not unduly constrain, housing
development. As a result, housing policy in the state rests largely upon the effective
implementation of local general plans, local housing elements in particular.
The purpose of the housing element is to identify the community‚Äôs housing needs, to state the
community‚Äôs goals and objectives with regard to housing production, rehabilitation, and
conservation to meet those needs, and to define the policies and programs that the community
will implement to achieve the stated goals and objectives.
State law requires cities and counties to address the needs of all income groups in housing
elements. The official definition of these needs is provided by the California Department of
Housing and Community Development (HCD) for each city and county within its geographic
jurisdiction. Beyond these income-based housing needs, the housing element must also address
special needs groups such as persons with disabilities and homeless persons.
As required by State Housing Element Law (Government Code Section 65583(a)) this Housing
Element includes the following:
        ÔÇß   Analysis of population and employment trends and projections, and a quantification
            of the locality‚Äôs existing and projected housing needs for all income levels. This
            analysis of existing and projected needs includes the City of Isleton‚Äôs share of the
            regional housing need.
        ÔÇß   Analysis and documentation of household characteristics, including level of
            payment compared to ability to pay; housing characteristics, including
            overcrowding; and housing stock condition.
        ÔÇß   An inventory of land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and
            sites having potential for redevelopment; and an analysis of the relationship of
            zoning, public facilities, and services to these sites.
        ÔÇß   The identification of a zone or zones where emergency shelters are allowed as a
            permitted use without a conditional use or other discretionary permit.
Adopted February 26, 2014 | Certified April 24, 2014                                        Page 1

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
        ÔÇß   Analysis of potential and actual governmental constraints upon the maintenance,
            improvement, or development of housing for all income levels and for persons with
            disabilities, including land use controls, building codes and their enforcement, site
            improvements, fees and other exactions required of developers, and local processing
            and permit procedures.
        ÔÇß   Analysis of local efforts to remove governmental constraints.
        ÔÇß   Analysis of potential and actual non-governmental constraints upon the
            maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels,
            including the availability of financing, the price of land, and the cost of construction.
        ÔÇß   Analysis of any special housing needs for the elderly; persons with disabilities,
            including developmental disabilities; large families; farmworkers; families with
            female heads of households; and families and persons in need of emergency shelter.
        ÔÇß   Analysis of opportunities for residential energy conservation.
        ÔÇß   Analysis of ‚Äúat-risk‚Äù assisted housing developments that are eligible to change from
            low-income housing uses during the next 10 years.
        ÔÇß   Goals, policies, programs, and quantified objectives to help meet the housing needs
            in the community.
Unlike other general plan elements, the housing element must be submitted to the California
State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) for review and certification.
Relationship to other Elements and Plans
The California Government Code requires internal consistency among the various elements of a
general plan. Section 65300.5 of the Government Code states that the general plan and the parts
and elements, thereof, shall comprise an integrated and internally consistent and compatible
statement of policies. The Housing Element‚Äôs goals, policy and action plan shall be compatible
with that of other corresponding General Plan elements.
The Housing Element goals, policies, and programs were created with the intent to be
consistent with State and local provisions, including all other elements to avoid any conflicting
policies and maintain effective process that best adheres to the needs of the City‚Äôs residents.
However, the adoption of this Housing Element may necessitate revisions of some of the
General Plan elements to maintain internal consistency with those elements as mandated by
State law.

Citizen Participation
As part of the Housing Element update process, the City implemented the State‚Äôs public
participation requirements in Housing Element Law, set forth in Government Code Section
65583(c)(7), that jurisdictions ‚Äú‚Ä¶shall make a diligent effort to achieve participation of all
economic segments of the community in the development of the housing element.‚Äù
The City of Isleton conducted a public workshop on Saturday, December 7, 2013 at 10:00 a.m. at
the Isleton City Hall. City staff distributed announcements of the workshop and posted
announcements on boards at City and community facilities. The City also contacted several
residents, business owners, community leaders, and local stakeholders directly to encourage
attendance at the workshop.
At the workshop, the Housing Element consultants presented a brief overview of the Housing
Element Update and then facilitated an interactive discussion to solicit ideas from participants
about the most critical housing issues facing Isleton residents, and identify new ways that the
City and the community might work to address these issues. Eight people attended the
workshop. Workshop participants included interested residents and members of the City
Council. Appendix C contains a list of workshop participants and a summary of the issues and
ideas provided by the community.

Chapter 2: Housing Needs Assessment
Under State housing element requirements, housing needs are defined in three categories:
existing needs, needs of special groups within the community, and projected needs over the
Housing Element planning period. Projected housing needs are the total additional housing
units that the City must demonstrate it can accommodate in order to adequately house
projected population over the housing element planning period in units that are affordable, in
standard condition, and not overcrowded.
This section begins with a description of housing and demographic characteristics of the city of
Isleton. The section then discusses the existing housing needs of Isleton based on housing and
demographic characteristics. The section also discusses the housing needs of ‚Äúspecial‚Äù
population groups as defined in State law. Finally, the section discusses the city‚Äôs projected
housing needs based on the regional ‚Äúfair share‚Äù allocation in the Regional Housing Needs
Assessment (RHNA) prepared by the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG).
Population Characteristics
Historical Population
George Andrus first settled Andrus Island in 1852. The city of Isleton was established in 1874 by
Josiah Pool and in its early years, was a major sugar beet producer and had steamboats
stopping twice per day on trips between San Francisco, Sacramento, and Marysville. Up until
the Great Depression of the 1930s, Isleton was the canning center for the Delta, and was known
for its Bartlett pear and asparagus crops. It was even known as the Asparagus Capital of the
World. In 1930 the population of Isleton peaked at 2,090 people. Since the Great Depression the
population has declined steadily. Figure 1 shows the population decline from 1930, the peak, to
the year 2010 when the US Census Bureau conducted the 2010 Census.

  According to Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG), the City of Isleton has a very
  small employment base that has decreased within the last decade. According to SACOG‚Äôs
  findings, Isleton had 321 jobs in 1990, which decreased to 115 in 2008; an almost 65 percent loss
  in employment. The decline in the number of jobs has historically been a factor in the city‚Äôs
  population decrease.
  There is a possibility that new development might improve the economy by bringing more
  residents, jobs, and commerce into the city. Isleton does have a sizable retiree population that
  may limit the workforce; however with the potential for development that exists in the cities,
  new business may be attracted, which would bring more jobs to the city.
  Household Characteristics
  Household Composition
  The U.S. Census divides households into two different categories depending on their
  composition. Family households are those consisting of two or more related persons living
  together. Non-family households include persons who live alone or in groups composed of

unrelated individuals. Different household types have different needs. Families with children
generally prefer larger single-family homes, whereas the majority of single-person households
or seniors tend to live in apartments, condominiums, or smaller single-family homes.
Table 3 shows the household types in Isleton in 2010. Out of the 297 households in Isleton, 191
(64 percent) were family households and 106 (36 percent) were non-family households. Only 52
family households (18 percent of all households) had children. The average household size was
2.36 persons per households, and the average family size was slightly larger at 2.94.

based on county median incomes adjusted for household size. The definitions for the various
income categories established by HCD are shown in Table 4.

According to the 2006-2010 American Community Survey, the median household income in
Isleton was $39,583, compared to the countywide median of $56,439. Isleton had the lowest
median income of all jurisdictions in Sacramento County. The distribution of households by
income is shown in Table 5. As seen in this table, a large majority of the population (more than
two thirds) falls below the median income for Sacramento County, and about half falls within
the low- to very low-income categories.

Lower-income households are least able to afford increases in housing costs without sacrificing
the purchase of food, medicine, clothing, or other essentials. Lower-income households are also
less likely to have funds available for home improvements, repairs, and maintenance.

Growth Projections
Population Projections
The Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) produces projections of population,
employment, and housing for the cities and counties in the Sacramento region, including the
city of Isleton. SACOG‚Äôs most recent projections, released in 2012, project household population
and employment to 2035. Table 7 shows estimates of the projected population, number of
households, number of employed persons, and the jobs/household ratio for 2020 and 2035, with
2008 as the base year. As shown in the table, Isleton‚Äôs population is projected to increase from
720 in 2008 to 729 in 2020 and 888 in 2035 (with an AAGR of 0.8 percent each year from 2008 to
2035). (Note: The 2008 population of 720 included in SACOG‚Äôs model is much lower than the 2008
population of 800 reported by the Department of Finance. Similarly the estimate of 310 households
included in SACOG‚Äôs model for 2008 is much lower than the 2008 estimate by the Department of
Finance of 333 households.)

While SACOG‚Äôs projections assume Isleton‚Äôs population will increase, the 2010 Census data for
Isleton indicates Isleton‚Äôs population decreased from 835 in 2000 to 804 in 2010. While
population in the Sacramento region appears to be increasing, the population of Isleton will
likely continue its decrease of about 4 percent (See Table 8) unless new development occurs and
attracts new residents to Isleton. Nonetheless, the City understands its obligation to meet the
Regional Housing Needs Allocation.

Employment Projections
As previously stated, SACOG produces projections of employment for the city of Isleton.
SACOG‚Äôs most recent projections, released in 2012, project employment to 2035. Table 7, on the
previous page, shows estimates of the number of employed persons, and the jobs/household
ratio for 2020 and 2035, with 2008 as the base year. Isleton‚Äôs employment totals are shown to be
115 in 2008, 128 in 2020, and 159 in 2035 (with an AAGR of 1.2 percent).
Household Growth
Table 7 also shows estimates of the projected number of households for 2020 and 2035, with
2008 as the base year. As shown in the table, the number of households is projected to grow
from 310 in 2008 to 345 in 2020 and 371 in 2035 (with an AAGR of 0.7 percent). Housing growth
projections based upon SACOG‚Äôs RHNA 2013-2021 figures show a need for an increase of 23
housing units by 2021.
Jobs-Housing Balance
Jobs-housing ratios quantitatively express the relationship between where people work and
where they live. As shown earlier in Table 7, the jobs/household ratio was calculated by
dividing employment by an estimated average number of workers per household of 1.1
persons. According to SACOG, employment is projected to increase at a slightly higher rate
than population. The jobs to household ratio is projected to remain constant between 2008 and
2020 at 0.34, and then to increase slightly by 2035 to 0.39.
Housing Stock Characteristics
Housing Types
As of January 2013, the State Department of Finance estimates that there were approximately
425 housing units within the incorporated city boundaries (Table 9). Of these, an estimated 240
were single-family detached homes and 122 were multi-family housing. These multi-family

There are several boarding houses, single-room occupancy units, and small studio apartments
located along Main Street in Isleton. These units provide an important source of affordable
housing to individuals and small households in the city.
Housing Age and Condition
The age and condition of housing units help to determine the need for rehabilitation. Without
proper maintenance, the condition of housing is expected to deteriorate over time. The age of
housing is also an indicator of structural integrity, as older buildings are not likely to be built to
current building standards for fire and earthquake safety. However, many of the buildings built
after the 1930 fire that destroyed most of Isleton, have proven to even exceed current building
standards.
The city‚Äôs housing stock is relatively old. The 2010 Census shows that the majority of the
housing stock, an estimated 272 units or 66 percent) in the city, was built prior to 1970 (Table
10). The data also showed that 130 units were built prior to 1940.
The City center contains most of the older units which are scattered throughout, on larger than
average lot size. These older units are more likely to need more repairs due to deterioration
with age. They present risks to residents from earthquake damage and electrical and structural
hazards, and many have not been built to include the American Disabilities Act standards for
sufficient handicap access. Many lower-income residents are forced to live in substandard
housing due to the housing affordability, and because many cannot afford to make necessary
repairs.

An important indicator for existing conditions of the housing supply is the number of
structurally substandard units needing rehabilitation or replacement. While the majority of
housing units within the city are in relatively good condition, the number of housing units
needing rehabilitation is expected to increase.
The quality of Isleton‚Äôs housing stock was determined in February 2007 by a field survey
conducted by following criteria developed by the City‚Äôs contract planner. Five categories of
housing were identified for purposes of the survey, including housing in excellent condition,
moderate, fair, repair needed, and dilapidated. Of Isleton‚Äôs total housing stock, 30 units were
determined to be in need of repair and two units were in need of replacement (Table 11). Units
needing rehabilitation are spread throughout the older residential areas of the city. However,
the largest concentration (20 units) is located in the two-block area of the Main Street
commercial center.

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
Housing Tenure
Housing in Isleton is largely owner-occupied (Table 12). According to the 2010 Census, 55.6
percent of the city's occupied units were owner-occupied and 44.4 percent were renter
occupied. The owner occupancy rate decreased significantly from the 2000 Census when 62.7
percent of housing units were owner-occupied.

Vacancy
The availability of vacant housing units provides choices for different household types to
accommodate changing needs; however, a high vacancy rate is a sign of an unhealthy housing
market. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has established 5 percent
as a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù vacancy rate. As of the 2010 Census, the vacancy rate in Isleton was 22.1 percent,
much higher than the vacancy rate in Sacramento County of 7.6 percent.
Rental Housing Costs
According to the U. S. Census, the median monthly rental rate in Isleton was $689 in 2010. Only
two rentals were posted online (a one bedroom in a larger house for rent and a two bedroom
single family home for rent). The one-bedroom was advertised for $600 and the two-bedroom
for $850. Estimates for a three-bedroom unit were provided by City staff in 2007 (Table 13).
Although only two units were posted on the internet as of November 2013, this does not mean
that there are not more rentals available in the city. As shown earlier in Table 12, the vacancy
rent for rental units is 19.7 percent.
Comparison of local rents to fair market rents1 established by HUD for the Section 8 Rental
Assistance Program shows that rental rates in the city are lower than HUD rent limits. This

leaves opportunities for Isleton residents to use Section 8 housing vouchers to assist with
housing costs; however, limited funding for this program serves as a hindrance to participation.
The Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency (SHRA) currently (November 2013)
offers rental assistance to three families in Isleton through its Housing Choice Voucher
Program. The long waiting lists and limited funds affect the number of households that can
actually receive this help.

For Sale Housing Costs
Housing in Isleton is generally less expensive than housing in more urban areas of Sacramento
County and neighboring cities. This is because Isleton is a rural community and located far
from urban services. The 2010 U.S. Census shows a median housing value of $243,300.
However, recent home sales prices are significantly lower than the reported value in 2010.
According to information provided by a local realtor at Del Rio Real Estate, the median sales
price for homes listed for sale, pending, or sold in Isleton in 2013 was $90,000 and the average
sales price was $102,070 (Table 14). Table 14 shows the median sales price by number of
bedrooms. The median sales price in Isleton is lower than the countywide median of $240,000 in
October 2013.
some areas HUD sets the level at the 50th percentile to give lower-income families who participate in the
voucher program access to a broader range of housing opportunities. The FMR figures that apply to the
Sacramento PMSA are set at the 50th percentile of rents in the area. In other words, half of the rents in the
Sacramento PMSA are above the figures shown and half below.

   Affordability and Overpayment
   Affordability is a major consideration in providing suitable housing. As defined by HUD, a
   household is overpaying for housing if it spends more than 30 percent of its monthly income on
   housing. This limitation on housing expenditures is particularly critical to lower-income
   households because of the very limited and sometimes fixed nature of their incomes. When
   lower-income households exceed this housing expenditure, it often leaves too little of their
   monthly income for other necessities, such as food, medicine, and clothing, and to make
   necessary home repairs. Table 15 provides a breakdown of households by income range that are
   overpaying for housing. As shown in the table, the percentage of households overpaying
   increases as income decreases. This is usually more prevalent among renters, although the
   majority of households in Isleton are owner-occupied.

Note: 1Overpayment is defined as a household paying 30 percent or more of income on housing.
   According to HUD, the median family income for a four-person household in the Sacramento
   PMSA (Sacramento Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area) was $76,100 in 2012. Income limits
   for larger or smaller households were higher or lower, respectively, and are calculated using a
   formula developed by HUD (Table 16).

Table 17 shows the 2012 household income limits for extremely low-, very low-, low-, and
moderate-income households in the Sacramento PMSA (including Isleton) by the number of
persons in the household. It also shows maximum affordable monthly rents and maximum
affordable purchase prices for homes. For example, a three-person household was classified as
low-income (80 percent of median) with an annual income of up to $54,850 in 2012. A
household with this income could afford to pay a monthly gross rent (including utilities) of up
to $1,371 or could afford to purchase a house priced at or below about $200,000.
Based on the rental rates and sales prices described earlier, market-rate housing in Isleton (both
rental and for-sale housing) is generally affordable to lower-income households.

Overcrowding
Overcrowding is defined by the Census Bureau as having 1.01 persons or more per room in a
dwelling unit, excluding bathrooms. Overcrowding occurs when there is insufficient housing
with enough rooms and at affordable prices to accommodate households in the area. Lower-
income households are more likely to live in overcrowded conditions because they cannot
afford the larger sized units that are more suitable for their household size. Overcrowding is
considered a housing concern because it is an undesirable living condition and it leads to a
faster deterioration of housing. According to the 2010 Census, approximately 27 households are
living in overcrowded conditions in Isleton (Table 18).

Special Housing Needs
Within the overall housing needs discussed above, there are segments of the population that
experience special housing needs. Six groups are identified in State housing element law
(Government Code, Section 65583(a)(7)): ‚Äúelderly; persons with disabilities, including a
developmental disability, as defined in Section 4512 of the Welfare and Institutions Code; large
families; farm workers; families with female heads of households; and families and persons in
need of emergency shelter.‚Äù Table 20 summarizes each of these groups.

Elderly
Elderly households are households headed by member aged 65 or over. According to the 2010
Census there were 135 people aged 65 or older (16.8 percent of the population), with about 10
percent of elderly living below the poverty level (Table 20). As shown in Table 21, there were 95
elderly households, with 66 households owning and 29 renting. Table 21 also shows the number
of seniors in Isleton paying more than 30 percent of their income for monthly owner costs.
The housing needs of elderly residents are often related to their limited mobility as well as their
fixed incomes. Elderly households have a high homeownership rate. While many own their
homes outright, fixed retirement incomes may not be adequate to cover rising utility rates,
insurance, or home repairs. Elderly households are often unable to afford increases in housing
rents and the costs for major home repairs. According to the U.S. Census, the median household
income in Isleton for householders 65 years and older was $20,417, much less than the median
household income for all households in Isleton ($39,583).
Although some seniors prefer single-family detached homes, many choose smaller, more
affordable homes that require less repair and upkeep. This could include condos, townhouses,
apartments, or mobile homes. In general, most senior households consist of a single elderly
person living alone, or a couple. This suggests that housing developments for senior households
should contain a larger proportion of smaller housing units than those intended for the general
population. There are currently (2013) no senior housing developments in Isleton.

Large Households
Households with five members or more are considered large households according to the
Census Bureau. They often require larger dwelling units with more bedrooms that may not be
available at costs they can afford. The increase in the number of household members does not
proportionately increase the earning power of the household. Often, it means an additional
dependent child. Large households present a need for large but inexpensive housing units in
the City. The 2010 Census shows that there are 40 large households in the City, split between
owner and renter occupied, as shown in Table 22.
Households in Isleton tend to be smaller than countywide. The average household size was 2.43
persons per household in Isleton, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. This was slightly smaller
than the Sacramento County average household size of 2.71 persons per household.

Female Headed Households
Single parent households have special housing requirements due to their needs to be near
schools, day care centers, recreational facilities, and public transit systems. Female-headed
households who have low incomes may find it particularly difficult to secure affordable
housing near these services. A factor that makes it harder for female-headed households is that
there are minimal services available in Isleton such as doctors, which means that the care
provider must travel out of town, which in turn could mean missing work, and therefore
making it harder to afford housing.

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
In 2010, the U.S. Census reported 46 female-headed households in Isleton and of these, 24
percent were below poverty level while 25 of the 46 households had children less than 18 years
of age.
Persons with Disabilities
Disabled persons are identified as those with visual and hearing impairments and mental or
other physical disability. Persons with limited mobility have special housing needs. These
include ramps instead of stairs, elevators for units with two or more stories, modified
bathrooms, wider doorways, and lower shelves. With the adoption of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA), all new multi-family residential projects containing four or more units
must contain some units accessible to persons with disabilities, but existing housing units are
unlikely to be accessible or designed for the handicapped.
Housing suitability depends on the severity of the disability of the disabled persons. The U.S.
Census collects data for several categories of disability, which it defines as:
        ÔÇß   Sensory disability ‚Äì blindness, deafness, or a severe vision or hearing impairment.
        ÔÇß   Physical disability ‚Äì A condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical
            activities such as walking, climbing stairs, reaching, lifting, or carrying.
        ÔÇß   Mental disability ‚Äì difficulty learning, remembering, or concentrating.
        ÔÇß   Self-care disability ‚Äì difficulty dressing, bathing, or getting around inside the home.
        ÔÇß   Going outside of the home disability ‚Äì difficulty going outside the home alone.
        ÔÇß   Employment disability ‚Äì physical or mental impairment that impairs the ability to
            work
        ÔÇß   Developmental disability ‚Äì a disability that originates before an individual becomes
            18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a
            substantial disability for that individual
The latest available data for residents with disabilities is from the 2000 Census. Isleton had a
total of 159 disabled residents, representing all age groups considered by the 2000 U.S. Census,
with a disability, or 21.1 percent of the population. Of these, 83 residents, or 55.3 percent, were
aged 65 or over.
SB 812, which took effect January 2011, amended State housing element law to require an
evaluation of the special housing needs of persons with developmental disabilities. A
"developmental disability" is defined as a disability that originates before an individual
becomes 18 years old, continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely, and constitutes a
substantial disability for that individual. This includes Mental Retardation, Cerebral Palsy,
Epilepsy, and Autism. Many developmentally disabled persons are able to live and work.

However, more severely disabled individuals require a group living environment with
supervision, or an institutional environment with medical attention and physical therapy.
According to the California Department of Developmental Services, as of July 1, 2013, the Alta
California Regional Center served 18,212 residents with developmental disabilities in the
region, 11,845 (65 percent) of which resided in Sacramento County. While an estimate of the
number of Isleton residents served by the Alta California Regional Center is not available, a
rough estimate of seven residents can be made based on the proportion of the Sacramento
County 2013 population that lives in Isleton. There is no supportive housing for persons with
developmental disabilities in Isleton.
While about 27 percent of developmentally disabled individuals in the region live in supported
housing, 73 percent live at home. Many developmentally disabled persons are able to live and
work. However, more severely disabled individuals require a group living environment with
supervision, or an institutional environment with medical attention and physical therapy.
Additionally, almost half (44.2 percent) of developmentally disabled individuals are under the
age of 18. Because developmental disabilities exist before adulthood, the first housing issue for
the developmentally disabled is the transition from living with a parent/guardian as a child to
an appropriate level of independence as an adult.
Farmworkers
Farmworkers are a large part of the Isleton and Delta economy. They make up a group that is
considered as having special housing needs. Many have large families with them and end up
earning a little more than minimum wage. With the low pay that farm workers usually receive,
it is difficult for many of these families to find housing that is both adequate and affordable.
While Isleton is considered a farming community, of the 330 people above the age of 16 that are
employed, only 14 of these people are employed in agriculture or similar industry, according to
the 2010 U.S. Census. The farmworker population within Isleton has fewer migrants than any of
the other agricultural regions in the vicinity and to-date no specific farmworker housing has
been identified.
Homeless
Homelessness is a growing national concern that has reached crisis proportions in many parts
of the country. State law mandates that the Housing Element address the emergency housing
needs of the homeless population. However, by its very nature homelessness is difficult to
measure. Based on conversations with local residents, City staff estimates that about 25 to 50
homeless people reside in and around Isleton. Several members of the City Council estimated
the homeless population to be closer to 10 people. This population tends to move between
Isleton and the nearby city of Rio Vista.

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
At this time there are no programs and the City lacks the means to be able to provide programs
for the homeless. The City must rely on charitable organizations such as churches to meet
whatever needs emerge.
Extremely Low Income Households
Extremely low-income households are defined as households with incomes under 30 percent of
the county‚Äôs median income. Extremely low-income households typically consist of minimum
wage workers, seniors on fixed incomes, persons with disabilities, and farm workers. This
income group is likely to live in overcrowded and substandard housing conditions. Sacramento
County median household income, from the 2010 Census, is $56,553. Thus in Isleton, a
household with an income of $16,965 would qualify as an extremely low-income household.
According to the 2010 Census, there were 61 people with an income lower than $15,000, or
about 20 percent of the population.
Assisted Housing At-Risk of Conversion
Inventory of Potential At-Risk Units
As required by Government Code Section 65583, the City must analyze the extent to which low-
income, multi-family rental units are at risk of becoming market rate housing and if necessary,
develop programs to preserve or replace these assisted housing units. The multi-family units to
be considered are any units that were constructed using various Federal assistance programs,
State or local mortgage revenue bonds, redevelopment tax increments in-lieu fees, inclusionary
housing ordinance, or density bonuses. Low-income multi-family housing is considered to be at
risk if it is eligible to convert to non-low income housing due to: 1) the termination of a rental
subsidy contract, 2) mortgage prepayment, or 3) the expiration of affordability restrictions. The
time period that is to be considered in making this determination is the 10-year period
following the last mandated updating of the housing element, which in the case of Isleton is
2013-2021.
There are no low-income, multi-family rental units in the city that have been constructed with
the use of Federal assistance programs, State or local mortgage revenue bonds, redevelopment
tax increments, in-lieu fees or inclusionary housing ordinance, or density bonuses. Therefore,
there are no at-risk housing units in Isleton.
Future Growth Needs
Regional Housing Needs Assessment
In September 2012, the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) adopted its final
Plan for the Allocation of Regional Housing Needs for January 1, 2013, through October 31,
2021. Required by State law, the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) is part of a
statewide statutory mandate to address housing issues that are related to future growth. The
RHNA allocates to cities and counties each jurisdiction‚Äôs ‚Äúfair share‚Äù of the region‚Äôs projected
Page 24                                               Adopted February 26, 2014 | Certified April 24, 2014

housing needs by household income group over the housing element planning period (January
1, 2013 to October 31, 2021).
The core of the RHNA is a series of tables that indicate, for each jurisdiction, the distribution of
housing needs for each of four household income groups. The tables also indicate the projected
new housing unit targets by income group for the ending date of the plan. These measures of
units define the basic new construction that needs to be addressed by individual city and
county housing elements. The allocations are intended to be used by jurisdictions when
updating their housing elements as the basis for assuring that adequate sites and zoning are
available to accommodate at least the number of units allocated.
As shown in Table 23, SACOG, in its RHNA, allocated Isleton a total of 23 units for the period
from January 1, 2013, through October 31, 2021.The allocation is equivalent to a yearly need of
approximately two housing units. The table also shows the RHNA for the previous planning
period of 2006-2013. Since Isleton did not adopt a Housing Element for the previous planning
period, State law, as a penalty, requires the City to accommodate the RHNA allocation from the
last period in addition to the RHNA allocation for the present period. SACOG allocated Isleton
a total of 109 units for the previous period of 2006 to 2013. Isleton must demonstrate that it has
capacity for 132 total units, or a yearly need of approximately 16 housing units. Of these 132
units, 46 must be affordable to moderate-income households and below, including 9 very low-
income units, 18 low-income units, and 19 moderate-income units.

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
Chapter 3: Resources for Residential
Development
This section analyzes the resources and opportunities available for the development,
rehabilitation, and preservation of affordable housing in the city of Isleton. Included is an
evaluation of the availability of land resources and the financial administrative resources
available to support housing activities.
Vacant Land Inventory
Government Code Section 65583(a)(3) requires the Housing Element to contain ‚Äúan inventory of
land suitable for residential development, including vacant sites and sites having the potential
for redevelopment, and an analysis of the relationship of zoning and public facilities and
services to these sites.‚Äù Vacant land must be zoned to allow the construction of housing for all
income levels and also to help complete the objectives of the housing element. Appendix B
contains a detailed analysis of vacant land and potential development opportunities. The results
of this analysis are summarized below.
Methodology and Assumptions
In accordance with the requirements of Government Code Section 65583.2, an assessment was
conducted of the vacant land suitable for residential development within the city of Isleton. The
data was compiled by City staff and the Consultants and mapped using a Geographic
Information System (GIS). Vacant parcels were identified using aerial photographs and field
observation. The effective date of the vacancy status for each site is November 1, 2013. The
inventory only includes parcels located within the Isleton city limits. Only parcels with the
following General Plan land use designations that allow for residential development were
included in the inventory:
            o   Low Density (LD)
            o   Medium Density (MD)
            o   High Density (HD)
            o   Mixed Use (MXU)
            o   Mobile Home Park (MH)
Parcels with the following zoning districts and sub-districts that allow for residential and mixed
use development were included in the inventory:
            o   Single-Family Residential District (R)

                    ÔÇß   RM-MH-5.4
While the maximum allowed residential density was used to determine the income categories of
the inventoried sites, the inventory uses more conservative assumptions for the realistic number
of units that would be built on the sites. Given the lack of recent development history, the
inventory assumes the minimum density for sites designated LD (zoned R-1-7), MD (zoned R-
M-3), and HD (zoned R-M-2). Since the land designated for a mobile home park (MH land use
designation and R-MH zoning) does not have a minimum density, it is assumed that this site
will build out at 80 percent of maximum density (i.e., 6 units per acre). This is a conservative
estimate given that the existing mobile home park in the city is built at roughly 11 units per
acre.
Assumptions for Mixed Use Combing District
Several of the parcels are also within the Mixed Use Combining District, which allows for more
flexibility. While the MXU Combining District allows all categories of land uses allowed by the
General Plan, the base land use designations of the General Plan provide guidance for the
selection of those base zoning districts to be applied to the area.
Since the Mixed Use Combing District allows for both residential and commercial uses, the sites
inventory makes certain assumptions about the amount of residential development that is
expected to occur on each site. For Sites 5 and 7, the sites inventory assumes that 50 percent of
the site will be built as residential at 80 percent of maximum density. This is a conservative
estimate that accounts for the potential for some of the sites designated for mixed use to be built
as commercial uses. Based on the fact that the zoning allows the sites to be built as 100 percent
residential, the formerly-approved Village on the Delta was approved as a 100 percent
residential project on land zoned for mixed use, and there is little demand for new commercial
land at this time given the vacant storefronts along Main Street, the assumptions for the number
of units in the Mixed Use Combining District are conservative.
Site 6, which is zoned Mixed Use, does not have a base zoning district on which to base the
density assumption. Much of this site has also already been subdivided as part of the formerly-
approved Village on the Delta. While higher-density housing is not precluded from being built
on the site, the site is assumed to be appropriate for moderate-income housing and the

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
inventory assumes the same density as the formerly approved project (roughly 6.4 units per
acre). Lots that have already been subdivided are assumed to have one unit per lot, while
unsubdivided land is assumed to build out at 6.4 units per acre. This is a very conservative
assumption since future development could be built at much higher densities than what is
assumed in the inventory.
Zoning to Accommodate Lower Income Housing
State law requires that the densities of sites identified in the inventory be sufficient to encourage
and facilitate the development of housing affordable to lower-income households. Government
Code Section 65583.2 allows local governments to use ‚Äúdefault density standards‚Äù that are
‚Äúdeemed appropriate‚Äù in State law to accommodate housing for lower-income households
given the type of the jurisdiction. Isleton is considered a ‚Äúsuburban jurisdiction‚Äù with a default
density standard of 20 units per acre. HCD is required to accept sites that allow for zoning at
this density as appropriate for accommodating Isleton‚Äôs share of the regional housing need for
lower-income households.
Table 24 shows the assumptions used to determine the inventoried income categories for each
residential General Plan land use and zoning district in the city.

Zoning District minimum lot size, whichever is more restrictive.
While the maximum density in the Mobile home Park designation (8.0 mobile homes per acre)
is less than the default density of 20 units per acre, the capacity for mobile homes is counted as
lower-income. Mobile homes are an important source of affordable housing in Isleton and the
surrounding Delta communities. There were three mobile home sales listings in and around
Isleton ranging from $40,000 to $55,000. According to the 2012 American Community Survey
(three-year estimate), the median value for mobile homes was $32,400 in Sacramento County.
Monthly rental rates for mobile home parks in Isleton were between $300 and $500. This
combined sales and rental price is affordable to very low-income households.
Summary of Residential Capacity
Table 25 shows a comparison of the residential capacity to the total RHNA. The City has
adequate vacant land to accommodate the City‚Äôs share of the regional housing need for all
income groups. There are 70 acres of vacant land designated for residential and mixed use
development. Based on the residential densities allowed by the General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance these 70 acres can realistically accommodate an estimated 483 units, which exceeds
the RHNA of 132 units.

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
Availability of Infrastructure
Water supply is not a major issue in Isleton. Water service is provided by Cal American Water
Company. There is sufficient water supply to serve new development planned for in this
Housing Element; however, storage capacity would need to be expanded to serve major new
development. The former Village on the Delta had planned to build new storage tanks to serve
the development.
The biggest infrastructure constraint in Isleton is inadequate sewage treatment facilities that do
not meet the State Water Quality Control Board standards. The City of Isleton built the current
wastewater treatment and disposal pond system in 1975. For a number of years the system
work well but maintenance was ignored and portions fell into disrepair. Significant work has
been completed to optimize both treatment and disposal. The original wastewater treatment
system was designed for 435,000 gpd. The treatment process provides adequate treatment but
in recent years the percolation rates have reduced, thus reducing capacity. The State Water
Quality Control Board submitted to the City in 2006 a cease and decease order indicating that
no new sewer hook ups can be made until the City fixes sewage issues. This order is primarily a
hydraulic capacity issue.
The City of Isleton is moving forward in addressing the Regional Water Quality Control Board‚Äôs
cease and decease order. The system will be analyzed from headworks to disposal. The new
project may include a reclamation project that will irrigate corn or be used for constructed
wetlands. Alternatively, the pond levees may be raised to provide more storage.
As stated earlier, the existing sewer ponds can accommodate up to 430,000 gallons. Currently,
the city is using approximately half of the sewer treatment pond capacity. Once the City
corrects the percolation issue, the ponds will have enough capacity to accommodate more than
the number of units included in the RHNA. However, at some point, the sewage treatment
ponds will need to be expanded to accommodate the reuse of the existing vacant retail,
commercial businesses, and vacant residential units located within the city and when the SOI
reserved lands become part of the city.
Environmental Constraints
The only known environmental constraints affecting the sites inventory are flooding-related
constraints. As discussed in the Non-governmental Constraints section, almost the entire City of
Isleton is located in the 100-year flood zone. Flooding constraints are associated with the lack of
available funds to allocate towards repairing and or improving the Sacramento River levee and
the Slough levee around the City. The levees have not received Federal FEMA/National Flood
Insurance Program approval status. The levees were built prior to any standards and will
require considerable improvements to meet the current Federal and or State standards.
Additionally, the City‚Äôs 1979 and 2000 General Plan discuss the utilization of a cross town levee
that would require a considerable amount of funding in excess of $10 million to construct
pursuant to the General Plan policy and to insure that levee meets applicable design standards.

                                                    CHAPTER 3: RESOURCES FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT
Infrastructure improvements that could be necessary to construct housing would add to
construction costs associated with providing affordable units. Construction in floodplains can
require costly assessments for necessary levee repairs and/or construction features designed to
minimize flood risk.
Zoning for a Variety of Housing Types
State Housing Element Law (Government Code Section 65583(c)(1) and 65583.2(c)) requires that
local governments analyze the availability of sites that will ‚Äúfacilitate and encourage the
development of a variety of types of housing for all income levels, including multifamily rental
housing, factory-built housing, mobile homes, housing for agricultural employees, supportive
housing, single-room occupancy units, emergency shelters, and transitional housing.‚Äù This
section discusses the availability of sites and relevant regulations that govern the development
of the types of housing listed above.
Multifamily Rental Housing
The Multifamily Residential (RM) District allows multifamily housing as a permitted use at up
to 22 units per acre, although the maximum allowed densities are determined by the sub-
districts. Isleton‚Äôs regulations make no distinction between rental and ownership housing.
Manufactured Housing
Manufactured housing can serve as an alternative form of affordable housing in areas where the
development of higher density multi-family residential units is not allowed. Isleton meets all
State requirements for allowing the development of manufactured housing. Isleton‚Äôs Zoning
Ordinance states that a mobile home is allowed ‚Äúas a single-family dwelling when set on a
permanent foundation within any R or RM district.‚Äù In addition, the Zoning Ordinance allows
mobile home parks in the RM-MH-5.4 District and within and residential district under PUD
provisions, as required by State law.
Farm worker Housing
State law contains provisions for the regulation of farm worker housing in agricultural zones.
While the Delta region is an important agricultural region in California, only 14 Isleton
residents were employed in agriculture according to the 2010 U.S. Census. The city is
surrounded by agricultural lands, but does not have any land designated for agriculture in the
city limits.
Emergency Shelters
Senate Bill 2, in effect as of January 1, 2008, amended State Housing Element law (Government
Code Sections 65582, 65583, and 65589.5) regarding shelter for homeless persons. This
legislation required local jurisdictions to strengthen provisions for addressing the housing
needs of homeless persons, including the identification of a zone or zones where emergency
shelters are allowed as a permitted use without a conditional use permit. The identified zone
Adopted February 26, 2014 | Certified April 24, 2014                                          Page 33

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
must have sufficient capacity to accommodate at least one emergency shelter and must be
suitable (i.e., contain compatible uses) for an emergency shelter, which is considered a
residential use. The law also requires permit procedures and development and management
standards for emergency shelters to be objective and encourage and facilitate the development
of emergency shelters.
There are two potential districts where emergency shelters might be appropriate in Isleton: the
Planned Industrial District and the (PID) and the R-M-2 District. As Isleton is a small town, both
districts are close to services (although few services are available in Isleton). While the
industrial zone is not specifically intended for residential uses, the existing industrial uses are
all immediately adjacent to existing residential uses and incompatibility is not an issue. The
development standards in either zone would allow and encourage emergency shelters.
As shown on Figure 4, there is one 2.67-acre vacant parcel zoned R-M-2 (shown in orange).
There is one entirely vacant 6-acre parcel and a 3-acre portion of an underutilized parcel zoned
PID (shown in purple). Either district has enough capacity for at least one emergency shelter,
which would more than accommodate the needs of the homeless population in and around
Isleton.
                        Figure 4: Potential Zones for Emergency Shelters
This Housing Element contains Action 5.1 to update the Zoning Ordinance to define emergency
shelters and allow them by-right in at least one zoning district. The City Council is expected to
consider adopting a Zoning Ordinance amendment related to emergency shelters in January
2014.

Transitional Housing and Supportive Housing
Transitional housing is designed to assist homeless individuals and families in moving beyond
emergency shelter to permanent housing. With the enactment of SB 2 in 2008, State law now
requires cities and counties to treat transitional and supportive housing as a residential use
subject only to those restrictions that apply to other residential uses of the same type in the
same zone. For example, if a proposed transitional housing facility is a multifamily use
proposed in a multifamily zone, then the Zoning Code should treat the transitional housing the
same as other multifamily uses proposed in the zone. This Housing Element contains Action 5.1
to update the Zoning Ordinance to include definitions consistent with State law. The City
Council is expected to consider adopting a Zoning Ordinance amendment to address this
requirement in January 2014.
Single-Room Occupancy Units
Single room occupancy (SRO) units are multi-unit housing that provide small units that
typically contain a single room. Tenants of SROs typically share bathrooms, kitchens, and
common activity areas. SROs provide a source of affordable housing for seniors and lower-
income residents. In Isleton, SROs are considered boarding houses. There are five or six
boarding houses on Main Street that contain shared kitchens and/or bathrooms and provide
affordable rents for residents. Boarding houses are allowed with a Conditional Use Permit in
the Central Commercial/Residential District (CCRD) and Multifamily Residential (RM) zones.
Second Units
A second dwelling unit is an additional self-contained living unit, either attached to, or
detached from, the primary residential unit on a single lot. It has cooking, eating, sleeping, and
full sanitation facilities. Second dwelling units can be an important source of affordable housing
since they can be constructed relatively cheaply and have no associated land costs. Second
dwelling units can also provide supplemental income to the homeowner, allowing the elderly
to remain in their homes or moderate-income families to afford houses.
To encourage establishment of second dwelling units on existing developed lots, State law
requires cities and counties to either adopt an ordinance based on standards set out in the law
authorizing creation of second dwelling units in residentially-zoned areas, or where no
ordinance has been adopted, to allow second dwelling units on lots zoned for single family or
multi-family use that contain an existing single-family unit subject to ministerial approval (‚Äúby
right‚Äù) if they meet standards set out by law. Local governments are precluded from totally
prohibiting second dwelling units in residentially-zoned areas unless they make specific
findings (Government Code, Section 65852.2).
Second units are allowed with a Conditional Use Permit in all residential districts (i.e., the UR,
R, and RM zoning districts). Section 1206 of the City‚Äôs Zoning Ordinance contains standards for
second units including maximum floor area, access requirements, and off-street parking
standards. The standards are reasonable and do not unduly constrain the production of second
units. However, the Zoning Code is inconsistent with State law in that it requires a Conditional

comply with State law.
Potential Funding Sources
The City of Isleton experiences serious financial limitations due to the City‚Äôs size and revenue
base. Because of this, the City is located in one of Sacramento County‚Äôs ‚ÄúTarget Areas,‚Äù which
are areas designated by the Federal government to be economically distressed. The City‚Äôs staff
resources are restricted, as assistance is limited mostly to personnel in the Building Department.
The assignment of full-time personnel is financially impossible. Residents are eligible to receive
grants and low interest loans to help defray the costs of the improvements. The Sacramento
Housing and Redevelopment Agency (SHRA) was authorized through the City‚Äôs Cooperation
Agreement to fund essential community development and housing assistance activities as part
of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program through December 31, 2011.
Isleton continues to seek technical housing assistance from the Sacramento Area Council of
Governments (SACOG) and SHRA.
In 2012 the State of California enacted Assembly Bill 1x26, which dissolved redevelopment
agencies across the state. Prior to AB 1x 26, California Redevelopment Law required
redevelopment agencies to set aside at least 20 percent of all tax increment revenues in a
housing fund to be used for affordable housing. These redevelopment set-aside funds were
used to supplement CDBG funding for residential rehabilitation loans; provide repair loans for
owners of mobile homes; and assist in the development of affordable units.
On February 1, 2012, Assembly Bill 1x26 dissolved all redevelopment agencies in the State of
California. Existing redevelopment plan areas remain unchanged while city and county
successor agencies wind down the activities of the former redevelopment agencies. The
successor agencies are tasked with managing redevelopment projects currently underway,
making payments on enforceable obligations, and disposing of redevelopment assets and
properties with the sales proceeds to be given to the State.
With the elimination of redevelopment agencies, property tax revenues in the redevelopment
plan areas are no longer available for new or future affordable housing programs. After making
the required payments on existing bonds and other enforceable obligations, the remaining
property tax revenues exceeding the amount of those obligations, if any, are allocated to taxing
entities such as cities, counties, special districts, and school and community college districts. As
a result, many cities and counties have lost their largest source of funding for affordable
housing programs.
The City lacks the available funding and staff to devote to the oversight of implementing
affordable housing programs and will continue to use support from other agencies such
SACOG and SHRA. The Housing Element includes Actions 2.2 and 3.2 for the City to pursue
regional, State, or Federal funding for housing.

Chapter 4: Constraints
There are a variety of factors, both governmental and non-governmental, that influence the
maintenance, improvement, or development of housing for all income levels. Various
government policies and standards as well as market forces can increase housing costs to
developers and potential home buyers, limiting housing availability and affordability,
especially for low-income households. The housing element must analyze current and potential
constraints on affordable housing production and whenever possible, include programmatic
solutions to remove or mitigate impacts of constraints.
Governmental
The local government is responsible for protecting the welfare of its citizens, and as such is
required to regulate housing production to ensure supply of housing for all income levels.
Governmental actions, however, may discourage development or indirectly increase housing
costs, making it difficult to meet local housing needs. Identifying factors that may serve as
governmental constraints can lead to positive changes in City actions and operations by
facilitating development processes. Policies and regulations that may hinder development
include land use control, building codes and enforcement, on-/off-site improvements, fees, and
permit procedures. This section aims to identify constraints and provide appropriate responses
whenever possible in order to encourage residential construction and housing affordability.
Land Use Controls
Land use controls can constrain housing production by limiting the amount of land designated
for residential development and the number of housing units built per acre of land. The Zoning
Ordinance poses the greatest potential constraints on housing, as it regulates where residential
development can occur and establishes processing procedures and development standards for
building construction. The City‚Äôs General Plan also determines the number of housing units that
can be built on a parcel of land based on density categories: low, medium, and high. The
amount of land designated for residential use and the density at which development is
permitted affects the future supply and costs of housing.
Zoning
Table 28 provides a breakdown of the City's residential zoning districts and identifies applicable
development standards, such as lot dimensions, setbacks, and building heights. The City of
Isleton has five different residential zoning districts, two of which are combing districts
intended to be overlaid on the underlying base districts. These include: Single-Family
Residential Districts (R), Multi-Family Residential Districts (RM), Central Commercial/
Residential Districts (CCRD), Planned Unit Development District (PUD), and Mixed Use
District (MXU).
The purposes and applications of each residential district are summarized below:

  As of November 2013, the Zoning Ordinance is inconsistent in its descriptions of the Single-Family
Residential Sub-districts. Some sections reference the R-1-7 Sub-district while other sections reference an
R-1-6 Sub-district with a minimum lot size of 6,000 square feet. The Zoning Map shows the R-1-7 Sub-
district, but does not show the R-1-6 Sub-district. This Housing Element contains Action 5.1 to update the
Zoning Ordinance for consistency.

       Preservation Ordinance.
   4. PUD‚ÄìPlanned Unit Development Combining District: The PUD district is intended to
       be combined with residential or commercial base zoning districts. These areas are
       designated by the General Plan and/or City Council to be developed in a manner
       superior to that which would be allowed under conventional regulations of the
       underlying base zoning district. Planned Unit Developments are encouraged to achieve
       a more functional, aesthetically pleasing and harmonious living and working
       environment. A PUD may include a combination of different dwelling types and/or a
       variety of land uses that are made to complement each other and harmonize with
       existing and proposed land uses in the vicinity.
   5. Mixed Use Combining District: This district is applied to lands within the boundaries
       of the City‚Äôs former redevelopment project area(s) and is intended to be combined with
       the existing residential, commercial, and industrial base zoning districts. The City
       Council determines use arrangements within these areas to be made physically,
       functionally, and aesthetically compatible through the Site Plan Review, Architectural
       Design Review, PUD procedures or a combination thereof. The MXU Combining District
       provides the flexibility needed to improve land use conditions within redevelopment
       areas.
   The adopted densities and development standards will allow for the construction of a
   variety of housing for all economic segments of the community.

General Plan
The City of Isleton‚Äôs current General Plan was adopted in October 2000. The General Plan
divides the residential land use designations into three densities: low, medium, and high. The
Low Density designation allows 6 to 9 units per net acre. The Medium Density designation
allows 9 to 15 units per net acre. The High Density designation allows 16 to 22 units per net
acre.
Under the Planned Unit Development approach to design, the City may allow developers to
build extra units to incentivize better design. The number of additional units permitted is
negotiable depending on the amount of affordable housing, common recreation open space, and
other amenities to be provided.
Pursuant to a policy found on page IV-A-4 of the General Plan, the maximum number of
housing units per density category shall not be considered a ‚Äúright‚Äù but rather an ‚Äúentitlement‚Äù
to be granted under special circumstances. Except where low income housing is proposed, the
maximum number of units may be achieved only through the PUD process based on the merits
of a request. Medium and High Density areas must be developed at no less than the average
allowable housing density. This policy serves to incentivize the development of low-income
housing.
Density Bonuses
A density bonus is the allocation of development rights that allows a parcel to accommodate
additional square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the
parcel is zoned. State law establishes the minimum affordability requirements to qualify for a
density bonus are as follows:
         ÔÇß   The project is eligible for a 20 percent density bonus if at least 5 percent of the units
             are affordable to very low-income households, or 10 percent of the units are
             affordable to low-income households; and
         ÔÇß   The project is eligible to receive a 5 percent density bonus if 10 percent of for-
             purchase units are affordable to moderate-income households.
The law also requires jurisdictions to grant a project additional density based on a sliding scale.
A developer can receive the maximum density bonus of 35 percent when the project provides
either 11 percent very low-income units, 20 percent low-income units, or 40 percent moderate-
income units.
Density bonus law requires cities and counties to grant a certain number of incentives
depending on the percentage of affordable units developed. Incentives include reductions in
zoning standards, reductions in development standards, reductions in design requirements,
and other reductions in costs for developers. Projects that satisfy the minimum affordable
criteria for a density bonus are entitled to one incentive from the local government. Depending
on the amount of affordable housing provided, the number of incentives can increase to a

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
maximum of three incentives from the local government. If a project uses less than 50 percent
of the permitted density bonus, the local government must provide an additional incentive.
Density bonus law also imposes statewide parking standards that a jurisdiction must grant
upon request from a developer of an affordable housing project that qualifies for a density
bonus. The developer may request these parking standards even if they do not request the
density bonus. The parking standards are summarized in Table 29. These numbers are the total
number of parking spaces including guest parking and handicapped parking.

Under the PUD zoning procedures, the City allows for the granting of a density bonus up to 25
percent of the maximum density for developments that qualify according to the requirements of
State law. The density bonus ordinance is slightly outdated. This Housing Element contains
Action 5.2 to update the density bonus provisions of the City‚Äôs Zoning Ordinance to comply
with State law.
Parking
Off-street parking often requires large amounts of land, which can negatively impact the
development of affordable housing by increasing development costs, decreasing land
availability for housing development, and limiting funds. Of special note is the fact that the
City‚Äôs generally narrow streets limit the extent of on-street parking that is possible, therefore
reinforcing the need for off-street parking. The older areas of Isleton are lacking in off-street
parking, creating a shortage of parking spaces for customers of businesses in the downtown.
The City‚Äôs parking standards intend to alleviate or to prevent traffic congestion and shortage of
curb spaces. Table 30 shows the City‚Äôs parking standards for residential uses. The City‚Äôs
parking requirements are similar to other jurisdictions and do not impose undue constraints on
development.

Constraints on Housing for Persons with Disabilities
There are very few regulations related to housing for persons with disabilities in the City‚Äôs
Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance does not address group homes, but does allow rest
homes as permitted by right and conditional use. Rest homes serving six or fewer persons are
allowed by right in the R Zoning District. Rest homes serving more than seven are a conditional
use within the R and RM zoning districts. The Zoning Ordinance also allows reduced parking
standards for elderly housing, as shown in Table 30, above. Appendix D provides responses to
the SB 520 Analysis Questions related to housing for persons with disabilities.
Building Codes and Code Enforcement
Building construction in the City of Isleton is regulated by the 2010 California Building Code.
This code promotes public health and safety and ensures that safe and decent housing is
constructed in the City of Isleton. The enforcement of these codes is intended to protect
residents from health and safety hazards and is not considered to be an undue constraint to
housing production. However, the codes and their enforcement can increase the cost of housing
development.
The City checks residences for code compliance when permit applications are submitted by
homeowners, which gives the City the opportunity to help correct deficiencies in older homes,
reducing possible threats to public safety and health. The City‚Äôs Building Department has a
good reputation for assisting with these applications. The City has identified many homes that
may be out of compliance.

Site improvements are regulated by the Subdivision and Parcel Map Ordinance and through
conditions and standards imposed by the City‚Äôs Site Plan Review process under the Zoning
Ordinance. Site improvements include such things as landscaping, walls, signage, streets, and
utility systems. In order to reduce housing costs, the City requires those improvements that are

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
deemed necessary to maintain the public health, safety, and welfare. Improvement
requirements for single-family and multi-family use are summarized below.
Subdivision Improvements
Requirements of the subdivision ordinance, which most affect the cost of housing, are standards
for the provision of utility services (e.g., water, sewer, drainage) and street improvements. Basic
improvements required include the following:
    ÔÇ∑   Water, sewer, and drainage lines and facilities, including the extension of lines to the
        property and to adjacent vacant properties, which will eventually require them as well.
        Rebate agreements with the City are typically included in the subdivision agreement
        where oversized line extensions are required. Extension of lines to drainage ditches or
        basins may also be required.
    ÔÇ∑   Street improvements include curb, gutter, sidewalk, A/C paving, driveway approaches,
        fire hydrants, streetlights, street signs and street trees.
    ÔÇ∑   Specialized improvements where appropriate, such as under grounding of ditches and
        fencing to restrict access to adjacent agricultural lands.
    ÔÇ∑   Under grounding of electrical, telephone and cable utility services.
To offset the costs of improvements in past projects, the City has suggested design
modifications to reduce lineal footage of street area and therefore the length of improvements
required. Two cost reductions result:
    1. additional land is made available for lot sales and housing, and
    2. lower average costs per lot or per unit to the developer.
While the cost of required improvements adds considerably to housing costs, the improvements
are considered by the City to be basic to the type of residential environment residents wish to
have created and maintained. An essential principle is that developers pay for all direct costs
associated with a given residential project so that existing residents and property owners are
not required to subsidize improvements or to provide costly improvements at a later date
through City general fund expenditures. The City considers its improvement requirements to be
so basic that they cannot be waived or modified except as may be required to provide density
bonuses mandated by State law.
On-site Improvements for Multi-Family (including Mobile Home Parks)
In order to achieve adequate housing for all socio-economic segments of the population, multi-
family projects involving 10 or more units are reviewed under PUD provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance has policies and standards for multi-family housing on land

designated by the General Plan for Medium Density or High Density and requires the following
improvements:
    ÔÇ∑   Landscaped open space a minimum of 20 percent of net site area for projects of 20 or
        more units.
    ÔÇ∑   Landscaped open space a minimum of 10 percent of net site area for projects of 20 or
        fewer units.
    ÔÇ∑   Common recreation area for the use of tenants a minimum of 10 percent of net site area
    ÔÇ∑   One tot lot.
    ÔÇ∑   A total of 5,000 square feet of area for passive recreation shaded by trees and/or
        structures.
    ÔÇ∑   In addition to the parking requirements in Table 30, one guest off-street parking space
        for each four dwelling units; one guest on-street parking space for each eight dwelling
        units
    ÔÇ∑   One-half of all off-street parking spaces covered by a garage or carport.
    ÔÇ∑   An internal system of walks serving all units.
    ÔÇ∑   Ornamental walls along the site perimeter.
There have been no multi-family developments proposed in recent decades, so there is no
evidence as to whether or not these standards pose a constraint to development. This Housing
Element includes Action 5.5 to monitor the impacts of the PUD process.
Fees and Development Costs
Fees for development processing and improvement of infrastructure (such as arterial streets,
intersection improvements, and water and sewer trunk line extension) and for public facilities
(such as parks, schools and fire stations) can add considerably to housing costs.
Table 31 shows the City‚Äôs current (as of November 2013) fees for single-family homes. The
estimated fees for a single-family home were $10,248 per unit. The City has not established a fee
schedule for multi-family developments as none have been built or proposed in several
decades; however, fees for multi-family would be similar to those for single-family. In addition
to City fees, the school district charges a fee of approximately $7,000 per single-family unit and
$4,500 per multi-family unit. In total, fees are approximately 4 to 6 percent of the total
development costs for new single-family homes.

                          Note: *Fire Department fee is scheduled to increase
The City‚Äôs fees are extremely low. In 2007 when the City was processing development
application, the City‚Äôs fee schedule was grossly out-of-date and did not cover the costs of
providing infrastructure and services for new development. The updating of the fee structure is
a high priority for the City upon adoption of the new General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. The
City is cognizant of the need for setting fees in a fair and prudent manner in order to manage
the impacts of fees on the supply of housing. Whether fees are also to be charged for recreation
facilities remains a matter for policy discussion by the City Council. In the event that recreation
impact fees are desired, the Recreational Element of the General Plan provides the technical
basis for such fees in accordance with provisions of the Quimby Act and State Subdivision Map
Act. The Housing Element includes Action 5.7 to develop a new fee schedule for single-family
and multi-family development.
On-site and off-site fees for new development cover improvements needed as the result of new
development. A subdivision, for example, is required to provide certain on-/off-site
improvements for streets and utilities. In addition, capital facility fees will be imposed in
accordance with the mandates of AB 1600 enacted in 1991. Capital facility fees will be limited to
community-wide needs for fire and police facilities, arterial streets, civic center facilities, and
specialized recreation areas and facilities that may not be covered by the recreation impact fee.
From time to time, it can be expected that fees will be increased in direct proportion to increased
costs of service or construction involved. All fees are to be levied on the fair-share principle
described previously for subdivision improvement requirements. Fees are not and will not be
charged as a source of revenue to augment the City‚Äôs annual budget.
Processing and Permits Procedures
Isleton‚Äôs experience in processing applications for housing development has been limited in
recent years to a few building permits. The City‚Äôs approach to processing is to be fast and
efficient on all applications consistent with the need for accuracy of data and information and
requirements for good mapping and engineering design. Table 32 shows the permit
requirements for various residential development types and the following text describes permit
procedures.

Conditional Use Permit
The Planning Commission has the power to grant or to deny applications for conditional use
permits and to impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of use permits. The
Commission determines whether approvals will be consistent with established legislative
policies with respect to traffic safety, street dedication, and street improvements. The decision is
reviewed by the City Council and may be affirmed, reversed, or modified.
Planned Unit Development
The Planned Unit Development District is intended to be combined with base zoning
designations in order to encourage creative and efficient uses of land that would otherwise not
be achieved under conventional district regulations. PUD procedures allow greater innovation
in project design so as to increase housing affordability and are largely relied upon to achieve
adequate housing for all socio-economic segments of the population. In order to provide
locations for such well-planned developments, the Planning Commission has the power to
grant use permits for planned unit developments. The permit procedures are akin to those of
conditional use permits with the exception of a few additional procedures outlined in Article 16
of the Zoning Ordinance. The Commission may grant a use permit for a PUD so long as the
application and evidence submitted are in compliance. The City Council will review the
decision and may affirm, reverse, or modify.
Processing Times
The Planning Commission acts on the application within 30 days following the closing of the
public hearing. Within five days following the Commission‚Äôs decision, the Secretary of the
Commission transmits the necessary data, staff reports, and the findings and decision on the
application to the City Clerk. At the first regular meeting of the City Council held more than 10
days after a decision on a use permit application, the City Council reviews the decision. Both a
conditional use permit and a PUD permit become effective immediately after it is granted by
resolution of the City Council.

Non-Governmental Constraints
Non-governmental constraints to development are constraints that are not created by the City
but can greatly influence the provision of housing. Examples in Isleton include: the location of
the entire town within a floodplain and associated cost of construction, the price of land, and
the availability of financing.
Floodplain Status and Cost of Construction
California‚Äôs construction costs have steadily increased since the early 1980‚Äôs causing substantial
increases in housing costs. These costs are dramatically inflated in Isleton because the entire
City is located in a floodplain. Isleton is located in ‚ÄúZone A‚Äù floodplain as determined by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Being in this floodplain zone can increase
the construction costs of new homes because of the added building requirements as well as
flood insurance.
Changing the floodplain status of the City could help decrease the construction costs of new
homes. This could be achieved by strengthening the levees that surround Andrus Island and the
city. The vulnerability of the current levees can be seen in the flood of 1972 that left much of the
city under water for several months.
Land Costs
The price of land greatly affects the costs of housing. The price of land in Isleton is affected by
its flood zone status, which greatly depreciates the value of land compared to the rest of the
Page 52                                                     Adopted February 26, 2014 | Certified April 24, 2014

Delta region as well as the state. According to online listings from Zillow.com and Trulia.com,
there are six lots for sale ranging in size and price from 7,405 square feet to 60 acres and $36,500
to $1,295,000, respectively. The median price per acre is approximately $26,000 and the average
price per acre is $84,000.
Construction Costs
Many factors can affect the cost to build a house, including type of construction materials, site
conditions, finishing details, amenities, and structure configuration. Construction costs for a
1,700 square-foot single family home are between $178,500 and $187,000, or $105 to $110 per
square foot, based on building valuation data compiled by the International Code Council
(ICC). An additional 30 percent of construction costs and on-site improvement costs, or between
$53,500 and $56,000, can be added to approximate ‚Äúsoft‚Äù costs, including architectural and
engineering fees, contingency costs, marketing costs, construction loan interest, as well as
developer overhead and profit. These construction numbers exclude development impact fees
and permit costs, which are discussed below under Government Constraints. For wood frame,
garden-style apartment units, construction costs may range from approximately $95to $100 per
square foot, or about $130,500 to $137,500 per unit. Soft costs, 30 percent of hard construction
and on-site improvement costs, could range between $39,000 and $41,000 per multifamily unit
in additional construction costs. Again, these costs do not include development impact fees and
permit costs.
Total development costs, including land, on- and off-site improvements, planning and
development impact fees, and hard and soft construction costs, amount to an estimated
$260,000 per single family unit and $175,000 per multifamily unit. Given current sales prices for
existing homes and high vacancy rates, there is little market demand for new homes.
Availability of Financing
For credit-worthy projects, residential construction loan rates are currently (2013) extremely
low. The rates are not expected to drop from the historic lows of today (2013). If interest rates
rise, not only will it make new construction more costly (since construction period loans are
short term and bear a higher interest rate than amortized mortgages), but it will also lower the
sales price that buyers can afford to pay.
Faced with a lagging housing market and the growing risk of a recession, the Federal Reserve
has been cutting interest rates since late 2007. Mortgage interest rates are currently (November
2013) at a historic low around 4.35 percent. These cuts make it easier for households to finance
house purchases. However, due to the recent collapse of the ‚Äúsub-prime‚Äù mortgage market,
loan qualification standards are considerably stricter and the availability of financing is
considerably reduced.
While most private lending institutions provide this service, government entities have taken
active roles in providing financing programs for residential development. Federal, State, and

local agencies offer a variety of programs that provide funds for housing construction and
mortgage loans.
Based on the population and housing characteristics presenting in the Housing Needs
Assessment chapter of this element, the City‚Äôs residents and housing units are eligible for
participation in many of the programs offered by Federal and State agencies. However, the
limited available funding for these programs is a constraint to their utilization.

Chapter 5: Energy Conservation Opportunities
State Law requires housing elements to address the issue of energy conservation within all
residential development. Energy efficiency is directly related to affordability of housing
especially for those of low income, as money spent on utilities can substantially reduce the
amount that can be spent on food, shelter, and other basic needs. It is important for the City to
provide energy conservation opportunities to help absorb the shock of cost increases for low
income households. The methods for energy conservation have been created to comply with the
City‚Äôs goal to ‚Äúpromote energy conservation activities in all residential neighborhoods‚Äù (see
Chapter 6, Housing Goals and Policies, Goal 6).
All new buildings in California must meet the standards contained in Title 24, Part 6, of the
California Code of Regulations (Building Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and
Nonresidential Buildings). These regulations respond to California's energy crisis and need to
reduce energy bills, increase energy delivery system reliability, and contribute to an improved
economic condition for the state. They were established in 1978 and most recently updated in
2010 (effective date of January 1, 2011). Through the building permit process, local governments
enforce energy efficiency requirements. All new construction must comply with the standards
in effect on the date a building-permit application is made. The City of Isleton has adopted the
2010 California Building Code. The State recently prepared the 2013 standards, which will go
into effect on January 1, 2014. The Housing Element includes Action 6.2 to adopt the 2013
standards.
There is a new section within the California Building Code that now includes green building
regulations, referred to as CALGreen. This is the nation‚Äôs first mandatory state-wide green
building code, intended to encourage more sustainable and environmentally friendly building
practices, require low pollution emitting substances that can cause harm to the environment,
conserve natural resources, and promote the use of energy efficient materials and equipment.
CALGreen Requirements for new buildings include:
    ÔÇ∑   Reduce water consumption by 20 percent;
    ÔÇ∑   Divert 50 percent of construction waste from landfills;
    ÔÇ∑   Install low pollutant-emitting materials;
    ÔÇ∑   Separate water meters for nonresidential buildings‚Äô indoor and outdoor water use;
    ÔÇ∑   Moisture-sensing irrigation systems for larger landscape projects; and

        that all are working at their maximum capacity and according to their design
        efficiencies.
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) provides gas and electric services for the City of Isleton. PG&E
offers the following financial and energy-related assistance programs for low income customers:
    ÔÇ∑   CARE (California Alternate Rates for Energy). PG&E offers this rate reduction program
        for low- to middle-income households. PG&E determines qualified households by a
        sliding income scale based on the number of household members. The CARE program
        provides a 20 percent discount on monthly energy bills.
    ÔÇ∑   Energy Savings Assistance Program. PG&E‚Äôs Energy Savings Assistance program offers
        free weatherization measures and energy-efficient appliances to qualified low- to
        moderate-income households. PG&E determines qualified households through the same
        sliding income scale used for CARE. The program includes measures such as attic
        insulation, weather stripping, caulking, and minor home repairs. Some customers
        qualify for replacement of appliances including refrigerators, air conditioners, and
        evaporative coolers.
    ÔÇ∑   REACH (Relief for Energy Assistance through Community Help). The REACH
        program is sponsored by PG&E and administered through the Salvation Army. PG&E
        customers can enroll to give monthly donations to the REACH program. Through the
        REACH program, qualified low-income customers who have experienced
        uncontrollable or unforeseen hardships that prohibit them from paying their utility bills
        may receive an energy credit up to $200. REACH assistance is available once per 18-
        month period, with exceptions for seniors and mentally- and physically-disabled
        persons. The Salvation Army determines eligibility by a sliding income scale based on
        the number of household members. To qualify for the program, the applicant‚Äôs income
        cannot exceed 200 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines.
    ÔÇ∑   Energy Efficiency for Multifamily Properties. The Energy Efficiency for Multifamily
        Properties program is available to owners and managers of existing multifamily
        residential dwellings containing two or more units. The program encourages energy
        efficiency by providing rebates for the installation of certain energy-saving products
        such as high-efficiency appliances, compact fluorescent light bulbs, attic and wall
        insulation, and efficient heating and cooling systems.
    ÔÇ∑   Medical Baseline Allowance. The Medical Baseline Allowance program is available to
        households where a California-licensed physician has certified that a full-time resident is
        either dependent on life-support equipment while at home; a paraplegic, hemiplegic,
        quadriplegic, or multiple sclerosis patient with special heating and/or cooling needs; a
        scleroderma patient with special heating needs; or suffering from a life-threatening

        lowest or baseline price for residential customers.
The California Department of Community Services and Development (CSD) administers the
Federally-funded Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). This program
provides two types of assistance: Home Energy Assistance and Energy Crisis Intervention. The
first type of assistance is a direct payment to utility bills for qualified low-income households.
The second type of assistance is available to low-income households that are in a crisis situation.
CSD also offers free weatherization assistance, such as attic insulation, caulking, water heater
blankets, and heating and cooling system repairs to low-income households.

Chapter 6: Housing Action Plan
This Housing Element Policy Document includes seven goal statements. Under each goal
statement, the element sets out policies that amplify the goal statement. Implementation
programs are listed at the end of each sub-section and describe briefly the proposed action, the
City agencies or departments with primary responsibility for carrying out the program, and the
time frame for accomplishing the program. Several of the implementation programs also have
quantified objectives listed.
The following definitions describe the nature of the statements of goals, policies,
implementation programs, and quantified objectives as they are used in the Housing Element
Policy Document:
        ÔÇß   Goal: Ultimate purpose of an effort stated in a way that is general in nature and
            immeasurable.
        ÔÇß   Policy: Specific statement guiding action and implying clear commitment.
        ÔÇß   Implementation Program: An action, procedure, program, or technique that carries
            out policy. Implementation programs also specify primary responsibility for
            carrying out the action and an estimated timeframe for its accomplishment. The
            timeframe indicates the calendar year in which the activity is scheduled to be
            completed. These timeframes are estimates, and not mandatory deadlines, except as
            expressly legal by law. They provide general guidelines and may be adjusted based
            on City staffing and budgetary considerations.
        ÔÇß   Quantified Objective: The number of housing units that the City expects to be
            constructed, conserved, or rehabilitated or the number of households the City
            expects will be assisted through Housing Element programs and based on
            anticipated market conditions during the eight-year timeframe of the Housing
            Element (October 31, 2013, to October 31, 2021).
Housing Goals and Policies
Goal 1          To develop, through public and private efforts, sufficient new housing
                to ensure the availability of affordable housing for all households in
                Isleton.
Policies
H-1.1     The City shall explore participation in various Federal and State housing funding
          programs, and shall encourage the use of programs that would allow local households
          of moderate income to purchase homes.
Page 58                                               Adopted February 26, 2014 | Certified April 24, 2014

                                                                  CHAPTER 6: HOUSING ACTION PLAN
H-1.2    The City shall allow mobile homes on permanent foundations on separate lots or
         within mobile home parks as a means to improve housing affordability for low- and
         moderate-income residents.
H-1.3    The City shall encourage participation by individuals, households, and the
         development community in various Federal and State programs intended to improve
         housing opportunity, including housing that might be made available under programs
         of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Self-Help, and Community Development Block
         Grants.
H-1.4    The City shall make information available on housing programs, housing availability,
         and housing assistance to all residents of the community.
H-1.5    The City shall strive to efficiently process the review and approval of zoning and
         building permits for new housing construction and remodeling, and shall maintain an
         equitable fee structure for such review.
H-1.6    The City will maintain an adequate supply of developable land to meet realistic
         housing demand within the limits of area available for new housing.
H-1.7    The City shall continue to work on meeting standards for the Cease and Desist Order
         to be lifted in order to ensure adequate sewer capacity.
Goal 2          To manage housing and community development in a manner that
                promotes the long-term integrity and value of each new housing unit
                and the neighborhood environment in which it is located.
Policies
H-2.1    The City shall approve extensions on time limits of approval for multi-family
         developments if adequate evidence is provided of circumstances beyond the control of
         the applicant that warrants such approval, other than failure to achieve financing.
H-2.2    The City shall consider mobile home parks as multi-family residential, with a
         maximum density of 8 units per net acre.
H-2.3    The City shall monitor progress in implementation of the Housing Element on an
         annual basis, with review by the City Council.
H-2.4    The City shall require the phased development of multi-family projects where
         appropriate as a means to mitigate potential adverse impacts of a proposed project that
         are time-sensitive, such as school impacts.
H-2.5    The City shall apply standards of on-site landscaped open space and recreation area to
         apply to multi-family projects of 20 or more housing units. Such standards shall not
Adopted February 26, 2014 | Certified April 24, 2014                                      Page 59
CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
          exceed those otherwise prescribed by the Recreation Element of the General Plan for
          neighborhood recreation needs.
H-2.6     The City shall strive to avoid the overconcentration of low- and moderate-income
          housing within any of the residential neighborhoods of the city.
Goal 3           To promote equal access to safe and decent housing for all economic
                 groups.
Policies
H-3.1     The City shall encourage infill housing in residential districts where essential services
          are available, especially in the Main Street Area.
H-3.2     The City shall require the use of Planned Unit Development (PUD) procedures of the
          Zoning Ordinance for multi-family projects involving 10 or more units in order to
          allow greater innovation in project design so as to increase housing affordability. The
          City shall monitor the effects of this policy to assure that it does not become a
          constraint to the development of multi-family housing and does not force the creation
          of higher cost housing at the expense of low-income households.
H-3.3     The City shall waive or allow modification of selected development standards under
          PUD zoning procedures for affordable housing projects where design proposals
          achieve the functional equivalent of existing improvement standards. It is to be noted
          that the granting of density bonuses for very low-, low-, and moderate-income housing
          is mandated by State Law; and that the above policy reflects part of that mandate.
H-3.4     The City shall permit smaller lots with a minimum of 4,000 square feet for subdivisions
          where housing units are designed specifically for the small lot under PUD procedures.
H-3.5     The City shall grant density bonuses under PUD zoning procedures in areas of
          Medium Density for projects which do not qualify under Policy HE-3.3, above, only if a
          project is judged successfully against quantitative and qualitative criteria which
          assures good design and the provision of amenities not normally provided under
          conventional approaches to residential project design. These types of density bonuses
          are entirely separate from those mandated by State Law for very low and low income
          households and are intended primarily for market rate housing.
H-3.6     Based upon competent community-wide housing market analysis, the City will:
          maintain an adequate ratio of single family homes to apartments to allow choice,
          affordability and availability in housing types; encourage an increase in home
          ownership; require that proposed income or rental subsidy apartment projects be
          justified by features of design, livability and availability of community services.
          Generally, an adequate ration is considered to be about 65 percent single-family to 35
          percent multi-family. It is understood, however, that the availability of sites for new

         housing within the City favors multi-family densities more than single family.
         Consequently the 65:35 ratio may be increased in favor of multi-family until such time
         that land within the Urban Reserve (land that the City has labeled for future possible
         annexation) may be annexed to permit a greater number of single-family units.
Goal 4          To provide for a choice of housing for residents with special housing
                needs including the elderly, disabled, farm workers, homeless, and
                other lower-income groups.
Policies
H-4.1    The City shall promote housing sites for the elderly and disabled that are within
         reasonable proximity to transportation services, medical facilities, recreation areas, and
         convenience shopping facilities, and where reasonable security by police and fire
         protection services can be assured.
H-4.2    The City shall encourage and pursue programs to assist lower-income and elderly
         residents to rehabilitate deteriorating housing.
H-4.3    The City shall encourage new housing units that are adaptable for disabled
         households. This can be accomplished by City staff at the building permit stage by
         assuring the elimination of barriers and by provisions for special handicapped needs
         such as lowered switches and flush doorways.
H-4.4    The City shall maintain a housing directory and referral service for disabled residents
         with participation by the private sector.
H-4.5    The City shall support local and regional efforts to provide emergency and transitional
         housing for local homeless individuals and families.
H-4.6    The City shall encourage participation in the Housing Choice Vouchers Program (i.e.,
         Section 8 rental assistance) administered by Sacramento County.
Goal 5          To maintain and improve the quality of the existing housing stock and
                the neighborhoods in which it is located.
Policies
H-5.1    The City shall administer strict enforcement of building and housing codes to achieve
         demolition of dilapidated houses, and actively pursue condemnation of vacant
         dilapidated housing units.
H-5.2    The City shall conserve and maintain the existing housing stock through building
         inspection participation in housing rehabilitation programs.

H-5.3     The City shall seek methods to alleviate overcrowding, including provision for some
          three or more bedroom apartments in new multi-family projects.
H-5.4     The City shall enforce the Historic Preservation Ordinance to preserve the character of
          Main Street as a historic mixed-use corridor.
Goal 6          To ensure equal access to sound, affordable housing for all residents.
Policies
H-6.1     The City declares that all persons regardless of race, color, religion, sex, sexual
          orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, familial status, source of income,
          or disability to have equal access to sound and affordable housing.

                neighborhoods.
Policies
H-7.1     The City shall require all new dwelling units to meet current State requirements for
          energy efficiency, and shall encourage retrofitting of existing units.
H-7.2     The City shall encourage energy efficiency in new land use patterns, to the extent
          possible.

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
Quantified Objectives
One of the requirements of State law (California Government Code Section 65583[b]) is that the
Housing Element contain quantified objectives for the maintenance, preservation,
improvement, and development of housing. The quantified objectives set a target goal for
Isleton to achieve based on needs, resources, and constraints. State law recognizes that the total
housing needs identified by a community may exceed available resources and the community‚Äôs
ability to satisfy this need. Under these circumstances, the quantified objectives need not be,
and are not intended to be, identical to the total housing needs. Table 34 shows the quantified
objectives for the City of Isleton.

                                                   APPENDIX A: EVALUATION OF EXISTING HOUSING ELEMENT
Appendix A: Evaluation of 2000 Housing Element
The City currently faces certain financial, infrastructure, and flooding constraints, which have
prevented Isleton from fully implementing the programs from the previous (2000) Housing
Element. These fiscal difficulties are largely due to the size of the City, small economic base, and
other fiscal issues that have occurred within the City. Infrastructural constraints include water
availability and inadequate sewage treatment facilities that do not meet the State Water Quality
Control Board standards.
The following is an evaluation of each of the actions from the previously adopted (2000)
Housing Element:
2000 Housing Element Action A-Provision of Adequate Sites for Housing
Development
A.1     As part of its annual monitoring of housing construction, City staff will provide the
        Planning Commission with recommendations for amending the General Plan, as
        necessary, to assure an adequate selection and availability of sites for low and low-
        moderate income housing. The recommendations will be consistent with applicable
        policies listed in this element and all other elements of the General Plan.
        Evaluation: Very few new units have been built in Isleton since 2000 and no General Plan
        recommendations were necessary to assure adequate sites. The City had, and continues to have,
        adequate vacant sites at appropriate densities to allow for a variety of housing types to meet the
        needs of residents of all income levels. This action is not necessary.
A.2     City Staff will maintain an updated map of sites available for low and low-moderate
        income housing, plus information on ownership, availability of utility services, density
        of development allowed by the General Plan, density bonuses or equivalent incentives
        available to prospective developers, applicable fees and procedures involved in the
        city‚Äôs development review and entitlement process. This information will be provided to
        the local Realtors, to housing developers operating within the Isleton housing market
        area and to the County Housing Authority. Annual publications will begin July 1, 2000.
        Evaluation: The City initiated a Housing Element update in 2007 that updated the sites
        inventory. While the Housing Element was never officially adopted, the updated sites inventory
        was available. The City will continue this program in the updated Housing Element.
2000 Housing Element Action B-Providing for the Housing Needs of Very Low-,
Low-, and Moderate-Income Households
B.1     The City will meet with representatives of the development community by March 2000
        to find innovative ways to meet housing needs. Thereafter, the meeting will be held
        annually in conjunction with monitoring and reporting to the Planning Commission on
        progress in meeting housing needs.
Adopted February 26, 2014 | Certified April 24, 2014                                              Page 69

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
        Evaluation: The City met with prospective developers of the former Village on the Delta to
        discuss ways to meet housing needs. The development was never completed due to the collapse of
        the housing market.
B.2     In conjunction with B.1, above, the City will contact and encourage developers and
        agencies which have had success in constructing housing for very low- and low-income
        households within Isleton‚Äôs housing market area to consider additional or new projects.
        Contacts will include those non-profit development organizations with experiences in
        constructing housing for seniors, families, single-parent households, such as Self Help,
        the Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME), and the Sacramento Mutual
        Housing Association. Opportunities will also be discussed with representatives of the
        development community participating in B.1, above.
        Evaluation: This action was never completed due to a lack of staff resources and lack of interest
        by the development community.
B.3     The City shall enact an ordinance providing that a minimum of 15 percent of all single-
        family and multi-family housing construction shall be made available on a permanent
        basis for occupancy by low income households.
        Evaluation: This action was never completed due to a lack of staff resources and lack of
        development interests. Given the state of the housing market, such a policy might discourage new
        development in Isleton. In addition, this policy would be difficult to implement now given recent
        court cases challenging inclusionary housing in California.
B.4     In conjunction with B.3, above, the City shall institute a silent second loan program to
        assist low-income households to purchase housing at affordable rates of interest.
        Funding for this program shall be from housing set aside funds maintained by the City‚Äôs
        Redevelopment Agency.
        Evaluation: This action was never completed due to a lack of staff resources and lack of funding.
        With the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency by the State of California, this program is no
        longer feasible.
2000 Housing Element Action C-Conservation and Improvement of Affordable
Housing
C.1     The City will conduct a coordinate effort with the Sacramento Housing and
        Redevelopment Agency to make housing rehabilitation loans available to eligible
        owners of deteriorating housing units, and to provide the technical assistance necessary
        to meet the procedural requirements of the various government assistance programs
        involved. The target month for beginning this program is March 2000.

                                                   APPENDIX A: EVALUATION OF EXISTING HOUSING ELEMENT
       Evaluation: This action was never completed due to a lack of staff resources and lack of funding.
       The City is still interested in pursuing grant funding to establish a rehabilitation loan and/or
       grant program, but has limited staff resources to administer the program.
C.2    The City will conduct a coordinated effort with the Sacramento Mutual Housing
       Association to develop a program of rental housing rehabilitation. This will include use
       of the authority of the City‚Äôs Redevelopment Agency as may be necessary to assure
       cooperation of the owners of rentals in need of rehabilitation. The target month for
       beginning this program is March 2000.
       Evaluation: This action was never completed due to a lack of staff resources and lack of funding.
       With the elimination of the Redevelopment Agency by the State of California, this program would
       be difficult to implement. The City is still interested in pursuing grant funding to establish a
       rehabilitation loan and/or grant program, but has limited staff resources to administer the
       program.
C.3    The City will conduct a door-to-door survey of the existing housing stock which is
       sound to identify those units in need of minor repairs or improvements. Examples
       include need for painting, roof repair or replacement and elimination of dry rot.
       Identified owners will be notified by mail of conditions observed, with offers by the City
       to assist owners in achieving needed repairs, including loans of grants if available. The
       target month for beginning this program is March 2000.
       Evaluation: The City completed this action as part of the update to the Housing Element in
       2007. The findings from the door-to-door survey are summarized in this Housing Element.
2000 Housing Element Action D-Promotion of Equal Housing Opportunity
D.1     The City will take the lead in establishing an inter-agency and citizen task force to
       identify and address special housing needs. This effort will include a description of the
       options available and providing assistance on the steps that can be taken by affected
       households to improve their housing condition. The target month for beginning this
       program is July 2000.
       Evaluation: This action was not completed. The City does not have dedicated staff to oversee the
       task force.
D.2    The City will serve as a clearinghouse for information required by rental households of
       their rights and protections under the law against discrimination in housing. The target
       month for completing this program is September 2000.
       Evaluation: Unknown.

CITY OF ISLETON HOUSING ELEMENT, 2013-2021
2000 Housing Element Action E-Provision of Low Rent Assistance
E.1     In conjunction with programs which seek to meet the needs of very low- and low-
        income groups and special groups described above, the City will seek and cooperate
        with qualified developers and non-profit housing organizations to construct rental
        assistance housing with priority given to qualified residents of Isleton an those people
        employed in Isleton who must now reside in other parts of the County.
        Evaluation: There has been little to no new development in Isleton in recent years and little
        interest by the development community since the housing collapse. No new rental housing has
        been constructed.
2000 Housing Element Action F-Energy Conservation
F.1     The City will engage in the following activities which foster energy conservation:
            1. An energy conservation program in conjunction with the Pacific Gas & Electric
                 Company.
            2. The use of solar equipment in new construction and remodeling of houses. The
                 City will consider the adoption of an ordinance which will assure access to
                 southerly positions of the sun in relation to roof-mounted solar equipment.
            3. The City actively enforces State construction standards for new housing.
        A time for beginning these programs will be when applications are filed with the City
        for building permits required for remodeling and new construction.
        Evaluation: PG&E offers an energy conservation program, as described in Chapter 5 of the
        Housing Element. The City has adopted solar access standards and continues to enforce State
        building standards.
2000 Housing Element Action G-Elimination of Governmental Constraints to
Meeting Housing Objectives
G.1     The City will methodically review and recommend amendments to the General Plan and
        City development regulations to the extent considered feasible and appropriate to
        eliminate or modify policies and regulations which may unnecessarily constrain the
        private sector in meeting housing objectives of the community. This review will cover
        each of the identified governmental constraints described in the Housing Element.
        Where constraints cannot be eliminated or modified, the reasons will be described. This
        program has been made a part of the General Plan Update for the period of 1999-2020,
        and will be continued as General Plan amendments and revisions to ordinances are
        considered by the City.

       Evaluation: The City updated the Zoning Ordinance in 2010 and removed certain barriers to
       development. This Housing Element Update includes several specific actions to amend the
       Zoning Ordinance to remove additional constraints. For example, the City is currently

Appendix C: Summary of Community Workshop
On December 7, 2013 at 10:00 a.m., the City held a community workshop on the Housing
Element Update. The following is a summary of the issues and other comments discussed at the
workshop:
   ÔÇ∑   FEMA is a major issue. Flooding has not been a major issue for some time, but FEMA
       requirements are a barrier to development.
   ÔÇ∑   Slum lords are an issue in Isleton and policing is a major issue. There is no code
       enforcement or policing of problematic rental properties. There are major drug issues
       and landlords either do nothing or are unable to address the issues. The City cannot
       afford to conduct code enforcement and without a police department, these issues are no
       addressed.
   ÔÇ∑   The City doesn‚Äôt want to discourage business in Isleton by penalizing landlords that are
       not dealing with the crime occurring in rental properties, but there needs to be some
       code enforcement to address the issues.
   ÔÇ∑   Boarding houses on Main Street are an important source of housing in Isleton. There are
       five or six different boarding houses that have shared bathroom and/or kitchen facilities
       and charge low rents.
   ÔÇ∑   There are several buildings along Main Street on the National List of Registered Historic
       Properties. The Housing Element could mention the City‚Äôs Historic Preservation
       Ordinance.
Eight people attended the workshop:
   ÔÇ∑   Chelsey Norton, Miniter Harnish, Consultant
   ÔÇ∑   Dan Hinrichs, City Manager
   ÔÇ∑   Warren Tellefson, Holmes International
   ÔÇ∑   Catherine Flynn, Citizen
   ÔÇ∑   Robert Jankovitz, City Council
   ÔÇ∑   Pamela Bulahan, City Council

Appendix D: SB 520 Analysis
In accordance with SB 520 (Chapter 671, Statutes of 2001), the City has analyzed the potential
and actual governmental constraints on the development of housing for persons with
disabilities and demonstrated the City‚Äôs effort to remove such constraints. The following shows
the City‚Äôs responses to the ‚ÄúSB 520 Analysis Tool‚Äù prepared by HCD.
SB 520 Analysis Tool
Overarching and General
        ÔÇß    Does the locality have any processes for individuals with disabilities to make
             requests for reasonable accommodation with respect to zoning, permit processing, or
             building laws?
             Normal city process.
        ÔÇß    Describe the process for requesting a reasonable accommodation.
             Ability to comment on applications through the project referral process; direct testimony to
             Staff, Planning Commission, or City Council during the project public hearing process.
        ÔÇß    Has the locality made any efforts to remove constraints on housing for persons with
             disabilities, such as accommodating procedures for the approval of group homes,
             ADA retrofit efforts, an evaluation of the zoning code for ADA compliance or other
             measures that provide flexibility?
             The City updated the Zoning Ordinance in 2010. The Ordinance allows for the placement of

           parking requirements for special needs housing if a project proponent can
           demonstrate a reduced need for parking?
           Parking standards in the Zoning Ordinance allow for reduced parking standards for elderly
           housing (one parking space per dwelling unit instead of two spaces).
       ÔÇß   Does the locality restrict the siting of group homes? How does this affect the
           development and cost of housing?
           The City defines group homes as rest homes. Rest homes are allowed in the R (Single-Family)
           zoning district by right serving six or fewer persons. Rest homes serving more than seven are
           a conditional use within the R and RM zoning districts.
       ÔÇß   What zones allow group homes other than those residential zones covered by State
           law? Are group homes over six persons also allowed?
           The City defines group homes as rest homes. Rest homes are allowed in the R (Single-Family)
           zoning district by right serving six or fewer persons. Rest homes serving more than seven are

           comply with Fair Housing Laws?
           The definition of family provided in the zoning code limits individuals unrelated by blood or
           marriage to five or fewer. This is inconsistent with the State law. The Housing Element
           includes Action 5.1 to amend the definition consistent with State law.
       ÔÇß   Does the land use element regulate the siting of special need housing in relationship
           to one another? Specifically, is there a minimum distance required between two (or
           more) special needs housing?
           None specified.
Permits and Processing
       ÔÇß   How does the locality process a request to retrofit homes for accessibility (i.e., ramp

           family zones? What permits, if any, are required?
