    Policy Document       xiv            1994
The Paradise General Plan revision process began during the latter part of 1990 when the Town Council selected
QUAD Consultants to assist with designing and implementing a work program for producing a new Paradise General
Plan. Over the ensuing three plus years, the program experienced three different Town Councils, four different
Planning Commissions and four different General Plan Steering Committees. In addition to the General Plan
Steering Committee, a strong and focused citizen subcommittee patiently followed the process and played a major
role in shaping the plan and maintaining continuity.
The community struggle regarding whether or not the town's commercial core area should be sewered has evolved
and matured during the production of the draft revised General Plan documents. The primary issues that meld the
sewer controversy and the revisions to the town General Plan are growth, health and safety.
Growth is an important issue to every community in California and invariably it becomes the focus of the
community's General Plan. To some, it represents traffic congestion, noise, air and water pollution, obstructed
viewsheds, health and safety problems, and Jong lines at the grocery store. To others, it represents possible
financial contributions from developers to the cures for improving a deteriorating local quality of life; and a way
to maintain current public services. Basic to all communities, growth represents change from the way it was and
the way it is, to something new.
This General Plan focuses on managing growth so that changes are predictable and occur in a manner that is
acceptable to the majority of people in the community. It distinguishes between population and economic growth,
choosing to manage residential and population growth, while at the same time seeking to stimulate and diversify the
local economy. The overall General Plan goal is to produce a community within the fifteen-year time frame of the
plan, that has contained its population growth, maintained its natural environment and rural setting, improved its
infrastructure, enhanced its open space, eliminated any health and safety problems and boosted its local economy.

The Town of Paradise, California is located in eastern
Butte County in the western foothills of the Cascade-
Sierra Nevada Mountains. Located north of Paradise
are the smaller unincorporated conununities ofMagalia,
Paradise Pines, Nimshew and DeSabla; to the south of
the town is the Lime Saddle area. These areas are
known as the Upper and Lower (Eden) Ridge,
respectively. To the southeast is the City of Oroville
(the county seat), and to the west is the City of Chico.
State Route 191 partially bisects the conununity and
ends at its intersection with Pearson Road, located in
south central Paradise, and the West Branch of the
Feather River flows along the easterly edge of the
community.
Three study areas were established for the town and
surrounding areas for the purpose of the General Plan:
 • Primary Study Area - reflects the existing
         town limits.

Population           Growth     and       Build     Out
Projections
The population growth anticipated over the next fifteen
years could average approximately 1. 3 percent
annually. The plan's growth management thrust is
intended to keep residential construction and population
growth near to that experienced over the past ten years.
Carrying this projection forward will result in a
population increase from the current 26, 000 to
approximately 31,114 by the year 2008. Using net
rather than gross acreage, the build-out population
projection is estimated at 29,752.
Build out projections contained in the Paradise General
Plan are based primarily on a survey of existing land
uses, the land use designations established by this plan,
and the vacant land gross acreage town wide. The
numbers have been modified from those contained in
the May 1992 draft General Plan, consistent with the
text revisions directed by the General Plan Revision
Steering Committee.
Table 2-2 contains estimated acreage, square footage,
dwelling units and population, as applicable to each
land use designation, at build out in accordance with the
General Plan. This information is presented for both
the Primary and Secondary Planning Areas. Dwelling
unit estimates are based on an average within the
density range for each land use designation, and actual
densities may be somewhat higher or lower, depending
upon the adequacy of infrastructure, the application of

   1
       Based on total gross acres allocated to each land use designation under General Plan.
   2
       Based on population density and building intensity ratios contained in Table 2-1. Residential densities are figured on the averaged
       allowable density; A-R density is figured on one unit per five acres. Commercial, Business Park and Industrial calculations allow for
       property constraints.
   3
       Based on Housing Condition Surveys, March 1991 and February 1990, and documentation for the development of the Paradise Area
       Transportation Model Planning prepared for the Butte County Council of Governments, October 1990; Mobile homes are included with
       single-family units.
   4
       Based on existing plus potential new, allowing for property constraints, and where data on existing square footage is available .
   .5  Based on average household size of 2.33 for single-family dwellings and 1.92 for multiple-family dwellings.
IMPORTANT NOTE: It is estimated that the numbers in the above table could be reduced up to ten percent when figuring net rather than
gross acreage. Accordingly, the projected population (total persons) at build out of net acreage would be approximately 12.505.

everything special about Paradise.
Third, the town must work diligently to provide an
adequate and reasonable level of public services. Town
government, the local citizenry, special service districts,
and all service providers must work together to develop
a unified approach to providing Paradise with an
efficient, cost effective, coordinated and comprehensive
delivery of public services.
Fourth, a real and concerted effort must be made to
support and encourage community education. The
children of Paradise need a quality education in order
to contribute to their community and to find success in
their lives. Life-long learning opportunities should also
be available to citizens of all ages, and an awareness of
local government and civic undertakings must become
paramount to a broader spectrum of the general public.

Unified School District in providing a well-rounded
quality educational environment to the children of
Paradise. Education of the children in the Paradise

• Improve and expand communication and
    cooperation between Paradise, Butte County,
    Chico and the various special districts in order to
    assure effective and sound land use decisions
    within the region.
Butte County, Chico and Oroville are all revising their
general plans during the early 1990s. The region is
expected to continue to grow as people, businesses and
industry become dissatisfied with the problems of being
located in major urban areas, and decide to relocate to
Northern California. It is a goal of the General Plan to
improve communication and coordination with other
jurisdictions and special districts to cooperatively
address planning issues from a regional standpoint.
 • Fully implement the               onsite    wastewater
    management district.
It is an objective of the General Plan to fully implement
and sustain the operations of the town onsite wastewater
management district.
 • Surface and groundwater quality shall be
    improved and preserved and the Paradise area
    watershed shall be protected.
It is a policy of the General Plan to protect the quality
of domestic water supplied to the community. The
primary mechanism for implementing the policy shall
 be to strive to influence activities within the watershed
and outside the town limits in order to preserve the
natural state and ecological integrity of the watershed.

Development projects should be designed in a manner

large parcels of land have reduced potential
development opportunities in the town. Generally, the
remaining vacant lands within the town are those with
some degree of constraints, which have tended to
discourage development in the past.
The remaining vacant lands devoid of major constraints
or with a small degree of constraints are located in
various parts of the community, ranging from the
properties just north of the golf course to smaller
pockets of parcels in the northeastern portion of town.
Larger land holdings south of Roe Road, east of Clark
Road, west of Neal Road, and north of Honey Run
Road all experience some degree of major constraints.
The opportunities of future development may include
infilling small pockets of vacant land within the
proposed rural residential, town residential, and
various commercially designated land areas. While the
town has not experienced a significant amount of
redevelopment or 'tear-down' type development, it is
expected that such an approach may provide valuable
opportunities for both residential and commercial
development within the fifteen-year time frame of the
plan.
The General Plan does designate additional land for
light industrial and business park development. The
potential for actual development of this land is
dependent upon, to some degree, the overcoming of
infrastructural constraints.
The General Plan also designates additional land for
community service land uses. The plan attempts to
provide new opportunities for community service type
development, such as residential care facilities, medical
offices, senior citizen and youth centers, and day care
facilities.
The General Plan directs revisions to the Downtown
Revitalization Plan which will focus on opportunities
and strategies for commercial development in the

                           Introduction
                           The purpose of the Noise Element is to identify and
                           appraise noise problems in the community. It must
                           recognize the guidelines adopted by the Office of Noise
                           Control in the state Department of Health Services. The
                           Noise Element analyzes and quantifies current and
                           projected noise levels for the following sources applicable
                           to the Paradise planning area:
                           •         Highways, arterials and major streets
                           •         General aviation airport operations
                           •         Local industrial plants
                           •         Other ground stationary noise sources which
                                     contribute to the community noise environment.
                           Current noise levels are analyzed and quantified in Section
                           7.0 of Volume ID, Environmental Setting. Projected noise
                           levels are analyzed and quantified in this chapter, and
                           projected noise contours are incorporated into the Land
                            Use Constraints Diagram contained in Chapter 2.0 The
                           noise contours have been used as a guide for establishing
                            a pattern of land uses in the Land Use Element that
                            minimizes the exposure of community residents to
                            excessive noise. This land use pattern is reflected in the

      practical application of the best-available noise reduction measures, an exterior noise level of up to 65 dB
      Ldn/CNEL may be allowed provided that available exterior noise level reduction measures have been
      implemented and interior noise levels are in compliance with this table.

   A.     Be the responsibility of the applicant.
   B.     Be prepared by a qualified person experienced in the fields of environmental noise assessment and
          architectural acoustics.
   C.     Include representative noise level measurements with sufficient sampling periods and locations to
          adequately describe local conditions and the predominant noise sources.
   D.     Estimate existing and projected (20 years) noise levels in terms of Ldn or CNEL and/or the standards
          of Table I-1, and compare those levels to the adopted policies of the Noise Element.
   E.     Recommend appropriate mitigation to achieve compliance with the adopted policies and standards of
          the Noise Element. Where the noise source in question consists of intermittent single events, the
          report must address the effects of maximum noise levels in sleeping rooms in terms of possible sleep
          disturbance.
   F.     Estimate noise exposure after the prescribed mitigation measures have been implemented.
   G.     Describe a post-project assessment program which could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the
          proposed mitigation measures.

•         Capital Improvements Program.                A program, administered by town govermnent and reviewed by
          the Planning Commission, which schedules permanent improvements five or more years into the future to
          fit the town's fiscal capability. The program is generally reviewed annually, and the first year of the
          program is adopted in the town's annual budget.
•         Carrying Capacity. The level of land use, human activity or development for a specific area that can
          be accommodated permanently without an irreversible change in the quality of air, water, land or plant and
          habitats. It may also refer to the upper limits beyond which the quality of human life, health, welfare,
          safety or community character within an area will be impaired. Carrying capacity is usually used to
          determine the potential of an area to absorb development.
•         Circulation.      Refers to the overall movement of automobiles, pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians, etc.
•         Clear Zone.       That section of an approach zone of an airport where the plane defining the glide path is

          Department of Housing and Urban development (HUD) and the state Department of Housing and
          Community Development (HCD). This grant allots money to cities and counties for housing and community
          development. Jurisdictions set their own program priorities within specified criteria.
•         Community Park. Land with full public access intended to provide recreation opportunities beyond
          those supplied by neighborhood parks. Community parks are larger in scale than neighborhood parks but

•         Consistent. Free from variation or contradiction. Programs in the General Plan are to be consistent,
          not contradictory or preferential. State law requires consistency between a general plan and implementation
          measures such as the zoning ordinance.
•         Constraint. Something that restricts, limits or regulates a given course of action. It is used in the
          General Plan to describe "constraints" to development. Environmental constraints include, but are not
          limited to, steep slopes, poor soils and rare and endangered plant and animal species. Infrastructural
          constraints can include poor roads, antiquated water distribution systems, a lack of service capacity of the
          local school district and a lack of a community sewer system.
•         Cut and Fill. The act of cutting into a slope and using the soil to backfill an area.    A common example
          is the construction of a roadway on a slope where earth is removed from the upper side of the cut into the
          hill and used to fill the lower or outer edge of the cut to widen the road.
•         Dedication of Land. The turning over by an owner or developer of private land for public use, and
          the acceptance of land for such use by the governmental agency having jurisdiction over the public function
          for which it will be used. Dedications for roads, parks, school sites or other public uses are often made
          conditions for town approval of a development.
•         Dedication, in lieu of. Cash payments which may be required of an owner or developer as a
          substitute for a dedication of land, usually calculated in dollars per lot or square foot of land or building
          area, and referred to as in lieu fees or in lieu contributions.
•         Density. The degree of crowding together of people or buildings. For housing, density is the number
          of permanent residential dwelling units per acre of land. All densities specified in the General Plan are
          expressed in maximum number of units per net developable acre. (See "Developable Acres, Net.") Density
          can be managed through zoning in the following ways: minimum lot sire requirements, floor area ratio,
          land use intensity ratio, setback and yard requirements, minimum house size requirements, ratios comparing
          number and types of housing units to land area, limits on units per acre, and other means. Maximum
          allowable density often serves as the major distinction between residential districts.

          square footage or additional residential units beyond the maximum for which the parcel is zoned, usually
          in exchange for the provision or preservation of an amenity at the same site or at another location. (See
          "Development Rights, Transfer of.")
•         Density Transfer. A way of retaining open space by increasing densities--usually in compact areas
          adjacent to existing urbanization and utilities--while leaving unchanged historic, sensitive or hazardous
          areas. For example, developers can buy or trade development rights of properties targeted for public open
          space and transfer the additional density to the base number of units permitted in the zone in which they
          propose to develop.
•         Design Guidelines. Guidelines established by a local municipality intended to advise and direct the
          design of buildings, roads, parking facilities, etc.
•        Developable Acres, Net. The portion of a site remaining after removing or deducting public or
         private road rights-of-way and land not developable (see "Developable Land"), and which can then be built
          upon. Net acreage includes requires yards or setback areas.
•         Developable Land. Land which is suitable as a location for structures and which can be developed
          free of or with minimal development constraints, and without disruption of, or significant impact on,
          natural resource areas.
•         Development. The physical extension and/or construction of urban land uses. Development activities
          include: subdivision of land; construction or alteration of structures, roads, utilities and other facilities;
          installation of septic systems; grading; deposit of refuse, debris or fill materials; and clearing of natural
          vegetation cover (with the exception of agricultural activities). Routine repair and maintenance activities
          are exempted.
•         Development Rights. The selling of rights to develop land by a landowner who maintains fee-simple
          ownership of the land. The owner keeps title but agrees to continue using the land as it has been used,
          and the holder of the development rights maintains the right to develop. Such rights usually are expressed
          in terms of density allowed under existing zoning.
•         Development Rights, Transfer of (TDR). Also known as "Transfer of Development Credits,"
          a program which can relocate potential development from areas where proposed land use or environmental
          impacts are considered undesirable (the "donor" site) to another ("receiver") site chosen on the basis of
          its ability to accommodate additional units of development beyond that for which it was zoned, with
          minimal environmental, social, and aesthetic impacts. (See "Development Rights.")
•         Detention Dam. Dams may be classified according to the broad function they serve, such as storage,
          diversion or detention. Detention dams are constructed to retard flood runoff and minimize the effect of
          sudden floods. Detention dams fall into two main types: in one type, the water is temporarily stored and
          released through an outlet structure at a rate which will not exceed the carrying capacity of the channel

          downstream; in the other type, the water is held as long as possible and allowed to seep into the permeable
         hanks of gravel strata in the foundation. The latter type is sometimes called a water-spreading dam or dike
         because its main purpose is to recharge the underground water supply. Detention dams are also constructed
          to trap sediment. They are often called debris dams.
•         Discourage.       To advise or persuade to refrain from.
•         Diversion.      The direction of water in a stream away from its natural course (i.e., as in a diversion that
          removes water from a stream for human use).
•         Dwelling Unit.      A room or group of rooms (including sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation facilities,
          hut not more than one kitchen) which constitutes an independent housekeeping unit, occupied or intended
          for occupancy by one family on a long-term basis.
•         Easement. Usually the right to use property owned by another for specific purposes. Easements are
          either for the benefit of land, such as the right to cross "A" to get to "B," or "in gross," such as a public
          utility easement. For example, "rear" lots without street frontage may be accessed via an easement over
          the "front" lots. Utility companies use easements over the private property of individuals to he able to
          install and maintain utility facilities.
•         Easement, Scenic. A tool that allows a public agency to use, at a nominal cost, private land for scenic
          enhancement, such as roadside landscaping or vista preservation.
•         Economic Base.         Economic base theory essentially holds that the structure of the economy is made up
          of two broad classes of productive effort--hasic activities which produce and distribute goods and services
          for export to firms and individuals outside a defined localized economic area, and nonbasic activities whose
          goods and services are consumed within the boundaries of the local economic area. The theory holds that
          the reason for the growth of a particular region is its capacity to also support the nonbasic activities which
          are principally local in productive scope and market area.
•         Economic Development.              The implementation of strategies to consciously and purposefully influence
          the local economy in order to provide jobs for town residents, increase per capita income and strengthen
          the local tax base.
•         Ecosystem. An interacting system formed by a biotic community and its physical environment.
•         Elderly Housing.        Typically one and two-bedroom apartments designed to meet the needs of persons
          sixty-two years of age and older, and restricted to occupancy by them.
•         Encourage.       To stimulate or foster a particular condition through direct or indirect action by the private
          sector or government agencies.
•         Enhance.      To improve existing conditions by increasing the quantity or quality of beneficial uses.

•        Environmental Impact Report Addendum. Additional information added to a draft EIR that
         discusses minor changes in the project. It is used only when the changes and revisions to the project do
         not introduce new potential impacts not addressed in the draft EIR, no substantial changes in the
         circumstances under which the project is undertaken have occurred since the production of the draft EIR,
         no new information has become available that would lead to a conclusion of potential significant impacts
         not addressed in the draft EIR, and the revisions and changes will not cause impacts determined to be
         insignificant in the draft EIR to now become significant.
•        Erosion. The loosening and transportation of rock and soil debris by wind, rain or ruuning water.
•        Exaction. A contribution or payment required as an authorized precondition for receiving a development

          such action(s).
•         Fire Hazard. Any condition or action which increases or may cause an increase of the bamrd or
          menace of fire or explosion to a degree greater than tbat customarily recognized as normal by persons in
          the public service of suppressing or extinguishing fires; or which may obstruct, delay or hinder, or may
          become the cause of an obstruction, delay or hinderance to the prevention suppression or extingnishment
          of the fire.
•         Flood, 100-Year. The magnitude of a flood expected to occur on the average every 100 years, based
          on historical data. The 100-year flood has a one one-hundredth, or one percent, chance of occurring in any
          given year.
•         Flood Plain. All land between a natural or rnanmade waterway and the upper elevation of the one

          for motorists to pull off or park and view maps, gather information, and generally become oriented to
          Paradise; or it may be a privately owned place which through special development standards or guidelines
          (e.g., for landscaping and signs), marks entry to the town; or a combination of both. The intent of the
          gateway designation on the General Plan Land Use Map is to ensure that a highly visible location in the
          town may be appropriately treated.
•         General Plan. A compendium of the town's policies regarding its long-term development, and designed
          in the form of official maps and accompanying text. The General Plan is a legal document required of
          each local agency by the State of California Government Code Section 65301 and is adopted by the town
          Council. The General Plan may be called a "town plan," "comprehensive plan" or "master plan."

                           SUMMARY OF DRAFT EIR
                  MITIGATION MONITORING PROGRAM
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
         The proposed project is the adoption of a revised General Plan for the Town of
Paradise and surrounding Planning Area. The planning period for the proposed General
Plan is 1992 through 2007. The Paradise Planning Area is located in eastern Butte
County in the western foothills of the Cascade-Sierra Nevada Mountains.
MITIGATION MONITORING PROGRAM
         The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) prohibits a public agency from
carrying out or approving a project for which an EIR identifies significant environmental
effects, unless findings relative to mitigation of those effects have been made. Section
21081.6 of the Public Resources Code (CEQA) requires the agency making those
findings--in this case, the Town Council of the Town of Paradise--to adopt a reporting
or monitoring program for adopted or required changes to mitigate or avoid significant
effects.     This program must be designed to ensure compliance during project
implementation. This code section also requires an agency having jurisdiction over
natural resources affected by a project, if requested by the Lead Agency, to submit a
proposed reporting or monitoring program for changes required or incorporated into the
project at its request.
         The proposed mitigation monitoring program for the proposed General Plan has
been integrated with the Summary of Potential Impacts and Proposed Mitigation
Measures which is set out on the table which follows.
         In addition to the mitigation monitoring program set forth in the chart, the State
General Plan Guidelines recommend that cities and counties establish formal procedures
for regularly monitoring the effectiveness of their general plans. When a monitoring
program reveals a plan inadequacy, the Town should amend or, if necessary, totally
revise the general plan to bring it up to date. The Town should annually review and
Paradise General Plan EIR                             S-1                     May 14, 1992
amend, as necessary, those portions of the plan having .a short-term focus, such as the
implementation measures. The review should take into account the availability of new
implementation tools, changes in funding sources, and the feedback from plan monitoring
activities. State law requires the local planning agency to provide an annual report to the
legislative body on the status of the plan and progress in its implementation.
AREAS OF CONTROVERSY AND ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED
         The proposed General Plan, almost by definition, addresses a number of issues
which are potentially controversial. Areas of controversy and issues to be resolved
identified by residents of Paradise and interested agencies include the following:
•        Rate, location and character of population growth and new development
•        Residential lot sizes
•        Loss of agricultural land
•        Air quality impacts of growth
•        Impacts of growth on wildlife and trees
•        Institution of sewer service in the community
•        Increased traffic
•        Cost and need for new or expanded public services, including police and fire,
         schools, parks, sewage disposal and water service
•        Aesthetics
•        Annexation of developed areas such as Paradise Pines and the Lime Saddle area.

                                       PREFACE
        This Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been prepared to address the
potential effects of adopting and implementing a General Plan, referred to throughout this
report as the Paradise General Plan, for the Town of Paradise and the surrounding
Planning Area included in the General Plan. The EIR conforms to the requirements of
the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970 (CEQA), as amended, and the State
CEQA Guidelines, as well as to the administrative procedures established by the Town
of Paradise for the preparation and processing of EIRs. In accordance with Sections
15050 and 15367 of the State CEQA Guidelines, the Town of Paradise is designated as
the lead agency for this report.
        An EIR is an informational document intended to provide the general public and
appropriate governmental decision-makers with a full understanding of the potential
environmental effects of a proposed project. The EIR process is intended to enable
public agencies to evaluate a project for determination of the significance of its effect(s)
on the environment, to examine and institute methods of reducing and/or eliminating the
severity of adverse impacts, and to consider alternatives to the project as proposed.
CEQA requires that major consideration be given to preventing environmental damage.
At the same time, it is recognized in CEQA that public agencies have obligations to
balance other public objectives, including economic and social factors, in determining
whether and how a project should be approved.
        This EIR accompanies the Paradise General Plan Policy Document (including the
seven mandatory elements), Land Use Diagram and Circulation Diagram (Volume I),
which set out the proposed physical development and circulation system for the Planning
Area. To an important extent, the considerations included in this EIR have influenced
the content of, and direction established by, the General Plan. This EIR also
incorporates by reference portions of the Environmental Setting document prepared for
the Paradise General Plan (Volume III).
        QUAD Consultants, a professional planning firm with offices in Sacramento,
Visalia, Bakersfield and Fresno, California, assisted the Town with the preparation of
this EIR and the Paradise General Plan.
Paradise General Plan EIR                   1-1                                May 15, 1992

                                 INTRODUCTION
1.1     PROPOSED ACTION
A.      The proposed actions for which this Environmental Impact Report (EIR) has been
prepared include the following:
•       Adoption and subsequent implementation of a General Plan for the Town of
        Paradise and the surrounding area, known as the Paradise General Plan.
•       Subsequent Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance amendments and changes of zone
        to achieve consistency with the General Plan.
B.      The objectives of this project are to:
•       Identify the Town's land use, circulation, environmental, economic and social
        goals and policies as they relate to land use and development through the year
        2007.
•       Provide a basis for Town decision-making, including a nexus to support
        development exactions as required by Nollan v. California Coastal Commission
        (1987).
•       Provide citizens with opportunities to participate in the planning and decision-
        making processes of local government.
•       Inform citizens, developers, decision-makers, other cities and Butte County of the
        ground rules that will guide development within the Town.
        The area encompassed by the General Plan is described as the Paradise Planning
Area. The Paradise Planning Area consists of the Town of Paradise and the surrounding
Secondary and Tertiary Planning Areas to the north and south, as shown in Figure 2-3.
All future development activities within this area, as well as the continuation of existing
Paradise General Plan EIR                    2-1                               May 15, 1992

or established uses, would be carried out or sustained in accordance with the adopted
Paradise General Plan. The Plan will be adopted by, and administered under the
auspices of, the Town of Paradise. For the portions of the Planning Area which are in
the unincorporated area of Butte County, the County will be requested to adopt and
administer an identical or substantially similar plan and approach to land use decision-
making.
1.2     PROCEDURES
        This EIR has been prepared for the Town of Paradise by QUAD Consultants in
accordance with applicable provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) and the State Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental
Quality Act (California Administrative Code, Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3). As
provided in Section 15121 (a) of the Guidelines, this EIR is to serve as an informational
document that will:
        .. .inform public agency decision-makers and the public generally of the
        significant environmental effects of a project, identify ways to minimize
        the significant effects, and describe reasonable alternatives to the project. ..
        Although a general plan and an EIR on a general plan are legally distinct, they
must address many of the same concerns, and the processes for preparing them are
similar. According to the State General Plan Guidelines a thorough process for revising
an entire general plan will cover "virtually every substantive requirement of an EIR ...
A well-prepared general plan EIR covering broad geographic areas can increase the
possibility that negative declarations can be issued at a later time for specific project
proposals within the planning areas." The CEQA Guidelines recognize that a general
plan EIR will not be as specific as an EIR on an individual project.
        CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines authorize the use of the general plan EIR for
subsequent discretionary projects in order to streamline and simplify environmental
review. Through "tiering", the environmental review for subsequent project is limited
to the additional significant effects which were not examined in the general plan EIR or
effects which may be mitigated by specific revisions in the project.
        The adoption of the proposed Paradise General Plan is a discretionary action of
the Town of Paradise. Consequently, the Town is defined under CEQA as the lead
Paradise General Plan EIR                     2-2                                 May 15, 1992
agency for the project. In accordance with State Planning Law and with the CEQA
Guidelines, the Town will adopt the Plan only after a minimum of one public hearing
each before the Planning Commission and the Town Council.
        The Town, following a forty-five day public review and comment period on the
Draft EIR and public testimony on the environmental effects of the Plan, will address
concerns raised by the public and by responsible and trustee agencies (as defined by
CEQA) in a published Final EIR. The Town Council will certify this Final EIR
preceding the adoption of the Paradise General Plan. Measures and programs prescribed
in the Final EIR to mitigate potentially significant effects on the environment associated
with carrying out the General Plan and related actions will be imposed by the Town upon
future developers, upon itself, and upon other parties involved in implementing aspects
of the Plan.
1.3     METHODOLOGY/SCOPE OF EIR
        This EIR discusses and evaluates the potential effects of the approval, and
subsequent implementation, of a General Plan for the Town of Paradise and the
surrounding Planning Area included in the General Plan. Included in this environmental
analysis are the direct effects of building out the portions of the Planning Area designated
for development, as well as the cumulative and growth-inducing effects upon the
community and regional environments. The EIR will also take into consideration the
mitigating effects of many of the goals, objectives, policies and implementation measures
which are a part of the General Plan.
        In April 1991, the Town of Paradise distributed a Notice of Preparation (NOP)
of the subject EIR, inviting responsible and trustee agencies and other interested parties
to comment upon the appropriate scope of the environmental analysis. A copy of this
NOP, and of the responses received by the Town, are included as Appendices A and B,
respectively, of Volume II, Environmental Impact Report.
        Based upon the Initial Study of the Plan's potential environmental effects and
upon the comments received in response to the referenced NOP (see Appendices A and
B), it has been determined that this EIR should be focused upon the following aspects of
the environment:
 •      Topography
Paradise General Plan EIR                     2-3                                May 15, 1992

  ~
•       Geology/Seismicity
•       Soils
•       Air Quality
•       Hydrology
•       Vegetation and Wildlife
•       Noise
•       Light and Glare
•       Land Use and Population
•       Housing
•       Health Hazards and Safety
•       Transportation and Circulation
•       Public Facilities and Services
•       Scenic and Cultural Resources
        Aspects of the environment other than those listed and discussed above have been
determined by the Town of Paradise to be unlikely to incur significant Plan related
impacts. This EIR, therefore, will be confined to the topical areas referenced and to
CEQA - mandated discussion of such general issues as the Plan's possible irreversible
environmental effects, alternatives to the proposed Plan, and the comparative
environmental superiority among such alternatives.
        According to the State General Plan Guidelines:
        Because a general plan and its EIR overlap in content and should be
        prepared as part of a single planning process, local governments may want
Paradise General Plan ElR                    2-4                             May 15, 1992

        to combine them into a single document or set of documents (CEQA
         Guidelines, Section 15166).
        Three documents have been prepared which, taken together, constitute this
Environmental Impact Report.            Volume III, the Environmental Setting, contains
information on the physical and environmental setting, including inventories of soils,
geology, hydrology, air quality, vegetation, wildlife, energy, cultural heritage, ambient
noise, existing land use, transportation, population, public services, and water quality,
and a description of relevant local and regional plans. This document constitutes both
the data and analysis out of which General Plan policies have evolved and the
environmental setting section of the EIR.
        The first document, Volume I, Policy Document, consists of the policies, plan
proposals, standards and implementation program of the General Plan. In essence, this
document is the project and constitutes the project description for purposes of CEQA.
This document, Volume III, consists of the environmental assessment - the discussion of
effects, mitigation measures, and alternatives which satisfies the requirements of an EIR.
Ultimately, the three documents are to be certified as the EIR, while Volumes I and II
are to be adopted as the General Plan.
        The scope and analysis of the issues discussed above conforms to the Standards
for Adequacy of an EIR (CEQA Guidelines Section 15151), which states:
         An EIR should be prepared with a sufficient degree of analysis to provide
        decision-makers with information which enables them to make a decision which
        intelligently takes account of environmental consequences. An analysis of the
        environmental effects of a proposed project need not be exhaustive, but the
         sufficiency of an EIR is to be reviewed in the light of what is reasonably feasible.
         Disagreement, among experts does not make an EIR inadequate, but the EIR
         should summarize the main points of disagreement among the experts. The
         courts have looked not for perfection but for adequacy, completeness, and a good
         faith effort at full disclosure.
         The environmental effects of a change in an adopted plan and the range of
 discussion of potential impacts for issues such as police and fire protection and schools
 are guided in this EIR by the definition of "environment" in the CEQA Guidelines:
Paradise General Plan EIR                    2-5                                May IS, 1992
        Environment means the physical conditions which exist within the area
        which will be affected by the proposed project, including land, air, water,
        minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of historical or aesthetic
        significance. (Section 15360)
        Further, Section 15146 (b) states that "An EIR on projects such as the adoption
or amendment of ... a local general plan should focus on the secondary effects that can
be expected to follow from the adoption, but the EIR need not be as detailed as an EIR
on the specific construction projects that might follow. Accordingly, the impacts of the
proposed Paradise General Plan and related actions are not evaluated in terms of change
just in allowable land uses from the current Town General Plan and zoning plan, but
rather in terms of the actual effects on the physical environment, as it exists now,
attributable to Plan implementation. It should be noted that possible social and/or
economic effects of a project are not considered environmental impacts under CEQA,
unless they, in turn, result in adverse, identifiable effects on the physical environment.
        The consideration of alternatives to the proposed project in this EIR has been
conducted in conformance with Section 15126 (d) of the CEQA Guidelines, which
prescribes:
        (3) The discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives capable of
        eliminating any significant adverse environmental effects or reducing them
        to a level of insignificance ...
        (5) The range of alternatives required in an EIR is governed by "rule of
        reason" that requires the EIR to set forth only those alternatives necessary
        to permit a reasoned choice. The key issue is whether the selection and
        discussion of alternatives fosters informed decision-making and informed
        public participation.
        The next chapter of this report describes the project in greater detail and
summarizes the general characteristics of the Planning Area and vicinity. Chapter Three
of this EIR describes specific characteristics of the Plan's environmental setting,
organized within the framework of the topical areas of focus prescribed in response to
the Town's Initial Study and responses to the Notice of Preparation. Chapter Three also
identifies and discusses potentially significant project-related impacts on those selected
aspects of the environment and sets forth mitigation measures for these impacts, as
Paradise General Plan EIR                    2-6                                 May 15, 1992
appropriate. Chapter Four evaluates alternatives to the proposed Plan, including: the
alternative of no Plan update, and alternative land use and circulation system scenarios.
An alternative location for the Plan is evaluated only to the extent that alternative
Planning Area boundaries have been considered.
        The fifth and final chapter of this EIR summarizes significant environmental
effects of the proposed Plan which cannot be avoided and evaluates the cumulative
impacts and growth-inducement potential of the project. Following the text of this
report, several appendices and references have been included to facilitate full
environmental review of the Plan. Additional technical appendices referred to in this
EIR document are included in Volume II, Environmental Setting, addressing in detail key
aspects of the Paradise General Plan's environmental setting. Those technical
appendices are to be regarded as an integral part of this EIR.

                                 CHAPTER TWO
                           PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1     LOCATION
        The Planning Area for the proposed Paradise General Plan is situated in eastern
Butte County in the western foothills of the Cascade-Sierra Nevada Mountains and
includes the Town of Paradise and surrounding unincorporated area of Butte County (see
Figures 2-1 and 2-2). Located north of Paradise are the smaller unincorporated
communities of Magalia, Paradise Pines, Nimshew and De Sabia; to the south of the
Town is the Lime Saddle area. These areas are known as the Upper and Lower (Eden)
Ridge, respectively. To the southeast is the City of Oroville (the County seat), and to
the west is the City of Chico. State Route 191 and the Skyway are the primary access
routes to the Town from State Highway 99. State Route 191 becomes Clark Road and
bisects the community, ending near the northerly town limits. The South Fork of the
Feather River flows through the Feather River Canyon along the easterly edge of the
community.
        Three study areas were established for the Town and surrounding areas for the
purpose of the General Plan: the Primary Study Area, which reflects the existing Town
limits; the Secondary Study Area, which encompasses the existing Sphere of Influence
boundary adopted for the Town by the Butte County Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO); and the Tertiary Study Area, which extends to the south and west
to Highway 99 and Pentz Road. The Paradise General Plan refers to these areas as the
Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Planning Areas respectively. These areas are shown
on Figure 2-3. For purposes of the EIR, the terms "Study Area", "Planning Area" or
"Plan Area" refer collectively to the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Study Areas.
        The Paradise town limits (Primary Study Area) encompasses approximately
11,820 acres, and the Secondary Study Area includes an additional 17,686 acres. The
Planning Area includes all or portions of Sections 1, 2, 11, 12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 25, 26,
35 and 36, Township 23 North, Range 3 East; Sections 7, 18, 19, 30 and 31, Township

2.2     DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED GENERAL PLAN
        Chapter 1.0 of Volume I, the Policy Document, Section 1.1 explains the purpose
and nature of the General Plan. Chapter 2.0 describes the Land Use Diagram,
Circulation Diagram and Land Use Constraints Diagram and includes land use
designations and standards, circulation system classifications, planned circulation system
improvements and classifications, and a population density/land use and building intensity
matrix. Chapter 6.0 contains the goals, objectives, policies, implementation measures,
standards and programs which comprise the Paradise General Plan.
2.3     RELATED ACTIONS
        Following adoption of the Paradise General Plan, the Town will undertake
amendments to the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances to achieve consistency with the
General Plan. It is intended that this EIR will also be used by the Town as the
environmental documentation for subsequent proposed Zoning and Subdivision Ordinance
amendments.

                                 CHAPTER THREE
             ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING, IMPACTS AND
                           MITIGATION MEASURES
3.1     INTRODUCTION
        As discussed in Chapter One, this EIR has been prepared to address the potential
environmental effects of the adoption and implementation of a General Plan to guide land
use, development and transportation systems in and around the Town of Paradise.
Chapter One also identified the aspects of the environment which might be affected
significantly by the Plan. In the following sections of this chapter, each of these aspects
of the environment is discussed. For each topical area considered, reference is made to
the relevant section(s) of Volume III, the Environmental Setting, for a description of the
setting. Potential project-related impacts upon that setting are identified, and means of
mitigating possible significant environmental impacts are outlined.
        It should be noted that CEQA requires an EIR to suggest mitigation measures
which will potentially offset any identified significant effects upon the environment, if
such measures are available. It should also be noted that the State CEQA Guidelines
mandate that mitigation measures proposed to be incorporated into the project must be
distinguished from those proposed independently in the EIR. Finally, State law requires
that the agency or other party responsible for carrying out identified mitigation measures
be designated through the CEQA process. Accordingly, this EIR specifies, for each
mitigation measure it proposes, the party responsible for its implementation.
        Because this is an EIR for a general plan, the goals, objectives, policies, and
implementation measures of the Plan itself are designed to mitigate or avoid impacts on
the environment. Reference will be made to the pertinent Plan policy statement when
that constitutes a mitigation measure.         Additional mitigation measures may be
incorporated into the Plan, if relevant, or simply incorporated into the Mitigation
Monitoring/Reporting Program adopted for the Plan.

units and population at General Plan buildout for the Primary and Secondary Planning
Areas. This table will be referenced throughout this Chapter.
3.2     TOPOGRAPHY
Setting:                Please refer to Section 3.1 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of the topography of the Paradise Planning Area.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: The Uniform Building Code
                        establishes standards with regard to construction on slopes. The
                        Town of Paradise has amended Chapter 70 of the Uniform
                        Building Code to impose additional requirements with regard to
                        grading, slopes and erosion control.         The significance of
                        topographic-related impacts can be measured in comparison to
                        these thresholds and a determination made as to whether the
                        topographical features of the Planning Area impede compliance
                        with these standards, or whether the Plan prescribes development
                        which conflicts with these standards.
                        Impacts of Planning Area development must also be evaluated to
                        determine the potential for site modifications to cause any impact
                        to unique landforms such as ridgelines and canyons.
                        Impact #3.2.1-1: Potential for land development and construction
                        or improvement of roads and other infrastructure in accordance
                        with the Paradise General Plan which will create excessive cuts
                        and fills or result in excessive road grades.         Potential for
                        topography to hinder adequate access.
                        Conclusion: The Planning Area contains excessively slop.ing lands
                        (refer to Figure 3-1, Slope, of Volume III, Environmental Setting)
                        and the potential exists for significant impacts to occur if
                        development and construction were unregulated. However, the
                        policy statements that are incorporated in the proposed Paradise
                        General Plan and the regulations of the Town Subdivision

                        Standards and the Uniform Building Code, as amended by the
                        Town, will reduce these potential impacts to a level which is less
                        than significant.
                        The proposed policy statements which are incorporated in the
                        General Plan which will reduce impacts on topography are as
                        follows:

                                       be recognized in site-specific design as well as
                                       when establishing long-term growth objectives.
                        LUP-2          Building on slopes in excess of 30 percent shall not
                                       be permitted.
                        Safety Element
                        SP-18          The Town shall require all development proposals
                                       on sites which contain slopes exceeding 20 percent,
                                       and/or which border or include significant and
                                       sensitive streamcourses or natural drainageways, to
                                       include programs for replanting and slope
                                       stabilization, erosion control plans, and to
                                       incorporate designs which minimize grading and
                                       cut-and-fill.
                        SP-19          Building on slopes in excess of 30 percent shall not
                                       be permitted.
                        The Town has amended the Uniform Building Code to read as
                        follows:
                        Section 7001. The purpose of this chapter is to safeguard life,
                        limb, property and the public welfare, and to preserve and enhance
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-3                              May 15, 1992
                        the natural environment by preventing and eliminating conditions
                        of accelerated erosion and by regulating grading on private and
                        public property in the incorporated areas of the Town of Paradise.
                        Section 7002. This chapter sets forth rules and regulations to
                        control excavation, grading and earthwork construction, including
                        fills and embankments, and erosion and sediment control;
                        establishes the administrative procedure for issuance of permits;
                        and provides for approval of plans and inspection of grading,
                        erosion and sediment control operations.
                        Section 7003. No person shall do any grading, clearing or
                        grubbing without first having obtained a grading permit from the
                        Town Engineer except for the following:
                        1.      An excavation which does not exceed two feet in vertical
                        depth at its deepest point measured from the original ground
                        surface and which does not create a cut slope greater than four feet
                        in height and steeper than one and one-half horizontal to one
                        vertical and does not exceed twenty-five cubic yards of material,
                        2.      A fill that does not exceed one foot in vertical depth and is
                        placed on natural terrain with a slope flatter than five horizontal to
                        one vertical at its deepest point measured from the natural ground
                        surface, or less than three feet in depth, not intended to support
                        structures, which does not exceed twenty-five cubic yards on any
                        one lot and does not change the existing drainage pattern,
                        3.      Temporary excavations in a public street or right-of-way
                        for which a permit has been issued by the Department of Public
                        Works,
                        4.      An excavation below finish grade for a basement, footing,
                        retaining wall, swimming pool, or other structure authorized by a
                        valid permit, which excavation will be completely occupied by and
                        retained by the structure authorized by valid building permit,
Paradise General Plan EIR                      4-4                                May 15, 1992
                        5.      A fill above existing grade, which fill will be retained by
                        the exterior wall of a building, a retaining wall, swimming pool or
                        other structure authorized by a valid building permit.
                        The Town has adopted design specifications for public and private
                        roads and streets which include the requirement that public street
                        or road grades shall not exceed ten percent except with written
                        permission of the Town Engineer. The maximum grade for
                        private roads or streets is thirteen percent.         Under certain
                        conditions where it is obvious the proposed roads will never serve
                        more than six to eight lots, no hazardous traveling is envisioned,
                        and it is deemed the health and safety of all who may use such
                        roadway are not endangered with consideration given to road
                        construction, erosion, surfacing and cross slope, the maximum
                        grade may be greater than thirteen percent but not to exceed fifteen
                        percent. Any grade in excess of thirteen percent is required to
                        have an all-weather, non-skid surface.
                        Because all construction and development must be in compliance
                        with these policies and regulations, this impact is found to be less
                        than significant and no mitigation measures are required.
                        Impact #3.2.1-2: Potential for modification of ridgelines, canyons
                        or other significant landforms during construction and development
                        in accordance with the General Plan.
                        Conclusion: Ridgelines and canyons are dominant features of the
                        topography of the Paradise Planning Area. The potential exists for
                        significant impacts to occur if development and construction were
                        unregulated. However, the policy statements which have been
                        incorporated in the proposed Paradise General Plan and the
                        regulations of the adopted Town Improvement Standards and
                        Uniform Building Code, as amended, will reduce these potential
                        impacts to a level which is less than significant.
Paradise General Plan EIR                      4-5                              May 15, 1992
                        The policies that are incorporated in the proposed General Plan,
                        in addition to those listed in Impact #3.2.1-1 above, which will
                        reduce impacts on significant landforms are as follows:
                        Open Space/Conservation/Energy Element
                        OCEP-17        Ridgeline development shall be carefully reviewed
                                       to assure a minimization of proposed structures that
                                       intrude into the view-line of nearby roadways and
                                       properties.
                        OCEP-27        Open space or resource conservation zoning shall be
                                       established for sensitive lands such as areas of
                                       resource production, steep canyons and stream
                                       corridors, and areas of significant natural resource
                                       value.
                        Because all construction and development must be in compliance
                        with these policies and regulations, this impact is found to be less
                        than significant and no mitigation measures are required.
Mitigation
Measures:               Because no significant impacts have been identified, no mitigation
                        measures are required.
3.3     GEOLOGY/SEISMICITY
Setting:                Please refer to Section 3.2 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of geology and seismicity of the Paradise
                        Planning Area.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: All of Butte County is situated in a
                        UBC Risk Zone 3 and rated VIII by the Modified Mercalli
                        Intensity Scale. A total of 3, 125 new dwelling units and 1.67
                        million square feet of new commercial, industrial and other
                        structures may be constructed in the Primary Planning Area at full
                        buildout under the proposed General Plan, in addition to 1,949
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-6                               May 15, 1992
                        new dwelling units and 1.01 million square feet in the Secondary
                        Planning Area.        Landslides, subsidence, liquefaction, dam
                        inundation hazards and volcanic hazards are all potentially
                        significant impacts, depending upon the likelihood that such events
                        will occur. The assessments of risk related to these hazards in the
                        Butte County Safety Element and the Paradise Multihazard Disaster
                        Plan are used as impact evaluation criteria.
                        Impact #3.3-1:       Potential to expose people and property to
                        earthquakes.
                        Conclusion: All new structures must be constructed in compliance
                        with the standards of the UBC and are less like! y to suffer
                        structural damage than existing structures built before such
                        regulations were in place. According to the Paradise Multihazard
                        Disaster Plan, while there are no known earthquake faults within
                        the Planning Area, the Planning Area does encompass several
                        active fault zones and is subject to earthquakes of the magnitude
                        of 6.9 on the Richter scale. While the general seismic hazards
                        experienced in the Paradise Planning Area are effectively
                        addressed through the standards of the UBC in terms of structural
                        damage, seismic events can also result in secondary impacts,
                        including fires, disruption of water supply and utilities, and other
                        hazards to which new development would be exposed. The
                        General Plan would not, however, increase the hazards to which
                        people and property are exposed. The General Plan does
                        incorporate an implementation measure which will reduce impacts
                        due to seismic activity; not, however, to a level which is less than
                        significant due to the increased exposure of people and property to
                        secondary impacts. This measure is as follows:
                        Safety Element
                        SI-8            Enforce and comply with the prov1s1ons of the
                                        Uniform Building Code and the Uniform Fire Code.

                        The impact is determined to be potentially significant and
                        unavoidable if the General Plan is approved. No additional
                        mitigation measures are available.
                        Impact #3.3-2: Potential to expose people and property to the
                        effects of liquefaction, landslides and dam inundation hazards.
                        Potential to expose structures, roads and utilities to the effects of
                        subsidence.
                        Conclusion: According to the Butte County Safety Element, the
                        Paradise Planning Area is rated as having a low landslide potential
                        and is not within an area of potential subsidence. It is in an area
                        with generally low potential for liquefaction.           While dam
                        inundation hazards are not addressed in the Safety Element, the two
                        dams within the Planning Area are subject to annual safety
                        inspections and were not identified as hazards in the Multihazard
                        Disaster Plan.        Impacts related to liquefaction, landslides,
                        subsidence and dam inundation hazards are determined to be less
                        than significant.
                        Impact #3.3-3: Potential to expose people and property to the
                        hazards associated with volcanic eruption of Lassen Peak. At a
                        distance of 70 miles, the most likely impact that would be
                        experienced in the Paradise Planning Area is ashfall, which can
                        cause damage to engines, stormwater and sewer systems, and
                        sewage and water treatment plants; loss of visibility and associated
                        impacts (such as vehicle accidents and impeded evacuation);
                        collapse of flat-roofed structures due to weight; and respiratory
                        illnesses.
                        Conclusion: According to the Multihazard Disaster Plan, though
                        most of the eruptions in the Lassen Peak area have been small, it
                        is believed that it is capable of much larger eruptions. An eruption
                        could be expected within the next I 00 years, with the severity
                        unknown. The General Plan would not, however, increase the
                        hazards to which people and property are exposed.                The
                        Multihazard Disaster Plan recommends several guidelines for
Paradise General Plan EIR                       4-8                              May 15, 1992
                        volcanic eruption planning, and the General Plan proposes to
                        adopt the Multihazard Disaster Plan by reference. The General
                        Plan does incorporate policy statements and implementation
                        measures which will reduce impacts due to volcanic hazards; not,
                        however, to a level that is less than significant. Those policy
                        statements and implementation measures are as follows:
                        Circulation Element
                        CP-8            Creation of additional connections north to Paradise
                                        Pines; west to east to Feather River Hospital; and
                                        from west to east in the southern portion of the
                                        Town shall be studied.

                                        activity and wildland fires, and the Town of
                                        Paradise Multihazard Disaster Plan.
                        SI- 7           Adopt the Town of Paradise Multihazard Disaster
                                        Plan by reference in the General Plan.
Mitigation
Measures:               No additional mitigation measures are available for Impact #3.3-1.
                        Because no significant impacts have been identified for Impacts
                        #3.3-2 and #3.3-3, no mitigation measures are required.
3.4     SOILS
Setting:                Please refer to Section 3.3 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of the soils of the Paradise Planning Area.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: Soil impacts fall into two general
                        areas of concern:
                        •      Impacts related to agricultural productivity of soils
Paradise General Plan EIR                      4-9                              May 15, 1992

                        •       Impacts related to suitability of soils for development and
                                erosion hazards
                        The significance of impacts on agricultural productivity can be
                        measured by comparison of soil types to the U.S. Soil
                        Conservation Service (SCS) Land Capability Classification System.
                        Conversion of prime soils (Class I and II), those best suited for
                        cultivation, should be considered significant. A MODERN SCS
                        SOIL SURVEY HAS NOT BEEN PREPARED FOR THE
                        PLANNING AREA. Information available from soil surveys of
                        the Valley floor indicate that foothill lands in Butte County are
                        generally of low agricultural capability (Classes VII and VIII).
                        Although soil may not be prime, it may have other unique and
                        beneficial uses.
                        A soil-vegetation survey prepared in 1980 by the California
                        Department of Forestry did not rate the land for agricultural
                        suitability, but rather for suitability for timber production and
                        extensive range use. The potential for conversion of soils with a
                        medium to high potential for timber production and range use to
                        nonagricultural uses should be considered significant, provided that
                        such soils are found in parcels of sufficient size to make timber
                        production and range use (grazing) commercially viable.
                        Butte County, which currently has jurisdiction over the Secondary
                        Planning Area, has established a minimum parcel size of 160 acres
                        for grazing land and 160 acres for timber preserve. Where lands
                        are used for grazing and such use and parcel size complies with
                        County zoning, their conversion to other uses or division into
                        smaller parcels should be considered significant.
                        Impact #3.4-1: The conversion of potentially productive soils for
                        timber production and grazing use to nonagricultural uses.
                        Conclusion: Of the dominant soil types within the Primary and
                        Secondary Planning Areas, the Aiken soils are rated as medium to
                        very high suitability for timber production and unsuited to medium
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-10                               May 15, 1992

                        suitability for range use; Toomes soils are rated as unsuited for
                        timber production and low suitability for range use; Supan soils
                        are rated as unsuited for timber production and medium suitability
                        for range use; Pentz soils are rated as unsuited for timber
                        production and high suitability for range use; Stover soils are rated
                        as unsuited for timber production and medium suitability for range
                        use; and Guenoc soils are rated as unsuited for timber production
                        and low suitability for range use.
                        Based on these ratings, new development on Aiken, Supan and
                        Pentz soils which precludes their use for timber production and
                        grazing is potentially significant. Aiken soils, which are the
                        predominant soil type (45 %), are primarily found within the town
                        limits (Primary Planning Area) and the portion of the Secondary
                        Planning Area north of the town limits. New development is not
                        proposed within the northerly Secondary Planning Area, and
                        portions of the area are zoned Timber Preserve (TPZ) in Butte
                        County and are proposed to be designated as "Timber Preserve"
                        in the General Plan. The likelihood that timber production would
                        be proposed within the town limits is remote, due to the built-up
                        nature of the area and the small existing parcel sizes. Impacts on
                        soils suitable for timber production are therefore determined to be
                        less than significant, and no mitigation measures are required.
                        Pentz, Supan and Stover soils are the dominant soil types in the
                        southerly Secondary Planning Area and are rated as high, medium
                        and medium suitability, respectively, for grazing use. However,
                        only one parcel within this area is 160 acres in size; all other
                        parcels are less than 160 acres. The 160-acre parcel includes
                        Stover and Pentz soils.        This parcel is designated "Open
                        Space/ Agricultural" in the proposed General Plan. While the
                        General Plan provides for the eventual conversion to
                        nonagricultural use of the southerly Secondary Planning Area, no
                        determination has been made as to the ultimate use of that
                        particular 160-acre parcel. Slopes exceed 30 percent on portions
                        of the site, and these areas would not be developed under the
                        proposed General Plan. The General Plan (Land Use Element)
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-11                              May 15, 1992
                        calls for preparation and adoption of a specific plan for the
                        southerly Secondary Planning Area, which would include the
                        assignment of specific land use designations. An environmental
                        impact report will be prepared for the specific plan which will
                        address the proposals and impacts expected to result from that
                        plan.
                        Policy statements incorporated in the General Plan will reduce or
                        delay the eventual conversion of lands to nonagricultural use by
                        assuring that conversion occurs in an orderly and efficient matter
                        and is not premature. These policy statements are as follows:

                        LUP-5          The Town shall prepare a specific plan for the

                                       of the town limits which will more precisely
                                       determine residential densities, roads, drainage,
                                       utilities and sewage disposal.

                                       Secondary Planning Area as a holding designation
                                       to prevent premature conversion to urban uses until
                                       such time as a specific plan is adopted and public
                                       facilities and services are available.

                        measures of the General Plan are designed to encourage their
                        preservation. These policies and measures include the following:

                                       use for some lands.

                        With the policy statements and implementation measures
                        incorporated in the proposed General Plan, the impact on
                        agricultural lands is found to be less than significant for the
                        reasons stated above, and no mitigation measures are required.
                        Impact #3.4-2: The potential for soil disturbance during and
                        following construction to lead to wind and water erosion and
                        potential stream siltation.

                        Conclusion: The Planning Area contains excessively sloping land
                        (refer to Figure 3-1, Slope, of Volume III, Environmental Setting),
                        and some soils within the Planning Area have high to very high
                        erosion potential and are adjacent to streamcourses (refer to Table
                        3-4 of Volume III). The potential exists for significant impacts to
                        occur if development and construction were unregulated.
                        However, the policy statements and implementation measures that
                        are incorporated in the proposed General Plan and the regulations
                        of the Town Subdivision Ordinance, Zoning Ordinance, Town
                        Improvement Standards and the Uniform Building Code, as
                        amended by the Town, will reduce these potential impacts to a
                        level which is less than significant, and no mitigation measures are
                        required.
                        The policy statements and ordinances set forth in the Conclusion
                        for Impact #3.2.1-1, including the requirement for grading permits
                        and erosion and sedimentation control plans in situations prescribed
                        by Town ordinance, are also applicable to, and serve to reduce,
                        this impact. In addition to those policies and ordinances, the
                        proposed General Plan includes the following policy statements
                        and implementation measures:

                                        all Town of Paradise adopted soil erosion standards
                                        maintained by the Town Engineering office.

                                        established for sensitive lands such as areas of
                                        resource production, steep canyons and stream
                                        corridors, and areas of significant natural resource
                                        value.

                                        and intermittent watercourses in the Planning Area
                                        on the Land Use Constraints Diagram and develop
                                        standards for their protection, including appropriate
                                        setbacks.
                        Because all construction and development must be in compliance
                        with these policies, measures and regulations, this impact is found
                        to be less than significant and no mitigation measures are required.
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-15                               May 15, 1992
Mitigation
Measures:               Because no significant impacts have been identified, no mitigation
                        measures are required.
3.5     AIR QUALITY
Setting:                Please refer to Sections 4.2 and 16.4 of Volume III, Environmental
                        Setting, for a description of air quality in the Paradise Planning
                        Area and the Butte County Air Quality Attainment Plan,
                        respectively.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: The federal and State ambient air
                        quality standards provide the basis for evaluating air quality
                        impacts. These standards are shown in Table 3.5-1. Non-
                        attainment of a federal or State emission standard for any pollutant
                        is a significant impact. Because the State standards set forth under
                        the California Clean Air Act of 1988 are more restrictive than
                        federal standards, the State standards . will be used for
                        determination of significant impacts. It is unlikely that an
                        individual development project consistent with the General Plan
                        would, in itself, exceed a standard. However, almost every
                        project will result in an incremental contribution to a condition in
                        which standards are exceeded, and a significant cumulative impact
                        will result.
                        Impact #3.5-1: Adoption of the General Plan will result in the
                        accommodation of an increased population within the Planning
                        Area over time and at buildout. The increase in population will
                        result in increased vehicle traffic and increased emissions that will
                        contribute to the cumulative regional degradation of air quality in
                        the Paradise Planning Area and the Northern Sacramento Valley
                        Air Basin. Refer to Table 3.1-1 for General Plan buildout figures
                        and Table 3.13-3 for traffic generation figures. Based upon these
                        figures, the estimated mobile source emissions which will result
                        from adoption and implementation of the General Plan are shown
                        in Table 3.5-2. These estimated emissions were calculated

1.                    California standards for ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide (1 hour), nitrogen
                      dioxide and particulate matter - PM10, are values that are not to be exceeded. The
                     sulfates, lead, hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride, and visibility reducing particles
                     standards are not to be equaled or exceeded.
2.                   National standards, other than ozone and those based on annual averages or annual
                     arithmetic means, are not to be exceeded more than once a year. The ozone
                     standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with
                     maximum hourly average concentrations above the standard is equal to or less than
                     one.
3.                   Concentration expressed first in units in which it was promulgated. Equivalent units
                     given in parenthesis are based upon a reference temperature of 25° C and a
                    reference pressure of 760                         =     of mercury. All measurements.of air quality are to be
                     corrected to a reference temperature of 25° C and a reference pressure of 760                                       =
                     of mercury (1,013.2 millibar); ppm in this table refers to ppm by volume, or
                    micromoles of pollutant per mole of gas.

                                                                                             !,' ,'
4. Any equivalent procedure which can be shown to the satisfaction"or ..the Air
   Resources Board to give equivalent .results at or near the level of the air quality ·
   standard may be used.
5. National Primary Standards: The levels of air quality necessary, with an adequate
   margin of safety to protect the public health. Each state must attain the primary
   standards no later than three years after that state's implementation plan is approved
   by the Environmental Protection Agency.
6. National Secondary Standards: The levels of air quality necessary to protect the
   public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant. Each
   state must attain the secondary standards within a "reasonable time" after the
   implementation plan is approved by the EPA.
7. Reference method as described by the EPA. An "equivalent method" of
   measurement may be used but must have a "consistent relationship to the reference
   method" and must be approved by the EPA.
8. At locations where the state standards for ozone and/ or suspended particulate matter
   are violated. National standards apply elsewhere.
9. Prevailing visibility is defined as the greatest visibility which is attained or surpassed
   around at least half of the horizon circle, ·but not necessarily in continuous sectors.

                        utilizing the URBEMIS #3 computer model developed by the
                        California Air Resources Board.
                        Conclusion: The mobile source emissions reported in Table 3.5-2
                        will contribute to local exceedances of State ozone standards, for
                        which Paradise is a nonattainment area.           Development in
                        accordance with the General Plan will also contribute to regional
                        emissions of ozone and PM10 which are currently not in
                        compliance with State standards. In order to comply with the
                        requirements of the California Clean Air Act, Butte County must
                        reduce reactive organic gas emissions by 7.58 tons per day by
                        1994, with further reduction deadlines by 1997 and 2000 (Air
                        Quality Attainment Plan, Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin,
                        1991). Therefore, any increase in emissions will have a significant
                        cumulative impact, even with the adoption and implementation of
                        policy statements and implementation measures incorporated in the
                        proposed General Plan. Additional mitigation measures are
                        recommended, but will not reduce impacts to a level which is less
                        than significant.
                        Policy statements and implementation measures incorporated in the
                        General Plan which will reduce impacts on air quality include the
                        following:

                              of vehicle miles travelled which, in turn, reduces
                              air pollution and congestion and saves energy.

                                        Paradise region.
                        Impact #3.5-2: Construction activities within the Planning Area
                        will contribute to air pollution emissions from heavy construction
                        equipment and from the generation of dust from grading activities.
                        Conclusion: Even though short-term or temporary in nature, an
                        increase in pollutant emissions is a significant impact in an area
                        which exceeds the State standards for ozone and particulate matter.
                        Impacts of dust generated will be reduced to a level which is less
                        than significant by practices already implemented by the Town of
                        Paradise.     These practices include the application of best
                        management practices, including watering to control dust during
                        construction or use of other acceptable dust palliatives, and the
                        grading permit procedures and requirements and road construction
                        requirements described in Sections 3.2 and 3.4 above. Regulation
                        of emissions from construction equipment is outside the
                        jurisdiction of the Town of Paradise, and such emissions cannot be
                        mitigated.
                        Impact #3.5-3: The development of new businesses or industries
                        which increase stationary source emissions.
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-19                               May 15, 1992
                        Conclusion: All new businesses and industries which produce
                        stationary source emissions must receive an air quality permit from
                        the Butte County Air Pollution Control District. All permits
                        issued must be in compliance with the Air Quality Attainment
                        Plan, State and local standards and regulations, including
                        consideration of cumulative regional emissions. Because all new
                        businesses and industries must meet these requirements, it is
                        determined that this impact will be less than significant, and no
                        mitigation measures are required.
Mitigation
Measures:               Mitigation Measure #3.5-1. The Butte County Air Pollution
                        Control District (APCD) has recommended installation and
                        maintenance of an air monitoring station in the Paradise area to
                        monitor ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Applies
                        to Impact #3.5-1.
                        Effectiveness of Measure: Air quality monitoring will assist the
                        Butte County APCD and the Town in determining compliance with
                        State and federal standards and the Air Quality Attainment Plan,
                        but will not reduce air quality impacts.
                        Implementation/Monitoring: The Butte County APCD will be
                        responsible for installing and maintaining the monitoring station.
                        Public Resources Code Section 21081.6 provides that where the
                        approving agency has received mitigation suggestions from an
                        agency having jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected
                        by a project, the latter agency must prepare and submit a reporting
                        or monitoring program applicable to the proposed mitigation
                        measure, if so requested by the approving agency. The Town of
                        Paradise intends to submit such a request to the APCD.
3.6     HYDROLOGY
Setting:                Please refer to Section 5.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of surface hydrology, water quality, and Town
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-20                              May 15, 1992
                        and district responsibilities, and Section 14.8 for a description of
                        water service for the Paradise Planning Area.
hnpacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria for Flooding: The Planning Area
                        includes several drainage basins and is traversed by several
                        streamcourses which extend beyond the boundaries of the Planning
                        Area. Flooding impacts relate to the potential to expose existing
                        and future Planning Area residents to flooding, and the potential
                        to cause additional flooding to occur on downstream properties as
                        a result of Planning Area development in accordance with the
                        proposed General Plan. If either circumstance exists, the impact
                        is potentially significant. The Federal Emergency Management
                        Agency (FEMA) has developed maps on a nationwide basis which
                        identify flood hazard zones. Development within a FEMA-defined
                        flood hazard zone should be considered a potentially significant
                        impact.
                        Impact #3.6-1: Potential exposure of people and property to
                        flooding onsite and offsite, and increased runoff due to
                        construction which results in an increase in impervious surfaces.
                        Conclusion: All available sources of flooding information for the
                        Paradise Planning Area conclude that the area is not subject to
                        flooding from outside sources and that, because of the nature of
                        the topography and the drainage basins in the Paradise Planning
                        Area, any flooding that occurs is localized in nature, resulting
                        from a temporary lack of capacity or blockage of a drainage basin.
                        As described in Section 5.1 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        while the soils and subsoils of the Paradise area do not markedly
                        aggravate the runoff situation, they also do not prove to be highly
                        permeable. This often results in localized flooding which can be
                        exacerbated by such land use activities as grading operations,
                        vegetation clearance, inattention to storm runoff from construction
                        sites during the peak winter rainfall period, large-scale paving and
                        the lack of a collection system for most storm waters. None of the
                        Paradise Planning Area is within a flood hazard zoned defined and
                        mapped by FEMA.
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-21                               May 15, 1992
                        The potential exists for significant temporary impacts to occur if
                        development and construction were unregulated. However, the
                        proposed General Plan incorporates policy statements and
                        implementation measures which are designed to reduce impacts
                        related to flooding and drainage. These policies and measures are
                        as follows:
                        Safety Element
                        SP-9            The Town shall assure that increased runoff
                                        resulting from additional coverage of surface area
                                        on developing properties does not adversely affect
                                        surrounding properties, roads or stream courses.
                        SP-10           Natural drainageways shall be preserved.
                        SP-11           The Town shall assure that no new structures are
                                        located within potential floodways.
                        SP-12           Development shall not be permitted if identified or
                                        potential flooding and drainage impacts cannot be
                                        overcome by sound engineering practices.
                        SP-13           All new development must comply with the
                                        procedures and regulations of the Master Storm
                                        Drain Study and Facilities Plan.
                        SI-12           Constantly re-evaluate and continue to implement
                                        the Master Storm Drain Study and Facilities Plan.
                        The proposed General Plan also incorporates special permit zones
                        identified in the Master Storm Drain Study and Facilities Plan on
                        the Land Use Constraints Diagram, thus limiting development
                        within these areas.
                        In addition to the policy statements and implementation measures
                        listed above, the Town Subdivision Ordinance requires that storm
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-22                             May 15, 1992
                        water runoff from new subdivisions shall be collected and
                        conveyed in a manner consistent with the Master Storm Drainage
                        Study and Facilities Plan, and with the requirements of the Town
                        Engineer. The Town Zoning Ordinance also establishes coverage
                        limitations on new development.
                        The policy statements and implementation measures that are
                        incorporated in the proposed General Plan and the regulations of
                        the Subdivision and Zoning Ordinances will reduce these potential
                        impacts to a level which is less than significant, because all new
                        construction and development must be in compliance with these
                        policies and regulations; therefore, no mitigation measures are
                        required.
                        Impact Evaluation Criteria, Water Quality: Water quality
                        impacts can be associated with both surface and groundwater. If
                        surface water courses and adjacent areas are disturbed, or if runoff
                        contaminates the watershed or surface water courses, the impact
                        should be viewed as potentially significant. The National Pollutant
                        Discharge Elimination Standards (NPDES) established by the
                        Environmental Protection Agency provide standards for storm water
                        discharge quality.
                        Groundwater impacts can be measured by the potential to
                        encounter unsafe domestic water supplies, or for the Plan itself to
                        adversely affect groundwater quality. If there are reports of unsafe
                        groundwater in the Planning Area, or if Plan characteristics could
                        potentially contribute to groundwater contamination, the impact
                        should be viewed as significant.
                        Finally, State and federal drinking water standards have been
                        established for public and private water systems, and compliance
                        with these standards can be used to determine whether impacts are
                        significant.
                        Impact #3.6-2: Degradation of surface water quality and
                        contamination of the watershed. The impact of development and
Paradise General Plan EIR                    4-23                               May 15, 1992
                        construction in accordance with the General Plan on surface water
                        quality may consist of erosion and silt carriage and deposition due
                        to grading for roads and building pads. Increased motor vehicle
                        residues and landscaping fertilizer and spraying residues will be
                        washed into the watercourses draining the Planning Area during
                        periods of runoff.          Development which directly impacts
                        streamcourses or occurs in proximity to streamcourses could
                        exacerbate this impact.
                        Conclusion: Impacts related to erosion and silt carriage and
                        deposition were addressed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4 and determined
                        to be less than significant. Impacts on water quality due to runoff
                        from new development are potentially significant if development
                        were unregulated.          However, the policy statements and
                        implementation measures that are incorporated in the proposed
                        General Plan and recommended mitigation measures will reduce
                        these potential impacts to a level which is less than significant.
                        The proposed policy statements and implementation measures
                        which will reduce impacts on water quality, disturbance of
                        streamcourses and contamination of the watershed are as follows:

                                        and preserved and the Paradise area watershed shall
                                        be protected.

                                        to protect and preserve the Town's water resources.

                                        control over development and activity affecting the
                                        Paradise watershed.

                        result in the installation of additional septic systems and contribute
Paradise General Plan EIR                      4-25                               May 15, 1992
                        to cumulative impacts of septic system failures on groundwater
                        quality. Although a sewer system is planned, it will be several
                        years before construction is completed, and only portions of the
                        Planning Area will be sewered within the planning period (15
                         years). Annexation of all or portions of the northerly Secondary
                        Planning Area may eventually require the Town to provide sewer
                        service to this area.
                        Conclusion: Any groundwater contamination which currently
                        exists is the result of existing septic system failures and other
                        existing sources of contamination. The potential exists for
                        significant impacts to occur resulting from new development on
                        septic systems, if development were unregulated. However, in
                        addition to formation of a wastewater design assessment district
                        preliminary to construction of a wastewater collection, treatment
                        and disposal facility, the Town is in the process of forming an on-
                        site wastewater management district to monitor and care for
                        existing and future septic systems. Maintenance of on-site septic
                         systems will become a Town function. It is also anticipated that
                        common leachfields will be constructed in some instances, with the
                        Town maintaining the common areas. The on-site district will
                        contain three or more zones, ranging from a zone requiring only
                         simple on-site suitability determinations, to areas with high flow
                        and/or marginal on-site suitability determinations. The latter areas
                         may require community leach fields or other unique solutions.
                         Developed areas annexed to the Town would most likely be
                         included in one of the above-described zones.
                        The Town Subdivision Ordinance currently requires all new lots
                         to meet the requirements of the Butte County Environmental
                        Health Department regarding sewage disposal.
                        Formation and operation of the on-site wastewater management
                         district, in conjunction with policy statements and implementation
                         measures that are incorporated in the proposed General Plan and
                        requirements of the Town Subdivision Ordinance, will reduce these
                         potential impacts to a level which is less than significant, and no
Paradise General Plan EIR                      4-26                              May 15, 1992
                        mitigation measures are required. The annexation of developed
                        areas, and provision of sewer service or inclusion in the onsite
                        wastewater management district, would represent a beneficial
                        impact on water quality. The proposed policy statements and
                        implementation measures which are incorporated in the General
                        Plan which will reduce impacts on groundwater quality, in addition
                        to those included in the Conclusion to Impact #3.6-2 above, are as

                                       to the commercial area of the Town as expeditiously
                                       as possible.

Paradise General Plan EIR                    4-27                               May 15, 1992
                        Impact #3.6-4: Potential to encounter unsafe.drinking water. The
                        predominant source of domestic water provided within the
                        Planning Area is surface water supplies; however, development of
                        a groundwater source is contemplated. In addition, it is estimated
                        that there are approximately 300 privately-owned, relatively
                        shallow wells in Paradise, some of which supply water for
                        domestic use.        According to Section 5.2 of Volume III,
                        Environmental Setting, the upper portions of the Tuscan Formation
                        may hold unconfined water which receives recharge from the
                        Paradise area and could be subject to contamination by septic
                        systems. However, septic tank/leach line failures in Paradise do
                        not affect water supplies distributed by the Paradise Irrigation
                        District, since its sources are outside the urbanized area.
                        Conclusion: As a practical matter, all new development within
                        the Town is serviced by a community water system. The Paradise
                        Irrigation District is the major supplier, serving 95 percent of the
                        incorporated town; the Paradise Pines area is served by the Del
                        Oro Water Company (refer to Figure 14-3 of Volume III,
                        Environmental Setting). Public and private water systems, but not
                        individual wells, are required to comply with State drinking water
                        standards. The Paradise Irrigation District is planning to add, by
                        June 1993, filtration capacity to enable the District to meet revised
                        Federal and State water quality standards. The capacity will be
                        increased from 6 to 25 million gallons per day (mgd). Because all
                        new development on a community water system must be in
                        compliance with State and federal standards, this impact is
                        determined to be less than significant. Potential impacts of new
                        development on water quality of existing wells is determined to be
                        less than significant because the construction of the sewer system
                        and the formation of the on-site wastewater management district
                        will prevent new sources of groundwater contamination from being
                        developed.
Mitigation
Measures:               Mitigation Measure #3.6-l:           Compliance of the Paradise
                        stormwater collection and disposal system with NPDES standards
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-28                                May 15, 1992
                        when applicable to the Town of Paradise, including basins and
                        devices to prevent pollutants from entering streamcourses. The
                        Department of Fish and Game has recommended that stormwater
                        treatment facilities have the ability to remove soluble, suspended
                        and surface floating pollutants in addition to sediments. Applies
                        to Impact #3.6-2.
                        Effectiveness of Measure: Compliance with NPDES standards
                        has been determined by the Environmental Protection Agency to
                        assure water quality is not degraded.
                        Implementation/Monitoring:          Monitoring of water quality
                        discharge standards will be carried out by the Town Engineering
                        Office and the Butte County Environmental Health Department.
                        In addition, the Department of Fish and Game has recommended
                        that the mitigation monitoring program for this measure include the
                        following:
                        •       Specific criteria to measure effectiveness of mitigation.
                                However, Section 21081.6 of the Public Resources Code
                                does not require mitigation monitoring programs to
                                measure the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
                        •       Annual monitoring for a minimum of five years. Annual
                                written reports submitted to the lead agency and the
                                Department of Fish and Game.
                        •       Annual monitoring reports, each of which include
                                corrective recommendations that shall be implemented in
                                order to ensure that mitigation efforts are successful.
3.7     VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE
Setting:                Please refer to Section 6.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of vegetation and wildlife in the Paradise
                        Planning Area.
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-29                              May 15, 1992

Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: At the State level, the Department
                        of Fish and Game is responsible for implementing the California
                        Fish and Game Code and the California Native Plant Protection
                        Act, which include protection for rare and endangered species.
                        The Department also has a policy protecting wetlands, which are
                        defined in similar terms as those used by the U.S. Army Corps of
                        Engineers. The State, like the federal government, supports the
                        policy of "no net loss" of wetlands. The first statement in that
                        policy reads:
                                1. California's remaining wetlands provide significant and
                                essential habitat for a wide variety of important resident
                                and migratory fish and wildlife species.
                        Finally, the Department manages an information program called
                        the California Natural Diversity Data Base which records sightings
                        of rare, threatened, endangered and otherwise sensitive species, as
                        well as occurrences of natural communities. The Data Base
                        considers natural communities as species equivalents in rating their
                        status (i.e. rare, endangered, etc.). The basis for this practice is
                        that natural communities have value in and of themselves, and that
                        they may harbor sensitive species which have not yet been
                        identified and which might not be identified and protected before
                        they are eliminated. The Natural Diversity Data Base and other
                        sources were consulted in the preparation of Section 6.0 of
                        Volume III, Environmental Setting.
                        The State CEQA Guidelines state that a project may have a
                        significant effect on the environment when any of a number of
                        conditions occur including the following related to biological
                        resources:
                        (a)     The project has the potential to substantially degrade the
                                quality of the environment, substantially reduce the habitat
                                of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife
                                population to drop below self-sustaining levels, threaten to
                                eliminate a plant or animal community, reduce the number
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-30                              May 15, 1992
                                 or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or
                                 animal. .. (Section 15065)
                        Additionally, Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines states that a
                        project will normally have a significant effect on the environment
                        if it will, among other things:
                        •        Conflict with adopted environmental plans and goals of the
                                 community where it is located.
                        •        Substantially affect a rare or endangered species of animal
                                 or plant or the habitat of the species.
                        •        Interfere substantially with the movement of any resident or
                                 migratory fish or wildlife species.
                        At the federal level, both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
                        the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are responsible for enforcing
                        federal legislation, most notably the Endangered Species Act and
                        the Federal Clean Water Act. A key issue with both agencies is
                        wetlands protection. The federal administration has adopted a
                        policy of "no net loss" of wetlands.
                        Impact #3.7-1: Loss of vernal pools, freshwater marsh, and
                        riparian wetlands. Freshwater marsh and seeps, riparian areas,
                        and possibly vernal pools are present within the Planning Area.
                        It is possible that there are wetlands resources within the Planning
                        Area that could be classified as jurisdictional wetlands.
                        Development in accordance with the General Plan will potentially
                        result in the elimination and/or alteration of wetlands. The loss of
                        wetlands would eliminate habitat critical to the continued existence
                        of plants and wildlife dependent on this resource.
                        Conclusion: Unregulated development and construction in the
                        Planning Area have the potential to result in the elimination and/or
                        alteration of wetland areas. Because wetlands may provide habitat
                        for species of special concern, this elimination or alteration would
Paradise General Plan EIR                      4-31                              May IS, 1992

                        constitute a reduction in the habitat of these wildlife species. The
                        threat of elimination of sensitive plant communities dependent upon
                        a wetland environment, such as vernal pools, would also be
                        significant. However, the policy statements and implementation
                        measures that are incorporated in the proposed General Plan and
                        recommended mitigation measures will reduce these potential
                        impacts to a level which is less than significant.
                        The proposed General Plan does not propose development in the
                        Tertiary Planning Area (most likely location for vernal pools) or
                        additional development in the northerly Secondary Planning Area.
                        Most of the southerly Secondary Planning Area is proposed to be
                        designated "Open Space/ Agriculture", and development is not
                        proposed until a specific pian is adopted for the area, at which
                        time environmental impacts must be addressed. All development
                        which is proposed must comply with the policies of the General
                        Plan.     The proposed policy statements and implementation
                        measures which will reduce impacts on wetlands are as follows:
                        Open Space/Conservation/Energy Element

                                       corridors, and areas of significant natural resource

                                        standards for their protection, including appropriate
                                        setbacks.

                                        such as areas of resource production, stream
                                       corridors and slopes greater than 30 percent.
                        OCEI-10        Require significantly important natural areas with
                                        high wildlife value to be set aside and preserved
                                       during land use development.
                        Impact #3. 7-2: Impact to wildlife resources, including deer
                        winter range, and animal species of special concern, including the
                        endangered bald eagle, due to the loss of habitat and/or foraging
                        areas as development occurs in accordance with the proposed
                        General Plan. The Planning Area contains habitat which may
                        support species of special concern, as described in Section 6.0 of
                        Volume III, Environmental Setting. The vegetation communities
                        within the Planning Area provide suitable habitat and foraging
                        areas for numerous species of wildlife described in Volume III.
                        According to the Department of Fish and Game, bald eagles winter
                        around streams and reservoirs within the Planning Area, and it is
                        probable that eastern portions of the Planning Area fall within the
                        foraging territory of a nearby eagle breeding territory.
                        Conclusion: Additional development within the Planning Area
                        will, over time, result in diminished wildlife habitat. Because the
                        Planning Area may provide habitat for species of special concern,
                        the reduction of this habitat is considered a potentially significant
                        unavoidable impact. The northerly Secondary Planning Area,

                        which encompasses the reservoirs, is not proposed for any
                        additional development in the General Plan. Policy statements and
                        implementation measures incorporated in the proposed General
                        Plan, the Town Tree Ordinance and mitigation measures will
                        reduce this impact; not, however, to a level which is less than
                        significant. The Town of Paradise is forested, and the proposed
                        General Plan emphasizes preservation of existing trees and
                        reforestation. Policy statements and implementation measures
                        incorporated in the General Plan that will reduce impacts on
                        habitat for wildlife resources and potential impacts on deer herds
                        and species of special concern (in addition to those listed in the
                        Conclusion for Impact #3.7-1 above) are as follows:
                        Open Space/Conservation/Energy Element
                        OCEP-1         Existing large heritage trees and oak woodlands
                                       shall be identified, protected, preserved and
                                       enhanced.     Trees so identified shall only be
                                       removed as a last resort.
                        OCEP-2         Reforestation and maintenance of trees shall be
                                       encouraged along road corridors.
                        OCEP-3         Trees that are no longer living, and which do not
                                       pose a significant danger, shall also be given
                                       consideration for preservation if they possess
                                       significant wildlife habitat value.
                        OCEP-6         Where feasible, limit new development within the
                                       Secondary Planning Area to Designated
                                       Development Zones as established by the
                                       Department of Fish and Game to protect deer herd
                                       migration routes.
                        OCEP-7         Deer movement shall be considered when approving
                                       fencing and other improvements in new
                                       development.
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-34                             May 15, 1992
                         OCEI-6         Create a Town arborist or tree specialist position at
                                        Town Hall to provide information and education
                                        concerning trees to Town residents.
                         OCEI-8          Amend the tree ordinance to assure that its
                                         administration and enforcement will sustain and
                                         enhance the present forested setting of Paradise, and
                                         to assure that trees are only removed as a last
                                         resort. Establish a mitigation program for tree
                                         removal.
                         OCEI-11        Incorporate deer herd migration routes (windows)
                                        into the Land Use Constraints Diagram.
                         Impact #3. 7-3: Potential loss of sensitive plant populations,
                         including oak woodlands. The type of vegetation communities
                         which exist within the Paradise Planning Area provide habitat for
                         several sensitive plant populations, as described in Section 6.0 of
                         Volume III, Environmental Setting.
                         Conclusion: Areas designated for future development may contain
                         sensitive plant populations. The loss of habitat for sensitive plant
                         communities is a potentially significant impact. This impact can
                         be reduced by mitigation measures, policy statements and
                         implementation measures incorporated in the proposed General
                         Plan to a level which is less than significant. The policy
                         statements and implementation measures that will reduce impacts
                         on sensitive plant species are listed in the Conclusions for Impacts
                         #3. 7-1 and #3. 7-2 above.
                         Impact #3. 7-4: Potential impacts on fisheries in Butte Creek and
                         the Feather River due to erosion, sedimentation, siltation,
                         streambed alteration and removal of riparian vegetation.
                         Conclusion: Potential impacts of erosion, sedimentation and
                         siltation were addressed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4 above. The
                         proposed General Plan does not propose development in the
Paradise General Plan EI.R                     4-35                                May 15, 1992
                        canyons of the West Branch Feather River, but rather contains
                        several policy statements and implementation measures designed
                        to assure their protection. It was determined that these impacts
                        will be less than significant due to proposed policy statements and
                        implementation measures incorporated in the General Plan and
                        existing Town ordinances, standards and regulations. Potential
                        streambed alteration impacts are mitigated to a level which is less
                        than significant by Mitigation Measure #3. 7-2. Policy statements
                        and implementation measures incorporated in the proposed General
                        Plan, and listed in the Cone] usion for Impact #3. 7-1 and 3. 7-2
                        above, as well as the following policy statement will reduce
                        potential impacts of removal of riparian vegetation to a level which
                        is less than significant, and no further mitigation measures are
                        required.
                        Open Space/Conservation/Energy Element
                        OCEP-5          Area fisheries shall be protected, and the
                                        cooperation of responsible agencies shall be sought
                                        to assure minimum streamflow and restore fisheries.
Mitigation
Measures:               Mitigation Measure #3.7-1: Application for and receipt of
                        Section 404 permits pursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act for
                        individual projects and public works projects that involve alteration
                        of wetlands that cannot be avoided through project design or
                        development in an alternative location. This process would include
                        formal wetlands delineations of impacted areas and appropriate
                        onsite or offsite compensation for wetlands that cannot be avoided,
                        which may include enhancement of wetlands habitat. Applies to
                        Impacts #3. 7-1, 3. 7-2 and 3. 7-3.
                        Effectiveness of Measure: This measure will not avoid potential
                        impacts, but does provide a formal mechanism for mitigating
                        impacts through an established permitting procedure.
Paradise General Plan EfR                     4-36                               May 15, 1992
                        Implementation/Monitoring: Section 404 permits shall be
                        applied for and received from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
                        as a condition of approval of applicable private development
                        projects and public works projects. Monitoring programs for
                        wetlands enhancement or creation must be formulated once the
                        nature of the actual compensation is determined.
                        Mitigation Measure #3. 7-2: Application for and receipt of a
                        Streambed Alteration Permit from the Department of Fish and
                        Game for private projects and public works projects prior to any
                        modification of streambeds or additional stream crossings. Applies
                        to Impacts #3. 7-1 and #3. 7-2.
                        Effectiveness: By regulating streambed aiterations, disturbance of
                        streambed environments will be minimized, reducing impacts to
                        fisheries and riparian habitat.
                        Implementation/Monitoring: Streambed alteration permits are
                        issued by the Department of Fish and Game upon application by
                        project proponents. Application will be made a condition of
                        approval of applicable projects by the Town. Monitoring will be
                        carried out by the Town Engineering Office during inspection of
                        project improvements and by the Department of Fish and Game
                        following issuance of a Streambed Alteration Permit.
                        Mitigation Measure #3. 7-3: The Department of Fish and Game
                        has recommended that setbacks and drainage restrictions be applied
                        to impacts on streams, lakes and wetlands. Applies to Impact
                        #3.7-1.
                        Effectiveness of Measure: The Department of Fish and Game has
                        determined such measures to be effective.
                        Implementation/Monitoring: The Department of Fish and Game
                        has recommended that the mitigation monitoring program for this
                        measure include the following:
Paradise General Plan EIR                    4-37                              May 15, 1992
                        •       Specific criteria to measure effectiveness of mitigation.
                                However, Section 21081. 6 of the Public Resources Code
                                does not require mitigation monitoring programs to
                                measure the effectiveness of mitigation measures.
                        •       Annual monitoring for a minimum of five years. Annual
                                written reports submitted to the lead agency and the
                                Department of Fish and Game.
                        •       Annual monitoring reports, each of which include
                                corrective recommendations that shall be implemented in
                                order to ensure that mitigation efforts are successful.
                        Mitigation Measure #3. 7-4: Upon recommendation by the
                        Department of Fish and Game, biotic surveys, floristic studies for
                        plant species of special concern and/or tree inventories of
                        previously undeveloped sites proposed to be developed or
                        otherwise disturbed shall be conducted by qualified biologists
                        during proper phenological periods or seasonal parameters. If
                        species of special concern are found, measures, including setbacks
                        and drainage restrictions, shall be taken to ensure their continued
                        survival in conformance with State and federal law, including
                        setbacks, open space designations and drainage restrictions.
                        Applies to Impacts #3.7-2 and #3.7-3.
                        Effectiveness: Conducting such studies when necessary will
                        ensure the identification of species of special concern and sensitive
                        habitat so that projects can be redesigned, if necessary, to avoid
                        significant impacts.
                        Implementation/Monitoring: Study results shall be submitted to
                        the Department of Fish and Game for their review. The
                        Community Development Department will be responsible for
                        assuring that studies are completed and submitted, and that
                        mitigation measures and conditions of approval are complied with.
3.8     NOISE
Paradise General Plan EIR                    4-38                                May 15, 1992

Setting:                Please refer to Section 7.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of the noise environment of the Paradise Planning
                        Area.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: Noise impacts of the General Plan
                        are evaluated by comparison of projected future noise levels to
                        accepted noise standards. The Noise Element of the proposed
                        General Plan establishes land use compatibility guidelines for
                        various types of new development which may be proposed, ranging
                        from 60 dB Ldn as acceptable, but up to 70 dB L<ln with inclusion
                        of protective measures. The Noise Element also establishes
                        performance standards for new projects affected by or including
                        non-transportation sources and the maximum allowable noise
                        exposure to transportation noise sources. Please refer to Figure
                        6.4-1 and Tables 6.4-1 and 6.4-2 of Volume I, Policy Document.
                        These standards are widely applied in similar jurisdictions
                        throughout the State. The intent of these standards is to provide
                        a suitable environment for outdoor activities, indoor
                        communications and sleep.
                        Impact #3.8-1: Increased and continuing noise from major
                        roadways. Traffic noise impacts are expected to occur at noise
                        sensitive land uses where existing or future exterior traffic noise
                        levels exceed 60 dB Ldn· The Federal Highway Administration
                        (FHWA) model was used with future traffic data (Table 3.13-3) to
                        predict future traffic noise levels for development in accordance
                        with the General Plan. Table 3.8-1 shows the predicted distances
                        to future 60 and 65dB Ldn noise contours for major roadways.
                        Figure 2-3, the Land Use Constraints Diagram, in Volume I,
                        Policy Document, shows the contours in map form.
                        Conclusion: Impacts of development in accordance with the
                        objectives and policy statements incorporated in the Noise Element
                        will be less than significant because compliance with these
                        objectives and policies will avoid potentially significant impacts.
                        These objectives and policy statements are as follows:
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-39                              May 15, 1992

                        N0-3          New development of noise-sensitive land uses will
                                      not be permitted in areas exposed to existing or
                                      projected levels of noise from transportation noise
                                      sources which exceed the levels specified in Table
                                      6.4-2.
                        N0-4          Noise created by new transportation noise sources,
                                      including roadway improvement projects, shall be
                                      mitigated so as not to exceed the levels specified in
                                      Table 6.4-2 at outdoor activity areas or interior

                        Impact #3.8-2: Increased noise or creation of new sources of
                        noise from new fixed noise sources such as the expansion of
                        existing and development of new industrial uses. A quantitative
                        analysis of future noise levels generated by fixed noise sources is
                        too speculative to produce, as the actual types of future fixed noise
                        sources are not known at the time of General Plan approval.
                        However, the potential for the introduction of new fixed noise
                        sources increases with the amount of land designated for industrial
                        use. The proposed General Plan designates 212 acres for Light
                        Industrial and 280 acres for Business Park use, in comparison to
                        approximately 30 acres of existing industrial uses within both the
                        Primary and Secondary Planning Areas.
                        Conclusion: The potential for introduction of new fixed noise
                        sources, and potentially significant noise impacts, increases with
                        the amount of land designated for industrial uses in the General
                        Plan. While these impacts are potentially significant, objectives
                        and policy statements incorporated in the Noise Element will avoid
                        potentially significant impacts. These objectives and policy
                        statements are as follows:
                        N0-1           New development of noise-sensitive uses shall not
                                       be allowed where the noise level due to non-
                                       transportation noise sources will exceed the noise
                                       level standards of Table 6.4-1, as measured
                                       immediately within the property line of the new
                                       development, unless effective noise mitigation
                                       measures have been incorporated into the
                                       development design to achieve the standards
                                       specified in Table 6.4-1.
                        N0-2           Noise created by new proposed non-transportation
                                       noise sources shall be mitigated so as not to exceed
                                       the noise level standards of Table 6.4-1 as measured
                                       immediately within the property line of lands
                                       designated for noise-sensitive uses. This objective
                                       does not apply to noise sources associated with

                                       agricultural uses.
                        NP-I           Where proposed non-residential land uses are likely
                                       to produce noise levels exceeding the performance
                                       standards of Table 6.4-1 at existing or planned
                                       noise-sensitive uses, an acoustical analysis shall be
                                       required as part of the environmental review
                                       process so that noise mitigation may be included in
                                       the project design.
                        NP-3           Where noise-sensitive land uses are proposed in
                                       areas exposed to existing or projected exterior noise
                                       levels exceeding the levels specified in Table 6.4-2
                                       or the performance standards of Table 6.4-1, an
                                       acoustical analysis shall be required as part of the
                                       environmental review process so that noise
                                       mitigation may be included in the project design.
                        Impact #3.8-3: Increased noise due to increased operations at the
                        Paradise Skypark Airport. Operations are expected to increase
                        within the planning period. The 1988 California Aviation System
                        Plan (CASP) estimates that the number of annual operations will
                        increase from the existing 10,000 to 11,676 annual operations in
                        the year 2005. Based upon the projected increase in annual
                        operations, the CNEL values are expected to increase by less than
                        one dB.
                        Conclusion: An increase of less than one dB over the planning
                        period should not be viewed as significant. In addition, policy
                        statements incorporated in the proposed Noise Element will avoid
                        potentially significant impacts. These policy statements are as
                        follows:
                        NP-6           New land uses within the projected 55 Ld, contour
                                       of Paradise Skypark Airport shall be compatible

                                        residential and institutional land uses such as
                                        schools, hospitals, convalescent homes, and other
                                        inpatient health care facilities shall not be permitted.
                        NP-7            Multi-family residential land uses may be permitted
                                        within the 55 Ldn contour of the Airport subject to
                                        an acoustical analysis showing that all structures
                                        have been designed to limit interior noise level in
                                        any habitable room to 45 dB Ldn within the
                                        boundaries of the 55 Ldn contour as projected in the
                                        Paradise Skypark Airport Land Use                 Plan.
                                        Compliance with the acoustical analysis requirement
                                        shall be as specified in Table 6.4-3.
Mitigation
Measures:               Because no significant impacts have been identified, no mitigation
                        measures are required.
3.9     LIGHT AND GLARE
Setting:                Please refer to Section 8.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of light and glare in the Paradise Planning Area.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: The impact of new sources of light
                        and glare is potentially significant if the following criteria are met:
                        (1)     The light and/or glare is continuous, rather than temporary
                                in nature (example: a continuous stream of cars or regular
                                pattern of lighting vs. occasional passing headlights).
                        (2)     The level of light and/or glare is noticeably higher than the
                                surrounding ambient level of light;
                        (3)     The light and/or glare has the potential to shine directly
                                into the interior and/or outdoor activity areas of existing or
                                future residences; and
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-43                                  May 15, 1992
                        (4)     The size of the affected parcels (larger parcels offer greater
                                flexibility for siting of residences).
                        Impact #3.9-1: New sources of light and glare in previously
                        undeveloped areas. This impact consists of interior and exterior
                        residential lighting, headlights from automobiles and glare from
                        additional paved surfaces and roofs.
                        Conclusion: New development in accordance with the proposed
                        General Plan in previously undeveloped areas will create new
                        sources of light and glare, including lighting of commercial and
                        industrial areas, new residences, and schools. These impacts are
                        potentially significant, but will be reduced to a level that is less
                        than significant by policy statements and implementation measures
                        incorporated in the proposed General Plan, proposed Plan densities
                        and separation of incompatible land uses, and Town standards and
                        ordinances which do not require street lighting in residential areas.
                        The generally low residential densities proposed, distances between
                        structures, forested setting, and lack of street lighting all assist in
                        reducing impacts of light and glare. Individual projects which are
                        proposed consistent with the General Plan are subject to
                        environmental review when impacts are known, and any identified
                        impacts of light and glare can be mitigated through project design
                        and conditions of approval. The relevant policy statement and
                        implementation measure incorporated in the proposed General Plan
                        which reduce impacts of light and glare are as follows:

Mitigation
Measures:               Because no significant impacts have been identified, no mitigation
                        measures are required.

Setting:                Please refer to Section 9.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of the existing land use in the Paradise Planning
                        Area; Figure 2-1, Land Use Diagram, of Volume I, Polily
                        Document for a diagram of the planned land use; Section 11.0 of
                        Volume III for a description of population; and Table 3.1-1 for
                        General Plan buildout population.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria:          Appendix G of the CEQA
                        Guidelines states that a project will normally have a significant
                        effect on the environment if it will conflict with adopted
                        environmental plans and goals of the community where it is
                        located; disrupt or divide the physical arrangement of an
                        established community; convert prime agricultural land to
                        nonagricultural use or impair the agricultural productivity of prime
                        agricultural land; and/or induce substantial growth or concentration
                        of population. A primary purpose of a general plan is the
                        establishment of the types of plans and goals referred to above,
                        against which the impacts of future development can be measured,
                        and to prevent new land use conflicts from being created. Growth
                        and development which is inconsistent with the established goals

                        should be considered potentially significant.       The proposed
                        environmental plans and goals, objectives, policies and
                        implementation measures for growth, development and land use
                        compatibility of the proposed Paradise General Plan include the
                        following:

                                      detailed analysis, it is revealed that the proposal
                                      would have long-term cumulative adverse
                                      environmental impacts on the Town of Paradise.

                        SP-14          Residential development and institutional uses shall
                                       not be permitted within the clear (Safety Area 1) or

                        Conclusion: This impact was addressed in Section 3.4 (Soils)
                        above and determined to be less than significant.
                        Impact #3.10-2: The proposed General Plan will result in
                        substantial changes or alterations of present or planned land uses
                        in some portions of the Paradise Planning Area.
Paradise General Plan EIR                    4-48                               May 15, 1992
                        Conclusion: Physical changes to the environment resulting from
                        changes in present and planned land uses are addressed in other
                        sections of this Chapter, and conclusions reached as to their
                        significance and necessary mitigation measures. These sections
                        include 3.2 Topography, 3.3 Geology/Seismicity, 3.4 Soils, 3.5
                        Air Quality, 3.6 Hydrology, 3.7 Vegetation and Wildlife, 3.8
                        Noise, 3.9 Light and Glare, 3.11 Housing, 3.12 Health Hazards
                        and Safety, 3.13 Transportation and Circulation, 3.14 Public
                        Facilities and Services, and 3.15 Scenic and Cultural Resources.
                        Impact #3.10-3: Land use conflicts between new development in
                        accordance with the General Plan and existing development.
                        Conclusion: While land use conflicts currently exist within the
                        Paradise Planning Area, new land use conflicts could be created
                        between new development and existing uses if development were
                        unregulated. Such conflicts could include noise, light and glare,
                        odors, traffic, and aesthetic impacts, and are potentially
                        significant. However, all new development must be consistent
                        with the proposed General Plan, when adopted, in terms of both
                        land use designations and policy statements, including the policy
                        statements listed above under "Impact Evaluation Criteria". The
                        Town Zoning Ordinance is also designed to reduce and avoid land
                        use conflicts through separation of uses, setbacks, fencing
                        requirements, and the requirement for conditional use permits for
                        some uses which require compliance with conditions of approval.
                        The General Plan also includes policy statements and
                        implementation measures designed to mitigate existing land use
                        conflicts by reducing the number of nonconforming uses which
                        now exist in the community. These policy statements and
                        implementation measures are as follows:
                        Land Use Element
                        LUP-85          The relocation of nonconforming uses to areas
                                        where such uses are permitted shall be encouraged.

                        LUP-86         The expansion of existing legally nonconforming
                                       uses shall be discouraged.
                        LUP-87         The Town shall consider exclusion of home
                                       occupations from neighborhoods where their
                                       presence 1s out of character with present
                                       development and use patterns.
                        LUP-88         The Town shall assure compatibility between home
                                       occupations or cottage industries and residential
                                       uses.
                        LUP-89         The Town shall endeavor to improve its present
                                       code enforcement program, including seeking ways
                                       to fund necessary personnel.
                        LUI-65         Zone properties consistent with their General Plan
                                       land use classification.
                        LUI-69         Consistently enforce the regulations of the Zoning
                                       Ordinance when alerted of illegal uses.
                        These policies and implementation measures and the Zoning
                        Ordinance will reduce potentially significant impacts to a level
                        which is less than significant.
                        Impact #3.10-4: Growth-inducing impact. The proposed General
                        Plan is designed to accommodate a population of 34,349 within the
                        Primary Planning Area by 2007, representing an annual growth
                        rate of approximately 1.5 percent. Approval of the proposed
                        General Plan may lead to increased applications for development
                        projects consistent with the Plan, as well as requests to amend the
                        General Plan to accommodate projects not consistent with the
                        Plan.
                        Conclusion:      A general plan which proposes any future
                        development is by definition "growth-inducing". The proposed
Paradise General Plan EIR                    4-50                                May 15, 1992
                        General Plan, however, attempts to address all potentially adverse

                        measures, programs, proposals for adequate infrastructure and
                        services, and protection of environmentally sensitive resources.
                        Impacts which cannot be reduced or mitigated to a level which is
                        less than significant are identified in other sections of this Chapter.
Mitigation
Measures:               Because no significant impacts have been identified, no mitigation
                        measures are required.
3.11    HOUSING
Setting:                Please refer to Section 12.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of housing in the Paradise Planning Area.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: The Housing Element of the
                        proposed General Plan is required to identify housing needs and
                        establish goals, policies, and quantified objectives for the
                        preservation, improvement and development of housing. The
                        Butte County Association of Governments (BCAG) is required to
                        prepare a Regional Housing Allocation Plan which establishes
                        Paradise's share of the regional housing need (see Table 12-15,
                        Volume III), and the Housing Element is required to reflect that
                        share in its goals and objectives. Failure to designate sufficient
                        land to accommodate needed housing, designation of land far in
                        excess of identified needs, or failure to provide public facilities
                        and services to support housing in designated areas, would result
                        in a general plan that is internally inconsistent, and would
                        represent a potentially significant impact. The relevant Housing
                        Element goals, quantified objectives and policies are as follows:

                        Impact #3.11-1: Information on General Plan buildout in Table
                        3.1-1 estimates that the proposed General Plan will accommodate
                        3,125 new dwelling units within the Primary Area and 1,949 new
                        dwelling units within the Secondary Planning Area.
                        Conclusion: While these figures exceed new construction goals
                        contained in the Housing Element, as listed above, the General
                        Plan has a 15-year planning period, while the Housing Element
                        time frame is only 5 years. It is estimated that these dwelling
                        units will accommodate a population of 34,349 within the Primary
                        Area, a figure which only slightly exceeds the 2007 population
                        figure of 33,000 which the proposed General Plan is designed to
                        accommodate. It is normally desirable to allow some flexibility in
                        these estimates to account for physical constraints which may limit
                        development (such as topography and availability of sewer
                        service), to avoid undue restrictions on housing supply which may
                        increase costs, and to allow for some variance in the actual
                        densities constructed. Based on the impact evaluation criteria, this
                        impact is determined to be less than significant and no mitigation
                        measures are required.
                        Impact #3.11-2: Adverse impacts on existing housing due to
                        policies and programs contained in the proposed General Plan.
                        Conclusion: The policies and programs of the proposed General
                        Plan are designed to preserve, upgrade and protect existing
                        housing, rather than result in adverse impacts such as deterioration
                        which would result in substandard housing conditions. This impact
                        is therefore determined to be less than significant, and no
                        mitigation measures are required.

Mitigation
Measures:               Because no significant impacts have been identified, no mitigation
                        measures are required.
3.12    HEALTH HAZARDS AND SAFETY
Setting:                Please refer to Section 10.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of existing conditions related to health hazards
                        and emergency response and evacuation. Other health and safety
                        hazards are addressed in other sections of this Chapter: wildland
                        fire hazards in Section 3.14, and seismic hazards in Section 3.3.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria for Health Hazards:                 The
                        significance of vector-related impacts can be measured by
                        comparison to the adopted "Guidelines, Checklist and Standards
                        for Vector Prevention in Proposed Developments" of the Butte
                        County Mosquito Abatement District (BCMAD), and a
                        determination made as to whether the proposed General Plan
                        impedes compliance with these standards and prevention practices.
                        Full compliance with some adopted guidelines and standards may
                        conflict with the preservation, maintenance and enhancement of
                        wetlands within the Planning Area.
                        Impact #3.12-1: Exposure of residents of the Paradise Planning
                        Area to potentially high levels of nuisance and disease vectoring
                        mosquitoes and ticks, and creation of new sources of vectors
                        within the planned wastewater treatment plant and stormwater
                        retention basins. The BCMAD has indicated that storm water
                        retention basins are known to breed mosquitoes if they are not
                        properly maintained, and that created marshes associated with
                        wastewater treatment plants pose a serious risk of mosquito
                        production. The mosquito species are important vectors of
                        diseases such as malaria, encephalitis and canine heartworm
                        disease, and the local tick is a vector of Lyme disease.
                        Conclusion: If proper prevention practices are not applied,
                        impacts related to identified health hazards are potentially
Paradise General Plan EJR                    4-54                              May 15, 1992
                        significant. Impacts of the planned wastewater treatment plant
                        have been and will be further addressed in the environmental
                        documentation prepared for that project (Final Environmental
                        Impact Report for the Town of Paradise Central Area Wastewater
                        Collection and Sewage Treatment Facilities System, September
                        1989, SCH# 88041912) Additional environmental documentation
                        will be prepared for the actual construction of the system following
                        system design, and the BCMAD will be consulted at that time.
                        Mitigation measures are proposed that will reduce impacts of any
                        stormwater retention basins to a level that is less than significant.
Mitigation
Measures:               Mitigation Measure #3.12-1: The BCMAD has recommended
                        that stormwater retention basins be properly designed and
                        maintained so they do not breed mosquitoes, in consultation with
                        the BCMAD. Applies to Impact #3.12-1.
                        Effectiveness of Measure: Compliance with this provision, which
                        avoids conditions that contribute to vector breeding, has been
                        determined to be effective by the BCMAD.
                        Implementation/Monitoring: It will be the responsibility of the
                        Town Engineering Office to consult with BCMAD regarding the
                        design and maintenance of stormwater retention basins. BCMAD
                        has recommended this mitigation measure. Public Resources Code
                        section 21081.6 provides that where the approving agency has
                        received mitigation suggestions from an agency having jurisdiction
                        by law over natural resources affected by a project, the latter
                        agency must prepare and submit a reporting or monitoring
                        program applicable to the proposed mitigation measure, if so
                        requested by the approving agency. The Town of Paradise intends
                        to submit such a request to the BCMAD.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria for Emergency Response and
                        Evacuation: Emergency response is addressed in Section 3.14
                        (Public Services and Facilities) below. With regard to evacuation,
                        the Town has recently completed and adopted a Multihazard
Paradise General Plan EIR                    4-55                                May 15, 1992
                        Disaster Plan. The impact of the proposed General Plan will be
                        significant if it impedes compliance with the recommendations of
                        the Multihazard Disaster Plan.
                        Impact #3.12-2: The proposed General Plan will result in
                        additional development within the Planning Area, which will
                        contribute to identified traffic flow problems on existing evacuation
                        routes when and if it is necessary to evacuate all or portions of the
                        community.
                        Conclusion: The impacts of additional development on existing
                        evacuation routes would be potentially significant if this issue were
                        not considered in the planning process.            However, policy
                        statements and implementation measures incorporated in the
                        proposed General Plan, as well as the land use and circulation
                        system proposals depicted in the Land Use Diagram and
                        Circulation Diagram, will reduce the impacts to a level which is
                        less than significant. The proposed General Plan does not propose
                        additional development in the northerly Secondary Planning Area,
                        which is the area with only one evacuation route (Skyway). The
                        Plan also proposes additional east-west through streets and
                        improvements to existing roadways as shown in Table 2-3 of
                        Volume I, Policy Document, as well as the additional east-west
                        connectors indicated on the Circulation Diagram.
                        A policy statement and implementation measure which are
                        incorporated in the proposed General Plan which reduce impacts
                        on existing evacuation routes are as follows:

Mitigation
Measures:               Because no significant impacts have been identified, no mitigation
                        measures are required.
3.13    TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION
Setting:                Please refer to Section 13.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting,
                        for a description of the transportation and circulation setting for the
                        Paradise Planning Area, and Figure 2-2, Circulation Diagram, of
                        Volume I, Policy Document for a diagram of the planned circulation
                        system. In addition, please refer to Appendix F of this document for
                        transportation and circulation data tables.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: The standard used to evaluate the
                        functioning of the proposed circulation (roadway) system is level of
                        service (LOS). Level of service is a scale that measures operating
                        conditions or maximum design capacity at an intersection or along a
                        roadway segment in relation to the projected traffic volume resulting
                        from the planned circulation system. Levels range from A to F, with
                        "A" representing the highest level of service and "F" roadway failure.
                        Table 3.13-1 represents the average daily traffic criteria for each
                        street classification type for levels of service "C", "D" and "E". The
                        proposed General Plan has established level of service "D" or better
                        as the standard for all roadway segments.
                        Impact #3.13-1: Normally, for a General Plan, a travel demand
                        model is used to estimate peak hour and/or daily traffic volumes
                        produced by existing and projected development. Unfortunately, the
                        Butte County traffic model was not readily available for use in the
                        General Plan analysis. Further, some of the preliminary results from
                        prior application of the Butte County model did not appear logical.
                        Therefore, an alternative approach was used to forecast future
                        roadway traffic volumes.
Paradise General Plan EIR                       4-57                                May 15, 1992
                        Dowling Associates' TRAFFIX model was used to calculate existing
                        and projected average daily traffic volumes for numerous roadway
                        segments within the Paradise Planning Area. The following approach
                        was used to generate the total traffic volumes.
                        •       The existing PM peak hour turn movement volumes were
                                divided by 10 percent for all analysis locations except along
                                Skyway where 14 percent was used to estimate average daily
                                traffic levels.
                        •       The standard trip generation rates noted in Table 3.13-2 were
                                applied to all of the projected development within the Primary
                                and Secondary Planning Areas.
                        •       All of the residential traffic was assigned to the street system.
                                For the non-residential land uses only the non-home based
                                (NHB) component was assigned. The NHB component equals
                                30 percent of the total. The assignment of the residential
                                traffic generates trip ends both at the residential and non-
                                residential ends of the trips. Therefore, only the non-home
                                based component of the non-residential development needs to
                                be added. In sum, 100 percent of the residential trip
                                generation and 30 percent (NHB) of the non-residential trip
                                generation were assigned to the surrounding street system to
                                 represent growth in traffic due to new development. The total
                                daily traffic is the sum of existing plus new development
                                traffic.
                        •       The resultant average daily traffic volumes were compared to
                                a set of roadway capacities (based upon number of lanes,
                                roadway configuration and other parameters) to determine the
                                appropriate street classification, number of lanes and level of
                                service for each roadway segment.
                        Project Trip Generation: Standard trip generation rates were
                        applied to the projected levels of growth within the Primary and
                        Secondary Planning Areas. The resultant increments in new average
                        daily traffic generated by the Plan are detailed in Table 3.13-3. The
                        proposed plan is estimated to generate approximately 81,307 daily
Paradise General Plan EIR                       4-58                                 May 15, 1992

                        trips. Of these, approximately 32,400 trips are associated with
                        residential development, while 48,900 are created by non-residential
                        land uses. Not all of the new trip generation was assigned to the
                        street system. A factor of 30 percent was applied to the non-
                        residential land uses to estimate the level of non-home based trips
                        between the various non-residential land uses. The 30 percent value
                        is based upon the average value found in many travel demand models.
                        Non-home based trips include trips between office and school, office
                        and shopping or other travel patterns. All of the residential traffic
                        was assigned to the street system. The residential travel includes
                        home-based work, home-based other (includes home to school and
                        shopping) and some non-home based trips (mail and other deliveries).
                        The total residential increment is an estimated 32,400 trips while the
                        non-residential travel is an estimated 13,980.
                        Trip Distribution (Travel Pattern) Assumptions: The assignment
                        of traffic within the traffic model was made by assigning the trip
                        generation using the following set of trip distribution factors. As I 00
                        percent of the residential land use change was assigned to the street
                        system, an estimate of the distribution of total non-residential land use
                        trip generation was used. The existing land uses and the trips they
                        generate plus the proposed increases in non-residential land use
                        intensities were added together and allocated to specific locations
                        within the Planning Area. The destinations, called gateways, and the
                        final trip distribution values are shown in Table 3.13-4.
                        While no growth was projected down Skyway (within the Secondary
                        and Tertiary Planning Areas), an estimate of 6 percent growth in trips
                        for destinations toward Chico was included. The proposed growth in
                        Paradise includes extensive increases in Business Park and Light
                        Industrial areas. If these occur, less home-to-work travel between
                        Paradise and Chico will occur. An evaluation of the balance between
                        residential and non-residential travel patterns suggests that the
                        projected levels of Business Park and Light Industrial employment
                        could discourage growth in home-to-work travel between Paradise and
                        Chico, Oroville and other regional employment centers outside of
                        Paradise.

                        A traffic zone system was developed for the TRAFFIX model.
                        Figure 3-1 illustrates the traffic zone system. The Town of Paradise
                        was divided into 80 traffic zones. Table 3.13-5 details the individual
                        traffic zone land uses and trip generation assumptions.
                        The projected increases in average daily traffic were added to the
                        estimated existing traffic volumes. These volumes were compared to
                        the level of service criteria (see Table 3.13-1) to determine: 1) the
                        number of required travel lanes, 2) the required street classification,
                        3) the roadway configuration for each of the linkages that was
                        evaluated, and 4) the resultant level of service.
                        The results of this assessment are provided on Table 3.13-6. Table
                        3 .13-6 defines the build-out requirements for the major roadway
                        facilities within Paradise. Additional traffic projections are provided
                        for State Routes 70, 99 and other regional facilities outside of the
                        Paradise Planning Area under Impact #3.13-2.
                        In addition to the roadway segments listed in Table 3.13-6, the
                        Circulation Diagram includes Residential Collectors which carry less
                        traffic, but which function as collectors to adjacent arterials. These
                        Residential Collectors include the following roadway segments:
                        •         Bille Road west of Skyway
                        •         Roe Road east of Foster Road

                        Conclusion: Table 3.13-6 indicates that most of the roadways within
                        Paradise will operate at LOS "C" or better. However, there are a
                        number of exceptions. In addition, the street classifications and
                        resultant design standards used for this analysis include arterial and
                        collector streets which have center medians. Streets with center
                        medians have higher daily and peak hour capacity due to the fact that
                        left turn and through traffic volumes are separated. With a center
                        median facility, left turn movements are not made from the same
                        travel lane as normal through trips.
                        The roadway criteria for LOS "C", "D" and "E" from Table 3.13-1
                        were applied to the forecasted average daily traffic volumes. In all
                        cases, the analysis attempted to maintain LOS "C" or better.
                        Therefore, if a 4 lane divided arterial produced LOS "C" while a 4
                        lane undivided arterial achieved only LOS "D", the 4 lane divided
                        facility was recommended. Along Skyway and Clark south of Neal
                        and Pearson, arterial standards were used because it is assumed that
                        these roadway segments would still have access opportunities.
                        LOS "D" or better is achieved within Paradise except along Skyway
                        between Maxwell Drive and Neal Road where LOS "F" occurs. The
                        actual level of service is dependent upon the number of travel lanes
                        assumed for Skyway. If 4 lanes is assumed, LOS "F" occurs; if 6
                        lanes is assumed, LOS "D" - "E" is created along the highest volume
                        segment. Selected roadway segments operated at LOS "D". Along
                        these segments, if the number of lanes is increased, level of service
                        would be improved.
                        Impacts of traffic on roadway segments which reflect projected levels
                        of service below "D" ("E" OR "F") are potentially significant.
                        However, the policy statement regarding level of service and
                        assumptions for trip generation rate incorporated in the proposed
                        General Plan will reduce impacts to a level that is less than
                        significant. This policy statement and assumptions are as follows:

                        CP-1     The Town shall strive to maintain a level of service (LOS)
                                 "D" or better as the standard for new and existing roadways
                                 in the Paradise Planning Area. LOS "D" or better shall be
                                 maintained on all local streets within the town limits, and
                                 LOS "C" or better shall be maintained whenever feasible.
                                 However, the Skyway between Bille and Neal Roads may be
                                 allowed to exceed this standard. The Town shall review
                                 average daily traffic volumes along Skyway between Bille and
                                 Neal Roads before and after any construction of Skyway as a
                                 4-lane arterial with a center two-way left turn lane. If and
                                 when the LOS "D" threshold is reached, the Town shall
                                 determine whether to construct additional improvements to
                                 Skyway or to amend the Land Use Element designations and
                                 Circulation Element to maintain acceptable traffic volumes.
                        Trip Generation Assumptions
                        For the traffic generated in Paradise Pines and Magalia, the traffic
                        consultant divided the number of existing two-way trips on Skyway
                        just north of Pentz Road by the total number of dwelling units. The
                        resultant trip rate was approximately 3.8 trips per dwelling unit. This
                        rate is substantially lower than rates used for the residential growth
                        in Paradise (7.66 trips per unit was used for all residential other than
                        multi-family which used 6.47 trips per unit.) Surveys indicate that
                        approximately 42 percent of the population is over 60 years of age.
                        This would suggest that less travel on average may be generated by
                        the housing in Paradise. A reduction in the average daily and peak
                        hour trip generation rate would appear warranted. Reductions of 20
                        to 25 percent could be considered.
                        Mitigation measures listed below can further reduce impacts, but are
                        not required to reduce impacts to a level that is less than significant.
                        Level of Service Considerations: This General Plan assessment used
                        average daily traffic volumes to define the numbers of lanes and street
                        classifications within Paradise. While the traffic volume criteria
                        provides an estimate for average daily level of service, traffic impacts
                        during peak hours could exceed LOS "C" at major intersections.
                        Therefore, the recommendations for numbers of lanes and street type

                        (classification) should not be used to discourage individual
                        environmental review for specific development projects within
                        Paradise.
                        Impact #3.13-2: While the traffic model for Paradise did not project
                        land use changes outside of the Primary and Secondary Planning
                        Areas, some traffic was assigned to all three of the major roadways
                        leaving Paradise. The model forecasts that approximately 8,500 new
                        daily trips will be added to these facilities. Of these trips, an
                        estimated 3, 100 will use Skyway, 5 ,200 Clark Road and 200 Pentz
                        Road. It is assumed that most of the Skyway trips are destined for
                        Chico, while the Clark Road traffic is destined for Routes 70 or 99,
                        with the largest component allocated to Route 70. The Butte County
                        Congestion Management Plan forecasts 90,000 daily trips on Route
                        99 between Skyway and Route 32 in Chico. The Plan recommends
                        a 6 lane freeway operating at LOS "A".
                        Conclusion: Adding the 3,100 daily trips from Paradise will not
                        significantly impact the level of service on Route 99. Route 70 south
                        of Route 149 is projected to carry 62,300 daily trips at LOS "C" (4
                        lane freeway). Adding the entire 5,200 daily trips from Paradise
                        would not change the LOS on this link during the peak hours. It is
                        estimated that 620 additional peak hour trips would be added to the
                        projected 5,600 volume for a total of 6,220 peak hour trips.
                        Assuming a capacity of 8,000 vph, the resultant LOS would be .78
                        or "C", and the impact will be less than significant.
Mitigation
Measures:               Mitigation Measure #3.13-1: A series of new east/west residential
                        collector connector roadways could be developed in the southern
                        portion of the Town of Paradise to divert traffic from Pearson Road.
                        Roadways proposed on the Circulation Diagram include:
                        •        Roe Road east of Foster to Clark and Anchor Way
                        •        Wayland Road
                        Additional potential east-west connectors include:
                        •        Buschmann westerly to Skyway
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-63                               May 15, 1992

                        •       Neal Road to Skyway
                        Applies to Impact #3.13-1.
                        Effectiveness or Measure: Of these options, the Buschmann and Roe
                        Road connectors would divert the greatest number of peak hour and
                        daily trips. In fact, the diversion could be significant enough to
                        require a 2 lane divided collector along Roe Road. The easterly
                        extension of Roe Road to Anchor Way would reduce the need to
                        widen Pearson Road east of Clark Road. Of course, if the Business
                        Park and/or Light Industrial uses south on Clark and Neal Road
                        generate more traffic towards Chico and Oroville rather than
                        Paradise, the need for these new connectors would be diminished.
                        Implementation/Monitoring: The Town Engineering Office is
                        responsible for assuring that new road construction is accomplished
                        in accordance with the General Plan and EIR.
                        Mitigation Measure #3.13-2: Reconstruct the intersection of Foster
                        Road and Pearson Road to physically prevent traffic from crossing
                        Pearson Road from one side of Foster Road to the other. Applies to
                        Impact #3 .13-1.
                        Effectiveness or Measure: This measure will reduce traffic volumes
                        on Pearson Road to level of service "C".
                        Implementat.ion/Monit.oring: The Town Engineering Office is
                        responsible for assuring that the necessary reconstruction takes place
                        in accordance with the General Plan and EIR.

Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria: Impacts on public facilities and
                        services from the proposed General Plan can be considered
                        significantly adverse if the cumulative impacts of development in
                        accordance with the Plan will result in one or more of the following
                        situations which would not be mitigated or offset by policy statements
                        in the Plan or the existing standard tax or fee system:
                        •        A need for new systems or services results;
                        •       Substantial alterations to the existing systems or services are
                                 necessary;
                        •       The providing agency is currently operating at or above
                                 capacity and the additional service need would create an
                                 additional burden.
                        Impact #3.14-1: Increased demand on police services. Additional
                        development and population accommodated by the proposed General
                        Plan will result in an estimated need for 5 to 6 additional officers
                        (plus equipment and support personnel) during the planning period to
                        maintain the existing staffing standard of one officer per 1,200
                        residents and response time of 5 minutes. If all or portions of the
                        Secondary Planning area are annexed, the Town will be required to
                        provide police protection services to these areas as well. At planned
                        densities, it is estimated that an additional 11 to 12 officers would be
                        required to serve existing developed areas and planned new
                        development. If annexation of areas is formally proposed by the
                        Town, feasibility studies concerning a plan for providing services and
                        environmental documentation will be required prior to approval.
                        Conclusion: Based on the impact evaluation criteria, increased
                        demand on police services is a significant impact. However, policy
                        statements and implementation measures incorporated in the proposed
                        General Plan closely tie development to the availability of law
                        enforcement services, and will reduce this impact to a level which is
                        less than significant. These policy statements and implementation
                        measures are as follows:

                        LUP-10 The Town shall assure that the rate and character of
                               growth is commensurate with or does not exceed the
                               current level of public services, and shall assure that
                               municipal services can be provided to areas planned

                               improve its public service delivery capacity to assure
                               that future growth does not outstrip services.
                        LUP-18 New land use development shall not cause the levels
                               of police protection to fall below the service levels
                               established by this Plan.
                        LUP-20 Future development shall be designed and constructed
                               to take maximum advantage of known fire and crime
                               prevention siting, orientation and building techniques.
                        LUP-21 Establishment of assessment districts shall be
                               considered in newly developing areas to assure that
                               the longer term costs of land use development are
                               adequately funded.
                        LUP-22 A system of fees shall be established sufficient to
                               assure that future growth pays its equitable share of
                               service delivery costs.
                        LUI-12 Establish law enforcement and fire protection impact
                               fees for new land use development sufficient to assure
                               that established levels of protection are maintained.
                        LUI-13 If feasible, establish law enforcement and fire
                               protection service fees for existing land uses sufficient
                               to assure that established levels of protection are
                               maintained.
Paradise General Plan EIR            4-66                                  May 15, 1992
                        LUI-14           Establish standards for fire and crime prevention,
                                         orientation and building techniques in the Zoning and
                                         Subdivision Ordinances.
                        LUI-15           Establish a fee or fees to be collected upon issuance of
                                         permits for new development that will cover the cost
                                         of additional services and infrastructure not paid
                                         directly by the developer.
                        LUI-16           Utilize Mello-Roos and other forms of assessment
                                         district financing where the economics of new
                                         development permit.
                        Impact #3.14-2: Increased fire protection demand. As development
                        occurs in accordance with the proposed General Plan, a cumulative
                        increase in the demand for fire protection services will result. If all
                        or portions of the Secondary Planning Area are annexed, the Town
                        will be obligated to provide fire protection services to existing
                        development and new development. If annexation of areas is formally
                        proposed by the Town, feasibility studies concerning a plan for
                        services and environmental documentation will be required prior to
                        approval.
                        Conclusion: Based on the impact evaluation criteria, increased
                        demand on fire services is a significant impact. However, policy
                        statements and implementation measures incorporated in the proposed
                        General Plan closely tie development to the availability of fire
                        protection services, and will reduce these impacts to a level which is
                        less than significant. Policy statements and implementation measures
                        which will reduce these impacts are as follows:
                        Land Use Element
                        LUP-9            The character of future development shall be
                                         compatible with the Town's service delivery abilities
                                         and shall not result in service level declines.
                        LUP-10           The Town shall assure that the rate and character of
                                         growth is commensurate with, or does not exceed the
Paradise General Plan EJR                       4-67                                 May IS, 1992
                               current level of public services, and shall assure that
                               municipal services can be provided to areas planned
                               for annexation and development.
                        LUP-12 The Town shall continue to investigate means to
                               improve its public service delivery capacity to assure
                               that future growth does not outstrip services.
                        LUP-19 New land use development shall not cause the levels
                               of fire protection to fall below the service levels
                               established by this Plan.
                        LUP-20 Future development shall be designed and constructed
                               to take maximum advantage of known fire and crime
                               prevention siting, orientation and building techniques.
                        LUP-21 Establishment of assessment districts shall be
                               considered in newly developing areas to assure that
                               the longer term costs of land use development are
                               adequately funded.
                        LUP-22 A system of fees shall be established sufficient to
                               assure that future growth pays its equitable share of
                               service delivery costs.
                        LUP-25 The Town shall designate general locations for new
                               schools and fire stations in the Planning Area and
                               shall reflect the general location of these future
                               facilities on the Land Use Diagram. The actual
                               location of fire stations shall be in conformance with
                               the criteria established in the Safety Element.

                        LUI-13 If feasible, establish law enforcement and fire
                               protection service fees for existing land uses sufficient
Paradise General Plan EIR              4-68                                May 15, 1992
                                         to assure that established levels of protection are
                                         maintained.
                        LUI-15           Establish a fee or fees to be collected upon issuance of
                                         permits for new development that will cover the cost
                                         of additional services and infrastructure not paid
                                         directly by the developer.
                        LUI-16           Utilize Mello-Roos and other forms of assessment
                                         district financing where the economics of new
                                         development permit.
                        Safety Element
                        SP-7             New fire station(s) shall be located so that all areas
                                         within town limits are within a 5-minute emergency
                                         response time. New fire station locations shall be
                                         within a 1/2-mile radius of the symbols indicated on
                                         the Land Use Diagram.
                        Impact #3.14-3: Increased structural and wildland fire hazard.
                        Additional development in areas subject to wildland fire hazard will
                        result in the exposure of additional people and property to this hazard.
                        Conclusion: The potential exists for significant impacts to occur with
                        regard to exposure of additional people and structures to wild land fire
                        hazard if development and construction were unregulated. However,
                        policy statements and implementation measures that have been
                        incorporated in the proposed General Plan, Town Improvement
                        Standards, and an existing Town ordinance which prohibits new shake
                        roofs will reduce these impacts to a level which is less than
                        significant. Impacts related to water supply are addressed in Impact
                        #3.14-8 below. Policy statements and implementation measures
                        incorporated in the General Plan which will reduce these impacts are

                                       improved for emergency vehicle access.
                        SP-5           The Town shall promote fire prevention by continuing
                                       to require brush removal and fuel load clearing as
                                       ongoing conditions of development approval and
                                       property maintenance.
                        SP-6           The Town shall adopt a recent Uniform Fire Code
                                       amended to reflect the unique needs of Paradise, and
                                       require compliance with its provisions.
                        SP-8           The Town shall encourage Butte County to enforce
                                       standards conforming to the fire safety standards
                                       established by the State Board of Forestry for State

                                       account the recurrent nature of wildland fires
                                •      Design standards establishing minimum road widths
                                       and clearances around structures

                        Sl-1             Review existing standards for roadway widths,
                                         emergency access and road and structural
                                         identification and amend as necessary.
                        SI-6             Educate residents regarding the dangers of seismic
                                         activity and wildland fires, and the Town of Paradise
                                         Multihazard Disaster Plan.
                        ST-7             Adopt the Town of Paradise Multihazard Disaster
                                         Plan by reference in the General Plan.
                        SI-8             Enforce and comply with the provisions of the
                                         Uniform Building Code and the Uniform Fire Code.
                        SI-9             Require adequate      dry   brush   clearance   around
                                         structures.
                        Impact #3.14-4: Reduction of available landfill capacity. Using an
                        estimated solid waste generation rate of one ton per capita per year
                        which is disposed to the landfill, as reported in the Paradise Source
                        Reduction and Recycling Elements, approximately 11,672 additional
                        tons of solid waste would be generated annually at buildout within the
                        Primary and Secondary Planning Areas.             This amount would
                        contribute to cumulative regional impacts on landfill capacity. It is
                        currently estimated that the Neal Road Landfill will reach capacity in
                        1999.
                        Conclusion: Based on the impact evaluation criteria, the potential
                        exists for a significant cumulative impact on the landfill. However,
                        policy statements and implementation measures incorporated in the
                        proposed General Plan, along with adoption and implementation of
                        the Paradise Source Reduction and Recycling Elements, will reduce
                        impacts to a level which is less than significant. The Source
                        Reduction and Recycling Elements have been prepared in compliance
                        with State mandates which require reductions in solid waste disposed
                        to landfills by 1995 and 2000. Policy statements and implementation
                        measures in the proposed General Plan which will reduce impacts on
                        the landfill are as follows:
Paradise General Plan ElR                       4-71                                May 15, 1992

                        OCEP-49         The Town shall support and develop programs to
                                        recycle useful materials, including composting as an
                                        alternative to vegetation burning.
                        OCEP-50         Active community involvement in solid waste
                                        management and recycling shall be encouraged.
                        OCEI-31         Adopt and implement the Source Reduction and
                                        Recycling Elements and Household Hazardous Waste
                                        Element.
                        OCEI-34         Work towards establishment of a composting/chipping
                                        program.
                        OCEI-35         Establish mandatory refuse disposal, including a
                                        curbside recycling program.
                        OCEI-36         Improve recycling operations to accept all recyclables
                                        and maintain convenient hours of operation.
                        OCEI-37         Eliminate leaf burning after establishing a program for
                                        disposing of yard waste in an environmentally
                                        sensitive manner.
                        Impact #3.14-5: Need to extend solid waste collection services. The
                        Town is served by several private waste disposal companies, but
                        service is not mandatory. If refuse collection is not assured for new
                        development, there is a potential for illegal waste disposal, additional
                        burning of waste vegetation, and failure to meet the State-mandated
                        waste disposal reduction goals.
                        Conclusion: Based on the impact evaluation criteria, these impacts
                        are potentially significant.      However, policy statements and
                        implementation measures listed in Impact #3.14-4 above which are
                        incorporated in the proposed General Plan, and adoption and
                        implementation of the Source Reduction and Recycling Elements, will
                        reduce these impacts to a level which is less than significant.
Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-72                                  May IS, 1992
                        Mandatory refuse disposal service is funded by fees for service, and
                        will contribute to tipping fees collected at the landfill which are used
                        by Butte County to offset the cost of landfill maintenance and
                        expansion.
                        Impact #3.14-6: Increased school enrollment. The Paradise Unified
                        School District is operating under conditions of overcrowding, as
                        described in Section 14.6 of Volume Ill, Environmental Setting.
                        Using the yield factors contained in the Paradise Unified School
                        District Developer Fee Facilities Plan of: .24 elementary students per
                        household, .06 intermediate students per household, and .09 high
                        school students per household, planned General Plan buildout has the
                        potential of ultimately increasing the District's enrollment by 1,978
                        students (1,217 elementary, 304 intermediate, and 457 high school
                        students). Based on District criteria for school size, it is estimated
                        that this will result in the need for four additional schools (two
                        elementary, one intermediate, and one high school).
                        Conclusion: The cumulative impacts of development in accordance
                        with the proposed General Plan are potentially significant. However,
                        policy statements and implementation measures included in the
                        General Plan closely tie new development to availability of school
                        facilities, and will reduce impacts to a level which is less than
                        significant.    These impacts are further reduced by District
                        implementation of year-round school.            Policy statements and
                        implementation measures which will reduce impacts on schools are as
                        follows:

Paradise General Plan EIR                     4-75                                 May 15, 1992

                        ESI-6           Explore the feasibility of establishing a specific
                                        development impact fee program to assist the Paradise
                                        Unified School District to offset the impacts upon
                                        their facilities resulting from residential growth.
                        Impact #3.14-7: Increased demand on existing and for new public
                        parks and recreational facilities. The Town Subdivision Ordinance
                        establishes a park acreage standard of 3 acres per 1,000 population,
                        and the proposed General Plan increases that standard to 5 acres per
                        1,000.
                        Conclusion: Based on the impact evaluation criteria, increased
                        demand for public parks would be considered potentially significant.
                        However, objectives, policy statements and implementation measures
                        incorporated in the proposed General Plan, and Town requirements
                        for park land dedication or payment of in-lieu fees, will reduce
                        potential impacts to a level which is less than significant. Objectives,
                        policy statements and implementation measures which will reduce
                        impacts on parks and recreation are as follows:

                        OCE0-5          Increase the standard ratio of park acreage to
                                        population to 5 acres per 1,000 population.
                        OCEP-19         Whenever feasible, trailways shall be established in
                                        conjunction with new development, to serve as buffers
                                        and corridors between development, linking existing
                                        trailways, parks and school sites.
                        OCEP-20         The Town shall work with Feather River Hospital to
                                        create a public park and trail system on their property
                                        overlooking the Feather River Canyon.
                        OCEP-33         The continued operation of the golf course shall be
                                        encouraged, possibly through acquisition.
                        OCEP-34         The feasibility of establishing a public campground
                                        near DeSabla and Paradise Lakes shall be explored.

                        OCEP-36          A linear park shall be established encompassing the

                        OCEP-39          The Town shall endeavor to acquire and/or establish
                                         additional open space, particularly in the eastern
                                         portion of town.
                        OCEI-20          Work with the Paradise Recreation and Park District

                        LUP-14           The Town shall encourage the Paradise Irrigation
                                         District, Lime Saddle Community Services District,
                                         Paradise Recreation and Parks District, Paradise
                                         Cemetery District, and Paradise Unified School
                                         District to expand or enhance service capacity,
                                         consistent with the Town's General Plan.
                        Impact #3.14-8: Increased water consumption, provision of adequate
                        water supplies, and need for additional fire flow and peakload water
                        supply. Based upon the estimated population at General Plan
                        buildout, it is calculated that an additional 1.7 to 2.0 million gallons
                        per day will be needed at buildout in the Primary Area and 1.1 to 1.3
                        million gallons per day in the Secondary Planning Area (based on PIO
                        figures for historical per capita water use in the District). It is also
                        necessary to assure that adequate fire flow is available for fire
                        protection purposes.
                        Conclusion: Based upon impact evaluation criteria, the impact on
                        water supply will be a significant unavoidable cumulative impact.
                        While the proposed General Plan closely links new development to

                        available water supplies, includes policy statements and
                        implementation measures designed to reduce impacts by assuring an
                        adequate water supply, and includes water conservation policies, it
                        will still result in the depletion of water resources. In the context of
                        provision of water service in Paradise (refer to Volume III,
                        Environmental Setting), impacts on water supply are determined to be
                        cumulatively significant, and no additional mitigation measures are
                        available.       Policy statements and implementation measures
                        incorporated in the proposed General Plan which will reduce impacts
                        on water supply are as follows:

                                       the adequacy of fire flow and peakload water supplies.
                        SP-6           The Town shall adopt a recent Uniform Fire Code
                                       amended to reflect the unique needs of Paradise and
                                       require compliance with its provisions.

                        The Department of Fish and Game has indicated that the EIR should
                        address increased water supply impacts caused by pumping,
Paradise General Plan ElR                    4-79                               May 15, 1992
                        diversions, dams, etc. on springs, lakes, streams, aquatic and wetland
                        habitats and fisheries. Please refer to Section 3.7 (Vegetation and
                        Wildlife)for a discussion of impacts on wetlands and fisheries. As
                        described in Section 14.8 of Volume III, Environmental Setting, the
                        Paradise Irrigation District is exploring both surface and groundwater
                        sources for future water supplies, and no determination has been
                        made to commence or increase pumping or diversions or to construct
                        new or expand the capacity of existing dams and reservoirs. The
                        location of these future water supplies is not even known. These
                        impacts are too speculative to address in this EIR; the PID or other
                        water provider will, however, be required to address such
                        environmental impacts at such time that new or expanded facilities or
                        actions are proposed.
                        Impact #3.14-9: Impact of additional septic systems. Impacts of
                        additional septic systems on water quality were addressed in Section
                        3. 6 (Hydrology) above, and it was concluded that impacts will be
                        reduced to a level that is less than significant.
                        Impact #3.14-10: Impact of construction of a wastewater treatment,
                        collection and disposal system which will serve portions of the
                        community. The construction of such a system is a major assumption
                        of the proposed General Plan. Some land use designations and
                        density ranges are based upon this assumption (refer to Table 2-1,
                        Volume I, Policy Document). If all or portions of the Secondary
                        Planning Area are annexed, the sewer system will likely need to be
                        expanded at some point to serve these areas.
                        Conclusion:      The impacts of construction of this system are
                        potentially significant; however, these impacts have been and will be
                        addressed in environmental documents prepared for that project. A
                        Final Environmental Impact Report was certified for the Central Area
                        Wastewater Collection and Sewage Treatment Facilities System
                        (SCH# 88041912) by the Town of Paradise, and additional
                        environmental documentation will be required for approval of the
                        actual design and construction of the proposed wastewater facilities.

Measures:               Because no significant impacts have been identified, or no mitigation
                        measures are available, no mitigation measures are required.
3.15    SCENIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
Setting:                Please refer to Sections 3.1 and 3.15 of Volume III, Environmental
                        Setting, for a description of the Town history and scenic and cultural
                        resources of the Paradise Planning Area.
Impacts:                Impact Evaluation Criteria for Cultural Resources: Appendix K
                        of the CEQA Guidelines provides explicit guidance for determining
                        the "archaeological importance" (i.e., significance) of cultural
                        resources and suggestions for mitigating effects to them.
                        Archaeological importance is generally a measure of the
                        archaeological research value of a site.             Archaeological sites,
                        particularly those of the Historic period, are considered to be
                        archaeologically important only if the archaeological or historical
                        information they represent can be obtained solely through
                        archaeological methods (i.e., systematic excavation).                If the
                        historically consequential information can be gathered by means of
                        historical research rather than through archaeological excavation, the
                        site is not archaeologically important under CEQA. Any unmitigated
                        impact to an important archaeological resource is considered
                        significant. Under Appendix K criteria, an "important archaeological
                        resource" is one that:
                        A.       Is associated with an event or person of recognized
                                 significance in California or American history or recognized
                                 scientific importance in prehistory.
                        B.       Can provide information which is both of demonstrable public
                                 interest and useful in addressing scientifically consequential
                                 and reasonable archaeological research questions.
                        C.       Has a special or particular quality such as oldest, best
                                 example, largest, or last surviving example of its kind.
                        D.       Is at least 100 years old and possesses substantial stratigraphic
                                 integrity (i.e., it is essentially undisturbed and intact).
Paradise General Plan EIR                       4-81                                  May 15, 1992
                        E.      Involves important research questions that historical research
                                has shown can be answered only with archaeological methods.
                        Federal guidelines for evaluating the significance of archaeological
                        and historical resources are the criteria for inclusion in the National
                        Register of Historic Places (36 CFR 800). These guidelines, codified
                        in federal law (36 CFR 60.4), are summarized below:
                                The quality of significance in American history, architecture,
                                archaeology, and culture is present in districts, sites,
                                buildings, structures, and objects of State and local
                                importance that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
                                materials, workmanship, feeling and association and:
                                1.       That are associated with events that have made a
                                         significant contribution to the broad patterns of our
                                         history, or
                                2.       That are associated with the lives of persons
                                         significant in our past, or
                                3.       That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type,
                                         period, or method of construction, or that represent a
                                         significant and distinguishable entity whose
                                         components may lack individual distinction, or
                                4.       That have yielded or may be likely to yield
                                         information important in prehistory or history.
                        Both State and federal guidelines acknowledge that, aside from
                        archaeological and historical values, cultural resources can be
                        significant for their cultural or religious values (e.g., cemeteries and
                        sacred places). The federal Native American Religious Freedom Act
                        of 1979 provides protection for sites of Native American sacred
                        significance, and State laws promulgated under SB 297 (1982)
                        prescribe specific treatment for Native American human remains
                        discovered during excavation.
Paradise General Plan EIR                      4-82                                 May 15, 1992
                        Impact #3.15-1: Potential for disturbance or destruction of cultural
                        resources within the Paradise Planning Area.
                        Conclusion: It is known that cultural resources exist within the
                        Planning Area, and the potential exists for significant impacts to occur
                        if development, redevelopment, and construction were unregulated.
                        However. the policy statements and implementation measures that are
                        incorporated in the proposed Paradise General Plan, and compliance
                        with Appendix K of the CEQA Guidelines, will reduce these potential
                        impacts to a level which is less than significant.
                        Appendix K of the CEQA Guidelines is fairly explicit on mitigation
                        measures for cultural resources. It addresses treatment of human
                        remains under State law and limits on archaeological excavation as
                        mitigation.    These limits do not apply to test excavations for
                        evaluating significance.       Mitigative excavations shall only be
                        conducted by qualified professional archaeologists, who must prepare
                        an excavation plan prior to the procedure to narrowly focus the
                        excavation on recovery of data that will enable them to address
                        specific, scientifically consequential research questions.
                        When human remains are excavated, either by archaeological
                        procedures or during construction, the County coroner must be
                        notified immediately to determine whether the remains require
                        investigation of cause of death. Once it is determined that the
                        remains are of Native American origin, the State Native American
                        Heritage Commission must be notified immediately. The Commission
                        will identify the Native American group or individuals who are the
                        most likely descendants of the deceased Native Americans. The
                        descendants will then negotiate with the landowner, archaeologists,
                        and the lead agency to ensure dignified treatment of the remains
                        according to the customs and wishes of the descendants. The
                        Commission will mediate such negotiations, if necessary.
                        In accordance with the CEQA Guidelines, archaeological data
                        recovery excavation as a mitigation measure should be reserved as a
                        last resort. This is both because of the potential expense involved,
                        and because it is the first responsibility of archaeologists to preserve
                        and protect resources rather than disturb them through excavation.
Paradise General Plan EIR                       4-83                                May 15, 1992
                        Other means of mitigation include avoidance, redesigning a project to
                        leave the resource in an undeveloped portion of the site, preservation
                        easements or other land use set-aside, constructing a substantial
                        enclosure (such as a locked fence) around the site, or covering the site
                        with at least two feet of clean fill or pavement. If the site is to be
                        covered, filling or paving should proceed from the perimeter of the
                        site inward, so that heavy equipment will not directly contact the site
                        surface. Compression will impact the site. Once an archaeological
                        site is covered, any land use that will not entail excavating beneath
                        the covering will be allowable. Other measures, as appropriate, will
                        be recommended by a qualified, professional project archaeologist or
                        historian.
                        The proposed policy statements and implementation measures which
                        are incorporated in the General Plan which will reduce impacts on
                        cultural resources are as follows:

                                        to undertake an archaeological survey prior to project
                                        approval upon recommendation by the Center.
                        OCEI-26         Undertake a program of identification and cataloguing
                                        of historic resources, including those in the Central
                                        Commercial area, for use in future planning efforts.
                                        •        Establish a historic register and historical
                                                 society.
                                        •        Provide tours and      plaques  for historic
                                                 structures/sites.
                        OCEI-28         Amend the General Plan to include the list of historic
                                        structures, as appropriate.
                        OCEI-29         Require compliance of all development projects with
                                        Appendix K of the Guidelines for Implementation of
                                        the California Environmental Quality Act.
                        OCEI-30         When an archaeological survey is required by the
                                        Town or recommended by the California
                                        Archaeological Inventory, Northeast Information
                                        Center, the survey shall be undertaken by a qualified
                                        professional archaeologist who is certified by the
                                        Society of Professional Archaeologists or has
                                        equivalent qualifications.
                        OCEI-31         Should any historic or pre-historic artifacts be
                                        discovered during construction, all work shall cease
                                        until a qualified professional archaeologist views the
                                        site, provides recommendations and gives clearance to
                                        continue.
                        Because all construction, development and redevelopment must be in
                        compliance with these policies, implementation measures and
                        regulations, this impact is found to be less than significant and no
                        mitigation measures are required.
Paradise General Plan EIR                      4-85                               May 15, 1992

                        Impact Evaluation Criteria for Scenic Resources:                  The
                        Environmental Checklist Form in Appendix I of the CEQA Guidelines
                        provides two criteria for evaluating impacts on scenic resources:
                        •       Obstruction of any scenic vista or view open to the public
                        •       The creation of an aesthetically offensive site open to the
                                public view
                        Impacts which meet either or both of these criteria should be
                        considered significant.
                        Impact #3.15-2: Potential for land development and construction,
                        and construction or improvement of public works projects in
                        accordance with the General Plan to obstruct scenic vistas or create
                        an aesthetically offensive site open to the public view.
                        Conclusion: The Planning Area is rich in scenic resources and scenic
                        vistas. The potential exists for significant impacts to occur if
                        development and construction were unregulated. However, the policy
                        statements and implementation measures that are incorporated in the
                        proposed General Plan and the regulations of the Town Subdivision
                        Ordinance, Improvement Standards, the Tree Ordinance and the
                        Zoning Ordinance (sign ordinance) will reduce these potential impacts
                        to a level which is less than significant.
                        The proposed policy statements and implementation measures which
                        are incorporated in the General Plan which will reduce impacts on
                        scenic resources are as follows:

Mitigation
Measures:               Because no significant impacts have been identified, no mitigation

                                   CHAPTER FOUR
                            PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
4.1     ALTERNATIVE GENERAL PLAN CONCEPTS
        An integral part of the early preparation of the Paradise General Plan was the
identification and intensive consideration of four alternative land use and circulation
concepts for the Paradise Planning Area. These alternatives were developed by the four
subcommittees of the General Plan Revision Steering Committee. The purpose of this
consideration was to identify reasonable alternative development and conservation
possibilities for the area, in view of community priorities and values, and in relationship
to identified issues, constraints and opportunities. CEQA and the implementing State
CEQA Guidelines (Section 15126(d)) mandate that such alternatives to the proposed Plan
be discussed in this EIR. The value of such discussion is to inform public decision-
makers of the differential environmental impacts which might be associated with each
potential alternative, and to enable a reasoned judgement to be made regarding whether
some alternative to the proposed Plan might be environmentally superior.
        The alternative land use proposals for the Planning Area which were considered
during the early Plan formulation stages are conceptually illustrated in Figures 4-1, 4-2,
4-3 and 4-4 (inserted separately). These alternatives were considered prior to selection
of a preferred alternative, which is the basis for the proposed General Plan. It
encompasses some features from all four alternatives, but also incorporates some new
features.
        With respect to each of the aspects of the environment discussed in the preceding
chapter of this EIR, the differential potential impacts of the various land use alternatives
considered during the Plan preparation process have been described and evaluated to the
extent possible, given the conceptual nature of these alternatives. Many of the proposals
contained in these alternatives have been incorporated in the proposed General Plan. In
addition, the "no-project" alternative and an alternative involving a different planning
area are evaluated below. The final section of this chapter presents an assessment of the
comparative environmental superiority of all the project alternatives.
Paradise General Plan ETR                    5-1                                May 15, 1992
4.2     THE NO PROJECT ALTERNATIVE
        The State CEQA Guidelines mandate that the "no project" alternative be
considered in an environmental impact report. The Guidelines further stipulate that when
the no project alternative is environmentally superior, the EIR shall also identify an
environmentally superior alternative among the others considered for the project. In this
section, the environmental effects of the no project alternative are identified and
discussed.
        State law requires every city and county to adopt a general plan. If the proposed
Plan or some alternative plan is not adopted, the existing Paradise General Plan, adopted
in 1982 for a ten-year planning period, will remain in effect. As time passes, that Plan
will become increasingly outdated and non-responsive to current needs. According to
the State General Plan Guidelines:
        The general plan should be reviewed regularly regardless of its horizon,
        and revised as new information becomes available and as community
        needs and values change. Unless it is periodically updated, a plan will
        become obsolete in the face of community change. A general plan based
        upon outdated information and projections is not a sound basis for day-to-
        day decision making and may be legally inadequate... A jurisdiction is
        expected to make running changes to its general plan as they are
        necessary. (p. 13-14).
        In addition, maintaining the existing Plan would cause the Town to forego the
opportunity to preserve and enhance the environment through new Plan policies. While
the Town of Paradise could choose not to adopt the proposed General Plan and maintain
the existing Plan, such an approach would be inconsistent with State law and is not
feasible or realistic.
4.3     ALTERNATIVE LOCATION
        One CEQA reference (Guide to the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA), Remy, et. al., Solano Press, 1991) identifies several circumstances which might
trigger the requirement to analyze alternative locations for the project, based on CEQA
case law. These include instances where a legislative action is being sought to change
the allowed use for the proposed project (such as a zone change); in cases where
Paradise General Plan EIR                   5-2                               May 15, 1992
development at an alternative site would substantially diminish or avoid significant
impacts of the proposed project; and also, when policy decisions are being made about
where to locate particular land uses in the context of large geographic areas. The latter
circumstance clearly applies to adoption of a general plan.
        Because the Town of Paradise is required by law to prepare and adopt a general
plan, there is no question but that a plan must be adopted for the geographic area within
the Town limits. However, the proposed Paradise General Plan encompasses a larger
geographic area as its Planning Area. This discussion evaluates the selection of the
proposed Planning Area, as opposed to an alternative Planning Area Boundary such as
the existing Town limits. The existing Paradise General Plan, adopted in 1982, covered
only the area within the Town limits at the time of adoption.
        State law provides that, in addition to covering all territory within the municipal
boundaries, the general plan must cover "any land outside its boundaries which in the
planning agency's judgement bears relation to its planning" (government Code Section
65300), since certain issues are not confined to political boundaries. As stated in the
State General Plan Guidelines, "Cooperative "extraterritorial" planning can be used to
guide the orderly and efficient extension of services and utilities, ensure the preservation
of open space, agricultural and resource conservation lands, and establish consistent
standards for development in the plans of adjoining jurisdictions" (p.6).
        The Guidelines further state that, when determining its planning area, each city
should consider its sphere of influence. The Secondary Planning Area identified in the
Paradise General Plan is the same as the Sphere of Influence adopted in 1985 for the
Town of Paradise by the Butte County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO).
According to the Guidelines, although there is no direct statutory link between the sphere
and the planning area, the former provides a convenient measure of the city's region of
interest. The Secondary Planning Area includes, to the north, the unincorporated
communities of Magalia and Paradise Pines, whose development impacts the Town of
Paradise; and to the south, the existing airport and proposed site of portions of the future
wastewater treatment infrastructure.
        Alternative planning areas to the east and west are unrealistic due to extremely
steep terrain and waterways. While the Planning Area could be limited to the Town
limits, such an action would be contrary to the intent of State law and the General Plan
Guidelines. It would also not assist with directing development occurring in the
Paradise General Plan Em                     5-3                                 May 15, 1992
unincorporated area; there would simply be less assurance that such development would
provide for the "orderly and efficient extension of services and utilities, ensure the
preservation of open space, agricultural and resource conservation lands, and establish
consistent standards for development in the plans of adjoining jurisdictions."
        The Tertiary Planning Area, while extending beyond the Secondary Planning Area
to the southwest, is not an area proposed for growth and development in the Paradise
General Plan, other than portions of the future wastewater treatment infrastructure. It
is an area for which the Town is proposing to adopt policies regarding its potential
development under the auspices of Butte County. Because of its proximity to Paradise,
its function as a gateway to the community, and potential future opportunities, the Town
is attempting to influence land use activity in this area through adoption of policy
statements in the Paradise General Plan.
4.4     ALTERNATIVE GENERAL PLAN SCENARIOS
ALTERNATIVE PLAN #1
Description. The members ofSubcommittee#l agreed that the Town of Paradise should
capitalize on its unique attributes, and that the General Plan should provide the tools to
make that happen. No need was seen for any major changes in the existing General Plan
land use map; rather, it should be built upon, and enhanced by, the issues highlighted in
the goals, objectives and policies for this alternative (refer to Working Paper #2, Issues,
Goals, Objectives and Policies, Chapter 1). Please refer to Figure 4-1, Alternative Plan
#1, for a map of this alternative.
        This alternative identified the selection and implementation of a Town theme as
the most important outcome of the General Plan. It would apply to new and remodeled
commercial structures, as well as public facilities and improvements. This theme would
focus upon the Town's unique rustic and historical features (including the Paradise and
Magalia railroad depots, and the old Victorian hotel on Birch Street). This theme should
be implemented through a cooperative, incentive-based program (such as redevelopment),
rather than a punitive or authoritarian approach. Promotion of this theme would help to
promote the economic development of the Town and tourism. Related to this was a
strong interest in the preservation of trees and a reforestation program, and the creation
of a Town arborist or tree specialist position at Town Hall, enhancing one of the Town's
Paradise General Plan EIR                    5-4                               May 15, 1992
unique features. Other features to be protected included canyons, watercourses, vistas,
scenic highways, ridgelines, and access to rivers and streams.
         This alternative assumed a slow, managed rate of growth. New development
must pay its own way and be linked to the availability of public services and facilities.
Toward this end, this alternative recommended that consolidation or acquisition of the
library, Paradise Irrigation District, and other special districts be studied. No consensus
was reached regarding a preferred direction or boundaries for any new growth that did
occur. However, this alternative provided for the annexation of developed areas of
Paradise Pines to the Town of Paradise, and initiation of a "tiered" annexation of all land
within the current Sphere of Influence (Secondary Planning Area) within one year, in the
following manner:
         TIER #1. Annexation of developable lands along the three major roadways
         serving the Town from the south.
         TIER #2. Annexation of all other lands within the southern portion of the
         current Sphere of Influence.
In addition, this alternative called for initiating the expansion of the current Sphere of
Influence to coincide with the Tertiary Planning Area boundary.
         New commercial development was proposed to occur in centers or nodes,
although it was recognized that existing strip commercial development would remain, for
the most part. Infill development should be promoted (through redevelopment and other
means) in what was defined as the "heart" of the Town: the area between Skyway, Bille,
Clark and Elliott. High density residential development (including residential care
facilities and senior citizen housing) should occur on available sites in proximity to
commercial development, allowing residents to walk and bike to commercial centers.
         Areas proposed for industrial development included an expansion of the existing
industrial park along Clark Road, the airport, and an area along Neal Road. Other
notable features of this alternative included protection of the airport from encroachment
by incompatible uses, continued operation of the golf course (possibly through
acquisition), creation of attractive southern gateways into the Town, and conversion of
the junkyard along lower Skyway to a Park and Ride facility. To promote safety,
Paradise General Plan EIR                     5-5                               May 15, 1992
recreation and an alternative to the automobile, this alternative proposed a continuous
system of bike paths and trails linking schools, parks, commercial and residential areas.
        With regard to circulation system improvements, this alternative called for studies
to be performed to determine the feasibility and appropriateness of the following
improvement projects:
•       Extension of Buschmann Road to Skyway
•       Extension of Forest Service Road to Skyway
•       Conversion of Almond Street and Skyway to one way streets
•       Creating additional connections north to Paradise Pines, from the west side area
        to Skyway, and from the southern portion of Town to a major Town-owned
        street.
•       Within 3 to 5 years, study the area between Bille Road and Pearson Road for a
        possible connection to Pentz Road.
Evaluation.             Given the constraints presented by ex1stmg development,
topography, and other characteristics of the physical environment, which would be
difficult to alter, Alternative Plan # 1 represented a pragmatic approach to the future
physical development of the community. By proposing to build upon and enhance
existing community strengths, this Plan would minimize potential disruptions and costs
which might result from implementing major changes in land use patterns. Many of the
proposals contained in this alternative have been incorporated in the proposed General
Plan.
        The alternative assumed a slow, managed rate of growth commensurate with the
Town's and special districts' ability to provide necessary services. However, this
alternative did not provide a recommended direction(s) for growth. Not establishing a
preferred direction theoretically allows for a maximum of development opportunities.
However, it does not provide for potential cost savings or minimizing environmental
impacts which could be achieved by planning for growth. The Town and other service
providers could potentially provide infrastructure and services more efficiently and in a
more environmentally sound manner by planning the location of sewer and water lines,
Paradise General Plan EIR                   5-6                                May 15, 1992

storm drainage facilities, roads, schools, etc. One of the expressed goals of this
alternative was to "Provide cost-effective public services in the community", and it was
recommended that a feasibility study be undertaken regarding consolidation or acquisition
of special districts.
         A feasibility study for the annexation of the Paradise Pines area was also
proposed, but it was recognized that annexation would be difficult to achieve. The
proposal to initiate annexation of the entire Sphere of Influence within one year would
represent a large commitment of Town staff time and resources. Because the Town
would have to demonstrate to the Local Agency Formation Commission that it had the
ability to provide services to the area proposed to be annexed, it is probably also
infeasible to annex the entire area at this time. However, increasing the size of the
Town's Sphere of Influence ("ultimate growth boundary") would represent a first step
in planning for eventual annexation of these areas.
         Alternative Plan #1 's proposal to capitalize on and enhance the Town's assets
could be implemented through a variety of methods. Adherence to a theme suggests a
design/architectural/sign review and enforcement process, which would require additional
staff time and a new citizens committee. Economic development, infill development and
downtown revitalization would have the potential to increase payrolls and stimulate
additional spending in the Town. Redevelopment could simultaneously function as a
means of implementing these activities and as a source of additional tax revenues. This
alternative also included some specific recommendations regarding properties for which
redevelopment would be suitable. The alternative assumed that a stronger Chamber of
Commerce, with better funding, was a key to implementing many of its proposals.
         This alternative proposed that single family residential lot sizes range from 1/3
to 213 acre. While such a density is low in the context of most California cities, it is
compatible with existing development and the topography of Paradise. The larger the
lot size, the greater costs will be associated with residential sewer service. It was also
proposed that high density residential development (including residential care facilities
and senior citizen housing) be located on available sites near commercial development.
This would allow residents to walk and bike to shopping areas, and assure that the sites
could support this density of development by having access to sewer service and roads
to accommodate that volume of traffic. The difficulty with such locations involves the
small number of available sites and the opposition frequently encountered from
established neighborhoods.
Paradise General Plan EIR                    5-7                               May 15, 1992
         The areas proposed for industrial development probably represent the only
realistically available areas within the Primary and Secondary Planning Areas.
Development along Neal Road would result in substantial traffic impacts and could
require widening or, at a minimum, requiring Neal Road to be improved to major
collector or arterial roadway standards. The intersection of Neal Road and Skyway
would require realignment and signalization.
         Redevelopment/infill of the Clark/Skyway /Elliott/Bille" superblock" could provide
opportunities for developing improved off-street parking and circulation, thus solving
some of the current circulation problems along these roadways. If the proposed one-way
couplet of Skyway and Almond Street were considered for implementation, its impacts
on the circulation system for the entire superblock should be studied. Internal access
would need to be provided (Oakwood, Beech, Fir and Foster should be studied) and
Foster Street should be cul-de-sacced at its north and south ends in order not to interfere
with the circulation of the one-way couplet. The one-way couplet proposal is further
evaluated below. The concept of internal access between adjoining commercial uses,
with limited access to major roadways, offers opportunities for additional circulation
improvements. As this concept could be applied along Skyway and Clark Road, existing
on-street parking could be eliminated to provide room for new roadway capacity, without
reducing circulation and/or joint use of parking facilities provided off-site under current
Town off-street parking regulations.
         With regard to the natural environment, this alternative proposed to preserve and
enhance the Town's natural assets. It proposed reforestation and preserving and restoring
stream courses to their natural state.          The alternative also recommended that
development, improvement and landscaping standards take into account Paradise's unique
environmental, physical and historical character. This alternative proposed to improve
the natural environment by prohibiting leaf burning and establishing mandatory refuse
collection and recycling.
         To provide a continuous system of bike paths and trails could require widening
some of the major arterial and collector streets within Paradise. Linkages with the
north/south Paradise Memorial Trail might require sidewalks and/or expanded roadway
shoulders to provide adequate space and separation between bicycles and vehicles.
Alternatively, a set of bike routes (linkages within the bike system which use public
streets) could be adopted. Bike routes allow for joint use of travel lanes by automobiles
and bicycles. Additional parks and recreational programs are proposed; such services
Paradise General Plan ElR                    5-8                                May 15, 1992
and facilities are now provided by the Paradise Recreation and Parks District. Use of
trails and pathways for a combination of pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian traffic may
create conflicts and be difficult to manage and regulate.
        Conversion of the "junkyard" along Skyway to a park-and-ride facility offers a
real opportunity to enhance public transit use. Any intercity public transit services
should be modified to serve the new park-and-ride lot. A proposed bypass to Skyway
at the northern end of Paradise (e.g. northwest from the intersection of Skyway and
Clark Road) might prove beneficial in splitting traffic between Skyway and Clark Road
south of this point. There does not appear to be another bypass option to the south of
the Skyway/Clark intersection unless a designation of Skyway to Clark Road to Pearson
Road to Skyway were adopted, with substantial traffic control measures along Skyway
and the east-west streets serving the downtown.
        The proposed one-way Skyway/ Almond Street couplet offered an opportunity to
increase the directional capacity of the two streets in the downtown area, and also
afforded the opportunity to create diagonal on-street parking on Almond Street if desired.
The northbound traffic should use Almond Street and Skyway should accommodate
southbound traffic. In order for the couplet to work, modifications would need to be
made to the existing street system to connect the two streets at the north and south ends
of downtown. Options at the north end included creation of a "Y" intersection
connecting with Luther Drive, or use of Elliott Road as a connector. Elliott Road was
a less optimal alternative due to its current function as a major arterial and the need to
make modifications to the northeast corner of Elliott and Skyway for the connection to
function properly. At the south end, the connection could be made either at Pearson
Road or Black Olive; however, the Black Olive option would require some extensive
right-of-way acquisition and intersection modifications. The Pearson Road alternative
would also require some prioritizing of turn movements from Skyway to Pearson to
accomplish this.
        Possible westerly connections from Crestview or Pinewood should only be
provided if Oliver Road and/or Valley View Drive were over capacity. New connections
would be expensive to build and could encourage development to the south along the
ridges these roads serve. They both would need to connect to Honey Run Road, which
currently has constrained capacity, and connection to Elliott Road might prove more
feasible.
Paradise General Plan EIR                   5-9                               May 15, 1992
ALTERNATIVE PLAN #2
Description. The members of Subcommittee #2 emphasized the importance of
preserving Paradise's physical environment, while at the same time promoting the
economic development of the Town. Please refer to Figure 4-2, Alternative Plan #2, for
a map of this alternative. While there was no need for major changes in the existing
General Plan land use map, the amount of parks and open space should be increased,
especially in areas which are already developed where there are few parks. Areas
unsuitable for septic systems might be candidates for parks and open space. Additional
small parks should be developed throughout the Town within the next 15 years. There
was a strong interest in the protection of stream courses and the watershed. Remaining
agricultural lands should also be preserved.
         This alternative included a number of proposals for enhancing the economic
development of the Town, consistent with the protection of the environment, as outlined
in Working Paper #2, Issues, Goals, Objectives and Policies. There should be a
townwide theme applied to new and remodeled commercial structures, based on the
Town's rustic character. This theme should be enforced through design standards and
a process of review and approval of architectural styles, signs and colors. Other
proposals included development of a conference center/destination resort, events that
attract tourists, expanded shopping opportunities, and a farmers market. A gateway
concept was proposed that would include the establishment of a scenic information park,
complete with canyon viewing areas, parking, and a visitor center with information about
the Town of Paradise and the surrounding area. A Redevelopment Plan should be
adopted to assist with economic development, and the Town should consider participation
in the Main Street program.
         Growth should be linked to the availability of services and facilities, especially
the available water supply, and should not exceed an annual rate of 1.5 percent. New
growth and development should occur to the south (including the Lime Saddle area) and
be annexed to the Town. Services would need to be provided, including schools, a new
fire station, and an adequate water supply. The sewer system should be planned to serve
the entire Town within 15 years. This alternative also proposed the annexation of
developed areas in Paradise Pines, while recognizing the potential difficulty of obtaining
the support of the residents for annexation.
Paradise General Plan EIR                   5-10                               May 15, 1992
        This alternative proposed several modifications to improve the existing circulation
system. These included the extension of a number of east-west roads (Elliott,
Buschmann, Nunneley, Roe, Wayland, downtown streets) to connect to Clark and/or
Skyway, and the creation of a bypass to Skyway (at least for emergency use). Pentz
Road should be designated a scenic highway. The Town should explore ways to recover
costs associated with use of the roadways by residents of the Upper Ridge if annexation
is not feasible. Sidewalks in selected areas and other safe pathways for bicyclists and
pedestrians on Town-maintained streets were of special concern. A trail system should
be established in the southerly portion of the Secondary Planning Area to take advantage
of the canyons and significant cultural resources in that area. Alternative forms of
transportation should be encouraged and supported over the next 15 years to improve
traffic circulation and air quality in the Town and the region.
        While recognizing that most existing commercial uses along Skyway and Clark
would remain, this alternative proposed that new commercial development should occur
in centers, and as infill in older areas. Infill, including second story "mixed uses",
should be encouraged in the area between Pearson, Elliott, Skyway and Black Olive.
New commercial development should be architecturally compatible with the Town theme.
        Areas proposed for industrial development included the airport (which should not
be permitted to expand), along Highway 99 (in the long term), and in suitable locations
along Neal Road (protecting archaeologically sensitive areas) and Clark Road. High
density residential development should be located where roads can accommodate the
traffic generated by such developments, and retirement facilities should be located close
to services. Multiple family developments should be low density in nature (duplexes,
triplexes and fourplexes).
Evaluation. Alternative Plan #2 can be characterized as focusing upon two major issues:
preservation of the environment and economic development. Although it might be
argued that the two concepts are mutually exclusive, the proposals in this alternative
were, for the most part, internally consistent. In fact, the economic development
proposals can be viewed as a means of increasing Town revenues in the long term, which
can potentially be used to fund proposed environmental protection measures. As with
Alternative Plan #1, many of the proposals of this alternative have been incorporated in
the proposed General Plan.
Paradise General Plan EIR                    5-11                              May 15, 1992
        The major changes proposed, in comparison with the existing General Plan,
included the designation of protective vegetative buffers along all streamcourses, trails
and bikepaths. The Plan also called for increased parks and open space, linked by trails.
The map which accompanies this Plan is very conceptual; feasible locations for such
features would need to be determined based on existing development, topography and
property lines.
        Constructing bicycle lanes on Skyway would require eliminating parking or
widening of the roadway. Widening of Clark Road might also be needed to establish
bicycle lanes. The costs associated with establishing bike lanes on all Town-maintained
roads might also be a concern. The use of trails and pathways for a combination of
pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian traffic may create conflicts and be difficult to manage
and regulate.
        This alternative bears some similarity to Alternative Plan #1 in that it also
proposed a Town theme, design review, a redevelopment plan, as well as several specific
recommendations, including a destination resort/conference center and gateway/visitor
center. Proposals regarding infill development in older areas (defined as the area
between Pearson/Elliott/Skyway/Black Olive) and commercial centers, rather than new
strip commercial development, were also similar to Alternative Plan #1. Redevelopment
and/or infill could provide opportunities for developing improved off-street parking and ,
circulation, thus solving some of the current circulation problems in this area. As a key
element of economic development, the Plan recommended that a full sewer system be in
place within 15 years, which may not be entirely feasible.
        This Alternative Plan also assumed a slow, managed rate of growth (not to exceed
1.5% annually). It was proposed that the area to the south of the existing Town limits,
within the Secondary Planning Area, be designated for new growth and development.
The advantages of development to the south include its proximity to the proposed sewage
treatment plant and the availability of water within the Lime Saddle Community Services
District (CSD) boundaries. The Plan recognized that services must be provided to the
area as development occurs, such as schools, sewer and water, and an additional fire
station. Development to the south would produce a need for expanded or additional
capacity along the roadways serving the new development. By annexing this area, the
Town would control the development options, access, and of funding the improvements
necessary to mitigate impacts.
Paradise General Plan EIR                   5-12                               May 15, 1992
        In addition to the area to the south, this alternative recommended studying the
feasibility of annexing Paradise Pines, while recognizing that it may not be possible.
With regard to traffic impacts on the Town of Paradise from existing and future
development of this area, a joint powers agreement could be developed with Butte
County to pay for transportation improvements and create joint benefit traffic impact
fees. It was also proposed that Lookout Point be annexed in order to develop it as a
parkway and protect it from inappropriate development.
        Several potential roadway extensions or connections were proposed, which are
described and evaluated as follows:
•       The extension of Elliott to Pentz Road should not be linked to Picket; rather, a
        potential extension to the northeast should be considered.
•       The westerly extension of Buschmann to Skyway should be considered to relieve
        traffic congestion on Pearson Road between Skyway and Scottwood Road.
•       The extension of Roe Road may not provide any overall traffic benefit except to
        increase the development potential for the areas served by the new connector.
        The potential for the Roe Road extension to reduce traffic along Pearson Road is
        questionable due to its width and configuration.
•        A bypass to Skyway at the northern end of Paradise (e.g. northwest from the
         intersection of Skyway and Clark Road) might prove beneficial in splitting traffic
        between Skyway and Clark Road south of this point. There does not appear to
        be another bypass option to the south of the Skyway/Clark intersection unless a
        designation of Skyway to Clark Road to Pearson Road to Skyway is adopted, with
         substantial traffic control measures along Skyway and the east-west streets serving
         the downtown is adopted.
        This alternative also strongly recommended construction of sidewalks and
pedestrian pathways for safety reasons. The Town currently has street standards which
include sidewalks and other pedestrian amenities. Streets which need to be brought up
to current standards include Skyway north of Bille; Sawmill; Wagstaff; Bille west of
Skyway; Oliver Road; Central Park; Elliott east of Clark; Nunneley west of Sawmill;
Neal Road south of Skyway; Roe Road; Scottwood; portions of Porter Road; Libby Road
and Edgewood Road south of Pearson Road. The proposed expansion of public transit
Paradise General Plan EIR                     5-13                              May 15, 1992

might require funding by the Town of Paradise or additional allocations of State Gas Tax
funding from roads to transit projects.
        Alternative Plan #2 proposed industrial development along Highway 99 as a long-
term strategy. Due to that area's distance from the existing Town limits, and the statutes
and criteria governing annexation, it would be difficult for the Town to gain control of
this area within the time frame of the General Plan. However, as a first step, the Town
could request that LAFCO amend their Sphere of Influence for Paradise to include this
area. Other proposed industrial sites included Neal Road, Clark Road and the airport.
Development along Neal Road could result in substantial traffic impacts, and could
require widening or, at a minimum, requiring that the road be improved to major
collector or arterial roadway standards. The intersection of Neal Road and Skyway will
require realignment and signalization.
        If Pentz Road were designated as a scenic highway, as proposed, appropriate land
use and development controls should be incorporated into the General Plan to implement
that designation. This alternative also generally recommended strengthening standards
and enforcement of existing Town ordinances regarding home occupations, signs and
noise. In order to improve the local environment, the Plan recommended mandatory
refuse disposal and recycling and a prohibition on leaf burning, accompanied by a
community composting program.
        The single family residential density proposed under this alternative was two
dwelling units per acre if sewer was not available, and four dwelling units per acre if
sewer is available. The latter density is feasible to serve with a sewer system. The Plan
recommended that new multiple family development occur at fairly low densities
(duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes). This density of development would make excellent
infill projects in low density areas and would provide some needed rental housing.
However, there is probably a need for some higher density development as well, to take
advantage of sewer availability and to make public transit more feasible.
        Alternative Plan #2 recommended the preservation of remaining agricultural lands.
Preservation limits the development options of property owners and reduces the sites
available for development which the Town may want to encourage. However, it does
preserve open space, historical associations, and has the potential to draw tourists if
promoted (similar to the harvest in the Apple Hill area outside Placerville).
Paradise General Plan EfR                   5-14                               May 15, 1992
ALTERNATIVE PLAN #3
Description. Subcommittee #3 wished to carefully manage growth to assure that the
Townwide infrastructure was in place to adequately serve it. There was also a strong
desire that development pay its own way and that planning tools such as development
impact fees, assessment districts, and payback strategies be explored and used to assure
that adverse impacts to existing service levels did not occur. Infill was encouraged while
protection of the physical environment within the community was given a high priority.
This included such things as trees, small animals, views, water courses and steeply
sloping lands. Present orchards and agricultural uses, however, were not targeted for
preservation; instead, such areas were seen as opportunities for community infill. Please
refer to Figure 4-3, Alternative Plan #3, for a map of this alternative.
        Substantial areas both north and south of Town were proposed for annexation
during the planning period in order to facilitate orderly growth and decision-making in
the Paradise region. To the north, annexations would encompass areas already largely
developed, as well as the Paradise watershed area, and would allow for consolidation of
action by government to assure that decisions in one area did not burden another
unnecessarily. Such action would also allow for a fairer sharing of the cost of services.
To the south, a large and substantially undeveloped area stretching from Neal Road to
the Feather River was proposed for annexation, including the Lime Saddle Community
Services District.
        An area was suggested as an "open classroom" and park adjacent to Butte
College. The area would provide an outdoor study area for students studying
archaeology, biology, natural resources conservation and other disciplines. It was
envisioned that the area would be open to all levels of education, including elementary,
high school and college students. It was also proposed that the community's sewage
treatment facility be located in this general area in order to put the effluent to beneficial
use on the public open space, including creation of wetlands. A nature trail system for
pedestrians and equestrians was also suggested.
        A Scenic Overlook was proposed below the community along Skyway to contain
a small parking lot, guard rails along the cliff areas, short trails to scenic points, and a
small sign. An artisans and tourist center containing small shops and crafts was
suggested as part of a revitalized central area which was to be located east of Skyway
between Pearson and Elliott Roads.
Paradise General Plan ElR                   5-15                                 May 15, 1992
         Other commercial activity was to be contained in crossroads centers located at
major intersections along Clark and Skyway. Existing strip commercial zoning was to
be maintained where it presently exists; however, new strip commercial zoning was to
be discouraged. No distinction was to be made between commercial types, with a full
range of commercial uses, including professional office, implied by the commercial
designation.
         Multiple industrial sites were proposed in order to provide opportunities for job
generating businesses to locate in Town. These sites included an area along Neal Road
likely to be served by a future community sewer and two areas along lower Clark Road
within the current Town Sphere of Influence.
         Retention of existing single family residential development patterns and densities
was viewed as desirable. Multiple family densities were to be targeted into an area in
close proximity to the center of the community and accessible to the future community
collection sewer system. It was proposed that properties presently designated for
multiple family use but which remained undeveloped and were outside the formal sewer
system target area, be redesignated for another use.
         This alternative suggested that certain actions be taken with regard to circulation,
but cautioned that the effect such changes will have on existing residential neighborhoods
should be carefully studied. Studies should be performed to determine the feasibility and
appropriateness of extending/connecting Buschmann Road to Skyway, and extending
Nunneley Road, Elliott Road, or another main east-west street to Pentz Road. It was
also proposed that Skyway be rerouted between Bader Mine Road and South Park Road
to eliminate an existing dangerous and slow stretch of major road. Finally, the
Subcommittee proposed the closure to vehicular traffic of Honey Run Road between
Honey View Terrace and the McEnespay Ranch in order to eliminate a poor! y maintained
and dangerous roadway.
         It was proposed that Honey Run Road remain open to pedestrian, bicycle and
equestrian traffic and be accessible to emergency vehicles. In general it was proposed
that all pathways be equally accessible to equestrians and runners, as well as pedestrians
and bicycles.
Evaluation. This alternative placed considerable importance on the availability of
necessary services prior to approval of new development. Equal weight was placed on
Paradise General Plan EIR                     5-16                               May 15, 1992
new development paying its own way. The importance placed on services and cost is
sustainable through the General Plan process as long as the Plan is carefully crafted to
clearly set out the level of service necessary for growth. The methodology for
determining future development's "fair share" should also be incorporated into or spelled
out in the General Plan. Improvement of services may be tied to the revenues generated
by future growth, therefore, the community must remain sufficiently flexible to allow
enough growth to support the cost of expanded or improved services. The desire to
limit growth may in fact be an impediment to improved service levels.
        The Subcommittee felt it was desirable to explore consolidation of the Town and
the Paradise Irrigation District in order to assure consistency in decision making and the
long term availability of an adequate water supply. The Town could be well served by
such consolidation which could also give the Town greater influence over activities
occurring in the Town's watershed.
        Infill was given considerable encouragement even though it might result in the
loss of existing in-town orchards. From the perspective of efficiency in land use and
service delivery, such an approach is to be commended. The orchards involved are of
limited expanse and their long-term viability is problematic. Elimination of orchards,
however, does reduce open land and green-space within the community, also a
Subcommittee priority.
        The annexation of surrounding areas, both developed and undeveloped, is a
desirable goal. Annexation of already developed areas to the north might, however,
prove exceedingly difficult unless the Town can offer something residents of the area do
not already have. The opportunity to share equitably in the cost of services is seldom
a motivator for people considering annexation. Vacant lands to the south might be more
easily annexable and the community should pursue this as a high priority.
        The prospect of creating an "open classroom" and park south of the Town might
attract considerable interest. Key to its implementation would be finding a method for
financing the venture. Any effort should involve the active participation of Butte College
and other educational facilities.
        An artisans and tourist area in central Paradise might be the most viable approach
for the "redevelopment" of the central area. It is very unlikely that a conventional
commercial project has much potential given competing commercial areas and the present
Paradise General Plan EIR                    5-17                              May 15, 1992
physical configuration of the central area. A properly designed and marketed center of
small shops and crafts would be unique in the Butte County region and could draw from
more distant areas of California. The concept would also support the Subcommittee's
interest in tourism promotion as an economic development tool.
        Retention of all existing strip commercial zoning would discourage aggregation
of future commercial uses in centers. Additional consideration should be given to
limiting strip commercial opportunities by distinguishing between commercial and
professional office use, allowing for exclusive designation of some areas for offices.
Retail commercial, service commercial and office uses generate substantially different
traffic patterns and peak hour impacts. It is desirable to group such uses in order to
avoid design incompatibilities and conflicts.
        The designation of more than one area for future small industrial activity is a
desirable feature. The absence of community sewers might, however, limit the
development potential of such sites. The major site shown on Neal Road has
considerable potential given its size and future community sewer access. Vehicular
access to the site may prove to be a considerable obstacle due to the present character
of Neal Road and the distance to other thoroughfares. The proposed industrial
development, along with other development, would produce substantial traffic impacts
and could require widening Neal Road. The intersection of Neal Road and Skyway
would require realignment and signalization.
        Policies concerning multiple family and single family development were
compatible with other community goals, placing concentrations of people in proximity
to the future community sewer while protecting existing neighborhoods. A minimum
parcel size was not established for residential use in unsewered areas nor was one
established for sewered areas. Parcel size standards and densities need to be expressed
in the General Plan.
        With regard to the natural environment, this alternative places emphasis on the
preservation of trees and habitat for small animals but contains few mechanisms for
accomplishing this. Two suggestions included in the Plan were that the Town review its
present tree preservation regulations to assure that they will sustain and enhance the
present forested setting, and the establishment of stream protection zones. The stream
protection zone concept is relatively loosely defined and would require more attention.
Paradise General Plan EIR                  5-18                             May 15, 1992
         This alternative also placed emphasis on views and recommended a scenic
overlook on Skyway and close review of ridgeline development. Junkyards were also
slated for cleanup. All of theses actions were compatible with the Subcommittee's desire
to promote Paradise as a tourist destination. Additional regulations would be necessary
to fully implement these ideas. The scenic overlook area is presently in the County and
would require County cooperation or annexation for implementation.
         The extension of existing residential streets to provide more east-west connections
is desirable from a circulation improvement perspective. The subcommittee, however,
limited such connections, fearing the impact additional traffic would have on existing
neighborhoods. The Subcommittee did suggest improvements to north-south circulation
through realignment of Skyway between Bader Mine Road and South Park Road. In
addition to bypassing a dangerous curve, the alternate route might also prove beneficial
in splitting traffic between Clark and Skyway south of this point. There appeared to be
no other bypass options south of the Skyway/Clark Road intersection.
         With regard to the other roadway extensions suggested for study, the following
comments are offered:
•        The extension of Elliott to Pentz should not be linked to Picket, rather a potential
         northeast extension should be considered. This extension appears more feasible
         than Nunneley to Pentz and provides a more direct linkage with the hospital.
•        The westerly extension of Buschmann to Skyway is very desirable and will help
         relieve congestion on Pearson Road between Skyway and Scottwood.
         The closure of Honey Run Road south of Honey View Terrace appears desirable.
The road is substandard and serves a limited number of destinations. Bringing the road
up to standard and maintaining it at that level would prove to be cost prohibitive. There
would also be expense associated with maintaining it for non-vehicular access.
         Several east-west pathways were proposed along existing roads which would link
up with the Paradise Memorial Trail way. It was intended that existing shoulder areas
be improved and widened. This is a very desirable feature of the Plan but will have
improvement costs associated with it.
Paradise General Plan ElR                    5-19                                May 15, 1992

        Pathways within the community are proposed to be accessible to a variety of
users: equestrians, runners, bicycles and pedestrians. Such a mix could be hard to
manage. Pedestrians, bicycles and equestrians are not necessarily compatible uses.
        Within the proposed Safety Element, the Subcommittee established service levels
for both police and fire protection, linking approval of new development to maintenance
of those levels. Providing a measurable service level standard in the General Plan for
all services should be a goal of the Town's planning effort in order to avoid future
disagreements over what is meant by "adequate levels" of service.
Paradise General Plan EIR                   5-20                            May 15, 1992
ALTERNATIVE PLAN #4
Description. Subcommittee #4 viewed the Town's growth opportunities as being limited
until infrastructure was in place to serve any development. An "Urban Reserve" area
was shown south of Town; however, there was significant resistance to continuing
growth and greater emphasis was placed on preserving the community as it is. The 1.5
percent per year growth cap was viewed in the context of the entire ridge area and not
just the Town of Paradise with some feeling that it would not be undesirable if the
growth occurred outside the Town proper. Please refer to Figure 4-4, Alternative Plan
#4, for a map of this alternative.
        It was believed by some that Paradise is a "bedroom community" to Chico. It
was also expressed that tourism should not be promoted but that the Town should
promote cultural events that may attract tourists. Most importantly it was felt that
Paradise should promote a sense of community for those already here. In this vein, it
was proposed that Paradise identify "Gateways" on major roads where signage and a
sense of what Paradise is can be reflected. These would be areas with special land use
controls to assure that development that was unsightly or out of character with Paradise
would be discouraged.        Stream protection areas were also identified in which
development should be carefully monitored and controlled in order to protect the
watershed and character of Paradise.
        It was suggested that development for both older and younger age groups be
promoted so that a full range of age groups was present. Rather than annex outlying
areas, it was suggested that the community work with Butte County to create joint
planning and decision-making for the ridge area, possibly through an area Planning
Commission or some similar mechanism. There was considerable interest in assuring
that decisions were not made by Butte County that frustrate efforts by Paradise to control
growth.
        Commercial development patterns were to be maintained under this alternative and
infill was to be encouraged in existing strips along Clark and Skyway. A substantial area
was shown, generally bounded by Skyway, Clark, Elliott and Pearson, as a central
commercial area which would allow for some concentration of commercial use in the
center of the community. This area formed the center of an "H" with Clark and Skyway
forming the verticals. As an alternative to mixed commercial infill along the strips, it
Paradise General Plan EIR                    5-21                             May 15, 1992
was proposed that some areas be designated as exclusive professional office development
areas. Mixed uses (e.g. residential apartments over retail shops) should be permitted and
encouraged in the commercial areas, provided no significant adverse impacts would
result. No new strips were to be entertained under this alternative.
        A single new industrial area was shown along Neal Road south of Town. The
site was intended to accommodate industry, if industry sought to locate in Paradise. The
site would have access to the future community sewer.
        Present residential patterns were to be maintained with higher density areas to be
focused along the route of the future sewer and around the central commercial area. The
minimum parcel size Townwide in unsewered areas was proposed to be one-half acre,
and the maximum height for buildings 35 feet.
        A number of suggestions were made concerning circulation and access, including
the creation of public access to the Miocene Canal. It was suggested that the Town
negotiate with PG&E for such access and propose to pay for the improvements to make
access feasible and safe. The Canal was viewed as a prime recreational asset for the
Town.
        Another circulation suggestion was the creation of a Park and Ride at the upper
end of Paradise to reduce through traffic on Skyway from the Upper Ridge.
        Road improvements included the connection of several in-Town streets:
•       Elliott to Pentz Road
•       Buschmann to Skyway
•       Roe Road to Bennett Road
•       Circle Lane to Edgewood Lane
•       Crestview Drive to Skyway
•       Newland to Clark Road
Paradise General Plan EIR                   5-22                              May 15, 1992

        Pathways accessible to the public were encouraged and it was proposed that future
developments have pedestrian walkways on at least one side of the street.
Evaluation.         This alternative could be described as the "existing conditions"
alternative, promoting the retention of Paradise as it is. To counter outside pressures that
may impose growth on the Paradise region, the alternative suggested a strong working
relationship with Butte County to create joint planning and decision-making for the ridge
area. It is always difficult to maintain things as they are and it is particularly difficult
when dealing with more than one political jurisdiction. The concept of developing a
strong working relationship with Butte County, including joint planning and decision-
making, is commendable and progressive. Implementation will require hard work and
a consensus within the Paradise area.
        The alternative did not promote economic activity, viewing Paradise continuing
as a place for people to reside, with new job and shopping opportunities probably
locating in more distant communities. Although this might maintain the present character
of Paradise, it would exacerbate traffic congestion and air quality problems without
providing Paradise with important property tax and sales tax revenues to pay for
solutions. The approach is also unlikely to result in the establishment of a General Plan
and EIR that address issues of housing accessibility, jobs/housing balance and feasible
financing programs to pay for the services Town residents desire.
        A large mixed use commercial area was shown in the center of the community
which was ascribed a community-wide goods and services role and as a focus for
visitors. A redevelopment project was also suggested to support the central commercial
area concept and a distinctive identity and character was proposed for the central area.
It was uncertain, however, what would drive the creation of the central commercial area,
particularly since the Subcommittee did not envision an active tourism industry in the
community. It is likely that competition from other centers along Skyway and Clark
would inhibit the creation of a central commercial area unless a more specific market
were identified.
        The suggestion that professional office development replace some of the mixed
use strip commercial areas could have beneficial impacts on through traffic as well as
creating less noise intrusion into abutting residential neighborhoods. The proposal that
residences be permitted in conjunction with retail shops in commercial areas (possibly
on a second floor) was also worthy of consideration.            Placing dwelling units in
Paradise General Plan EIR                   5-23                                May 15, 1992
prox11mty to services and in lively and eclectic environments is gammg increasing
acceptance. Such development would reduce dependence on the automobile, improving
traffic congestion, air quality and community noise levels.
         Maintenance of existing residential patterns while focusing higher density areas
along the future sewer line and in the community center is consistent with good planning
practice and should be supported by the General Plan. A one-half acre minimum parcel
size was proposed for unsewered areas, while no specific density standard was
established for multiple family areas. One-half acre parcels would assist in protecting
the health and safety of Town residents in unsewered areas but would have a negative
impact on housing affordability. It would be necessary to establish multiple family
density standards as a part of further plan deliberation.
         The Subcommittee proposed that home occupations be excluded from some
neighborhoods where they are clearly incompatible and that present home occupation
regulations be reviewed. The Town might have difficulty distinguishing adequately
between neighborhoods to exclude home occupations totally while permitting them in
other neighborhoods. Zoning categories must also apply equally to all properties,
however, an exclusion could be handled through an overlay zone.
         If Paradise continued to grow residentially without providing additional jobs and
shopping opportunities, traffic levels on a daily and peak hour basis along Skyway, Clark
Road and Pentz Road would increase. This in turn would increase demand to widen
facilities. Provision of park-and-ride lots, such as the one proposed at the northern end
of Paradise, would partially mitigate traffic impacts and should be encouraged.
         The Subcommittee proposed to preserve and enhance the Town's natural assets
through streamcourse protection areas and through policies protecting trees and wildlife.
Additional refinement of these ideas must be carried out and the associated costs
ascertained.
         Community appearance standards were proposed for signs and commercial and
industrial development. No specific theme was suggested for structures, although it was
recommended that "gateway areas" have a common design theme which could be tied to
a common theme for the central commercial area. Design regulations would require the
input of a wide range of community members as well as professionals in the field of
construction, design and architecture. If precise enough standards could be written, a
Paradise (ieneral Plan EIR                  5-24                               May 15, 1992
review committee might not be necessary; however, it is more than likely that
considerable discretion would still need to be exercised at the time of project review.
        The following discussion relates to roadway extensions suggested by the
Subcommittee:
•       The extension of Elliott to Pentz should not be linked to Picket, rather a potential
        extension to the northeast should be considered.
•       Connecting Buschmann to Skyway is an important road link that will help relieve
        traffic congestion on Pearson between Skyway and Scottwood.
•       The extension of Roe Road might not provide any overall traffic benefit except
        to increase the development potential for the areas served by the new connector.
        The potential for the Roe Road extension to reduce traffic along Pearson Road is
        questionable.
•       The connection of South Libby Road to Edgewood Lane appeared to provide a
        more contiguous circulation system than a connection from Circle Lane. Circle
        Lane could be used as an alternate if access from South Libby Road were found
        to be infeasible.
•       A connection from either Crestview or Pinewood Drive to Skyway should only
        be provided if Oliver Road and/or Valley View Drive are over capacity. These
        connections would be expensive to build and could encourage development to the
        south along the ridges they serve. They both would need to connect to Honey
        Run Road which currently has a constrained capacity. A connection to Elliott
        would appear more practical if it is feasible to construct.
•       Extending Newland Road to Clark Road should be undertaken to relieve traffic
        along Pearson Road to the east of Clark Road. The connection should be made
        to Noffsinger Lane rather than a new access point.
        A continuous bicycle path system was proposed for the community linking to the
existing Paradise Memorial Trail way. To provide a continuous system could require
widening of some of the major arterial and collector streets in Paradise to provide
adequate room for the pathway. The Subcommittee gave the needs of bicyclists and
Paradise General Plan EIR                   5-25                               May 15, 1992

pedestrians a high priority recommending greater attention to road shoulders, sidewalks
and crosswalks.
         Another proposal which might have high community value is public pedestrian
access to the Miocene Canal. The outcome would be very dependent on PG&E's
cooperation. In addition to access and improvement costs, the subject of safety and
liability would undoubtedly need to be addressed.
         Within the proposed Safety Element, the Subcommittee established service levels
for both police and fire protection, linking approval of new development to maintenance
of those levels. Providing a measurable service level standard in the General Plan for
all services should be a goal of the Town's planning effort in order to avoid future
disagreements over what is meant by "adequate levels" of service. This alternative also
recommends adoption of the full Uniform Fire Code. Compliance and enforcement of
the Code would have additional costs associated with it, for both government and
property owners; however, these costs would be repaid to the community through
reduction in fire hazard and loss.
4.5      COMPARATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERIORITY OF ALTERNATIVES
         In accordance with the State CEQA Guidelines, all reasonable project alternatives
have been evaluated to determine their comparative environmental
superiority. Based upon this evaluation, it has been concluded that Alternative Plan #4
is the environmentally superior alternative, with some qualifications. Although all four
alternative plans developed by the subcommittees incorporated a managed rate of growth
and environmental concerns, Alternative Plan #4 proposes the least amount of new
growth and development within the Town, and places the greatest emphasis on
preservation and enhancement of the natural environment. However, the Town of
Paradise does not control growth and development in the unincorporated area surrounding
the Town. Adoption of a General Plan based upon Alternative Plan #4 would not
prevent incompatible or increased growth from occurring in the northerly and southerly
Secondary Planning Area, which could actually result in greater environmental impacts
than the proposed General Plan. Development in the unincorporated area would occur
without the safeguards, standards and mitigation measures built into the proposed General
Plan.      For this reason, the proposed General Plan should be considered the
environmentally superior alternative.

                        MANDATORY CEQA SECTIONS
5.1     INTRODUCTION
        The California Environmental Quality Act and the State CEQA Guidelines require
that EIRs include discussion of the following issues:
•       The relationship between local short-term uses of the environment and the
        maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity (Section 15126(e))
•       Any significant irreversible environmental changes which would be involved in
        the proposed action should it be implemented (Section 15126(±))
•       Growth inducing impact of the proposed action (Section 15126(g))
•       Cumulative impacts (Section 15130)
5.2     SHORT-TERM VERSUS LONG-TERM USES
        A general plan is by definition a comprehensive, long-term plan for the physical
development of the community. According to the State General Plan Guidelines, it is
long term in two senses: (1) it establishes goals and projects conditions and needs into
the future as a basis for determining objectives; and (2) it establishes long-term policy
for day-to-day decision making based upon those objectives. The proposed Paradise
General Plan has established a planning period of fifteen years. The EIR for the General
Plan is in fact an assessment of the long-term cumulative impacts of development on the
environment in accordance with the Plan.
        As discussed in Chapter Three of this EIR, the conversion of undeveloped land
and open space to urban uses represents a long-term commitment to a change in use as
specified in the Plan. All such development must take place in accordance with the
policies of the General Plan and mitigation measures approved as part of this EIR.
Paradise General Plan EIR                   6-1                               May 15, 1992

5.3     SIGNIFICANT IRREVERSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES
        As noted in Section 5.2 above, adoption and implementation of the proposed
Paradise General Plan would result, over time, in the conversion of currently
undeveloped land and open space to urban uses, although significant areas of open space
will remain within the Planning Area. While generally considered permanent, such
conversion is not a direct adverse impact. The secondary environmental impacts of such
changes in use are analyzed in Chapter Three. Secondary impacts which are generally
considered irreversible and significant include loss of wildlife habitat and increased water
consumption.
5.4     GROWTH-INDUCING IMPACTS
        Any general plan which plans for and accommodates future urban development
may be considered "growth-inducing". Table 3.1-1 provides information regarding
future population and dwelling units upon buildout of the General Plan at prescribed
population density and land use and building intensity. The impacts of such buildout are
assessed in Chapter Three. The Paradise General Plan is intended to be growth-
accommodating, as opposed to growth-generating. The General Plan has been designed
to maintain and enhance the environment as growth occurs through policy statements
regarding adequate public facilities and services and protection of natural resources.
5.5     CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
        As noted in Section 5 .2 above, this EIR is by definition an assessment of the
cumulative impacts of development in accordance with the proposed Paradise General
Plan. It is an assessment of the environmental effects of full buildout of the General
Plan, including existing and proposed development, and future development in
accordance with the Plan. Because the actual nature of future developments cannot be
known at this time, the EIR is by necessity not as detailed as an EIR on the specific
construction projects that might follow, but instead focuses on the secondary effects that
can be expected to follow from General Plan adoption (State CEQA Guidelines Section
15146(b)). This EIR identifies the following significant cumulative impacts:
        •       Air quality
        •       Increased water consumption
        Table 5 .1-1 identifies those projects in the Town of Paradise that have already
been approved (but not constructed) or that are currently under consideration. The
environmental documents for the previously-approved projects are incorporated by
reference in this EIR.
        In addition to planned projects within the Town of Paradise, development in the
unincorporated area of Butte County and in the cities of Chico and Oroville is addressed

in their respective general plans. The Butte County General Plan is summarized in
Section 16.1 of Volume III, Environmental Setting. Butte County is in the process of a
comprehensive general plan update. Current policy has established an Urban Reserve
policy south of the town limits, in the Secondary Planning Area. This policy limits
development and provides for coordination with the Town regarding land use, zoning,
subdivision of land and development standards. North of the town limits, in the Paradise
Pines area, there is currently a moratorium in effect on new divisions of land. However,
"buildout" development of existing lots of record continues to impact water quality and
the circulation system of the Town of Paradise, as described in Chapter Three.
        The City of Chico is also beginning the process of a comprehensive general plan
update. The impact of development in the City of Chico on the Town of Paradise is
largely related to the extent that Paradise residents travel to Chico for employment and
shopping. The policies of the proposed Paradise General Plan have been designed to
create more shopping and employment opportunities in Paradise, and to encourage use
of alternative modes of transportation for those trips which are made. The other issue
which involves the City of Chico is the proposal which has surfaced previously for a
large-scale development of Nance Canyon, which is within the Tertiary Planning Area.
This development was initially proposed within the Butte County unincorporated area and
may now be under consideration for annexation to the City of Chico.
        The City of Oroville is currently in the process of revising its General Plan and
adoption is anticipated in late summer of 1992. Although still in the process of
formulating the plan, the City's steering committee has proposed design of a plan that
would accommodate approximately 70,000 people by the year 2010. This would
approximately double the existing holding capacity of between 34,000 and 36,000. There
are five residential development projects currently under review by the City: an
annexation and 249-lot single family subdivision on 73 acres on the north side of Table
Mountain Boulevard; a specific plan that has been placed on hold by the developer; a 47-
lot subdivision on 12 acres on 4th Street, north of Grand Avenue; a 49-lot subdivision
on 10 acres on Feather Avenue at 20th Street; and a 136-lot subdivision on 30 acres on
the south side of Feather Avenue between 18th and 20th Streets.

                                  INITIAL STUDY
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
        The proposed project is an update to the General Plan for the Town of
Paradise, consisting of the Land Use, Circulation., Conservation., Open Space, Safety
and Noise elements (adopted in 1982) and the Housing Element (adopted in 1985).
The anticipated time frame for the document is 15 years, or through the year 2007
(with the exception of the Housing Element, which must be updated every five (5)
years in accordance with the provisions of State law). The existing General Plan
consists of Natural Resources, Natural Hazards, Life Enrichment, Environmemal
Quality, Housing, Co=unity Development, and Regulatory Devices elements.
LOCATION/ENVlRONMENTAL SETTING
        The Town of Paradise is located in eastern Butte County, in the western
foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The location is shown on the vicinity map
included with this Notice. of Preparation and Initial Study. The boundaries of the
Paradise Study Areas are indicated on the attached map. The Primary Study Area
reflects the existing Town limits, and the Secondary Study Area refleets the existing
Sphere of Influence. Tne Ter.iary Study Area extends to the south and west to
Highway 99 and Pentz Road. The Tertiary Study Area is an area of interest to the
Town of Paradise, in tenns of open space and development activity, and the General
Plan will address this area at a very generalized level. This General Plan update
may or may not plan for additional urban development, and it is not anticipated that
all of these areas will be designated for urban growth and development in the
Paradise General Plan. For purposes of this Iniual Study, the term "Study Area"
refers collectiveiy to the Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Study Areas.
        Located north of Paradise, within the Secondary Study Area, are the smaller
unincorporated co=unities of Magalia and Paradise Pines. To the southeast is the
City of Oroville (the County seat), and to the west is the City of Chico. The
topography of Paradise is characterized by intervening ridges and valleys sloping to
the southwest (elevation ranges from 1080 to 2320 feet), and the west branch of the
Feather River and Little Butte Creek border the town on the east and west,
respectively. The primary entrances to the co=unity are State Highway 191
(Oark Road) and the Skyway.
COMPATIBILI1YWITH EXISTING ZONING AND                  PLA..~S
        The Secondary and Tertiary Planning Study Areas, which are outside the
current Town limits, are planned for in the Butte County General Plan, as well as
the Town's General Plan. The Town of Paradise is also included in the Butte
County Association of Governments' Regional Transportation Plan and air quality
planning is performed by the Butte Countv Air Pollution Control District. Any
mconsistencies between the proposed Paradise General Plan and existing Town and
County plans are proposed to be addressed through this General Plan update.
Zoning ordinance amendments will be undertaken by the Town of Paradise as
necessary following adoption of the Plan to conform to adopted land use
designations and policy considerations.

ITI.     DISCUSSION OF ENVIRONME?'fI"AL EVALUATION
Earth
l(b)          Yes       Tn:tpacts. If new urban development, including
                        residential development, occurs in previously
                        undeveloped areas, changes in the condition of the soil.
                        inciudinir leveling, compaction and overcovering of soil
                        will result. Soils in Paradise are not generally
                        considered highly permeable. Changes in the condition
                        of the soil are an unavoidable adverse impact of the
                        proposed General Plan update, if new areas are
                        designated for urban development.
                        Mitigation Measures. The proposed General Plan will
                        attempt to minimize adverse impacts on soils, through
                        consideration of policies which ensure that soil
                        resources are used in the most efficient manner
                        possible, minimizing the cumulative impact on soils, and
                        encoura~g soil conservation outside the Plan
                        bou.ndanes. Policies promoting infill development and
                        redevelopment of vacant or underutilized lands already
                        within Town limits will be considered during Plan
                        formulation. The General Plan will also incorporate a
                        planning boundary or boundaries which will define the
                        area within which growth and development may occur
                        during the time frame of the Plan.
1( c,d,e)     Maybe     Impacts. If additional development occurs in areas with
                        sloping topography, grading and relatively permanent
                        alteration to the namral topograohy of the area will be
                        required. If grading or cut-and-fill is done improperly,
                        or development is attempted on extremely steep slopes,
                        it is possible that erosion. siltation and other adverse
                        impacts, including subsidence. could occur. It is
                        possible that destruction. covering or modification of
                        unique geologic or phvsical features could occur,
                        including impacts on former gold mining areas and
                        natural drainage swales and basins. Mapping of
                        Mineral Resources Zones bv the Cilifornia Division of
                        Mines and Geology has not 'been completed in and
                        around the Town of Paradise.
                        Mitigation Measures. The General Plan will consider
                        policies which address restrictions on development on
                        slopes greater than a certain degree, such as 30%, and
                        consider the establishment of guidelines for
                        development in areas formerly mined, development in
                        areas with unique geologic or physical feamres, and for
                        pciing and cut-and-fill. Policies of this nature can be
                        unplemented through adoption and amendment of the
                        local zoning and other ordinances.
 l(f)    Maybe Impags. If new areas are planned for urban
                development, changes in siltation. deposition or erosion
               which may modify the channel of local rivers or srreams
                and drainage swales may result.
                Mitigation Measures. It is anticipated that the General
                Plan will attempt to minimize adverse impactS on rivers,
               pockets of wetlands, and srreams through consideration
                of policies which address grading and storm drainage
                and proximity of development to such features.
 l(g)    Maybe Impacts. Previous studies suggest that seismic activity
                does not present a significant hazard in the Paradise
               Planning Study Area. However, some past seismic
                activity and the existence of known fault zones in
               proximity to Paradise suggest the potential for
                earthquake damage at some future point.
                Mitigation Measures. The project includes an update of
               the Safety Element of the General Plan. which will
               include policies designed to minimize impacts of seismic
               hazards. Consultation with the State Division of Mines
               and Geology shall occur during the General Plan
               revision process. Continuing enforcement of the
               requirements of the Uniform Building Code in all new
               and remodeled structures will help to minimize
               potential damage resulting from seismic activity.

Z(a,b,c) Maybe Impacts. If additional population concenrrations and
               urban development are planned, more vehicle traffic,
               increased ermssions, and contribution to the cumulative
               deterioration of ambient air quality will result.
               Intermittent impacts will also result from grading and
               construction during Plan buildout if new areas are
               planned for development, or for improvements to the
               existing road system. The mandate of the State Oean
               Air Act to reduce emissions countywide from 1987
               levels suggests that any net increase in air pollutant
               emissions may have a significant effect on the
               environment. Butte County is designated a
               nonattainment County for ozone, and the Paradise area
               is designated as an attainment area for carbon
               monoxide and nitrogen dioxide (it is unclassified for all
               other categories). Butte County does not meet State
               and Federal standards for particulate matter smaller
               than 10 microns in diameter (PM10). The Butte County
               Air Pollution Conrrol District (BCAPCD) does not
               operate any monitoring stations in Paradise.
               Factors in the Paradise area which mav contribute to
               adverse air quality include burning of waste vegetation,
               use of wood stoves, automobile emissions, agricultural
           burning on the Valley floor and pesticide and herbicide
           application, all of which contribute to hydrocarbon
           emissions. However, relative to other nonattai=ent
           areas of California, emissions inventories for Butte
           County show low to moderate emissions of total organic
           gases and nitrogen dioxide.
           If new residential development is planned in proximity
           to certain types of co=ercial uses and industrial
           operations, residents may be exposed to unpleasant
           odors.
           The burning of leaves and other waste vegetation, in
           substantial amounts, may have a localized effect on air
           movement, causing updrafts and directional changes
           which would not otherwise occur.
           Mitigation Measures. Short-term impacts caused by
           construction-related dust attributable to General Plan
           buildout over time can be mitigated by proper dust
           suppression practices. While imjJacts caused by
           ellllSsions from construction eqlllpment are generally
           u=itigable, it is not anticipated that they would be
           significantly adverse.
           The General Plan will attempt to separate and locate
           residential uses away from areas and facilities that may
           generate unpleasant odors.
           The General Plan will be. coordinated with the policies
           and regulations adopted by the BCAPCD, including
           indirect source rules and transportation control
           measures. to the extent that those are available within
           the time frame for General Plan adoption. Circulation
           system improvements which will be reco=ended in
           the General Plan will be intended to reduce traffic
           congestion and improve air quality in the region. The
           General Plan will also consider policies which
           encourage increased transit ridership and other forms of
           alternative transportation. Mandatory solid waste
           collection and disposal and/or alternative methods of
           disposal of waste vegetation would mitigate impacts
           resulting from burning of such vegetation. Please refer
           to item 16(f) for further discussion of potential
           mitigation measures.
           Water
3(b) Maybe Impacts. If new urban development is planned in
           previously undeveloped areas, changes in soil drainage
           patterns, absorption or percolation rates, and the rate
           and amount of surface runoff, due to grading and an
           increase in impermeable surfaces (paved streets,
           strucrures, parking areas, etc.), will result. Soils in the
                    Paradise area are not generally considered to be highly
                    permeable. Improperly planned development and/or
                    mdividuals alterations may adversely impact natural
                    drainage swales and basins, creeks and streams.
                     Mitigation Measures. The imoactS related to drainage
                    and runoff may be mitigated through implementation of
                    the reco=endations of the Town's Master Storm
                     Drainage Study and Facilities Plan (McCain Associates,
                     1980), policies and implementation standards included
                     in the General Plan update, and the Town's existing
                    subdivision and site plan review processes. The Plan
                    should attempt to designate the future general locations
                    for storm water retention basins, if these are
                    determined to be necessary. The subdivision and site
                    plan review processes assure that grading will result in
                    proper drainage and that the appropriate storm
                    dramage facilities are installed.
                    The Master Storm Drainage Study and Facilities Plan
                    reco=ended that detention storage be considered for
                    all new development and the location of detention
                    reservoirs. It also reco=ended establishment of
                    "special permit zones" where special clearance would be
                    required prior to constructing unprovements to make
                    adequate provision for design flows. Further
                    reco=endations included establishment of storm
                    drainage fees and assessment districtS, a comprehensive
                    grading ordinance, easement dedications, some piping
                    of storm drains, improvements to open channels and
                    some culvert replacement. Please refer to item 3( e) for
                    further discussion of discharge requirements.
3(c)          Maybe Impaets. It is possible that if additional, improperly-
                    planned urban development occurs, alterations to the
                    course or flow of floodwaters resulting in inundation of
                    areas not previously subject to flooding could occur.
                    Localized stream flooding may result from individual
                    and project-related alterations to natural drainage
                    courses.
                    Mitigation Measures. ImpactS which are identified may
                    be mitigated through policies and implementation
                    standards included in the General Plan regarding
                    hydrology, grading, drainage and development
                    standards, and implementation of the Master Storm
                    Drainage Study and Facilities Plan.
3(c!Ji) Maybe       Impacts. If additional urban development, including
                    residential development, is planned, consumption of
                    additional surface water from Magalia Reservoir and
                    Paradise Reservoir, and possible development of other
                    water sources, for domestic use may result; the quantity
                    is unknown at this time.
                   Mitigation Mea5ures. Impacts which are identified may
                   be mitigated through policies included in the General
                   Plan regarding growth mana!;Sement, coordination
                   between water service capacity and new development,
                   and water conservation measures. Also, improved
                   coordination of planning and administration between
                   the Town and local water purveyors may help to
                   mitigate potential impacts.
3(e)         Maybe Impags. If new urban development is planned in
                   previously undeveloped areas, the amount of
                   stormwater runoff discharge may increase, which may
                   result in adverse impacts on surface water quality.
                   Specific water quality information for surface waters is
                   not available. The existing network of drainage basins
                   and swales, which collectS runoff and directs it to
                   downslope stream courses, is inadequate during lengthy
                   winter storm activity.
                   Mitigation Measures. The General Plan should review
                   and discuss modifications to traditional me!hods of
                   storm water discharge. Alternatives may include
                   detention and/ or retention basins and other,
                   nontraditional solutions. National Pollutant Discharge
                   EHmination System (NPDES) permitting requirements
                   for non-point-source discharges into waterways,
                   including stormwater discharge, have been delayed for
                   cities of less than 100,000 population, but are expected
                   to be required of cities the size of Paradise in 1992.
                   These regulations may require pretreatment of
                   discharged stormwaters.
3(g,h) Maybe       Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
                   increased demands upon groundwater supplies may
                   result. Increased demand for domestic water supplies
                   may contribute to groundwater overdraft, especially
                   during drought years.
                   Mitigation Measures. The General Plan will address
                   water quantity and quality and water system capacity
                   needed to serve the proposed General Plan buildout.
                   Policies regarding water conservation, drought-tolerant
                   landscaping, and coordination of any planned growth
                   with service capacity could reduce or delay the need for
                   additional faciJities. (Please refer to mitigation
                   measures for item 3( d) above).
Plant Life
4(a,b,c)     Maybe Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
                   the replacement of some native vegetation with
                   structures, roads and landscaping will oc=. The
                   California Natural Diversity Data Base (CNDDB)
                   indicates that special-status plants with reponed
                   occurrences in the Planning Study Area include the
                   following: California Hibiscus (Hibiscus califomicu.s,
                   Federal-Candidate Category 2; State-None); and Butte
                   County Cbeckerbloom (Sidalcea robusta, Federal-
                   Candidate Category 2; State-None). No occurrences
                   have been reponed within the Primary or Secondary
                   Study Areas.
                   Other special status plant species with potential to
                   occur in the Study Area include Butte County fritillary
                   (Fritillaria eastwoodiae), Red Bluff rush (Juncus
                   leiospermu.s), Bidwell's knotweed (Polygonum
                   bidwelliae ), Butte morning glory (Calystegia
                   atriplicifolius) and clustered lady slipper orchid
                   ( Cypripedium jascicu.1atu:m ).
                   A field reconnaissance will be conducted during
                   preparation of the Open Space and Conservation
                   Elements which will provide more detailed information
                   regarding existing conditions and impacts.
                   Mitigation Measures. The General Plan land use
                   designations and policies should be designed to assure
                   protection of. and mitigate impacts upon, special-status
                   plant species and habitat. Measures may include
                   conservation or open space easements, requirements for
                   site-specific biotic surveys, enhancement of the riparian
                   corridors along the Feather River and/or Little Butte
                   Creek, habitat acquisition, and/ or dedications of land.
                   Additional mitigation measures may be identified
                   during the environmental review process.
4(d)         Maybe Impacts. If land which is currently in agricultural
                   production is designated for urban development in the
                   General Plan, a reduction in acreage of agricultural
                   crops may result.
                   Mitigation Measures. The potential loss of agricultural
                   resources will be evaluated in the Environmental
                   Impact Repon to determine whether it meets accepted
                   thresholds for significance. Policies can be included in
                   the General Plan which prevent premature conversion
                   of agricultural lands and which promote preservation of
                   agricultural areas in the community.
Animal Life
5(a,b,c,d)Maybe    Impacts. The CNDDB indicates no reponed
                   occurrences of ET&C animal species within the S rudy
                   Area. Information obtained from the DFG indicates
                   that additional development may impact deer herd
                   migration through the Study Area. A field
                   reconnaissance will be conducted during preparation of
                    the Open Space and Conservation elements which will
                    provide more detailed information regarding existing
                    conditions and impacts.
                    Changes in land use and increased levels of human
                    activity may restrict uninterrupted open space around or
                    through the Planning Study Areas which may serve as
                    foraging areas for certain species.
                    Mitigation Measures. The General Plan land use
                    designations and policies should be designed to assure
                    protection of, and mitigate impacts upon, special-status
                    animal species and habitat. Measures may include
                    conservation or open space easements, requirements for
                    site-specific biotic surveys, restrictions on fence
                    construction, enhancement of riparian corridors, habitat
                    acquisition, and/ or dedications of land. Additional
                    mitigation measures may be identified during the
                    environmental review process.
6( a,b) Maybe       Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
                    especially certain types of co=ercial and industrial
                    development and new or expanded roadwavs, increased
                    noise levels due to increased traffic and nolse-
                    "'enerating land uses will result. If areas are designated
                    for noise-sensitive land uses (e.g. residential, school,
                    hospitals) adjacent to noise-generating land uses
                    (Highway 191, Skyway, other major roadways, the
                    airpon), potentially severe noise impacts could oc=.
                    Mitigation Measures. The General Plan update will
                    include an uodated Noise Element which will contain
                    existing and projected noise exposure contours for
                    major roads and other major noise generators. The
                    updated Noise Element will provide policies and
                    standards for any planned new development, and
                    subsequent individual projects will be evaluated for
                    consistency with the Noise Element. Land use patterns
                    will be consistent with these policies as well. Individual
                    projects will also be subject to the environmental review
                    process.
Light and Glare
7             Maybe Impacts. If additional urban deve!ooment is planned.
                    especially cenain types of commerdal and industrial
                    development, new sources of light and glare in the
                    surrounding area may result. Exact locations or
                    intensities are unknown at this point, until specific
                    development proposals are received.
                     Mitigation Measures. Tue General Plan will attempt to
                     avoid these impacrs when assigning land use
                     designations by buffering or otherwise separating light-
                    sens1tive uses tram sources of light and glare. As
                    property is developed, Town development standards
                    and conditions of aJ?Proval will be applied to mitigate
                    potential imoacrs ot light and glare upon surrounding
                    properties. Town standards do not normally require the
                     IDStallation of street lights, thus limiting the extent of
                     adverse impacts. Individual discretionary projects will
                    be subject to Town project review processes prior to
                     approval.
Land Use
8             Maybe Impacts. Adoption of the General Plan update may
                    result in substantial changes from the present and/ or
                    planned land use in areas with existing development,
                    and if areas which are not now developed or designated
                    for urban development are so designated.
                    Mitigation Measures. Tue proposed project is a
                    General Plan update, which involves changing present
                    and/or lj~~ned land uses in many instances; rncluding,
                    but not · 'ted to, potential open space designations.
                    The impacts associated with proposed land use
                    designations, and related mingation measures, are
                    addressed under the appropriate subject headings above
                    and below.
Natural Resources
9(a)          Maybe Impacts. If additional urban development, including
                    residential development, is planned, this development
                    will consume natural resources both during construction
                    and through continued maintenance of facilities and
                    industrial production. if industries are involved.
                    Mitigation Measures. Because any new development in
                    the Plan area will consist of new residential structures,
                    businesses and industries, modern energy-conservation
                    practices, design and materials will be incorporated
                    which will minimize the use of natural resources to the
                    extent possible.
Risk of Upset
lO(b) Maybe         Impacts. If additional urban development is planned
                    and/ or densities are increased, evacuation made
                    necessary by wildland fires or other emergencies may
                    become more difficult.
                    Mitigation Measures. Tue General Plan includes an
                    update of the Safety Element which will address

                           emergencv evacuation plans. The Town is also in the
                           process of preparing an Emergency Operations Plan, of
                           which relevant pornons will be incorporated in the
                           Safety Element.
Population and Housing
11,12 Maybe                Impacts. Adootion and implementation of the General
                           Plan may result in increased population densities in
                           specified areas, and may result m the location of
                           population clusters in currently undeveloped areas.
                           Population projections will be included in the General
                           Plan update. The Plan may result in creating new
                           demand for Town services in areas which currently do
                           not receive such services to full urban standards.
                           The General Plan may designate new areas for
                           residential development, in proportion to areas
                           designated for co=ercial and/or industrial
                           development. If new co=ercial and industrial
                           development are planned, that development and the
                           Town's physical attributes may result in increased
                           demand for housing in the community. Additional
                           characteristics of the local housing market include the
                           communitv's attractiveness as a retirement and second
                           home com'.munity, which may generate additional
                           housing demand.
                           Plan implementation may, over rime, create a
                           substantial additional supply of housing to the existing
                           stock if new areas are planned for development.
                           Installation of a sewer system may broaden housing
                           opportunities in the Town by permitting construction of
                           additional multifamily housing and the potential for
                           higher residential densities.
                           The General Plan will include an update to the Housing
                           Element, which will address housing needs and all
                           housing-related issues required by law.
                           Mitigation Measures. It is anticipated that the oolicies
                           and programs contained in the Land Use and Housing
                           elements will mitigate adverse impacts on housing
                           which mav result from the Plan. The Town is also
                           consideririg adoption of a Redevelopment Plan. which
                           would provide a 20% set-aside of redevelopment funds
                           to be used for housing-related purposes.
Transportation/Circulation
13( a,b,c,d,f)Maybe        Impacts. If new urban development of currently
                           undeveloped areas is planned, construction of new or
                           extended arterial, collector and local streets and
                           increased traffic volumes and anendant impacts, i.e.
                     congestion. increased vehicle emissions, increased noise
                     levels, lack of parking, safety hazards and alteration of
                     existing circulation patterns will result. New road
                     construction and improvements to the existing road
                     system would be required as development occurs.
                    Specific issues which have been identified include
                     anticitiated transportation control measures and
                     coordination of air quality planning; alternative
                     tr~ortation needs of senior citizens; need for
                     addinonal cross streets connecting Skyway, Oark and
                     Pentz Magalia roads; and need for additional travel
                     lanes in major roadways.
                     Mitigation Measures. The General Plan. which will
                    provide for comprehensive planning of any areas
                     designated for urban development, will attempt to
                     tnitigate potential traffic problems through measures
                     such as appropriate street system design. traffic
                     controls, promotion of increased transit ridership,
                    pedestrian and bicycle safety considerations, and plans
                    for improvements to existing roadways. The Plan
                    update includes an update of the Circulation Element.
                    The existing transit system will need to serve an
                    expanded area if annexation and new development
                     occur. Increased transit use will help mitigate impaets
                     associated with increased traffic.
Public Services
14(a,b)       Maybe Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
                    increased demand for, and possible dilution of, police
                    and fire protection services will result as buildout
                    occurs. The topography and vegetation of the Paradise
                    region make areas of the co=unity susceptible to
                    wildland fire hazards and litnit potential emergency
                    evacuanon routes.
                    Mjti17ation Measures. It is anticipated that the
                    implementation portion of the General Plan update will
                    address means of providing police and fire service. The
                    General Plan should also establish a reasonable
                    geographic area for provision of urban services. A
                    Capital Improvement Study currently in preparation for
                    the Town will iden?fy needed facilines and services,
                    maintenance of public facilities, and potential financing
                    methods, such as assessment districts, co=unity
                    facilities districts. developer/ subdivision fees, and other
                    user fees. The project includes an update of the Safety
                    Element of the General Plan. which will include, but
                    not be limited to, policies designed to minimize
                    wildland fire hazards and designate emergency
                    evacuation routes.
14(c) Maybe         Impacts. If new urban development is planned,
                    adoption of the General Plan will evenrually result in
                    increased enrollment in the local school district, which
                    will contribute to overcrowding of existing facilities,
                     need for additional sites and facilities, and/ or need for
                    additional student transportation. Anticipated State
                    budget cuts may exacerbate this situation.
                    Miti1mtion Measures. Future school location planning
                    in coordination with Town Planning staff and the
                    General Plan, coordination regarding future
                    development proposals, and identification of future
                    school sites, will help mitigate impactS on schools.
                    Other mitigation measures include continued
                    implementation of developer impact fees and year-
                    round school, which has already been implemented at
                    one of the two elementary schools in the Town and is
                    planned for the other school in 1992.
14(d) Maybe         Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
                    new demand for park and recreational facilities will be
                    created in the Town, and increased use of regional park
                    facilities and oublic trails, and imoactS on the Paradise
                    Recreation and Parks District may also result.
                    Mitigation Measures. It is anticipated that the
                    implementation portion of the General Plan will
                    address future park sites and means of providing and
                    paying for parks and recreational services. The Town
                    already administers a "QlJ.i.mby" provision within the
                    Town Subdivision Ordinance which provides for the
                    collection of fees and/ or dedication of land prior to the
                    filing of all parcel and subdivision maps.
14(e,f) Maybe       Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
                    increased demand for community facilities and services
                    will result, including construction and maintenance of
                    roads.
                    Mitigation Measures. The General Plan, as well as a
                    Capital Improvement Study currently in preparation for
                    the Town, will identify needed community facilities and
                    services, maintenance of public facilities, including
                    roads, and potential methods of financing such facilities
                    and services.
Energy
15(a,b)       Maybe Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
                    increased demand for, and consumption of. natural gas,
                    electricity and other power sources will occur.
                    However, it is likely or possible that an equivalent level
                    of development, and corresponding consumption of
            resources, would oc= elsewhere in the region if the
            development does not oc= in Paradise.
            Mitigation Measures. Utility companies will be
            consulted during formulation of the General Plan/EIR
            to determine impacts upon their service capabilities.
            Because any new development in the Plan area will
            consist of new residential structures, businesses and
            industries, modem energy-conservation practices,
            design and materials will be incorporated which will
            minimize the use of energy resources to the extent
            possible.
Utilities
16(a) Maybe Impacts. Please refer to item 15(a) above.
            Mitigation Measures. Please refer to. item 15(a) above.
16(b) Maybe Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
            increased demand for telephone, cable television., and
            other co=unications systems will oc=.
            Mitigation Measures. Co=unications system
            providers will be consulted during formulation of the
            General Plan/EIR to determine unpacts upon their
            service capabilities. Proposed development projects
            will be reviewed to assure that such services can be
            provided.
16(c) Maybe ImpaCJS. If additional urban development is planned,
            additional domestic water service and supply facilities
            will be needed as buildout occurs. Water service is
            currently provided in the Town and surrounding areas
            by three special districts: Paradise Irrigation D1Strict,
            Magalia County Water District and Lime Saddle
            Community Services District, from a combination of
            surface and groundwater sources, including Magalia and
            Paradise Reservoirs on Little Butte Creek. Extension
            of one or more of the systems would be required. The
            service capacity of one or more of the distncts may not
            be adequate to serve future urban development if such
            development is planned. Water system improvements
            under consideration include new wells, acquiring water
            rights from PG&E, raising Magalia Dam and a
            proposed filtration plant to improve water quality.
            Mitigation Measures. It is anticipated that the General
            Plan will consider policies which address alternative
            methods of providing domestic water service and
            policies coordinating new development with the
            availability of water service capacity. The General
            Plan/EIR will address water service capacity, the
            districts' ability to provide additional water service and
             fire flow and potential facilities and methods for
             provision of domestic water service and fire flow.
             Proposed subdivisions and other new development will
             be required to meet standard Town conditions for the
             provis10n of both domestic and fire protection water
             service.
16(d) Maybe  Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
             increased demand for wastewater disposal will result.
             The Town does not currently have a wastewater
             collection, treatment and disposal system; all
             development relies on individual septic systems.
             Buildout of any new areas selected for growth and
             development without installation of a sewer system may
             result m signifi=t impacts with regard to health
             hazards and water quality, and is probably not possible.
             The Regional Water Quality Control Board has advised
             the Town to correct the problem of potential
             groundwater contamination from septic systems.
             Mitigation Measures. The Town has adopted an on-site
             systems ordinance restricting the density of
             development within town limits to a level
             commensurate with the estimated assimilative capacity
             of area soils. The Town has formed a Wastewater
             Desi~ Assessment District and is in the process of
             formmg a Sewer Assessment District and issuing bonds
             to fund consrmction of a sewer system in a pornon of
             the Town. Litigation is currently in progress by some
             local property owners to prevent implementation of the
             "Design District".
             According to the "Sewer Project Feasibility Study"
             prepared by Kennedy/Jen.ks/Chilton, the State can
             unpose a sewer system on the Town. Signifi=t
             improvements in groundwater quality can be expected
             upon construction and operation of a central
             wastewater facility. Assumptions re~arding wastewater
             collection, treatment and disoosal will be a basic factor
             in the formulation of the General Plan, since it affects
             and limits population growth, densities and the types of
             development which can be permitted. Regular septic
             tank inspections =help mitigate impacts caused by
             individual systems.
16(e) Maybe  Impacts. Please refer to item 3(b ).
             Mitigation Measures. Please refer to item 3(b ).
16(t') Maybe Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
             the need for solid waste disposal and potential demand
             for solid waste collection service will mcrease. The
             General Plan/EIR will discuss the capacity of the Neal
                    Road landfill facility and future plans for solid waste
                    disposal and recycling.
                    Mitigation Measures. It is anticipated that the General
                    Plan will consider policies regarding mandatory solid
                    waste collection and disposal and recycling. A recycling
                    study is currently being prepared for the Town, and the
                    Town, in cooperation with a private company, has
                    already initiated a pilot =bside recycling program.
                    Other potential programs include educanonal
                    programs, additional recycling centers, and possible
                    wood waste recycling and composting programs.
Human Health
17(a,b)       Maybe Impacts. Urban development on septic systems without
                    regard to impacts on water quality and proper operation
                    of septic systems could create health hazards and
                    expose people to potential health hazards.
                    Mitigation Measures. Please refer to item 16( d) above.
Aesthetics
18            Maybe Impacts. If additional urban development is planned,
                    the types of vistas which now characterize the area,
                    which are rustic, hilly and lush with trees, as well as
                    valley panoramas, may be altered.
                    Mitigation Measures. It is anticipated that the General
                    Plan will consider policies which address maintenance
                    and enhancement of the co=unity's aesthetic
                    character through measures such as tree planting,
                    management and preservation (implementation of the
                    current tree ordinance); proper site planning and design
                    review; maintenance of a relatively low density of
                    development; and restrictions on development on
                    ridgelines and on slopes of greater than 30 percent.
                    The Conservation and Open Space elements will take
                    into consideration preservation of areas of scenic
                    beauty, maintenance of apJ?ropriate open space, park
                    development and landscapmg standards.

                    California State U niversiry, Chico has identified areas
                    in the community with a possible high sensitivity for
archaeological or historical resources. Two structures
in the community have been surveyed which may be
significant historical resources, and several historical
landmarks are located in the area. Numerous identified
and recorded archaeological sites exist within the
Paradise Town limits.
Miti~ation Measures. It is anticipated that the General
Plan will include policies to address preservation of
cultural resources. In areas of high sensitivity, it is
anticipated that these policies will provide for
compliance with Appendix K of the CEQA Guidelines,
including provisions that a qualified professional
archaeologist be contracted to conduct a field survey as
part of the environmental review process for
development permits.

                                                                               PLANNING
               Dear Mr. Stump:
               SUBJECT:          Revisions of Town of Paradise General Plan
               Thank you for your letter requesting geologic and seismic
               information for the revisions to the General Plan of the Town of
               Paradise. The Department of Conservation's Division of Mines and
               Geology (DMG) has-special expertise in evaluating geologic and
               seismic hazards, as well as mineral resource issues.
                   1. Our review of the Safety Element of your existing General
                        Plan finds it reasonably complete. However, we would
                        recommend that the map identifying active and potentially
                        active faults should be updated.      In particular, the Magalia
                        and Paradise faults should be identified on the fault map
                         (see Harwood and Helley, 1982). While there is no current
                        evidence for recent (Holocene) surface displacement on these
                        faults, some evidence suggests geologically recent
                        displacement (Dudley, 1988). Additional data on the faults
                        in the area of the Town of Paradise are discussed by the
                        California Department of Water Resources (1979), Woodward-
                        Clyde Consultants (1978), Hart and others (1984). General
                        geologic data of the area of the Town of Paradise are
                        presented in Burnett (1961), Division of Mines and Geology
                         (1965), and Jennings (1975).      A copy of a geologic map
                        index for the area of Paradise is enclosed.          These
                        publications are available for purchase and/or review at
                        DMG's Publications Office and Library, located at 660 Bercut
                        Drive, Sacramento, California, 95814.
                  2. Ideally, the General Plan should contain, among other
                        things, geologic hazards maps showing the general location
                        of a number of hazards, including zones of slope
                        instability, seismic ground shaking, potential liquefaction,
                        and areas subject to flooding from storm waters and dam
                        inundation.      These maps should be of sufficient scale and
                        detail to easily locate specific lots or sites relative to
                        areas of known geologic hazards. We suggest that existing
Mr. Charley stump

     data from the records of your building and planning
     departlllent and any data that exists on geologic hazards,
     such as areas of liquefaction or expansive soils, be
     compiled onto these hazard maps.      In addition, we have
     enclosed copies of DMG Note 46, "Guidelines for
     Geologic/Seismic Considerations in Environmental Impact
     Reports", and DMG Note 43, "Recommended Guidelines for
     Determining the Maximum Credible and the Maximum Probable
     Earthquakes". These documents may aid in the determination
     of potential impacts from earthquakes on nearby active
     faults, and other geologic hazards in the General Plan area.
I hope this brief information will be of value to you.      If you
have further questions, please contact me at (916) 322-2562. We
look forward to reviewing a draft of your revised Safety Element.
                              Sincerely,
                             ~~~~c<R':::.:____=:;::,~/~---­

GUIDELINES FOR GEOLOGIC/SEISMIC CONSIDERATIONS
                            IN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS
 The following guidelines were prepared by the Division of Mines and Geology with the cooperation of the State Water Resources Control
 Board to assist those who prepare and review environmental impact reports.
 These guidelines will expedite the environmental review process by identifying the potential geologic problems and by providing a
 recognition at data needed for design analysis and mitigating measures. All statements should be documented by reference to material
 (including specific page and chart numbers) available to the public. Other statements should be considered as opinions and so stated.

Att: Charley Stump/Senior Planner
RE: Response to Notice of Preparation of a Draft EIR for
Paradise General Plan Update.
Dear Mr. Stump:
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Notice of
Preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report for the Town of
Paradise General Plan Update. The Butte County Planning Department
has the following comments and concerns in addressing the impact
areas identified by the initial study:
     1.   Soils and development suitability
          *     A soil survey might be considered to guide site
                selection    for     residential,         industrial,           and
                commercial development that involves surface and
                subsurface structures.
          *     EIR should determine texture and composition of
                soils and identify bearing capacity, internal
                drainage, erosion potential, and slope stability.
     2.   Hydrology
          *     EIR should provide analytical forecasts of the
                changes of overland flow and stream discharge
                expected from the proposed development and evaluate
                the performance of the entire watershed that is
                subject to any development.
          *     EIR should estimate the concentration time by making
                separate estimates for:
                (1) the time overland flow; and

                                  -2-
-continued-
           (2) the time of channel flow and then summing the two.
          *      Utilize the ten year and hundred year storms of
                 sixty minutes duration for sto= water computations.
          *      EIR should develop perfo=ance goals for the
                 watershed on the Town of Paradise which reflect
                 local values, policies pertaining to development
                 intensity, sto= water retention, wetlands, open
                 space and the like.
          *      EIR should develop performance standards and
                 controls or the specific levels of performance that
                 must be met if goals are to be achieved.
          *      EIR should recommend performance controls to enforce
                 the standards and goals.   Ccntrols may be specific
                 ordinance or site plan review criteria within
                 General Plan.
          *      EIR should map precisely areas prone to flooding,
                 taking into account development and runoff factors.
          *      EIR should map the drainage network and supply the
                 following data: number of streams, bifurcation
                ratio, drainage basin order, drainage area, and
                drainage density.
          *      EIR should estimate nutrient loading of any impacted
                water body by identifying the various land uses
                proposed by the General Plan and major cover types
                 in each land use category, noting the relationship
                to the drainage system and water features, what
                kinds of pollutant each land use category is apt to
                contribute (both nutrients and other types), and the
                locations of critical entry points.
     3.  Vegetation and Wildlife
          *     EIR should document the distribution and makeup of
                the vegetative cover utilizing a scheme which
                outlines:
                 (l) vegetative structure,
               · ( 2) dominant plant types,

                                 -3-
-continued-
                (3) plant size and density,
                (4) site and habitat or associated use, and
                (5) special plant species
                Vegetative scheme should grant an understanding of
                both the biological phenomenon as well as the
                physical component of landscape having height,
                volume, texture, color, and functional ties with
                soil, water, air and land use.

                     RE:Draft EIR for the Paradise General Plan          RevisiogLANNING
           Dear Charley:
                     As mentioned at your scoping meeting today we have reviewed
           your initial study for this project and have three concerns that
           we would like addressed in your draft EIR.                They are as follows:
                     1. Under the general description of "water" there is a
           proposal to use 11 storm water retention basins".              Storm water
           retention basins are known to breed mosquitoes if they are not
           properly maintained, and therefore we request that the condition
          for use of such basins be that they are properly designed and
          maintained so they do not breed mosquitoes.
                     2. We are concerned that the proposed sewer system may
          produce mosquitoes (see attached letterl and request that there
          be some written assurance or mitigation that the proposed sewer
          system will be managed so it will not create a mosquito breeding
          problem.             Such assurance should address the design of the system
          and contingency control plans to prevent the creation of a public
          nuisance.
                     3. We commend you on including a Human Health element, and
          we request that a section be added on mosquitoes and mosquito
          borne disease.             This should include information on the species
          that are important vectors of diseases such as Malaria,
          Encephalitis and Canine Heartworm disease, which may be found in
          Paradise.
                    We also request that a section under the Health element
          include information on Lyme Disease and the local tick vector of
          this disease.
                    We are willing to consult with you on the design of the
          storm water retention basins and the sewer system so that the
          likelihood of mosquito problems is reduced. We will also try to
          provide any information you need on mosquitoes or ticks and the
          diseases associated with them.
                                                     Sincerely,
                                                ~~-~

                   RE:           Proposed Use of Wastewater for Wetlands
        Dear Planners:
                   I have read the Paradise Post article of 7/24/90
        regarding the possible us~ of treated sewer effluent as a
        water source for a created wetland. Reference was made to
        the created'marshes in Arcata.
                   You should be aware of the serious risk of mosquito
        production in ponds of this sort. Experts who have looked
        at the Arcata ponds found consistently high numbers of
        cu1ex ~e.E.~alis mosquito larvae.                 These may not be a
        problem in Arcata, because of the cooler temperatures, but
        in Butte County, such a mosquito breeding source would be an
        extreme liability for the owner/operator of such a facility.
                   If you are seriously considering such a facility, we
        urge you to understand the operational costs which would
        include the extensive use of pesticides. Cule~ tarsalis
        mosquitoes are a major vector species for encephalitis.
        Costs for abatement of mosquitoes in this source would be
        the responsibility of the facility operator.
                   If you plan to pursue this type of sewage treatment
        facility, we would be happy to review the risks and costs
        for you, in order to be sure your decision is based on a
        complete evaluation of the risks involved.

Paradise, CA 95969
             Subiect: Draft    ~IR    for Paradise General Plan
Mr. Stump,
       Thank you for f crwarding to us the Notice of Preparation fo=
~he   Paradise General Plan =evision. The Bu~te Coun~y Ai=
Pollution Control District (APCD) has reviewed the infer.nation
and we have concerns with how your department is dealing with the
"build out 11 of the J?a:::-adise area and t..':!e ai:::- quality concerns.
You have not adequately addressed the concerns from our·point of
view, consequently we have t..':!e following co:rnments.
       While the envirorunental checklist only has a small portion
for the air quali::::y concerns, checking the "maybe" column for
each question does not alleviate t..':!e problems that are going to
be created by the 11 build out". In the impacts/mitigation
section, you blend . all t..'1.:::-ee of the questions into one.
       The "build out" will lead to an increased population,
consequently increased vehicle traffic and increased emissions
that will lead to a degradation of the air quality in the
Paradise area and in Butte County. Paradise is a part of Butte
County and is therefore included in the non-attairunent status
designated by the State of California Air Resources Board. As is
stated in this draft plan, the non-attainment designation is for
ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. As you
mentioned, the APCD does not operate any monitoring stations in
the Paradise area. If there is going to be revision to t..'1.e
general plan t..'1.at will lead to increased growth, than the APCD is
going to require that t..'1.e City of Paradise install and maintain
an air monitoring station. The aforementioned pollutants are
what are to be monitored.

      Any residential development shou1.d address congestion
management planning and traffic control measures before the
building is allowed to commence. This will help mitigate the
impacts of the development and offer alternate transportation
measures to the popu1.ation.
      In addition, the burning of leaves and other waste
vegetation in fill:I!: quantity will have more of an effect on the air
quality of the area, especially in residential areas, than it
will on air movement. The APC!l requests that the Town of
Paradise follow the example set by the City of Chico and ban .all
waste, vegetation and leaf burning.
      The APCD appreciates the opportunity to comment on the
proposed revision to the General Plan of the Town of Paradise.
If you have any comments or questions in this matter, please feel
free to call me at 891-2882.

            Mr. Charley Stump
            Town of Paradise Planning Department
            5555 Skyway                                                  ;

            Dear Mr. Stump:
            The Department of Fish and Game (DFG) has reviewed the Notice of
            Preparation (NOP) of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
            for the Town of Paradise General Plan Revision.           Seven elements
            of the General Plan will be updated: Land Use, Circulation,
            Conservation, Open Space, Safety, Noise, and Housing. In
            addition to the present town limits Primary Study Area, the Draft
            EIR will address a Secondary Study area reflecting the Town's
            Sphere of Influence and a Tertiary Study Area reflecting a
            general interest of the Town of Paradise (Town).
            Significant adverse impacts on habitat and wildlife will occur
            because of the increased Town size implied by the NOP. The DFG
            recommends that the Draft EIR address these concerns:
                 1.      Storm drainage and sewage impacts on water quality,
                         including those areas outside of and downstream of
                         affected water sheds.     Specific mitigation measures
                         should provide that water treatment facilities have
                         the ability to remove soluble, suspended, and surface
                         floating pollutants in addition to sediments.
                 2.      Sedimentation impacts caused by construction
                         activities.     Specific mitigation measures in the form
                         of grading ordinances, slope constraints,
                         revegetation, etc., should be provided.
                 3.      Increased water supply impacts (including downstream
                         of the watershed) caused by pumping, diversions,
                         dams, etc. These impacts will affect springs in
                         addition to lakes and streams. Aquatic and wetland
                         habitat impacts should be fully discussed, with
                         special emphasis to the effects on fisheries.
                 4.      Potential impacts on all sensitive plant species
                         given Federal, State, or California Native Plant
                         Society listings. There may be more than 20 species
                         occurring within the study areas. Specific

Mr. Charley Stump                -2-                April 11, 1991
        mitigation measures such as setbacks, open space
        designations, etc. Should be provided.
    5.  Riparian and wetland .(including vernal pools) impacts
        beyond those mentioned in concern #3, including all
        streams, lakes, and wetlands.
        Specific mitigation measures such as setbacks, open space
        designations and drainage restrictions should be provided.
    6.  Impacts on deer winter range. The DFG recommends that the
        mitigation measures and actions proposed to the Butte
        County Board of Supervisors for land use encroachment
         impacts on deer winter range be adopted by the Town.
    7.  Impacts on the endangered bald eagle.   Eagles winter
        around streams and reservoirs within the study area.    It
        is probable that eastern portions of the study areas fall
        within the foraging territory of a nearby eagle breeding
        territory.
    8.  Impacts on wildlife species of special concern. More than
        20 such species of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and
        mammals may occur in the study areas.
    9.  Impacts on all habitats and species,  in addition to those
        specially emphasized above.
Equal consideration to indirect impacts should be given when
discussing these concerns.    An increased Town population will
have impacts extending well beyond the study areas; such impacts
may exceed the direct impacts occurring in Town.
In order to comply with Public Resources Code Section 21081 .6, a
detailed monitoring program must be developed for all required
mitigation conditions. The monitoring program should include the
following:
  a.   Specific criteria to measure effectiveness of
       mitigation.
  b.   Annual monitoring for a minimum of five years. Annual
       written reports submitted to the lead agency and the
       DFG.
  c.   Annual monitoring reports, each of which include
       corrective recommendations that shall be implemented
       in order to ensure that mitigation efforts are
       successful.
Mr. Charley Stump              -3-                 April 11, 1991
Pursuant to Public Resources Code Sections 21092 and 21092.2, the
DFG requests written notification of proposed actions and pending
decisions regarding this project. Written notifications should
be directed to this office.

                           Impact Report for Town of Paradise General Plan
                           Revision
        Dear Mr. Stump:
        With regard to the matter refel-enced above, thank you for the
        opportunity to make known some County concerns.                           It is important
        that the issue of Public Services (Item 14) be carefully studied
        with regard to fiscal ramifications on Butte County government.
        Obviously development means people and people mean services.                               In
        the case of population growth within incorporated areas, the impact
        stretches far beyond the town limits.
        Butte County's fiscal crisis is widely known and well documented.
       The. level of. services provided by Butte County to its citizens is
        substandard, due to understaffing, deteriorating equipment, and
        aging and overcrowded facilities, among other things.                            All have
       been stretched to their limits.
       Services provided by the County, directly benefi tting the dual
        citizenry of town and county, include superior and municipal
        courts, criminal prosecution, family support, court media ti on,
       probation, juvenile hall, incarceration, coroner, civil disaster,
       veterans services and halls, public guardian, libraries, public
       health, mental health, adult and youth alcohol and drug programs,
       environmental            heal th,   fire        sunnression         (in    the   close      in
       unincorporated but urbanized areas of the town), transportation,
       elections, clerk-recorder, public defender, grand jury, social
       services, LAFCo, public works in access to the town, assessor,
       treasurer-tax collector, landfill, farm and home advisory, and all
       of the administrative, personnel, legal, and financial activities
       rtacessary to support these.
       Any project, program, or activity that does not address its fiscal
       impact on these services and the means by which the costs of such
       will be borne, is incomplete in its proposal.

Town of Paradise - General Plan,   p. 2
Therefore, please consider this letter as an expression of concerns
pertinent to the General Plan Revision for the Town of Paradise.
! sincerely hope that the revision, when completed, will adequately
address the means for financing the ever increasing need for
countywide government services.       Again,  thank you for the
opportunity to comment.

                           The DEIR should address impacts the General Plan growth will have
                           on State Route 191. Any needed improvements should be identified.
                           The DEIR should also consider cumulative growth impacts from
                           developments of neighboring jurisdictions on State Routes 99, 149E,
                           and 70.
                           A detailed financial and transportation analysis should be
                           developed ta allow local roadway and mass transportation
                           improvements be in place as development occurs.
                           The DEIR should consider Park and Ride lots in the transportation
                           mitigation measures. The following Rideshare measure should also
                           be considered:
                    1      An on-site transportation coordinator at each employment site.

          Paradise, California       95969
          Dear Mr. Stump,
          Thank you for the opportunity to collllllent on the forthcoming Draft
          Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for Paradise General Plan
          Revision (SCH# 91043055). This project involves revision to all
          Elements of the Paradise General Plan.
          The .California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFAl would
          appreciate a discussion of the following issues in the DEIR:
           1.       A  complete description of the planning area.        This should
                    include current and planned land use designations, the number
                    of acres in agricultural production, soil classifications and
                    acreages, and cropping history.
          2.       Whether any land under a Williamson Act contract or in an
                    Agricultural preser;e is part of, or near to the planning
                    area. How will development affect these designations?
          3.        The possible mitigation measures to ensure that agricultural
                    land is not prematurely or unnecessarily converted to non-
                    agricultural uses.    These measures can include use of the
                    Williamson Act, deed disclosures, a Right-to-Farm ordinance,
                    phased development, clustered development, transfer of
                    development rights, and requiring infill development of vacant
                    land prior to urban expansion.
          4.        The interface conflicts which can arise from adjacent
                   agricultural and urban uses. Problems can arise due to noise,
                   dust, chemical usage, trespassing, and traffic conflicts.
                    Include any buffering measures (ie. buffers, setbacks, berms,
                    fencing, etc.) proposed for the development.
          5.       The pressure this project could create to convert surrounding
                   agricultural land to non-agricultural uses. Does this project
                   have the potential to be precedent setting?
          6.       Whether development of the area will create patterns of
                   discontiguous growth. If so, is development necessary at this
                   time?
          7.       Given the projected need for          residential and urban
                   development, what is the cumulative impact to agriculture from
      t.~is and other projects in the region?
Since the above issues are not necessarily comprehensive, the lead
agency should also request comments from concerned local agencies.
These agencies can include the agricultural commissioner's office,
the USDA Soil Conservation Service office, and the county Farm
Bureau Federation office.
The CPFA supports the right of local agencies to develop and
i:mplement land-use policy in its area of influence. However, the
CDFA also wants to assure that agricultural land is not prematurely
and irreversibly lost due to development which is not accurately
assessed fer environmental impact.

Dear Mr. Stump:
The Butte county Air Pollution Control District has reviewed the
Town of Paradise General Plan Update, Environmental Setting,
Draft Working Paper #l section that pertains to air quality and
offers the following comments.
The pollutants that are measured in Chico are:     nitrogen dioxide,
nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, ozone, and PMlO (particulate
matter smaller than 10 microns in diameter). The monitoring
station in Biggs was removed from service in February of 1990.
The superscript on Tables 4-3, 4-4, and 4-6 should be located
outside of the parentheses so as not to appear as parts per
million squared or parts per million to the 7th degree.
The concentration.levels on Table 4-4 are incor:::-ect for the years
1981 to 1988 inclusive. Please amend the columns to reflect the
correct concentration levels recorded for those years.
Paradise is designated as non-attainment for ozone only. The
Paradise area attains the State health-based standards for
nitrogen dioxides, sulfur oxides, lead, and sulfates. The area
is as yet unclassified for the pollutants carbon monoxide,
hydrogen sulfide, and visibility reducing particles.
If you have any questions regarding the aforementioned comments,
please contact this office at 891-2882. Thank you.
Sincerely,

                                  Tne Chaparral or scleroohvllous woodland is an assocauon of tall,

                          region that are open and dry or in various sw.ges of a post-burn succession.
                          iUthough characterized as a brushland, chaparral formatiorJ.S are often

even waterlogged during the winter rainy season and very dry during the
summer and fall.
Riparian Woodland
        The riparian woodland occurs as narrow snips of dense brush and trees
along the water courses of south Paradise and around the localized drainage
basins to the nor..h. The dominant riparian trees are willow (Salix sp.), white
alder (Alnus rhombifolia), western sycamore (Platanus racemosa), Fremont
cottonwood (Popu./.us fremonrii), California laJJF~ CtJmbe!lUlaria.caliJc~-oica),
big-leafmaple. ~cermacrophyllu.m),[qu:l.'Eilg;itpfrl('PJ)iiz,!s~), and
western dogwood ( Comus nu.ttallii).\... Prominent as understory and · elike
plants are poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobu.m ), California wild grape
(Vuis califomica), wild blackberry (Rubu.s spp.) and elderberry (Sambu.cu.s
mexicana). Tnis association has been greatly disrupted by development along
the various watercourses which drain southwesterly across the ridge surfaces
of Paradise.
Great Valley Cottonwood Riparian Forest
        The Great Valley cottonwood riparian forest is a dense, broadleafed,
winter deciduous riparian forest dominated by Fremont cottonwood (Popu.l.us
fremonrii) and Good ding' s willow (Salix goodaingii variahilis ). U nderstories are
dense, with abundant vegetative reproduction of canopy dominants. Scattered
seedlings and saplings of shade-tolerant species such as California box elder
(Acernegwuio califomica) or Oregon ash (Fra::dnus latifolia) may be found, but
frequent flooding prevents their reaching into the canopy. These sites are
inundated yearly du.ring spring, resulting in annual inputs of nunients, soil,
and new germination sites. This vegetation community was formerly extensive
along the major low-gradient (depositional) streams throughout the Central
Valley, but is now reduced to scattered, isolated re=ants or young stands
because of flood control, water diversion, agricultural development, and urban
expansion. Approximately 1200 acres of this sensitive vegetation community
occurs within the Dry Creek floodplain.

                      Foothill Woodland
                              The foothill woodland extends across the extreme southern portions of
                      the Town and dominates the ridge surfaces to elevations of 1300 feet. The
                      primary floral elements of this woodland are blue oak (Quen:us douglasii),
                      interior live oak (Quercus wizlizenii) and digger pine (Pirw.s sabiniana). Above
                      1500 feet these species give way to canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis), tan-
                      bark oak (Lithoca.rpus densiflora) and black oak (Querr:'..is kelloggii). Several
                      species of shrubs provide an understory to this open woodland. Prominent in
                      this community are manzanita (Arr:tostaohvlos sp.), California lilac (Ceanothus
                      sp.), /cha:ni'.:iSe ' 'Aden.'tiiofiz'7i.,_J&sCfeiiiiitum~ yerba santa (Eriodicryon
                      calijomicwn), poison oak Toxi.codemiron diversilobum) and several members
                      of the rose family (e.g. the· genera Prunus, R.ubus a.nd Rosa).
                      Digger Pine-Oak Woodland
                              Tnis woodland is a mixture of digger pine (Pirw.s sabiniana) and blue
                      oak (Querc'.is douglasii). Pure stands of either tree do occur, but mixed stands
                      are more common. Pinus sabiniana usually towers over the oaks in
                      undismrbed stands. Understories usually are dominated by introduced
                      annuals. Tnis vegetation type occurs on weil-drained sites with Mediterranean
                      climate, in rocky or exposed sites along ridges or c:J.Ilyons with poor or shallow
                      soils.
                      Westside Ponderosa Pine Forest
                              T.ne Ponderosa pine forest occurs as a broad transitional zone between
,             ·       the foothill woodland and higher mixed coniferous associations and is most
~'-'-'-'---'~ -{      extensive above L.500 feet elevation in Paradise. It is generally a closed forest
~ -~ominated by Ponderosa pine (Pirw.s ponderosa). Tne closely related Jeffrey
!v0,1 \d c;:..,.n.;.~ pine-~ jeffre"Ji) occurs locally on drier sites and serves as a specific
                      indicator of ultrabasic and serpentine rock outcroppings. The Ponderosa pine
                      zone has been the most heavily logged of all the communities in northern
                      California and this practice has allowed the encroachment of other woody
                      species into areas formerly covered by pines. The Ponderosa and Jeffrey             ?(

                        dogwood and California laurel. Tne ponderosa pine forest zone represents
                        the primary habitat type utilized for development in the Paradise area.
                        Northern Hardpan Vernal Pool
                                 Located within close proximity of the Terriary Study Area is a

            Wildlife
            Wildlife reported for the Town of Paradise and the Study Areas is typical of
   the transitional foothill habitat types found on the western flank of the Sierra
   plateau. Appendix B contains a partial listing of co=on and sensitive wildlife
   species which occupy the habitats.within Paradise and adjacent Butte County. Tills
   list is not meant to represent a comprehensive survey of the resident and migratory
   wildlife. The urbanized portions of Paradise are inhabited by a wide diversity of
   wildlife. No threatened, endangered or candidate wildlife species have been
   documented within the Paradise Study Area.

         RE:    General Plan Revision
         Dear Charley:
         This is in response to your request for comments to Working Paper
         #1 and your invitation to participate in the General Plan revision
         process      through       a    PID      representative                      on           one of                       several
         subcommittees.
         concerning Working Paper #1, I am enclosing c:opies of pages 46 and
         4 7 on which I have made suggested changes intended to improve
         accuracy or clarif'y intent.                   Concerning section 17 .12. 8 "Water
         Service", it is suggested the last sentence of t:iat section be
         deleted or expanded to clarify its need and objective.
         Regarding subcommittee representation, individual Directors have
         indicated they are unable to participate directly. As a body they
         did indicate they would expect staff to assist as much as possible.
        Unfcr-+:unately at 'this time we are unable to participate as a
        committee member.           We will, however, continue to provide input as
        needed and could be available to meet with any committee should
        that become desirable.
        Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments.
        Very truly yours,

         Del Om Water Cqmpanv
               The Del Oro Water Company's Paradise Pines and Magalia service areas have
          relevance to the Town of Paradise water planning program only if the areas were to
         be annexed to the Town or if their water supply sources conflicted' with proposed
          additional water supplies essential to maintain Town growth.
               The Llme Saddle service area's water system planning is of greater relevance. It
          is evident that continued urban growth in the area may significantly impact
          co=unity resources from a planning standpoint, and there is potential for further
          annexation to the Town of new subdivisions in the area. Del Oro Water Company
          has recently unde:caken the legal and physical steps essential to obtain a
          supplemental water supply from Lake Oroville to serve further planned urban
          development in the Llme Saddle area.

          fields, together with several engineered subsurface disposal systems serving
          co=ercial and institutionci facilities. In anticipation of an eventual need for
          centralized wastewater management facilities, portions of a future sanitary sewer
          system have been constructed along the Skyway. However, there are no existing
          connections to the system. Businesses and residences in the vicinity of the furure

Dear Charley:
Enclosed please find a copy of the "Schools" section of the working
paper #1 for the General Plan Revision. I have highlighted a few areas
that I feel are incorrect or that need to be changed.                                       Hopefully these
changes can be incorporated into the draft.
Change #1 - Page !!!!, Paragraph 2
End the last sentence after year with a period and delete "and actually
decreases during some years." Add a sentence stating, "Although some
years have shown decreases, the average rate of increase from 1986-87
through 1990-91 was 3. 29%."
Change #2 - Page 44, Paragraph 3, Sentence 2
This sentence should read, "The District owns another school site in the
Upper Ridge and plans to build a new school as soon as possible (prob-
ably a middle school)."
Change #3 - Table 14-2
The 1990-91 school year should read,               "Enrollment 4,67!!;                      Net Change 161;
Percent Change 3.56.''
If you have any questions regarding these three changes, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Dear Mr. Stump:
The Board of Trustees of the Paradise Unified School District feels
strongly that policies. goals and objectives that would require future
developments in the Town of Paradise to mitigate all impacts should be
incorporated into the General Plan at this time.                                  We would like to
suggest that the following statements be placed in the General Plan:
       Unless assurance is obtained that an adequate level of all
       public facilities,      including schools,                  will be available to
       future residents, no discretionary land use action shall be
       taken to increase density of use. The assurance shall include
       details of how any impacts identified as a result of the pro-
       posed land use actions are to be mitigated.
A policy such as this placed in the General Plan would allow the Council
to adopt ordinances which would guarantee that the citizens in the Town
would be provided with necessary services as the Town grows.                                        If the
quality of the educational experience for the students of Paradise is to
remain the same or improve, a policy statement of this type is essential.
If you have any questions regarding our request, please do not hesitate
to contact me.

I.  Species Locations
    In this section, Butte County U.S.G.S. topographic quads are
    listed. Following each quad are two groups of coded plant
    listings:   group one contains those plants documented to be in
    the quad; group two contains those plants for which their
    habitat type occurs in the quad. The plant codes are derived
    from the first two letters of the scientific name (e.g.)
    Clarkia mildrediae = Clmi) listed~section II.

   A. Animals
       1.   Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle (Desmocerus
            californicus dimorohus)
            FT status. Status caused by habitat loss and
            degradation.     Impacts include land use coversions,
            flood control projects, channel maintenance, grazing
            herbicides, and fire.      Occurs in riparian habitat
            along the Sacramento River and the lower portions of
            its tributaries. Completely dependent upon
            elderberry, particularly those with stems 1.5+ inches
            in diameter.
            A resident species.
       2.   Winter-run chinook salmon (Oncorhvnchus tshawvtscha)
            SE, FT status. Status caused by flood con~rol and
            channelization projects and water diversions which
            have destroyed or degraded habitat.
            Adults migrate up the Sacramento River from December
            through July.     Downstream migrating smelts occur from
           August to October.
       3.   Giant Garter snake (Thamnoohis couchi aigas)
            ST status. Status caused by wetlands loss. Also
           impacted by pollution, destro~ed food sources, snake
            collectors, and illegal killing.
            Inhabits marshes, slow moving streams, canals, ponds
            and flooded fields (especially riceland). Highly
            aquatic.  It is known to occur from the Butte Sink to
            Nelson.. other locales of possible occurrence include
           Angel Slough-Little Chico Creek, Honcut Creek, and
            its tributaries.
           A resident species.      Hibernates from November to
           March.

                           -2-
4. Aleutian Canada Goose (Branta canadensi• l•ucopar•ia)
   FE status. Status caused by exo~ic predators on its
   Aleutian breeding ground. Hunting was formerly a
   significant impact on the winter ground.
   Occurs in the Butte Sink from October to December,
   occasionally later. Feeds in croplands, favors corn.
   Roosts on flooded areas.
5. Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucoceohalus)
   SE, FE status. Status caused by pesticides
    (princi~ally DDT) .  The popu1at~on is slowly
   recovering. Other impacts include pollutants, nest
   disturbance by humans, and illegal kill.
   There are two known breeding territories in Butte
   County. Winter populations may exceed 50 birds
   county wide.   Lake Oroville is an important local
   wintering area.    Eagles often congregate about
   waterfowl concentrations in ricelands. To be looked
   for around all but the smallest streams and ponds
   countywide.
   A  s~arse breeding resident and fairly common winter
   residen~.
6. swainson's Hawk (Buteo swainsoni)
   ST status.   Status caused by loss of grassland
   (foraging) and woodland (nesting) habitats primarily
   to agricultural and urban land use conversion.
   Pesticides and rodenticides are additional problems.
   It may be found throughout the valley portion of
   Butte County including the foothill edge. Most
   occurrences are west of Hwy 99. Small rodents are
   the preferred prey.
   A March to September breeding resident.
7. American Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus anatum)
   SE, FE status. Status caused by DDT contamination.
   Human theft of nestlings is a problem.
   To be looked for countywide in any season. Most
   birds occur from September to October.    It is
   infrequently seen but of regular occurrence (one
   known breeding territory) in Butte County. Most
   often seen about bird concentrations.
   A resident species, but most sightings may be of
   winter visitors.

                             -3-
 8. California Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis
    coturniculus)
    ST status. Status caused by wetlands destruction. There
    is one record for Gray Lodge Wildlife Area. Unconfirmed
    sightings have been made in the Nelson area. Its habitat
    is shallow marshes wi t.'1 short sedges and bulrush.
 9. Greater Sandhill Crane    (~    canadensis tabida )
    ST status. Status caused bv loss of breeding habitat in
    northeastern California. wlnter ground losses in the
    Central Vallgy are a growing problQm.     H~man haraAamant,
    principally hunting, is a signiticant local problem.
    More than half of the California population is known to
    occur in Butte County during fall and early winter. They
    roost in shallowly flooded marshes and sloughs. Most
    foraging occurs in grain fields.     Grasslands, marshes, anc
    pastures are used for feeding.     Principal wintering areas
    are: Hwy 99 near Durham to Rancho Llano Seco, M&T Ranch,
    Nelson area, and the Butte Sink. May occur elsewhere in
    the valley. A September to April winter resident. A few
    have been known to summer locally.
10. Western Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus
    occidental is)
    SE status. Status apparently caused b~ DDT
    contamination, and pesticide use (particularly aerial
    spraying) in nesting territories. Riparian habitat
    loss and degradation, especially in the Central
    Valley south of Colusa, is the other major cause of
    the cuckoo population decline.
    It is found along the Sacramento River and lower
    portions of the rivers tributaries. To be looked for
    along the Feather River up to Oroville. cuckoo
    territories have been found in the Butte Sink and
    along Butte Creek.
    A summer resident from May to September.
11. Great Gray Owl (Strix nebulosa)
    SE status. Status caused by habitat loss and
    degradation. Forested nesting areas have been
    destroyed by logging. Meadow foraging areas have
    been lost to, or damaged by, reservoirs, grazing,
    roads, and buildings.
                           -4-
    This owl has been known to. occur east of Butte
    Meadows.   It has probably been extirpated as a
    brQeding resident, but could become reestablished.
     It requiree large meadow ayatama for foraging and old
    growth timber for nesting.
12. Willow Flycatcher (Emoidonax traillii)
    SE status. Status caused by the loss and degradation
    of riparian habitat due to water projects, channel
    maintenance, grazing, roads, buildings, and
    pesticides.   Cowbird parasitism of the nest may be a
    problem.
    The flycatcher is dependent on willow habitats as a
    breeder.   It may no longer breed in Butte County but
    it could become reestablished.   During migration it
    may be found countywide in riparian habitat and open
    woodlands.
    A spring (April-May) and fall (August-September)
    migratory transient.
13. Bank Swallow (Riparia rioaria)
    ST status. Status caused by bank protection projects
    which destroy eroding banks and bank swallow
    nestlings.
    Occurs along the Sacramento and Feather rivers.
    Requires vertical, eroding banks with soft soil.
    Forages over open water and, somewhat, over open
    land. A colonial nesting species.
    A breeding resident from March to October.
14. Least Bell's Vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus)
    SE, FE status. Status' caused by the loss and
    degradation of riparian habitat.   Cowbird parasitism
    of vireo nests have compounded the problem.
    Pesticides are another problem of unknown magnitude.
    Formerly a common summer resident in Sacramento
    Valley riparian habitat.   It is believed to have
    become extirpated about 1965.   Its reestablishment is
    possible.
15. Sierra Nevada Red Fox (Vulpes vuloes necator)
    ST status.   Cause of status uncertain.   Probable
    impacts include logging, grazing, reservoirs, roads,
    trapping, buildings, and disturbance by humans.
                                  -5-
           Found primarily in fir and lodgepole pine forests.
           Meadows are probably important for foraging. This
           fox has been seen east of Butte Meadows. It may be
           found below 4,000 feet elevation.
           The red fox found in the Sacramento Valley is an
           eastern race not known to be found above the lower
           foothills.
           The native fox should be a permanent resident.
     16.   Wolverine  (~    gulo)
           ST status. cause of status uncertain. Probable
           impacts include logging, grazing, reservoirs, roads,
           buildings, and disturbance by humans.
           There have been unsubstantiated sightings of this
           species in the Humbug Summit-Philbrook area. It is
           generally found in alpine habitats.
           A possible permanent resident above 5,000 feet
           elevation.
B. Plants
     l.   Butte county (Shippee) Meadowfoam (Limnanthes floccosa
           sp. Californica)
           SE status. Status caused by the destruction of
           vernal swale habitats mostly resulting from urban
           sprawl and agriculture. Grazing is a significant
           impact.
           Meadowfoam occurs in scattered populations from north
           of Chico to the Shi~pee area.   Its habitat is vernal
           swales of the alluvial apron at the valley-foothill
           junction. The flowering period is primarily
           March-April.   Other subspecies of the species occurs
           in Butte County.
     2.    Greene's Orcut Grass (Tuctoria greenei)
           SR status.   Status caused by vernal pool destruction.
           Grazing is an additional problem.
           Known to occur at Pentz and Richvale vernal pools.
           May occur elsewhere. All known locations are in the
           alluvial apron at the valley-foothill junction, which
           may extend far into the valley.   Flowers in late
           spring. The species is in reality endangered.

Environmental Setting Document                       viii                              1994
This document contains background information compiled for the Town of Paradise General Plan. The
document addresses all the subject areas to be addressed in the plan and also serves as the "environmental
setting" portion of the environmental impact report prepared for the General Plan. It also includes, as
Appendix "A," a Community Concerns Summary Report which synthesizes comments collected early in the
General Plan preparation process from the General Plan Revision Steering Committee, and responses to
a citizens' opinion telephone survey of the community.
Three study areas have been established for the town and surrounding areas for the purpose of the General
Plan:
•         Primary Study Area - reflects the existing town limits
•         Secondary Study Area - encompasses the existing Sphere of Influence adopted for the town
          by the Butte County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo), and the Paradise/Magalia
          Reservoir watershed area to the north.
•         Tertiary Study Area- extends to the south and west to Highway 99 and Durham-Pentz Road.
These study areas are shown on Figure 1-1. For purposes of this document, the term "study area" refers
collectively to the primary, secondary and tertiary study areas.
The Town of Paradise, California is located in eastern Butte County, as shown on Figure 1-2, in the
western foothills of the Cascade-Sierra Nevada Mountains. Located north of Paradise are the smaller
unincorporated communities of Magalia, Paradise Pines, Nimshew and DeSabla; to the south of the Town
is the Lime Saddle area. These areas are known as the Upper and Lower (Eden) Ridge, respectively. To
the southeast is the City of Oroville (the county seat), and to the west is the City of Chico.

The first Europeans to enter the Sacramento Valley may have been the Spanish expedition led by explorer
Gabriel Moraga in 1808, which explored the lower reaches of the Feather River, perhaps as far north as
Sutter Buttes. In 1820, Captain Luis Arguello led an expedition into the foothills east of Oroville, and gave
the Feather River its name (Fariss and Smith 1882:144-145). By 1828, and throughout the next two
decades, Hudson's Bay Company and American Fur Company trappers were active throughout the region
(Wells and Chambers 1973: 128).
In 1844, Mexican Governor Manuel Micheltorena issued several land grants within northern California.
Peter Lassen was awarded a grant on Deer Creek, part of which extended into northern Butte County.
That same year, Edward A. Farwell and Thomas Fallon settled on the Farwell grant, the eastern boundary
of which cuts through present-day Chico (Wells and Chambers 1973:128-129). In 1847, John Bidwell
acquired his famous Rancho Chico estate from Farwell and built a house. Bidwell's estate became a mail,
stage, and voting station, and farms sprang up around it. This settlement evolved into the City of Chico
(Bancroft 1888:491).
In 1844, Samuel Neal settled along lower Butte Creek with partner David Dutton about seven miles south
of Chico. Neal received the Esquon Grant, a 22, 193 acre tract encompassing present-day Durham and
Nelson. Neal established a successful cattle ranch, which he operated with Indian labor. His breeding
stock was obtained from John Sutter. Along with meat, Neal sold hides and tallow. Later, he was
successful in breeding horses and sheep. In the summer, he drove his livestock into the foothills along a
route that has become today's Neal Road, one of three major early routes between the Paradise Ridge and
the Central Valley. In 1848, Neal struck a rich gold deposit on the Feather River, and later he established
one of the county's first lumber mills near present-day Magalia (McGie 1982[I]:35-37; Talbitzer 1987:21,
24, 38).
Butte County was incorporated on February 18, 1850, by an act of the newly commissioned state
legislature. The original Butte County embraced all of present-day Butte and Plumas Counties along with
portions of Lassen, Tehama, Sutter, and Colusa Counties (Wells and Chambers 1973: 131). By 1853, when
farms and settlements began to appear in some of the county's more remote regions, it became evident that
the area was too large for the Butte County government to meet growing demands for roads, schools, law
and order. Thus, beginning with Plumas County on March 18, 1854, areas within the original Butte
County began to incorporate as separate counties (Fariss and Smith 1882:156-157).
It is thought that the first Euro-Americans to extensively explore Paradise Ridge (also known locally as
Apple Ridge or simply "the Ridge") in the spring of 1850 were Abraham Decker, Sam McClellan, Sr.,
and Sam McClellan, Jr., who arrived in the vicinity of Dogtown (i.e., Magalia) about two miles north of
the Town of Paradise. In the fall of that year, a man named Bassett built a cabin, and other settlers soon

Environmental Setting Document                       4                                                   1994
followed. Tom Neal was possibly the first to find gold in the area in 1851, and by the next year, about
500 miners were active in this locality. Abe Folk opened the first store in fall, 1851, and one of the area's
first settlers, E. B. Kinson, built a sawmill in 1852. Magalia was initially called Mountain View, but it
became Dogtown in honor of Mrs. Bassett, who operated a thriving business selling dogs to the miners.
The first post office was opened in 1857 under the name Butte Mills. In 1861, the name was changed to
Magalia (Wells and Chambers 1973:252).
In 1853, R. P. Powell founded the community of Powellton, a few miles north ofMagalia. There were
rich diggings around Powellton, which attracted a number of miners (Mansfield 1918:73). A large sawmill
was erected there by Charles Clark (Wells and Chambers 1973:259). Powell is credited with blazing the
trail to Susanville in 1861, which eventually connected Oroville to Susanville by stagecoach on what
became known as the Oroville-Susanville Humbug Road. The 160 mile-long stage road passed through
the Ridge communities of Dogtown, Lovelock, Powellton, and Inskip (Wells and Chambers 1973:204-205,
259). Powell had blazed this route as early as 1853, and it served as a pack-mule freight trail for several
years before it was improved for wagons and stagecoaches in 1861.
Lovelock, located north of Magalia, was founded in 1855 by George Lovelock. Excellent dry diggings
attracted many miners, and some quartz (i.e. "hard rock") mining occurred there, too. A quartz mill was
built there that was outofoperation by 1882 (Mansfield 1918:73; Wells and Chambers 1973:260). Further
yet up the ridge, about 17 miles north of the Study Area, the community of Inskip was settled by a man
named Kelly. The mines in this locality were exceptionally rich, and five hotels, stores, and saloons were
supported by hundreds of miners (Mansfield 1918:73).
On August 14, 1859, Chauncey Wright found a 54 pound gold nugget in a hydraulic mine about two miles
east of Magalia (which was then still referred to as Dogtown by most residents). When melted down in
San Francisco, the famous Dogtown nugget yielded $10,690 in gold (Mansfield 1918:74) at 1859 gold
prices.
Paradise had its beginnings around 1860, when William Leonard established a sawmill there. In 1865,
Leonard established the route now known as Clark Road to connect his sawmill to towns in the Sacramento
Valley. This route bypassed the exceedingly steep grade on the Pentz-Magalia Road above Pence's Ranch,
which made it the favored route from Oroville to Paradise from that time onward (Estep 1970:26). A hotel
on Clark Road served as a stage stop between Oroville and the mining towns on the upper ridge and
beyond to Susanville. In the 1870s, churches were built in Paradise, and Paradise Post Office was
established in 1877 in John Strong's general store on Clark Road. A second post office, known as Orloff,
was established near the Southern Pacific Railroad Company depot at Pearson and Olive in 1905. When
the two post offices were consolidated in 1911, the name of Paradise prevailed (McGie 1982(2]:234, 235;
Talbitzer 1987:63).
The town experienced little growth until the early decades of the current century when the expansion of
the lumber industry, construction of a railroad, and the formation of Paradise Irrigation District brought
many new people into the area. Paradise became a center of commerce for many of the newcomers
(Talbitzer 1987:78, 80).

The Ridge area received its first economic boost of the new century in 1900, when the Centerville
Powerhouse and a power transmission line were completed within Butte Creek Canyon. De Sabia
Powerhouse, located about seven miles upstream of the Centerville Powerhouse in Butte Creek Canyon,
was completed by 1903. Water was diverted from the Feather River to increase the capacities of both
powerhouses (Farber 1988; Mansfield 1918:352-353).
Diamond Match Company began to acquire about 55,000 acres on or near the Ridge in 1902. A huge
sawmill, then one of the world's largest, was built in Stirling City in 1904. That same year, Butte County
Railroad was built along Magalia Ridge to connect the sawmill at Stirling City to the match plant, planing
and finishing mills in Chico. This railroad passed through Paradise, contributing to the growth of that
community (McGie 1982[1]: 184; Talbitz.er 1987: 80). In 1907, Southern Pacific took over operation of the
railroad (Mansfield 1918:341, 359). The railroad gave renewed vitality to some of the old mining
communities of the upper Ridge.
In 1914, about 400 people, mostly farmers, occupied Paradise. There was very little electricity, one
telephone, no improved roads, two automobiles, no banks, and all of the water was supplied by wells.
Paradise Irrigation District was organized with an initial bond issue of $325,000 for the purpose of
irrigating orchards and farms. Domestic drinking water was not initially provided. Nonetheless, the
formation of PID led to rapid growth, and new orchards were planted (Mansfield 1918:367). The Magalia
Reservoir was acquired from PG&E, and a new dam and distribution system were completed on
February 16, 1918. The reservoir lies one-quarter mile from the Southern Pacific Railroad depot in
Magalia (Mansfield 1918:348), which today serves as a restaurant.
In January 1921, a new Paradise Elementary School was occupied. One week later, it burned down. The
next year, a new town hall was built near the site of the old one. In 1924, Paradise temporarily won a
bitter battle with the Chico High School Board of Trustees, who then administered Paradise High School,
to keep the school open. In the 1930s, however, Paradise, Magalia, and Stirling City high school students
were bused daily to Chico. By 1927, Paradise Irrigation District served 11,250 acres producing pears,
apples, walnuts, olives, and grapes. The same year, the Paradise Veterans Building was dedicated (McGie
1982[2]:9, 21, 23, 32, 36, 57).
One of the main events of the 1930s was the announcement of plans for a new road to Chico, later named
the Skyway, to replace the narrow, winding Neal Road. In 1939, Paradise Elementary School again burned
down (McGie 1982[2]:57).
Jn 1945, the Butte County Board of Supervisors voted to proceed with construction of the Skyway instead
of upgrading and realigning Neal Road. The long awaited road was finally built. Jn 1948, ground-
breaking ceremonies were held for Feather River Hospital, and in 1953, the Supervisors approved the
widening of the Skyway to four lanes through Paradise (McGie 1982[2]: 102, 103, 120).
Paradise Unified School District was formed in 1950, serving Paradise, DeSabla, Stirling City, and other
outlying areas. By the middle of that decade, Paradise population reached around 8,000 people. A new
Paradise Junior-Senior High School was built in 1954. To keep up with the town's steady growth, Paradise
Irrigation District constructed a new dam to create the Paradise Reservoir above the Magalia Reservoir.

(By 1979, the water district would serve over 30,000 people.) As the 1950s proceeded, Paradise began
to establish its identity as a retirement community. Between 1954 and 1959, the number of businesses in
the town grew by 47.4 percent (McGie 1982(2]:123, 132, 133, 134, 175).
Paradise continued to grow during the 1960s, with new public works projects such as water mains and the
widening of roads. A shopping center was built on the Skyway. Total school enrollment exceeded 2,600,
and a second elementary school was constructed on Pentz Road (McGie 1982(2]: 190, 196).
The Skyway was again widened through Paradise in the 1970s, and the town received a new library. A
mid-decade drought was hard on the town, as the water supply severely waned. The crowning event of
the decade was incorporation of the Town of Paradise in 1979 with over 20,000 residents in the new town
limits. For two years, Paradise was the most populous town in the county, until it was overtaken by Chico
(Talbitzer 1987:87). The widening of the Skyway to four lanes from Chico to Neal Road at the lower end
of Paradise ushered in the 1980s (McGie 1982(2]:216, 224, 236, 266), during which time Paradise became
a bustling, somewhat urban community with new shopping centers and other businesses along a widened
Clark Road.

The Paradise area is located on the western flanks of the Cascade-Sierra Nevada mountain system. The
general elevation above sea level ranges between 1200 feet in the most southerly portion of the tertiary
study area to 2,200 feet to the northeast at Magalia; however, the extremes of local relief within the three
study areas actually range between about 180 feet near the intersection of Highway 99 and Durham-Pentz
Road to nearly 2,900 feet near the northerly portion of Coutolenc Road, above Paradise Pines. The
primary study area is gently sloping towards the southwest with average slopes of around four percent,
although steeper slopes occur to the west, adjacent to Butte Creek Canyon; to the east, along the margin
of the canyon of the West Branch of the Feather River; and in localiz.ed stream incisements such as Berry
Canyon and Clear Creek to the south. Steep slopes and marked slope breaks are uncharacteristic of the
primary study area and nearly eighty-eight percent of the town sits on slopes of less than thirty percent,
as shown on Figure 3-1.
Paradise occupies a large southerly trending ridge which generally ranges about 1,000 feet higher than the
intervening steep canyons. Development has concentrated principally on south-sloping Paradise Ridge,
which is defined by steep canyons: the West Branch of the Feather River drainage to the east; and the Butte
Creek-Little Butte Creek drainage to the northwest. While some stream erosion has partially dissected the
ridge surface, the overall aspect of this surface is one of generally rounded low hills and terrace-like low
ridges. The major access roads to the community tend to follow the topography; however, the network
of roads within the town is less influenced by topography.

The study area is located somewhat intermediate between the Cascade Geo-Province to the north and the
Sierra Nevada Geo-Province to the south. The geologic characteristics of both systems are manifested in
the terrestrial character of the Paradise region. While the Cascade system is primarily composed of
Cenozoic (or geologically newer) volcanic rocks including Pliocene intrusives, the geologically older Sierra
Nevada system is characterized by massive intrusions of Mesozoic granite into various layers of overlying
rocks of varied origin. The geologic composition of the study area reflects a history of volcanism, tectonic
uplift, periods of marine inundation, and erosional and depositional forces which have shaped the current
character and distribution of the regional terrestrial strata.
The majority of the Paradise study area is underlain by Pliocene volcanics with those of the Tuscan
Formation dominating the northern., southern, and southeastern areas; basaltic deposits encompassing a
major portion of the town proper; and other geologic types including pre-Cretaceous deposits of Paleo-
Mesozoic undifferentiated rocks and marine sandstone and slate of the Monte De Oro Formation,
Cretaceous marine sandstone, conglomerate, and silistone of the Chico Formation, and more recent
alluvium of the Modesto Formation, occurring in the western, northeastern, and southeastern portions of
the Study Area. The Pliocene volcanics are several hundred feet in thickness hut have been deeply
trenched by erosion from Butte Creek and the Feather River. In the northwestern portion of Paradise
(along the general Butte Creek stream channel), a narrow, bow-shaped extension consisting of pre-
Cretaceous metamorphic rocks with small outcroppings of Mesozoic ultrabasic intrusives has been exposed
by the erosional forces of Butte Creek. The coincidence of these varied localized formations of the Sierra
Nevada and Pliocene volcanics associated with the Cascade system provides for considerable complexity
in the local soil types of the western and northeastern portions of the secondary study area.
The Paradise study area is a portion of an area characterized as a westward downtilted fault block which
underwent massive uplift during the Cretaceous period. Subsequent erosion of this block along with the
adjacent thick volcanics of the Cascade system have created canyons and gold-bearing channels. This
erosion has removed metallic gold from the metamorphic rocks and deposited it in gravelly streambeds.
The gold mining ventures of the Paradise area correspond to the mining of these gravels. Ancient stream
beds and surrounding areas were covered by volcanic outpourings during the Pliocene and exhumed
somewhat later during more recent erosion by such streams as the Feather River, Butte Creek and Chico
Creek, whose contemporary channels frequently intersect older stream channels lying atop the metamorphic
formations. These processes, along with landslide and mudflow activities, have formed the present
geological foundation of the study area which include volcanic rocks, metamorphic rocks, old gold-bearing
channels and recently excavated deposits of sand and gravel. Other than the localized and heavily worked
gold-bearing gravels, the Paradise region is not presently characterized as a heavily mineralized zone.
There are no current mining operations in Paradise and the past gold mining period has ended, leaving
numerous abandoned gold mines, including the Bader Mine, on the periphery of northeast Paradise.
The study area is located in an area of relatively low seismic activity and consequently has been accorded
a category of low potential earthquake hazard (Geomechanics, 1980; Guyton and Scheel, 1974; Butte
County General Plan, Seismic Safety Element, 1977). Such categorization must be made cautiously given
the generally high level of seismicity for most parts of California and the location of Paradise within the
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                         10                                               1994
Cascade-Sierra Nevada Provinces. Paradise lies in an upland region whose very existence is due primarily
to the active mountain-building processes of volcanism and uplifting along fault zones.
The only major comprehensive study of the earthquake hazard in northeastern California carefully
considered the record of low seismic history against the need for accurate planning (Guyton and Scheel,
1974). The approach used in this study was to catalog all known earthquake activity by locating the
epicenters of the quakes as well as the relative magnitude of each event. Although it was concluded that
the past seismic history of a region is the most objective measure of possible future seismic activity, it is
difficult to assess future earthquake activity since existing seismic risk maps of California are inadequate.
A more recent study of the seismicity of the Paradise area (Geomechanics, 1980) maps both the fault rones
and the epicenters of earthquakes that have occurred near Paradise since 1934. There were fifty-four
earthquakes ranging between 4.0 and 6.9 in magnitude on the Richter scale during the period 1934 - 1980.
Of this total only five were of magnitude 6.0 or greater. Two earthquakes of relatively large magnitude
have occurred relatively close to Paradise; the Ghost earthquake of February 8, 1940, with a magnitude
of 5.7 and the Oroville earthquake of August 1, 1975, with a magnitude of 5.7. The former earthquake
had an epicenter roughly twenty-five miles north-northeast of Paradise and the latter earthquake had an
epicenter about twenty-four miles southwest of Paradise on the newly discovered Cleveland Hills Fault near
Oroville (see Table 3-1).
Fault Zones
The Pacific tectonic plate is forcing itself under California and is moving north. This enormous pressure
has caused upthrust faulting that has interrupted the old tertiary channels and stream beds. People in
California generally are aware of major faults, such as the San Andreas fault. What is not generally
understood is that California contains many thousands of minor faults. In some places in and around
Paradise the tertiary channels are faulted as much as five or six times within one mile. Within the Paradise
area there are many faults that can be identified and others that are believed to be in existence that have
not located.
As the water percolates down these tertiary channels the flow is interrupted when the water encounters a
fault. If the upstream portion of the channel is higher than the downstream portion, the water can, and
sometimes does, cross the fault and continues in the lower (downstream) portion of the channel. Also, as
sometimes happens the water will continue down the fault for many thousands of feet. if on the other
hand, the downstream side of the channel is higher than the upstream portion of the channel this creates an
underground dam. It is not uncommon for these underground dams to be many miles in length (thirty-sixty
miles) and measure from just a few feet to several hundred feet in vertical upthrust. In some cases where
there is a minor upthrust fault, the water may backup and cross over the fault, as crossing a small dam and
continue percolating downstream. On larger upthrust faults of several hundred feet the water will either
go down the fault for several thousands of feet, or if the fault is sealed at that point the water will follow
the fault downstream until an opening in the fault is reached. At this point the water will again go down
thousands of feet.
The fault zones that may produce seismic activity with an impact on Paradise are listed in Table 3-3 and
indicated on Figure 3-2. The five known fault rones that could affect Paradise include the relatively short

Cleveland Hills fault, the Honey Lake fault, the Paradise fault, the Magalia fault and the Melones fault.
The Paradise and Magalia faults are approximately six to seven mile fault zones which dissect the
northeastern portion of the secondary study area. Although various researchers have disagreed over the
relative extent and significance of the Magalia fault , more recent investigation and field surveys have
indicated that the Magalia fault is geographically confined to the Magalia-DeSabla region (Dudley, 1988).
While no historic evidence of surface displacement on these faults exists, some evidence suggests
geologically recent activity along these faults (Dudley, 1988). The Melones fault zone is located roughly
thirty-five miles east of Paradise. The fault is in excess of 200 miles in length and may represent a local
segment of a more extensive central Sierra fault system. Most resesrchers accord the maximum credible
esrthquake along the Melones fault zone to be of magnitude 8.15 - 8.25 on the Richter scale, a range
similar to the extensive San Andreas fault zone located over 130 miles to the west. A short fault
approximately sixty miles east of Paradise, the Russell Valley fault, has not produced esrthquakes affecting
Paradise.
These data indicate that, for the most part, known fault systems in the Paradise region are somewhat short
and are unlikely to yield earthquakes of large magnitude. While long and quite active fault systems are
located in the northeastern California region, these systems are somewhat distant from Paradise and have
not caused large esrthquakes within historic times. Previously unknown fault zones may, however, produce
locally damaging esrthquakes, or a large magnitude esrthquake could occur along a major regional fault
zone such as the Melones or the Honey Lake fault. Additionally, although the Paradise and Magalia faults
within the study area are considered inactive, the potential for earthquakes of unknown magnitude along
these fault zones is not quantifiable.
The Paradise Multihazard Disaster Plan states that earthquakes of the magnitude of 6.9 on the Richter scale
should be anticipated and considered when designing hazard plans. The effects of an earthquake will be
further aggravated by aftershocks and by the secondary effects of further damage to structures, fires and
possible landslides. The time of day and season of the year will have an effect on the overall damage
throughout the Town of Paradise.

    XII.     Damage nearly total. Large rock masses displaced. Lines of sight and level distorted.
             Objects thrown into the air.
Masomy A, B, C, D. To avoid ambiguity of language, the quality of masomy, brick or otherwise, is
specified by the following lettering.
•         Masonrv A. Good workmanship, mortar, and design, reinforced especially laterally, and bound
          together by using steel, concrete, etc., designed to resist lateral forces.
•         Masonrv B. Good workmanship and mortar, reinforced, but not designed in detail to resist lateral
          forces.
•         Masonrv C. Ordinary workmanship and mortar, no extreme weaknesses, like failing to lie in at
          comers, but neither reinforced nor designed against horizontal forces.
•         Masonrv D. Weak materials, such as adobe, poor mortar, low standards of workmanship; weak
          horizontally.

Landslides
According to the draft Energy, Natural Resources, and Recreation Element (1989), in Butte County, landslides
frequently occur on slopes greater than fifteen percent, while slopes between five and fifteen percent exhibit very few
landslides. Map IIl-1 of the Butte County Safety Element (1977) depicts relative amounts of landslide unit risk.
Paradise and the surrounding study area are rated as having a low landslide potential. It is noted that <let.ailed analysis
of the complex interrelationships between the governing factors is needed to predict the stability of a specific area,
and detailed on-site investigations are recommended to assess site-specific risks. Seismic shaking greatly increases
landslide potential. The Muhihaz.ard Disaster Plan reports that the Feather River Canyon slope, along the northeast
boundary of the town, has a lot of shale and appears unstable when disturbed.
Subsidence
The primary cause of subsidence in Butte County is groundwater withdrawal, according to the draft Energy, Natural
Resources, and Recreation Element. However, areas of potential subsidence in the county are confined to the valley
floor and include local areas of heavy groundwater withdrawal and several producing gas fields. These areas are
illustrated in Map III-1 of the Butte County Safety Element, and the areas with the greatest subsidence potential extend
about two miles north and south of Chico and in a one-mile radius around Gridley. Therefore, it is reasonable to
assume that the potential for ground subsidence within the study area is low.
Liquefaction
Liquefaction occurs when there is a sudden but temporary increase in the fluid pressure between the soil grains, caused
when the weight of the overlying soil or structure is temporarily supported by the water and not the soil grains. Map
II-2 of the Buue County Safety Element illustrates areas of low, moderate and high liquefaction potential. The Paradise
study area has been determined to have a generally low potential for liquefaction because of the soil's diverse particle
size. The Butte County Safety Element cautions that the map must be considered approximate and invalid for direct
determination of liquefaction potential on a specific site.
Dam Inundation Hazards
According to the draft Butte County Energy, Natural Resources, and Recreation E/.ement (1989), there are currently
twenty-four dams in Butte County which are under the jurisdiction of the California Division of Dam Safety. Two
of these dams are above the Town of Paradise, within the secondary study area, on Paradise and Magalia reservoirs
on Little Butte Creek. These dams are inspected annually by the state. Because there are no known geologic hazards
in the vicinity, and the dams are inspected annually, it is reasonable to conclude that dam inundation hazard is low.

Volcanics
Mount Lassen, located approximately twenty-three miles north of Butte County. is considered to be one of the few
active volcanos in the continental United States. According to the draft Energy, Natural Resources, and Recreation
Element, while geologic hazards do exist in the Lassen Park area, the possibility of mudflows, flowing avalanches,
or volcanic ash endangering Butte County is very remote, based upon historical and geological data.
According to the ParadiseMuhihazard Disaster Plan, though most of the eruptions in the Lassen Peak area have been
small, it is believed that these volcanoes are capable of much larger eruptions, similar to those at Mount Saint Helens.
A repeat eruption could be expected within the next one hundred years, with the severity still unknown at this point.
The Town of Paradise may be within the range of ashflow or ashfall of such an eruption.

Recent U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service soil survey data for Butte County is not available.
The USDA Bureau of Chemistry and Soils conducted a soil survey of portions of the county in the 1920s. The Soil
Survey of the Chico Area, California, published by the USDA-BCS in 1929, clsssifies the majority of the primary and
secondary study areas as Aiken clay loam soils and much of the surrounding areas as "scabland" and "rough broken
and stony land."
The California Department of Forestry, in cooperation with the USDA Soil Conservation Service and National Forest
Service, has conducted extensive photo interpretation and field surveys to compile comprehensive soil-vegetation maps
for areas throughout numerous counties statewide, including those in the Paradise study area. The following discussion
is based primarily on information developed through that program.
The complex geologic character of the Paradise area is reflected in a varied and even more intricate soil composition.
A total of thirty-three distinct soil series comprise the primary and secondary study areas, with fifteen and thirty
different series in each area, respectively. Soils of the Aiken series dominate the primary and northern portion of the
secondary study areas. Soil composition is more complex and variable adjacent to stream channels of the Little Butte
and Middle Butte Creeks (reflecting erosion and exposure of distinct parent materials). The southern third of the
primary study area and the southern portion of the secondary study area are composed of differing soil types and
dominated by soils of the Toomes, Guenoc, and Pentz series. Soils of the Supan series are predominant in the western
portion of the secondary study area along the northwestern town limits. A complete list of soil series which comprise
the primary and secondary study areas, along with their areal extent and physical characteristics, is included in Table
3-4. Soils of the primary and secondary study areas are mapped in Figure 3-3.
Aileen clay loam has been generally characterized as granular, moderately deep, with slow permeability, good drainage
characteristics, and medium suitability for timber production. While the information in Table 3-4 indicates that its
erosion potential is moderate to very high, the Butte County Seismic Safety Element (1977) states that its erosion
potential is low. This series ranges from approximately 5 to 11 feet in depth and contains varying amounts of stones
and other rock fragments. The parent material of this soil type is basic volcanic rock with some metamorphic layers
encountered at depths of twelve to twenty-five feet. Dispersed throughout all soil horizons of Aiken clay loam are
hard, massive boulders of weathered andesite (derived from the original volcanic material). Soils of the Toomes,
Guenoc, and Pentz series share certain physical characteristics in that they are well-drained, moderately permeable,
with slight to moderate erosion potential. Supan series soils are unique in having been derived from secondary
volcanic landslide-mudflow parent materials.              However, in their basic physical characteristics and
drainage/permeability behavior, they closely resemble other soil types of the Paradise area. Despite the varied soil
composition of the primary and secondary study areas, certain physical characteristics are generally shared by all soil
series within the region. Soils are generally clay, loam, clay loam, or may be gravelly or sandy clay or loam. They
have slow to moderate permeability, are well drained, and have moderate to very .high erosion potential.
There has been some alluviation (deposition of sediment) in the various drainage depressions and rill networks atop
the main ridge. In these drainage systems pockets of silty clay residual soils have formed a somewhat impervious
alluvial layer. This condition, while not extensive, has served in a minor way to decrease channel percolation and to
increase the potential for flooding along these drainage courses. Other than these small pockets of shallow alluviation,
the Paradise-Magalia area is notable for its lack of soil types derived from recent alluvial deposition.

Exoansive Soib
According to the draft Energy, Natural Resources and Recreation Element of the Butte County General Plan (1989),
expansive soils exist over a majority of Butte County. as depicted on Map III-3 of the Butte County Safety Element
(1977). Expansive soils have a potential for shrinking and swelling with changes in moisture content. According to
the draft Energy, Natural Resources and Recreation Element, soils with no or low expansion potential are found
generally along stream valleys and on steep mountain slopes. Soils of high expansion potential are found in the nearly
level areas of the Sacramento Valley around the population centers of Chico, Oroville, Biggs and Gridley.
Soil Erosion
According to the Butte County Sqfety Element, erosion may be expected in Butte County where protective vegetation
is removed by construction, fire or cultivation. According to the 1967 Report and General Soil Map of Butte County
prepared by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, there are five classes of erosion hazard, as shown in Table 3-5. Soils
of high erosion potential are shown on Map III-2 of the Butte County Safely Element. The information in Table 3-5
may also be compared with Figure 3-1, Slope, to determine general locations of areas which may have high erosion
potential.

The climate of Paradise may be characterized as an inland Mediterranean climatic type. This climate has
warm to hot summers and mild to cool winters with a distinctive winter precipitation regime. The long,
dry summer period is somewhat unique to the Mediterranean climate yet is a feature shared commonly with
most of California. The winter period is characterized by the passage of mid-latitude storms moving
westward from the North Pacific Ocean and bringing moist, unstable air masses into interior Northern
California. The actual number of storm centers of low pressure is quite different from year to year and
is the primary determinant of precipitation variability from one year to another.
Since these storm systems are basically passing along the North American Polar Front under the influence
of a strong westerly wind movement, their passage during winter is a time of considerable air mass
interaction. Cold, dry air may flow southward across Northeastern California both during and immediately
after the passage of the storm centers. Additionally, a strong southerly flow brings moist, unstable
maritime air into the Paradise region from the Pacific Ocean by way of the San Francisco Bay and the
Sacramento River Valley. This unstable air brings periods of overcast conditions accompanied by drizzly
weather and cooler temperatures which can last for several days. North-south fluctuations in the mid-
latitude and subtropical jet streams have been noted to have some effect upon the trajectories of these storm
systems as they pass across Northern California.
Precipitation from these storms increases from west to east, with lower totals in the Sacramento Valley and
Western Sierran foothills, to much higher totals at higher elevations on the western side of the summit.
Reflective of this pattern, most stations such as Chico and Oroville receive between twenty-five/thirty
inches of precipitation annually; stations such as Paradise, Forest Ranch, and Grass Valley receive between
forty-five/fifty inches; and upland stations such as DeSabla, Brush Creek, and Strawberry Valley receive
between sixty/seventy inches per year. Table 4-1 shows the annual precipitation totals for Paradise at an
elevation of 1,750 feet above sea level, and for DeSabla at an elevation of 2,563 feet. The average
monthly precipitation varies greatly in Paradise (Table 4-2).
According to the Paradise Multihazard Disaster Plan, Paradise can experience a major storm at any time
during the rain and snow season. The Town of Paradise has been hard hit by major storms in the past.
When snowfall occurs in combination with warmer temperatures, a heavy, wet snow is produced which
creates the potential for damage to buildings and other snow related hazards. A major snowstorm in 1990
produced significant damage to both public and private property, as well as citizen casualties and injuries.

In general the winter months are cool, overcast and periodically dominated by moist maritime air masses
whose passage across Northern California as storm systems becomes increasingly more unstable. Freezes
can occur within Paradise at any time between late October and late April; however, prolonged periods of
freezing temperatures are rare. Absolute minimum temperatures of 10.8 F. and 9.0 F. have been recorded
during January for Paradise and DeSabla respectively. Snowfall frequently occurs during mid to late winter
in Paradise. It usually does not remain on the ground long, often melting within thirty-six hours. The
periods of snowfall, snow depth, and low winter temperatures are all cliruatological features which change
rapidly within short distances of Paradise as one moves up or down in elevation.
During the winter months the Cascade-Sierra area is dominated by higher pressure as a consequence of the
chilling effect of altitude coupled with a snowpack covering the surface. Cooler air tends to settle into
basins and valley bottoms where radiational cooling during the relatively calm, clear winter nights can lead
to low temperatures. On other occasions, radiational cooling can lead to the forruation of thick fog which
tends to blanket the Sierran foothills. The lower winter temperatures are also primarily responsible for the
low evaporation rates during November-April, when about twenty-five percent of the annual evaporation
of 53.6 inches is spread over half of the year.
The summer months are usually quite dry with less than four percent of the annual precipitation arriving
in the five month period of May-September. By mid-summer, the Sacramento Valley is usually occupied
by an elongated therrual high pressure ridge due to intense heating of the land surface. The retreat
northward of the Polar Front is accompanied by the domination of Northern California by the North Pacific
high pressure system. Warm, dry, subsiding air masses then dominate the Paradise region bringing low
relative humidities and absolute maximum temperatures such as 115 F. at Oroville, 104 F. at DeSabla, and
110 F. at Paradise. The period of mid-June to late September is coincidentally the peak season of fire
hazard in terms of optimal "fire weather" conditions: strong northwesterly winds; low relative humidities;
low soil moisture; dry brush, grass and timber; high air temperatures; and suitable ignition conditions and
temperature. The summer drought is not alleviated by the sporadic summer convectional thunderstorms
which bring sporadic and unreliable amounts of warm season moisture and the danger of lightning-set
wildfires to the Paradise region.
The rainfall pattern in Paradise can be characterized as one of seasonal drought. This seasonal drought
can be extended to a longer term cyclical drought during periods of lower than average annual
precipitation. The long term record shows that wide departures from the mean are uncharacteristic for
Paradise. However, a high of ninety-six inches was recorded in 1983 and a low of 18.5 inches was
recorded for 1976.

Paradise lies within the Sacramento Valley Air Basin, which extends from Sacramento and Solano Counties
on the south to Shasta County on the north (Figure 4-1). The air basin is generally situated in the northern
portion of the Central Valley and is bounded on the west hy the Coastal Range, on the north and east hy
the Cascade-Sierra Nevada and Siskiyou foothills and mountains, and on the south by the San Joaquin
Valley Air Basin.
The primary factors affecting air quality in a given area are the quality, type and location of pollutant
emissions, the topographic and geographic features of the region, and the prevailing meteorological
conditions. An emission rate represents the amount of pollutant released into the atmosphere by a given
source over a specified time period. It is generally expressed in units, such as pounds per hour (lb/hr) or
tons per year (ton/yr). Local and regional meteorological conditions govern the transport and diffusion of
emissions in the atmosphere. Wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric stability, temperature, and the
presence or absence of inversions are some of the key factors which affect pollutant dispersion.
The northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin is a natural closed basin, often with poor air circulation and
high atmospheric stability. The area is subject to frequent temperature inversions (a layer of cold air
capped with a warm air mass), preventing dispersion of pollutants.
The nearest air quality monitoring stations in Butte County are in Chico [carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen
oxides (NO,.), nitrogen dioxide (NO,), ozone and particulate matter smaller than ten microns in diameter
(PM 10)]. The Butte County Air Pollution Control District designates the Paradise area as a nonattainment
area for ozone and as an attainment area for NO,, sulfur oxides, lead and sulfates. All other categories
are unclassified at this time. The Paradise area has few major stationary sources of air pollutants.
Relative to other nonattainment areas of California, emissions inventories for Butte County show low to
moderate emissions of total organic gases and nitrogen dioxide. The burning of agricultural wastes and
application of pesticides and herbicides on the valley floor result in hydrocarbon emissions. Agricultural
activity is also a significant source of suspended particulates. Vehicular traffic emissions are the major
source of CO and the primary constituent of ozone. Motor vehicles comprise the major emission source
category generated within the community.
A summary of data from the BCAPCD monitoring stations from 1980 through 1989 pertaining to local
pollutant monitoring and the relationship of measured pollutants in the local enviromnent to California and
the national ambient air quality standards is contained in Tables 4-3 through 4-6. However, this data
should not necessarily be interpreted as having direct applicability to the Paradise area, as Paradise is above
the valley floor in the foothills.
The California Clean Air Act (AB 2595, 1988) requires that each air pollution control district that is
nonattainment for state ambient air quality standards for ozone or carbon monoxide prepare and submit an

attainment plan. Each plan must include a wide range of control measures which, for most areas, include
transportation control measures (programs or measures with the objective of reducing vehicle trip
generation and vehicle miles traveled), designed to reduce overall emissions by a net five percent per year
from 1987 levels. Butte County is coordinating with other northern Sacramento Valley counties in this
planning effort. Refer to Section 16.4 for a more complete discussion of this plan.

The drainage patterns of the Paradise area reflect the uniqueness of its location on a gently sloping ridge
surface. The Paradise area is dominated by a somewhat continuous overland runoff flow which is
organized into local rills or depressions as the runoff is collected. There is localized erosion and siltation
in these depressions or swales due to slope and the topography. However, the bulk of the runoff is shunted
downslope to become runoff in lower stream systems.
The Paradise area is divided into fairly distinct drainage basins. These basins are mapped in the Master
Storm Drainage Study and Facilities Plan, Paradise, California (McCain Associates, 1980). The drainage
basins serve to collect the upslope surface runoff and direct it downslope. However, in these local drainage
swales the flow is intermittent and only lasts briefly following rainfall. Due to the lack of a continuous
flow, the characteristics of a system of active stream erosion have not developed atop the ridge surface.
The drainage basins' bottom configuration depth of incisement is very shallow, usually less than one meter.
Thus, these drainage swales lack adequate capacity to convey runoff waters from lengthy storm activity
during the winter months. Since the drainage basins are long and narrow, averaging one-fourth to one-half
mile wide and four to five miles long, localized flooding may occur at various points. Downslope, these
drainage systems have become incised into the basement volcanic rocks and have developed steeper sides
and more clearly defined channels. Many of these channels carry a perennial runoff flow.
The drainage systems often coincide with groundwater seeps and springs which serve to increase the
moisture availability beyond the intermittent flows directly related to storm runoff. Consequently, the
drainage depressions and their downslope channels are often thickly vegetated.
As these areas are developed, the undergrowth and grass cover is often removed and channels are randomly
excavated to suit the individual owner's or developer's interest. Often when this takes place, either through
lack of knowledge, lack of funds or indifference, the resulting channel is inadequate in capacity and poses
a real possibility of promoting damage. While the soils and subsoils of the Paradise area do not markedly
aggravate the runoff situation, they also do not prove to be highly permeable. This often results in
localized flooding which can be exacerbated by such land use activities as grading operations, vegetation
clearance, inattention to storm runoff from construction sites during the peak winter rainfall period, large-
scale paving and the lack of a collection system for storm waters. Storm runoff arrives at the principal
drainage channels through overland flow for most of the Paradise area. Very few collector systems have
been constructed and the primary form of collection has been through roadside ditches.

Environmental Setting Document                        42                                                        1994
The major public roads running north and south are situated along ridges between basins and carry runoff
south until intercepted by east-west roads. The roadside ditches along these roadways tend to get quite
deep and create maintenance problems for town road crews and a somewhat unsightly and dangerous
condition for motorists and pedestrians.
According to the Master Storm Drainage Study, the area studied is situated in such a manner that it is not
subject to flooding from outside sources. Unlike many towns on the valley floor, no large streams or
rivers pass sufficiently close to provide any threat. Primary overland flow from storm runoff, the
inefficiency of local drainage depressions and roadside ditches to carry the intermediate flow and the
aggravation of runoff efficiency by human activities has created a somewhat difficult situation for the
management of present storm runoff. This situation also has implications for future development projects
which could create further flooding difficulties.
The Master Stonn Drainage Study considered the possibility of recommending flood zoning of the natural
drainage channels. In order to properly describe and locate the boundaries of such a zone, detailed
hydrologic and hydraulic studies must be made in order to determine the actual flood stage. The study
concluded that this approach is more applicable to towns adjoining major streams and rivers. It requires
that extensive topographic information and hydraulic calculations be made in order to determine the actual
bounds of the design flood. According to the study, the nature of the topography, and lack of major
streams and stream flow data, preclude this level of detail and make flood zoning impractical.
As an alternative, the study recommended the establishment of general areas where special clearance should
be required prior to construction of improvements. This approach, called "special permit zones," requires
the developer or property owner to verify that adequate provisions are provided for design flows. The
special permit zones are depicted in Figure 5-1. The study includes recommended design criteria within
the special permit zones. The study cautions that the special permit zones do not indicate limits of
flooding.

It has been reported (Town of Paradise Wastewater Management Study, Supplementary Phase I Report,
1984) that there has been contamination of small streams in or emanating from the Paradise area associated
with surfacing septic tank effluent.
The layered geology beneath Paradise has led to the formation of several aquifer zones. Depending on
local conditions of permeability, weathering and fracturing, the aquifers may bave some hydraulic
continuity. Beneath Paradise, groundwater movement is generally in a north-to-south direction, although
some flow does occur toward Butte Creek and West Branch Feather River Canyons. It is estimated that
there are approximately 300 privately owned wells in Paradise which supply water for irrigation and
domestic uses. Most wells penetrate into the Tuscan Formation and generally are less than 200 feet in
depth.
The most shallow groundwater body consists of perched water lying atop the Tuscan Formation.
Influenced by seasonal precipitation and local recharge from onsite wastewater disposal systems, this
perched, unconfined groundwater does not produce dependable yields of usable quantity. The underlying
Tuscan Formation, however, does have weathered and permeable zones which yield significant quantities
of groundwater. Based on a review of well logs for the Paradise area, the Tuscan Formation typically
yields usable water at depths of less than 200 feet. Much of the water is under pressure indicating at least
partial confinement of some of the water-bearing zones. The upper portions of the Tuscan Formation may
hold unconfined water which receives recharge from the Paradise area aod could be subject to
contamination by septic systems.
Beneath the Tuscan Formation lie the auriferous channel aquifers, which contain large quantities of high-
quality water. Since the auriferous, or gold-bearing, channels occur at substantial depths aod underlie only
limited portions of Paradise, they remain relatively untapped. Due to their depth aod apparent confinement,
the auriferous channels do not appear to receive significant recharge from surface water or septic systems
in Paradise.
The Metamorphic Basement Complex is well consolidated with few weathered or fractured zones aod thus
is not expected to yield large quantities of water. Only the deepest wells in Paradise appear to penetrate
this formation. Like the auriferous channels, the basement complex lies well beneath septic systems aod
should not be subject to contamination from on-site wastewater disposal.
Septic tank/leach line failures in Paradise do not affect water supplies distributed by the Paradise Irrigation
District since its sources are outside the urban area. Local shallow wells which were dug long ago aod
which may still bave limited use may be affected.

The Town of Paradise exercises, through the Town Engineer and the Community Development
Department, regulatory responsibility for the provision of adequate drainage facilities for new
developments. The town also provides maintenance for drainage facilities within public rights-of-way.
North of and adjacent to the town, County Service Area No. 4 provides periodic maintenance of drainage
facilities in county rights-of-way for the community of Paradise Pines. The county requires drainage
improvements as a condition of development.
The recommendations of the above-referenced Master Storm Drainage Study and Facilities Plan (1980)
with respect to detention basins, channel improvements, and culvert upgrading are implemented to the
extent that funding and regulatory authority with respect to new development permits.

Vegetation
Several natural vegetation communities occur within the Paradise study area, including chaparral, non-
native grassland, riparian woodland, Great Valley cottonwood riparian forest, foothill woodland, digger
pine - oak woodland, Ponderosa pine forest, and northern hardpan vernal pool, all of which are described
below.
•         Chaparral. The chaparral or sclerophyllous woodland is an association of tall, evergreen, woody
          shrubs which dominates many sites within the Paradise region that are open and dry or in various
          stages of a post-bum succession. Although characterized as a brushland, chaparral formations are
          often interspersed with grasses and scattered trees and thus integrate with the other vegetation
          communities. The chaparral community is often composed of locally dominant species of shrubs
          along with an admixture of many other species. The dominant shrubs of typical communities are
          toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia), several manzanitas (Arctostaphy/os}, California lilac (Ceanothus
          spp.), bitter cherry (Prunus emarginata), scrub oak (Quercus dumosa), redbud (Cercis
          occidentalis), yerba santa (Eriodictyon californicum) and mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus
          betuloides). Chaparral formations occur most prominently on the slopes adjacent to the canyons
          of Butte Creek and the West Branch of the Feather River, the ridge surfaces and valley sides in
          south Paradise and in areas which have been cleared, heavily logged or recently burned.
•         Non-native Grassland. The non-native grassland consists of a dense to sparse cover of annual
          grasses with flowering culms, often associated with numerous species of showy-flowered, native
          annual wildflowers, especially in years of favorable rainfall. With few exceptions, the plants are
          dead through the summer-fall dry season, persisting as seeds. This vegetation type occurs in the
          valleys and foothills of most of California, on fine-textured, usually clay soils, moist or even
          waterlogged during the winter rainy season and very dry during the summer and fall.
•         Riparian Woodland. The riparian woodland occurs as narrow strips of dense brush and trees
          along the water courses of south Paradise and around the localized drainage basins to the north.
          The dominant riparian trees are willow (Salix sp.), white alder (A/nus rhombifolia), western
          sycamore (Platanus racemosa), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), California laurel
          (Umbellularia californica), big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), and western dogwood (Cornus
          nuttallii). Prominent as understory and vinelike plants are poison oak (Toxicodendron
          diversilobum), California wild grape (Vitis californica), wild blackberry (Rubus spp.) and
          elderberry (Sambucus mexicana). This association has been greatly disrupted by development
          along the various watercourses which drain southwesterly across the ridge surfaces of Paradise.
•         Great Valley Cottonwood Riparian Forest. The Great Valley cottonwood riparian forest is a
          dense, broadleafed, winter deciduous riparian forest dominated by Fremont cottonwood (Populus

          frerrwntii) and Goodding's willow (Salix gooddingii variabilis). Understories are dense, with
           abundant vegetative reproduction of canopy dominants. Scattered seedlings and saplings of shade-
           tolerant species such as California box elder (Acer negundo californica) or Oregon ash (Fraxinus
           larifolia) may be found, but frequent flooding prevents their reaching into the canopy. These sites
           are inundated yearly during spring, resulting in annual inputs of nutrients, soil, and new
           germination sites. This vegetation community was formerly extensive along the major Iow-
           gradient (depositional) streams throughout the Central Valley, but is now reduced to scattered,
           isolated remnants or young stands because of flood control, water diversion, agricultural
           development, and urban expansion. Approximately 1200 acres of this sensitive vegetation
           community occurs within the Dry Creek floodplain.
•          Foothill Woodland. The foothill woodland extends across the extreme southern portions of the
           town and dominates the ridge surfaces to elevations of 1,300 feet. The primary floral elements
           of this woodland are blue oak (Quercus douglasil), interior live oak (Quercus wizlizenii) and
           digger pine (Pinus sabiniana). Above 1,500 feet these species give way to canyon live oak
           (Quercus chrysolepis), tan-bark oak (Lithocarpus densiflora) and black oak (Quercus kelloggii).
           Several species of shrubs provide an understory to this open woodland. Prominent in this
           community are manzanita (Arctostaphylos sp.), California lilac (Ceanothus sp.), yerba santa
           (Eriodictyon californicum), poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum) and several members of the
           rose family (e.g. the genera Prunus, Rubus and Rosa).
•          Digger Pine-Oak Woodland. This woodland is a mixture of digger pine (Pinus sabiniana) and
           blue oak (Quercus douglasil). Pure stands of either tree do occur, but mixed stands are more
           common. Pinus sabiniana usually towers over the oaks in undisturbed stands. Understories
           usually are dominated by introduced annuals. This vegetation type occurs on well-drained sites
           with Mediterranean climate, in rocky or exposed sites along ridges or canyons with poor or
           shallow soils.
•          Westside Ponderosa Pine Forest. The Ponderosa pine forest occurs as a broad transitional zone
           between the foothill woodland and higher mixed coniferous associations and is most extensive
           above 1,500 feet elevation in Paradise. It is generally a closed forest dominated by Ponderosa
           pine (Pinus ponderosa). The closely related Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyl) occurs locally on drier
           sites and serves as a specific indicator of ultrabasic and serpentine rock outcroppings. The
           Ponderosa pine zone has been the most heavily logged of all the communities in northern
           California and this practice has allowed the encroachment of other woody species into areas
           formerly covered by pines. The Ponderosa and Jeffrey pines are found locally intermixed with
           incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesil), white fir (Abies
           concolor), black oak and several additional hardwood species including big leaf maple, western
           dogwood and California laurel. The ponderosa pine forest zone represents the primary habitat
           type utilized for development in the Paradise area.
•          Northern Hardpan Vernal Pool. Located within close proximity of the tertiary study area is a
           documented vernal pool community classified by the California Natural Diversity Data Base
           (CNDDB) as northern hardpan vernal pool. These pools are ephemeral wetlands that occur when
           winter and spring rains fill the depressions in hogwallow or mima mound areas. Several sensitive
           plant species occur in association with the northern hardpan vernal pool community: Hoover's
           spurge (Chamaesyce hooverii, federal-Category 1; state-none), Green's tuctoria (Tuctoria greenei,

          federal-candidate Category 1; state-rare), and Shippee meadowfoam (Limnanthes floccosa ssp.
          californica, federal-Category l; state-endangered).
Federal Category 2 candidate species for federal listing comprise taxa for which information now in
possession of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service indicates proposing to list the species as endangered or
threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat(s)
are not currently available to support proposed rules at this time. Federal Category l candidate species
comprise taxa for which the service has sufficient biological information to support a proposal to list as
endangered or threatened.
Other sensitive species with reported occurrences within or near the study area include California hibiscus
(Hibiscus californicus, federal-Category 2; state-none), which occurs in moist, freshwater-soaked river
banks and low peat islands in sloughs, marshes and swamps; Butte County checkerbloom (Sidalcea robusta,
federal-Category 2; state-none), which occurs in small draws and rocky crevices in chaparral and
cismontane woodland communities; California beaked-rush (Khynchospora californica, federal-Category 2;
state-none), occurring in freshwater seeps.
Sensitive plant species with the potential to occur within or near the study area include Ahart's paronychia
(Paronychia ahartii, federal-Category 2; state-none), which occurs in stony, nearly barren clay of swales
and higher ground around vernal pools in valley and foothill grassland communities; and veiny monardella
(Monardella douglasiivar. venosa, federal-Category 2; state-none), which also occurs in valley and foothill
grasslands; adobe lily (fritillaria pluriflora); Butte County fritillary (Fritillaria eastwoodias); Red Bluff
dwarf rush (Juncus leiospermus var. leiospermus); Bidwell's knotweed (Polygonum bidwelliae); Butte
morning glory (Calystegia atriplicifolius); clustered lady slipper orchid (Cypripediumfasciculatum); Butte
County (Shippee) meadowfoam (Limnanthes floccosa sp. Californica, State-Endangered); and Greene's
Orcutt Grass (Tuctoria greenei, State-Rare). Appendix B contains a partial listing of common and sensitive
plant species found within and in the vicinity of the study area.
Timber
The draft Butte County Energy, Natural Resources, and Recreation Element defines timberlands as land
available for timber production and capable of growing at least twenty cubic feet of industrial-quality wood
per acre per year. Timberlands in Butte County occur at elevations between approximately 2,200 and
6,200 feet. According to the above-referenced document, timberlands in Butte County occupy
approximately 341,000 acres, including most of the northern and eastern portions of Butte County.
Approximately twenty-seven percent of timberlands in Butte County are on national forest land. Portions
of the northerly secondary study area are within the boundaries of the Lassen National Forest.
Butte County recognizes the value of its timber resources by affording protection through the use of
Timberland Preserve Zoning (TPZ). The California Forest Taxation Reform Act created timberland
preserve zoning as a measure to reduce property taxes and protect timberlands from encroachment. TPZ-
zoned lands within the Paradise secondary study area are shown on the Land Use/Circulation Diagram in
Volume I, Policy Document. The timberland preserve zoning ordinance of Butte County also designates
other timberland zoning districts in Butte County, including parcels within the secondary study area.
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                         51                                                1994
The California Forest Practice Act regulates timber harvesting on nonfederal lands. The act delegates
authority for timber harvest plan review and enforcement of forest practice rules to the California
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF). Forest practice rules include guidelines for timber
harvest plans. A timber harvest plan is required for harvesting of timber ,for commercial purposes on
parcels larger than three acres.
The Paradise Irrigation District owns timberlands in the secondary study area and has harvested timber on
these lands. Local opposition has been expressed to the continuation of this practice due to concerns with
soil erosion, sedimentation and deterioration of the watershed, clear-cutting and construction of access
roads. As described in the draft Energy, Natural Resources, and Recreation Element, timber harvest
operations in and adjacent to riparian zones can affect aquatic ecosystems through removal of vegetation
and deposition of sediment and debris in stream channels. Another local concern with timber harvesting
north of Paradise in general is the impact of the passage of logging trucks through the town.
Wildlife
Wildlife reported for the Town of Paradise and the study areas is typical of the transitional foothill habitat
types found on the western flank of the Sierra plateau. Appendix B contains a partial listing of common
and sensitive wildlife species which occupy the habitats within Paradise and adjacent Butte County. This
list is not meant to represent a comprehensive survey of the resident and migratory wildlife. The urbanized
portions of Paradise are inhabited by a wide diversity of wildlife. No threatened, endangered or candidate
wildlife species have been documented within the Paradise study area.
•          Sensitive Wildlife Species. Currently there are twenty-four species of sensitive wildlife found
           in the general region (Appendix B). None of these species has been recorded by the natural
           diversity data base within the study area. These species include the western yellow billed cuckoo
           (Coccyzus americanus occidentalis), California red-legged frog (Rana aurora draytoni), foothill
           yellow-legged frog (Rana boylei), American badger (Taxidea taxus), golden eagle (Aquila
           chrysaetos), northern harrier (Circus cyaneus), black-shouldered kite (Elanus caeruleus), prairie
           falcon (Falco mexicanus), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), Valley elderberry longhorn beetle
           (Desmocerus californicus dimorphus), winter-run chinook salmon ( Oncorhyncus tshawytscha),
           giant garter snake (thamnophis couchi gigas), Aleutian Canada goose (Branta canadensis
           leucopareia), bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsoni),
           American peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus anatum), California black rail (Laterallus
          jamaicensus), greater sandhill crane (Grus Canadensis tabida), great gray owl (strix nebulosa),
           willow flycatcher (Empidonax trail/ii), bank swallow (Riparia riparia), least Bell's vireo (Vireo
           bellii pusillus), Sierra Nevada red fox (Vulpes vulpes necator), and wolverine (Gulo gulo).
•          Deer Population. Deer herds throughout most of California exhibited a serious long-term decline
           during the late 1960s and early 1970s. The California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG)
           then initiated a herd planning program designed to address this problem. In 1976 a statewide Plan
          for California Deer was approved. In 1977, legislative mandate AB 1521 added emphasis to the
           program. Subsequently, a new deer management policy was adopted by the California Department
           of Fish and Game. This policy specifies: (1) planning for deer herd management on a herd basis,
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                         52                                                1994

          (2) that specific program elements be included in each herd plan, and (3) that herd plans generally
          conform to the goals of the statewide plan.
          One of the deer populations associated with the Paradise study area, the Camp Beale herd, is part
          of the Mother Lode Deer Management Unit. There are no unique biological or geographical
          features which define the herd boundary. Rather, the herd is composed of resident deer
          populations which have similar habitat types in common (oak woodland and chaparral in the
          foothills and remnant marsh and riparian vegetation in the valley). The eastern boundary of the
          Mother Lode Deer Management Unit is an area of overlap with neighboring migratory herds. In
          the Paradise study area these herds are the Bucks Mountain herd, the Mooretown herd and the
          Eastern Tehama herd. This area of overlap is variable in size and depends on topography,
          severity and onset of winter, and forage conditions. During winter, migratory deer may descend
          to low elevations and winter with resident deer. Similarly, Mother Lode deer may occupy home
          ranges within neighboring migratory herd winter range.
          A management plan was prepared for the Bucks Mountain/Mooretown deer herds in 1983. This
          study identified the generalized herd boundaries (Figures 6-1 and 6-2) and identified transportation
          corridors in areas designated for "agricultural-residential" use in the Butte County General Plan.
          Corridors within or partially within the Paradise study area include Pentz Road, Clark Road, Neal
          Road, Skyway (to Inskip), Honey Run Road and Highway 70. The plan sets goals for deer herd
          management and includes recommendations regarding minimum parcel sizes and densities of
          development within critical summer and winter ranges, major migration corridors, holding areas,
          and noncritical summer and winter ranges. A similar management plan was also developed for
          the Eastern Tehama deer herd in 1983 (Figure 6-3). Figure 6-4 depicts DFG-designated
          development zones within migratory deer winter ranges, as well as critical and noncritical summer
          and winter ranges, herd boundaries, and major migration corridors within the Study Area.
•         Fisheries. The lower reaches of Butte Creek support a varied fish population dominated by
          suckers (Catastomus occidentalis) and sqnawfish (Ptychocheilus grandis). Smallmouth bass
          (Micropterus bolomieul) and catfish (lctalurus spp.) are also found on lower Butte Creek.
          Appendix B contains a listing of the fish of Butte Creek. The most important fishery is provided
          by runs of anadromous (sea going) fish including chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and
          steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri gairdnen), which make their way up Butte Creek to the reach of
          stream below Centerville powerhouse.
          As late as the 1960s, Butte Creek supported a spring run of chinook salmon of over 4,000 adults
          (a maximum of 20,000 in 1960), a lesser number of fall run chinook salmon and a small number
          of steelhead trout. Currently, the spring-run numbers fewer than 200 adults. These numbers
          represent more than a ninety-five percent decline in the past thirty years. CDFG population
          estimates and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) fish surveys indicate that few adult spring-run
          salmon reach upper Butte Creek, where excelleut flow, temperature, and habitat conditions are
          available. The fall-run population varies between a few to as many as 1,000 (1985) and the
          number of steelhead trout is unknown (Hinton, 1989).
          Project dams and diversions in Butte Creek have had an adverse impact on salmon and steelhead.
          The decline of Butte Creek's once numerous chinook and steelhead fisheries is attributed to
          inadequate flows, poor water quality and inadequate fish ladders at several diversion dams.
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                         53                                                 1994

          Reduced flows of water in the creek resulting from the various barriers and diversions increase
          water temperature and decrease oxygen supply. This combinstion is lethal to both salmon and
          steelhead.
          Anadromous fish are precluded from spawning in the West Branch Feather River due to the
          barrier imposed by Oroville Dam. The Feather River Hatchery below Oroville Dam supports a
          run of steelhead and salmon. Lake Oroville supports a healthy warm-water fishery including
          largemouth, smallmouth, spotted, and redeye bass (Micropterus spp.); bluegill, green and redear
          sunfish, (Lepomis spp. ); catfish (lctalurus spp. ); and DFG-stocked chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
          tshawytscha) and brown trout (Sa/mo trutta). Development in the canyons of the West Branch
          Feather River watershed may lead to erosion and pollution which could detrimentally affect the
          Lake Oroville Fishery, according to DFG (Flint, 1991).
          The West Branch Feather River represents the western arm of Lake Oroville reservoir. Releases
          from Hendricks Dam near Stirling City downstream to a diversion structure northeast of Magalia
          provide for perennial streamflows. A well-established brown and rainbow trout (salmo gairdneri)
          population depends on these flows which Pacific Gas and Electric Company maintains under
          contractual agreement with DFG.
          The dam structure northeast of Magalia diverts streamflows to the Upper Miocene Canal (which
          runs parallel to the West Branch Feather River before feeding Kunkle Reservoir south of the
          town). Dewatering in the stretch of the West Branch Feather River between Magalia and Lake
          Oroville renders the section unsuitable to support viable game-fish populations.

The state Noise Element Guidelines require that major noise sources be identified and quantified by
preparing generalized noise contours for current and projected conditions. Significant noise sources in the
Paradise study area include traffic on major roadways and highways, airports, and representative industrial
activities and fixed noise sources. Please refer to Appendix C for a glossary of acoustical terminology used
in this section.
Noise modeling techniques and noise measurements were used to develop generalized L"" noise contours
for the major roadways and fixed noise sources in the Paradise study area for existing (1990 for major
roadways and 1991 for fixed noise sources) conditions.
Noise modeling techniques use source-specific data including average levels of activity, hours of operation,
seasonal fluctuations, and average levels of noise from source operations. Modeling methods have been
developed for a number of environmental noise sources including roadways, railroad line operations,
railroad yard operations, industrial plants and airports. Such methods produce reliable results as long as
data inputs and assumptions are valid. The modeling methods used closely follow recommendations made
by the state Office of Noise Control, and were supplemented where appropriate by field-measured noise
level data to account for local conditions. The noise exposure contours are based upon annual average
conditions. Because local topography, vegetation or intervening structures may significantly affect noise
exposure at a particular location, the noise contours should not be considered site specific.
A community noise survey was conducted to describe existing noise levels in noise-sensitive areas within
Paradise and the Paradise study area so that noise level performance standards can be developed to maintain
an acceptable noise environment.
Roadways
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise Prediction Model (FHWA-
RD-77-108) was used to develop L"" contours for all highways and major roadways in Paradise. The
FHWA model is the analytical method presently favored for traffic noise prediction by most state and local
agencies, including Caltrans. Short-term (fifteen-minute) traffic noise measurements and concurrent traffic
counts were conducted for State Route 191/Clark Road, Skyway, Pearson Road and Elliott Road (See
Figure 7-1) on March 14, 1991. The noise measurements were made to evaluate the noise exposure due
to traffic on those roadways. Using traffic data and the FHWA methodology, traffic noise levels as defined
by L"" were calculated for existing (1990) traffic volumes. Distances from the centerlines of selected
roadways to the L"" contours are summarized in Table 7-1.
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                        59                                                 1994
These calculations do not include consideration of shielding caused by local buildings or topographical
features, so the distances reported in Table 7-1 are worst-case estimates of noise exposure along roadways
in the community.
Existing traffic volumes were not provided for some of the local arterials. However, Figure 7-2, prepared
using the FHWA model, may be used to estimate the distance to the 60 dB I.,., contour for projected
volumes of arterial traffic.      For arterial traffic, the predicted distance to the 60 dB I.,., contour is
determined by the average daily traffic volume (ADT) and the posted speed limit. L"" contours derived
from Figure 7-2 are only indicators of potential noise conflicts, requiring more detailed analysis to
determine traffic noise levels at any given location.
Industrial Noise
The production of noise is a result of many industrial processes, even when the best available noise control
technology is applied. Noise exposures within industrial facilities are controlled by federal and state
employee health and safety regulations (OSHA and Cal-OSHA), but exterior noise levels may exceed
locally acceptable standards. Commercial, recreational and public service facility activities can also
produce noise which affects adjacent sensitive land uses.
The following descriptions of existing fixed noise sources in the Paradise study area are intended to be
representative of the relative noise impacts of such uses, and to identify specific noise sources which should
be considered in the review of development proposals. The locations of these noise sources are shown by
Figure 7-1.
•         Easy Street Industrial Park. The Easy Street Industrial Park is located on the east side and
          adjacent to State Route 191 near the south Paradise town limit. Currently the industrial park is
          approximately thirty percent built out. Existing uses at the industrial park include Fashion Optical
          Displays, Arlin's RV Repair, Ken's Paradise Hitch and Welding, John H. Franklin Company
          (paving, excavating, septic systems and general engineering), Frontier Tours, PAL Plastics, CMT
          Tool Company, Paradise Solid Waste Systems, Inc. and the Paradise Animal Shelter. The
          industrial park is also used for heavy truck and equipment storage.
          Based upon field observations at the Easy Street Industrial Park, the area noise environment is
          dominated by State Route 191 vehicle noise. Major noise sources associated with the industrial
          park included heavy truck traffic, machinery, heating ventilation and air conditioning systems, and
          dogs barking at the animal shelter. During the field observations, none of the noise sources could
          be isolated from area roadway traffic noise.
          The Easy Street Industrial Park has adequate room for expansion in the future. Loud or obtrusive
          noise sources could be located at the industrial park in the future. Uses which inherently have
          loud or obtrusive noise sources, and could be located at the industrial park in the future include,

           but are not limited to, sand and gravel operations, asphalt and concrete batch plants, machine
           shops, bottling and canning operations, and heavy equipment maintenance shops.
Airport Noise
The Paradise Skypark Airport is located south of the Town of Paradise town limits in the secondary study
area. It is a private, public use general aviation airport. The airport has one runway 1,990 feet in length
with a heading of 17 /35. Based upon the December 1988 California Department of Transportation Division
of Aeronautics California Aviation System Plan, the Paradise Skypark Airport has twenty-three single
engine piston, one multi-engine piston, and one rotor-craft piston based aircraft with a total of 10,000
annual average aircraft operations. The Butte County Airport Land Use Commission adopted a revised
policy plan for the Paradise Skypark in August 1985, and a Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) was
adopted in March 1986.
Based upon the Paradise Skypark Airport Land Use Plan, the fifty-five dB I..,. noise contour for aircraft
operations is confined to the airport property and does not extend into the Paradise town limits (see
Figure 7-3) However, existing residential uses located within the southern town limits are located under
the northern end of the Paradise Skypark approach zone (see Figure 7-4).
Community Noise Survey
A community noise survey was conducted to document noise exposure in areas of the community
containing noise sensitive land uses. For that purpose, noise sensitive land uses in the Paradise study area
were considered to include residential areas, parks, schools, day care centers, hospitals and other medical
facilities. Noise monitoring sites were selected to be representative of typical conditions in the community.
Short-term noise monitoring was conducted on March 13-14, 1991. Each site was monitored three
different times during the day and night so that valid estimates of I..,. could be prepared. One long-term
noise monitoring site was established in Paradise to record day-night statistical trends. The data collected
included the L.., and other statistical descriptors. Noise monitoring sites, measured noise levels and
estimated Ldn values at each site are summarized in Table 7-2. Monitoring sites are shown by Figure 7-1.
The community noise survey results indicate that typical noise levels in noise sensitive areas of the study
area are in the range of forty-five dB to fifty-six dB I..,.. Noise from traffic on local roadways and
neighborhood activities is the controlling factor for background noise levels in the study area. 1n general,
the areas of Paradise and the Study Area which contain noise sensitive uses are quiet.
The continuous monitoring data in Figure 7-5 show that ambient noise levels reach a minimum during the
hours of 1:00-5:00 a.m., increasing during the daytime hours as a function of increased traffic and other

A nighttime survey of the area revealed light and glare primarily limited to modem commercial centers,
consisting of signage, parking lot lighting and street lights. Street lights are not generally installed in
residential areas, and are placed in commercial areas to ease the transition for drivers between brightly lit
parking lots and dark roadways. Within the secondary and tertiary study areas, potential sources of light
and glare include State Highways 99 and 191 and Skyway. The high school stadium as well as other
lighted athletic fields are additional sources of light and glare when in use.

Seismic and natural flood hazards relevant to the Paradise study area have been described in the preceding
sections on Geology and Seismicity (3.2) and Hydrology (5.0). Other potential hazards include wildland
fire hazards, dam failure, aircraft accidents and a hazardous materials spills and leaks. The terrain and
limited access to the community restrict emergency evacuation routes. The town has recently completed
preparation of a Multihazard Disaster Plan which addresses earthquakes, hazardous material incidents,
major storms, major fires and volcanic eruptions.
The wildland fire hazard in the Paradise study area results from topography, elevation, dry summer
climate, winds, access, water availability, buildup of combustible materials, vegetation patterns, and
structural materials, and is compounded by periods of drought. The peak fire hazard season occurs from
late June through early October. Please refer to Section 14.2 for a complete discussion of fire protection.
According to the Multihazard Disaster Plan, due to the sheer volume of people that can be affected at one
time by a wildland fire, a number of potential traffic flow problems exist. These are complicated by the
existence of only one north route out of town; only four south routes out of town, two of which could
easily be affected by a single fire; and only three through east-west streets. The plan concludes that any
fire in the Magalia area would have a major impact on the roads in Paradise because access is via a two-
lane road. The plan identifies the following specific areas of concern:
•         Lower Neal Road
 •        The west side, especially Valley View, Valley Ridge, Acorn Ridge and adjoining areas
 •        Foster Road (single paved access, with Wayland Road to Neal Road as the only other escape)
 •        Fires threatening large sections of Skyway or Pentz, which could cut off both north and south
          egress
The potential for hazardous materials incidents exists primarily on the major highways which cross the
study area and leaking underground tank storage. Please refer to Section 16.5 for a discussion of the Butte
County Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
The potential for aircraft accidents exists in relation to Paradise Skypark Airport, a privately-owned, public
use airport located south of the town limits, within the secondary study area, on the west side of Clark
Road. According to the Paradise Skypark Airport Land Use Plan (Butte County Association of
Governments, 1985), the airport has experienced no crashes involving the public or scheduled air carriers
in recent years. According to this plan, approximately fifty percent of civilian aircraft accidents occur
within airport boundaries, and approximately fifteen percent outside airport boundaries and within one mile

of airports. Of these near-airport accidents, approximately sixty percent are concentrated within narrow
strips of land at both ends of the runway (approach and departure zones).
The Butte County Mosquito Abatement District has indicated that Lyme disease is present in the Paradise
area due to the presence of disease-bearing ticks. The district has also indicated that storm water basins
and wastewater treatment ponds may increase the potential for mosquito-borne diseases in the area.

The 1990 state Department of Finance estimated population for the Town of Paradise was 26, 786;
however, the 1990 U. S. Census count for the town is 25,403. The growth forecast contained in the 1982
Paradise General Plan for 1990 was 28,580, so it is evident that actual population growth has not equaled
previous estimates, most likely due in part to limitations upon sewage disposal systems. Estimated
household size for 1990 is 2.4 persons per household.
Department of Finance housing estimates for 1990 reported a vacancy rate of 4.28 percent and a total of
11,652 housing units, while the 1990 U. S. Census reported a total of 11,633 housing units.
Table 11-1 reports population counts for each census year, beginning with 1960, including a 1975 special
census conducted by the Department of Finance and sponsored by Butte County. Table 11-2 compares
population growth in Butte County with the Town of Paradise for 1980-1990.
According to the 1990 Census, the ethnic composition of the town is 94.6 percent white; eight-tenths of
one percent American Indian, Alaskan and Aleut; one percent Asian and Pacific Islanders; one-tenth of one
percent Black; and 3.4 percent Hispanic.
Employment information available from the California Employment Development Department (EDD) for
the Chico Metropolitan Statistical Area (which encompasses all of Butte County) indicates an annual
average unemployment rate of 7.9 percent, as compared to a statewide rate of 5.1 percent for 1989. Data
is not available for the Town of Paradise.
Employment projections for the Chico MSA forecast increases in employment in
agriculture/forestry/fishing; construction and mining; some manufacturing categories; retail trade; finance,
insurance, and real estate; services; and local government and education. No growth or decreases are
forecast in food, lumber, and wood products manufacturing; transportation and public utilities; wholesale
trade; and State and Federal government employment. The three largest employment sectors for the county
are services (24.3 percent), retail trade (22.6 percent) and government (21.2 percent).
The population growth anticipated over the next fifteen years could average approximately 1.3 percent
annually. The plan's growth management thrust is intended to keep residential construction and population
growth near to that experienced over the past ten years. Carrying this projection forward will result in a
population increase from the current 26,000 to approximately 31,692 by the year 2008. Using net rather
than gross acreage, the build-out population projection is estimated at 31,377.
Build out projections contained in the Paradise General Plan are based primarily on a survey of existing
land uses, the land use designations established by this plan, and the vacant land gross acreage town wide.

As described in Section 11.0 above, the population of Paradise has grown moderately since 1980, at an
average annual rate of 1.3 percent. A review of census data and Department of Finance (DOF) estimates
indicates that the town's housing stock expanded by 1,510 units during the period 1980-1990, an average
annual increase of 151 units (see Table 12-1). The actual growth of the housing inventory, however, has
not been constant over time (see Table 12-2).
An examination of census data provides insight into the changing demand for different types of dwelling
units within the town. The three basic types of housing units for which data are presented are single family
units, multiple family units (which range in size from duplexes to larger apartment complexes containing
several units), and mobile homes located in mobile home parks and on individual lots.
The predominant type of dwelling unit in Paradise continues to be the conventional single family residence.
Jn contrast to statewide trends, single family units in Paradise increased from 69.0 percent of the total
housing stock in 1980 to 72.4 percent in 1990, as indicated in Table 12-3. Statewide trends indicate a
decline in the percentage of single family dwellings, due primarily to an increased market share of lower-
priced mobile homes and rental apartment units.
Comparison of the growth rates of the three dwelling types in Paradise illustrates the change in distribution
of dwelling type. From 1980 to 1990, single family dwellings increased by only 20.8 percent, while
multiple family units experienced a significantly higher increase of 48.0 percent and the number of mobile
homes declined by 13.5 percent. The proportion of the town's housing stock comprised of multiple-family
units has slowly but steadily increased from 8.0 percent of the total supply in 1980 to 10.3 percent in 1990.
Construction of new multiple-family dwellings in Paradise is significantly constrained by the lack of a
sewer system.
The percentage of the local housing stock comprised of mobile homes, both in parks and on individual lots,
has historically been higher than average in Paradise, due to its rural nature and the larger senior citizen
population. The percentage of mobile homes declined from 23.0 percent of the housing stock in 1980 to
17.3 percent in 1990. Fewer new permits for mobile home installations are being issued in proportion to
the number of new, custom single family dwellings being constructed.

Before current housing needs can be understood and future needs anticipated, housing occupancy
characteristics must be identified. An analysis of household size, household growth, tenure and vacancy
trends complements the previous analysis of population and housing characteristics during the same time
period.
A review of available data shown in Table 12-4 indicates that the number of households in Paradise
increased by 1,613 during the period 1980-1990, a 16.9 percent increase. The small increase in the
average household size in Paradise during the 1980s is in contrast to a statewide trend toward smaller
households (see Table 12-5). Department of Finance estimates for 1990 indicate that the average household
size increased to 2.36 persons per household in 1990. This may be attributable to a decreased percentage
of elderly population and an increase in the number of families with children living at home.
Until 1990 Census data becomes available, it is not known whether the rate of homeownership within the
Town of Paradise has increased or decreased during this decade. The statewide trend is toward a decreased
rate of homeownership, due to the increased cost of housing. Table 12-6 estimates the number of owner-
occupied and renter-occupied units based upon 1980 rates.
The vacancy rate is a measure of the general availability of housing. It also indicates how well the type
of units available meet the current housing market demand. A low vacancy rate suggests that families may
have difficulty finding housing within their price range; a high vacancy rate may indicate either the
existence of deficient units undesirable for occupancy, or an oversupply of housing units. The 1980 and
1990 vacancy rates for Paradise are 5.2 and 4.28 percent, respectively.

Existing Housing Needs
Like most municipalities in California, Paradise's goal of providing a decent home and suitable living
environment for every family has not yet been achieved. The following analysis of current housing
conditions documents Psrsdise's housing needs relative to various segments of the population.
Housing need is a complex issue, consisting of at least three major components: housing affordability,
housing quality, and housing quantity. In addition, certain segments of the population have traditionally
experienced unusual difficulty in obtaining adequate housing. Those unusual difficulties experienced by
the elderly, the handicapped, female heads of household, large families, and the homeless are discussed
as special needs in this section.
Housing Affordability
State housing policy recognizes that cooperative participation of the private and public sectors is necessary
to expand housing opportunities to all economic segments of the community. A primary state goal is the
provision of a decent home and a satisfying environment that is affordable. The private sector generally
responds to the majority of the community's housing needs through the production of market-rate housing.
There are many components involved in housing costs. Some of these factors can be controlled at the local
level, others cannot. It is a primary goal of Paradise to adopt local policies and procedures which do not
unnecessarily add to already escalating housing costs.
Some of the effects or problems which result from increased housing costs include the following:
•         Declining Rate of Homeownership: As housing prices and financing rates climb, fewer people
          can afford to purchase homes. Households with median and moderate incomes who traditionally
          purchased homes compete with less advantaged households for rental housing. This can be
          expected to result in lower vacancy rates for apartment units and higher rents.
•         Overpayment: The cost of housing eventually causes fixed-income, elderly and lower income
          families to use a disproportionate percentage of their income for housing. This causes a series
          of other financial problems, often resulting in a deteriorating housing stock because the costs of
          maintenance must be sacrificed for more immediate expenses (e.g. food, clothing, medical care,
          and utilities).
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                        88                                                 1994

•         Overcrowding: As housing prices climb, lower income households must be satisfied with less
          house for the available money. This can result in overcrowding which places a strain on physical
          facilities, does not provide a satisfying enviromnent, and eventoally causes conditions which
          contribute to both deterioration of the housing stock and neighborhoods. Buying a new home has
          become a major obstacle for maoy families, particularly first-time home buyers.
In this area, the median sale price of a home was $100,000 in 1991. The household earning the median
family income for Butte County of $31,400 can theoretically afford a monthly housing payment of $654,
which is less than the $692 payment required for a median priced home purchased with a ten percent down
payment and financed at an 8.5 percent interest rate. A 1991 analysis of the components of monthly
housing costs for a typical single family house costing $100,000 purchased with a ten percent down
payment and financed at 8.5 percent for thirty years, indicates that a $10,000 reduction in land development
costs results in a ten percent reduction in monthly payment, while a one percent reduction in takeout
financing interest rates also results in a 9.2 percent reduction in monthly payment. The 1991 average sales
price of a mobile home in a mobile home park was $31,900. Financed at an 8.5 percent interest rate for
twenty years with a ten percent dowo payment, the monthly housing payment would be $249. Although
this payment does not include park rental fees, with fees it does fall within the monthly housing payment
that is affordable to the median income family.
Also, in this area 23.9 percent of housing units are renter-occupied. In 1990, average rental rates in
Paradise were $296 for a one-bedroom apartment, $444 for a two bedroom apartment, and $412 for a
three-bedroom apartment, and duplex rents ranged from $348 to $465. Rental rates for houses ranged from
$319 to $676, and for mobile homes from $324 to $542 (A Multifamily Rental Housing Strategy). These
rents are, for the most part, within the affordable range for the median income family.
The magnitude of the affordability problem is discussed in the 1991 Butte County Association of
Govermnents Regional Housing Allocation Plan. The definition of housing "needs" is those renters and
homeowners paying over twenty-five percent of their gross income for shelter. This plan has grouped
Paradise's households into four household income categories, including very low, low, moderate and above
moderate income. Table 12-7 indicates the existing and projected 1997 numbers of households that paid
or will pay in excess of twenty-five percent of their income for housing by income group.
Housing Ouality
A windshield housing condition survey was completed in the Towo of Paradise in March 1991. A survey
of multiple family units only was completed in February 1990. The results of both surveys are presented
in Tables 12-8 and 12-9. Both surveys indicate that the overwhelming majority of dwelling units in
Paradise are in sound condition.
The rating system used in both surveys was based on the format prescribed by the California Department
of Housing and Community Development. The rating system evaluates residences based on the exterior
condition of five components: roof, foundation, siding, windows, and doors.
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                          89                                               1994

Residences were rated as one of five possible condition categories: sound, minor, moderate, substantial,
and dilapidated. These terms are defined as follows:
•         Dwelling units rated as •sound" had no visible repair needs or needed one or two deferred
          maintenance repairs, such as painting, patching, or window repair.
•         Dwelling units rated in need of "minor" rehabilitation required several deferred maintenance
          repairs and/or had one replacement repair need (such as the re-sheathing of the roof, replacement
          of siding, replacement of doors or windows, or partial foundation work).
•         The "moderate" rehabilitation category was assigned to dwelling units that required two
          replacement repairs plus deferred maintenance. Complete replacement or installation of a
          foundation system and structural roof repair or replacement also typify "moderate" rehabilitation.
•         A dwelling unit in need of •substantial" rehabilitation requires the replacement of three or more
          components.
•         "Dilapidated" dwelling units are those which require the replacement of virtually all components
          and which are not financially feasible to repair.
While age certainly is contributory to housing quality problems, another factor which partially explains
substandard housing is overcrowding. Table 12-10 shows that 2.5 percent of the total housing units within
Paradise were overcrowded in 1980, a comparatively low number which undoubtedly can be ascribed to
the high elderly population. The U.S. Census Bureau defines overcrowded housing units as those with in
excess of 1.00 person per room average. The extent of the overcrowding problem in Paradise is shown
in Table 12-10. However, the actual causes cannot be determined without conducting special studies.
Overcrowding is often reflective of one of three conditions: a family or household living in too small a
dwelling; a family housing extended family members (i.e. grandparents or grown children and their
families living with parents); or a family renting inadequate living space to non-family members (i.e.
families renting to migrant farm workers). Whatever the cause of overcrowding, there appears to be a
direct link to housing affordability. Either homeowners/renters with large families are unable to afford
larger dwellings, older children wishing to leave home cannot do so because they cannot qualify for a home
loan or are unable to make rental payments, grandparents on fixed incomes are unable to afford suitable
housing or have physical handicaps that require them to live with their children, families with low incomes
may permit overcrowding to occur in order to derive additional income, or there is an insufficient supply
of housing units in the community to accommodate the demand. According to a Multifamily Rental
Housing Strategy, three-bedroom (and larger) apartments are very scarce in Paradise.

Special Needs
State housing law requires that the special needs of certain disadvantaged groups be addressed. The needs
of the elderly, disabled, large families, and female heads of household are described below.
•          The Elderly. The special housing needs of the elderly are an important concern of the Town of
           Paradise because this group comprises a larger-than-average share of the population. Their special
           characteristics include fixed incomes and special needs related to housing construction and
           location. Location-based needs include access to medical, shopping and public transit facilities.
           1990 state census data reveals that 7, 770 town residents, or 30.58 percent of the total population,
           were sixty-five years of age or older in 1990, compared to 6,487 persons (28.7 percent) in 1980.
           The Multi-Family Rental Housing Strategy Plan, prepared for Paradise by Connerly and
           Associates in 1990, indicated that seventy-three percent of the mnlti-family rental housing units
           (apartments, duplexes, multiplexes) in Paradise are occupied by citizens sixty-two years of age or
           older.
           Elderly households in Paradise may have two special needs: 1) low income elderly households
           may not have enough income to properly maintain their homes; and 2) some may no longer be
           able to live in their homes. The former may need financial assistance for housing rehabilitation,
           while the latter may need to move to an assisted situation for older adults.
           Estimate of Need. The estimate of the two special housing needs of the elderly population in
           Paradise is relatively high. The Paradise Multifamily Rental Housing Strategy report, prepared
           by Connerly and Associates in 1990 revealed that the majority of renters in the town are over the
           age of sixty-five. However, it is estimated that a significant amount of elderly persons still own
           their homes, and could be facing the two identified critical needs.
           Existing and Projected Resources The primary resources available to address the critical
           housing needs of the elderly population are: 1) federal government entitlement city funds; and
           2) an increase in General Plan land use designations that provide an increased opportunity for
           alternative housing for the elderly.
           The town has prepared a comprehensive housing affordability strategy report that focuses on
           housing rehabilitation.
•          Physically Disabled. Table 12-12 indicates the number of persons in 1980 who had disabilities
           that either restricted working or restricted them from using public transportation. It should be
           noted that the listing of those persons with transportation disabilities includes a large number of
           persons sixty-five years of age and older. As indicated, 4.6 percent of Paradise's households
           contained members who were unable to work because of a disability and 3. 8 percent experienced
           transportation disabilities. Estimates for 1990 are also included in this table.

Environmental Setting Document                          91                                                 1994

          Physically disabled persons need accessible and functional shelter that accommodates wheelchairs
          and walking aids. Special housing features may include entry way ramps, larger door and hall
          widths, grab bars in bathrooms, etc.
          Estimate of Need. As indicated in the discussion above and illustrated in Table 12-12, there is
          a significant population of physically disabled in the Town of Paradise. It is assumed that the
          need for accessible housing and functional shelter is high because the town does not experience
          a frequent rate of building permit activity dedicated to retrofitting existing rental or other dwelling
          units with entry way ramps, expanded door widths, etc.
          Existing and Projected Resources. Projects involving compliance with the American
          Disabilities Act requirements are eligible for funding with the federal government entitlement city
          funds. The Town of Paradise intends to utilize a portion of the funds for this purpose.
•         Large Families. Large families are indicative not only of those households that require larger
          dwellings to meet their housing needs, but also are reflective of a large number that live below
          the poverty level. Table 12-13 indicates the numbers and percentages of those households that had
          five or more members of 1980 and 1990.
          The primary housing need of low-income large families is affordable multi-bedroom rental and
          ownership housing.
          Estimate of Need. Large families do not make up a significant portion of the Paradise
          community. As Table 12-13 illustrates, only 6. 7 percent of the total number of housing units are
          occupied by large families. However, 6.2 percent of the total are renters, and the Paradise
          Mullifamily Rental Housing Strategy identifies large rental units as a need.
          Existing Resources. The federal entitlement city funding will be used, in part, for rental housing
          and onsite sewage disposal system rehabilitation programs. This will assist in the preservation and
          enhancement of the large rental unit housing stock town wide.
•         Female Heads of Household. Families with female heads of household experience a higher than
          average incidence of poverty as well. Table 12-14 lists the numbers and percentages of female-
          headed households for 1980 and 1990.
          A rental honsing survey prepared for the Town of Paradise by Connerly and Associates in 1990,
          indicates that there are a total of 790 multi-family rental units in the community. Four percent
          were occupied by female heads of household with children. Extrapolating this percentage over the
          total number of rental units in Paradise reveals approximately 112 female heads of household with
          children that rent housing in Paradise. The 1990 census data reveals that there are another 476
          female heads of household within the town.

          Female heads of households need low-cost family housing because they are usually strapped with
          the responsibilities of rearing children and earning an income. Recreation and child care facilities
          associated with housing is another need of single women raising children.
          Estimate of Need. While the estimate of need is not considered high in terms of the percentage
          of female hesds of households compared to other groups within the town, there is a need that must
          be addressed.
          Existing Resources. The General Plan land use designations provide ample opportunity for low
          cost rental housing opportunities. The federal government entitlement city funding can be used
          to assist the rehabilitation of existing low cost housing units and failing onsite sewage disposal
          systems.
•         Fann Workers. Although there are a few remaining agricultural parcels in Paradise, mostly
          orchards, the farm labor required is not sufficient to create a resident farm worker population.
          Jn the 1991 Regional Housing Allocation Plan, the Butte County Association of Governments
          (BCAG) determined that there would be 100 additional farm worker households countywide by
          1997, of which Paradise's share would be twelve households. However, BCAG concluded that
          Paradise is not expected to house farm workers due to its location.
•         The Homeless. The Butte County Community Action Agency (CAA) is responsible for assisting
          the homeless population in Butte County, including the Town of Paradise. This agency does not
          keep records for the numbers of homeless found in individual jurisdictions within the county.
          There is currently no emergency shelter or transitional housing within the Town of Paradise. The
          CAA has reported that, during the summer months, there is norrually a transient homeless
          population that camps in the Upper Ridge area north of the town. The CAA, which maintains a
          Paradise office, refers the small numbers of homeless it serves in Paradise to shelters in Chico
          and Oroville. According to the agency, it is meeting the needs of the homeless in Butte County
          (Lorene Eagleson, pers. comm., February 1992).
          Extent and Type of Programs Providing Food and Services
          Help-4-People and the Butte Community Action Agency are two nonprofit agencies within the
          Town of Paradise providing assistance to homeless persons within the area. Help-4-People is
          supported by fraternal and civic seivice organizations, ministerial associations, churches, business
          and individual volunteers. Help-4-People offers aid to transients in the form of food distribution
          every Tuesday and Thursday and agency referrals when needed. The Butte County Community
          Action Agency also offers aid in the form of distribution of commodities on the third Thursday
          of each month and agency/shelter referrals.

          Social Service Programs for Homeless
          Although no social service programs for the homeless exist within the Town of Paradise, the Butte
          Community Action Agency is able to make the necessary referrals to other programs within Butte
          County.
          Extent and Tvne of Social Service Programs Targeted to Prevent Low-income Individuals
          From Becoming Homeless
          The Housing Authority of Butte County offers assisted housing to those low-income persons who
          meet the requirements of Federal Preference. Help-4-People and Butte Community Action Agency
          offer their commodity assistance to low-income individuals and families as well. Other commodity
          assistance programs are run through local churches. In addition to commodity assistance, CAA
          also offers assistance with electric and gas bills for low-income families.

Information presented in Sections 11.0 and 12.0 above documented tbe recent growth which has
occurred in tbe population and housing stock of Paradise. Between 1980 and 1991, the population
increased by 14.4 percent. The portion of tbe statewide housing need assigned to Butte County during
tbe period January 1, 1991 to July 1, 1997 totals 12, 165 dwelling units. The number of households is
projected to increase by 9,866 countywide.
Market Demand for Housing
The Paradise and Butte County regional real estate market, like most of the rest of California, is
relatively slow at the time that this Housing Element is writteu. At tbe same time, it is one of the more
affordable housing markets in the state. The cyclical nature of real estate makes it difficult to forecast
the character of market demand during the planning period. Local sources have indicated tbat the supply
of rental apartments is relatively scarce in Paradise, although there is a greater available supply of rental
honses.
Projected Housing Demand and Basic Construction Need for all Income Levels
The 1991 Regional Housing Allocation Plan prepared for the Butte County Association of Governments
establishes botb the projected need for nonmarket rate housing and the distribution of the projected need
to each jurisdiction within the region. The need for nonmarket rate housing is defined as households in
the very low, low, and moderate income groups which pay over twenty-five percent of total income for
housing. It is assumed that households with an above-moderate income are not in need of economic aid.
A projected total need for 1, 176 households is given in the Regional Housing Allocation Plan for the
Town of Paradise between 1991 and 1997. This total was subsequently adjusted by BCAG to take into
consideration additional vacancies, housing replacement need, farm workers, students and other
adjustments, for a total of 1,568 households.
The plan establishes the basic new construction need for the Town of Paradise at 1,350 dwelling units.
This allocation was based on tbe assumption that the maximum number of dwelling units that Paradise
can accommodate is 1,350 between 1991and1997, due to sewer constraints and topographic conditions.
The basic construction need for Paradise and tbe other Butte County jurisdictions by income level is
presented in Table 12-15. This total may be translated into an annual new construction need of 193
units.

Conversion of Assisted Housing Units
State housing element law requires that housing elements address subsidized housing units at risk of
conversion to market rate units. Two developments have been identified in Paradise which are at risk
of conversion: Kathy Court, located at 1561-1565 Kathy Court, a 236 (J) (1) project with family rental
units; and Paradise Gardens, a forty-eight unit Section 8 new construction project.
Kathy Court is a mortgage-based subsidy project subject to the provisions of the Low Income Housing
Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act (LIHPRHA). It is currently eligible to proceed under
the provisions of LIHPRHA because it is within two years of its initial prepayment eligibility date.
Paradise Gardens has a FmHA Section 515 rural rental housing mortgage loan with a Section 8
conventional new construction contract (mortgage and rental subsidies). April 4, 1994 represents the
Section 8 contract opt-out date.
Accordingly, both of these projects are or will be at risk of conversion to market rate units during the
next ten years. The Town of Paradise currently does not have the financial ability to purchase and
assure preservation of either of these projects, and there is no nonprofit organization within the town that
is involved with or capable of purchasing them. Potential future preservation resources may include
federal entitlement city funding. If this funding source is available, and if the at risk projects are
eligible, the town may choose to attempt to assist the preservation of one or both projects.
Currently, the Community Housing Improvement Program (CHIP) a non-profit housing organization
based in Butte County, is seeking "Home" (Horne Investment in Affordable Housing) funding to assume
the existing mortgage for the twelve family rental units on Kay Court (formally "Kathy Court"). If
successful, CHIP intends to maintain the units as affordable for low-income families. The Town of
Paradise supports this effort. The units were appraised at a value of $400,000 in 1993. CHIP has
offered $377,000 and has estimated another $339,054 in rehabilitation cost is needed to conserve these
units. Using the current average cost of new construction for the multifamily residential units ($70 per
square foot), replacement of the units is estimated to be approximately $840,000 with an estimated
$84,000 for the cost of the land and improvements.
The contract extending the agreement to maintain the Paradise Gardens, a 48 unit Section 8 project as
affordable for low income persons, was executed by the property owner in 1996. It is not known at this
titne if the Section 8 program will be continued; however, all local steps have been taken to ensure these
units are conserved. New construction costs for this type of housing is estimated to be $2,956,320 for
the construction of the units and $336,000 for the cost of the land and improvements.

In order to properly plan for future housing needs, undeveloped lands available for housing within the
town and within projected growth areas must be identified. It is assumed that this growth and
development will occur upon annexation to the town. The Regional Housing Allocation Plan assumes
that development will be concentrated in those communities in which public facilities can be constructed
or expanded between 1991 and 1997.
Available Land Inventory
Table 2-2 of Volume I, Policy Document, itemizes land planned for growth and development within and
around the Town of Paradise. It includes vacant lands presently within the Town of Paradise and lands
to the south of the town limits within the secondary study area which are planned for residential
development, and that are not inordinately constrained by topography and the current lack of a
community collection sewer system. Some of the lands in the secondary study area are already prezoned
for residential use, and will be zoned to an appropriate residential classification upon annexation to the
town. It is important to note that the county has adopted a Paradise Urban Reserve Policy Statement
and has designated this area as "Urban Reserve" (see Figure 16-1). The policy provides that the
county's land use policy, zoning and subdivision shall be coordinated with the Town of Paradise. Please
refer to Section 16. l for a more complete description of this policy.
Table 2-2 of Volume I indicates the projected holding capacity of Paradise based upon vacant lands
planned for development. Table 2-1 of Volume I, presents the allowed densities and land use intensity
for each residential land use classification in the Paradise General Plan.
The tables indicate that the amount of land available (land inventory) for different types of residential
development, served or planned to be served by public facilities, is more than adequate to meet
anticipated growth, and to provide for the estimated number of new housing units determined necessary
by the Regional Housing Allocation Plan to provide new housing opportunities for low and lower income
households.
The primary land use designations that will provide low and moderate income housing opportunities are
"M-R" (Multi-Family Residential: ten dwelling units per net aere), "T-R" (Town-Residential: three
dwelling units per net aere), "C-C" (Central-Commercial: ten dwelling units per net acre), and "C-S"
(Community-Service: ten dwelling units per net acre).

At the Town's request, the Geographic Information Center (GIC) at California State University, Chico
prepared a geographic information systems land use map depicting vacant parcels with the current zoning
classifications within the Town of Paradise and the surrounding sphere of influence'. This map was
analyzed with the General Plan Land Use Map and an environmental constraints map to determine the
consistency with the Town Zoning map and the suitability of sites for future residential development.
The Town undertook and completed a town-wide rezoning effort in calendar year 1997. Comparison
of the zoning map with the land use map indicated that the two maps are consistent.
The 1998 Sites Analysis indicated there are approximately twenty (20) acres of vacant, buildable MF
[Multifamily Residential] zoned property, thirty (30) acres of C-C [Community-Commercial] zoned
land, and thirty acres (22 acres buildable) of C-S [Community-Services] zoned property which could be
developed with affordable housing within the Town limits (Primary Study Area). These zoning
classifications allow up to ten (10) dwelling units per acre for a potential total of 720 new units. A
Planning Commission use permit is required for residential use in the C-C and C-S zoning districts;
however, these properties are located in areas where residential use is in proximity and the topography
is not considered a significant constraint. These districts also allow greater lot coverage, 60% and 80%,
respectively. Additionally, there are nnderdeveloped and vacant sites representing approximately 3 acres
within the C-B [Central-Business] zoning district which could be developed with 30 housing units.
Because the area is in proximity to commercial services and transportation facilities, tl1is general vicinity
would be an appropriate location for a senior citizen housing project.
As indicated in Table 2-2 of the General Plan Policy Document and verified through new mapping, there
are approximately 500 vacant acres of property designated for Rural-Residential and Town-Residential
development. This acreage could provide approximately 960 new housing units.
Based on above data gathering and analysis, the Town of Paradise has more than adequate vacant,
buildable sites to meet the housing allocation projected by the Butte County Association of Government,
Regional Housing Allocation Plan, 1991. (See Table 12-15, Basic New Construction Need By Income
Group.)

    1'.2.$ J)EYELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS
A number of factors affect the ability of the private sector to respond to the demand for housing and
constrain the maintenance, improvement or development of housing for all economic groups. Constraints,
however, can generally be translated into increased costs to provide housing and fall into two basic
categories: governmental and nongovernmental.
Governmental Constraints
Govennnental constraints are potential and actual policies, standards, requirements, or actions imposed by
the various levels of government or development. Although federal and state programs and agencies play
a role in the imposition of governmental constraints and increases in llousing costs, they are beyond the
influence of town government and cannot be effectively addressed in this document. An analysis of
potential local governmental constraints is presented below.
Land Use Controls
Land use controls are basically minimmn standards included within the town's zoning and subdivision
ordinances. Zoning is a means of ensuring that the land uses in a community are properly situated in
relation to one another, providing adequate space for each type of development. Zoning regulations control
such features as height and bulk of buildings, Jot area, yard setbacks, population density, building use, etc.
If zoning standards are too rigid and do not allow sufficient flexibility, development costs could increase,
and interest in develop1nent may decrease.
Open space requirements can be an impediment to the prov1s1on of affordable housing.                   On-site
requirements for off-street parking and open space and/or landscaped areas can greatly increase the cost
of land development while limiting the overall housing density. The open space requirements for the Town
of Paradise do not exceed the percentages found in the same regional area. The 60% open space
requirement for detached single-family residential units would not be considered a constraint to affordable
housing in Paradise especially because there is no minimum square footage requirement for the unit size.
The open space requirement for multifamily residential development is 40% which is also consistent with
open space requirements for cities in the sa1ne regional area as Paradise and is not considered a constraint
to development of affordable housing. Please see Table 12-16A.

Note: All the comparison jurisdictions are served by sanitary sewer. The Town of Paradise, like
other communities served by septic and leach line systems, requires replacement areas for
additional septic line installation in case of system failure. This factor may require additional open
space areas for health and safety reasons and not aesthetic considerations.
QftCstreet parking regulations may also pose constraints on the provision of affordable housing especially
when coupled with open space requirements. The above noted open space requirements represent the
total of all impervious surfaces including of!Cstreet parking; therefore parking surfaces are not an
additional calculation and would not be considered a further constraint. The Town also has a reduced
off-street parking space size for compact cars for twenty (20) or more spaces which can constitute up
to 25 % of the total parking area. Additionally, the town engineer may approve oftcstreet parking spaces
within the yard setback areas of the property if sight distance is not impaired.
A potential constraint to providing affordable housing for qualified senior citizens is the current zoning
regulation which requires two (2) off-street parking spaces for mobile home sites. Mobile home units
represents approximately 16% of the total housing stock in the Town. Additionally, there are no
provisions for reduced off-street parking spaces for senior housing. Senior citizens represent the largest
group of Paradise occupants in mobile home parks and also comprised the largest number of lower
income persons in the community. It is common that senior citizens do not have more than one vehicle
per household. Because of this fact, many jurisdictions have reduced the number of required off-street

parking spaces for senior citizens. Therefore, it is reconnnended the Town review and revise the current
off-street parking regulations for mobile home sites and senior citizen housing.
The subdivision ordinance governs the process of converting raw land into building sites. It allows the
town to control the internal design of each new subdivision so that its pattern of streets, lots, public
utilities, and any amenities will be safe, pleasant and economical to maintain. As with zoning, overly
restrictive standards will result in higher land development costs and/or lack of interest in development.
The Town of Paradise offers several incentives in its zoning ordinance and subdivision ordinance,
including the following:
•          The zoning and subdivision ordinances were comprehensively amended and rewritten in 1988
           and 1990, respectively, updating and streamlining many requirements.
•          The zoning ordinance was amended to allow small (750 square feet) second dwellings in single
                                                                  11
           family zones \Vith a site plan revie\v permit. These granny flats" cai1. be rented out and are
           not considered in density limitations. In addition, the zoning ordinance allows "two-family"
           residences in single-family residential zones with the securing of a use permit.
•          The second dwelling units and two-family residences represent affordable housing opportunities
           in the Paradise connnunity. Because of the size limitations on the secondary dwelling units,
           they most often are rented at an affordable price. Additionally, second dwelling units can help
           senior citizens in retaining their primary household either through the increased income from
           the rental of a second dwelling unit and/or by providing living quarters for family members or
           caretakers.
           Currently, second dwelling units require noticing and a public hearing as part of the site plan
           review approval either by the Planning Connnission or the Town Planning Director. The site
           plan review permit process could be considered a constraint to the provision of second dwelling
           units. With adopted regulations for second dwelling units including size, yard setback areas
           and other development standards, second dwelling units could be approved administratively by
           Town staff.
•          The town's present requirements for onsite and offsite improvements are considerably less than
           most California cities of comparable size and development and are not considered to be a
           significant impediment to residential development. In order to preserve the rural character of
           the connnunity, asphalt berms and walkways have been preferred to sidewalks and concrete
           curbs and gutters in single-family areas.
•          The town changed its requirement of two parking spaces per new dwelling unit to a graduated
           scale based on the square footage of the unit. This allows for a reduced number of required
           parking spaces for multi-family residential development. For example, units less than 700
           square feet in size now only require 1.2 parking spaces, and units exceeding 1,200 square feet
           in size now require 1.8 parking spaces.

•         The Town of Paradise recently reorganized the planning, engineering and building departments
          into a Community Development Department to streamline permit processing and increase public
          service efficiency. This has dramatically improved the processing of building and planning
          permits for local housing projects by improving and expediting interdepartmental
          communication, and reducing redundancy of work.
•         The zoning ordinance does not distinguish between conventional houses and mobile homes on
          permanent foundations within rural residential and single family residential zoning districts.
          In addition, the zoning ordinance includes a mobile home combining zone which permits the
          use of mobile homes not placed on a permanent foundation as dwellings in the Rural
          Residential-3, Rural Residential, Single-Family Residential, Multiple-Family, Multiple-
          Family/Professional, Rural Residential-IO and Rural Residential-20 zones.
•         Lot merger provisions have been included in the subdivision ordinance to assist in the assembly
          of small parcels into larger building sites.
•         The town's site plan review process establishes standards that can be reviewed by a developer,
          prior to submittal of an application, to determine the requirements that will apply to the project.
          A site plan review is conducted before submittal of building plans, and reduces costs by
          identifying any problem areas prior to development of costly working drawings.
•         The zoning ordinance includes a planned development combining zone that provides flexibility
          for planned developments which do not conform in all respects with the designated land use
          pattern and/or ordinance requirements.
•         In terms of development standards for single and multi-family residential development, the town
          zoning ordinance is both clearly written and liberal. Lot coverages, height restrictions,
          setbacks and floor area ratio standards are straight forward and not considered an impediment
          to residential construction.
•         The Town's identity is closely related to the natural beauty of the forested terrain associated
          with Paradise and other communities located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
          Shortly after incorporation, the Town adopted its first tree ordinance. In March 1998, the tree
          preservation ordinance was amended. A permit is required to remove trees; however, the
          ordinance does not prohibit removal of trees for the construction of buildings and homes, but
          rather, prohibits indiscriminate and excessive removal of trees and logging. The tree permit
          is not a constraint to the provision of housing.
Building Codes
Building codes regulate the physical construction of dwellings and include plumbing, electrical and
mechanical divisions. The town adopts and follows the Uniform Building Code as established by state
law. The town operates a one-stop permit processing procedure.
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                        115                                     Revised 9/15/98

Site Improvements
Site improvements are regulated by the town subdivision ordinance, and through conditions and
standards imposed through the town's site plan review process. Site improvements include required
offstreet parking, roads, sidewalks, landscaping, walls, and the storm drainage system. There is
currently no sewer system, and water system requirements are handled by the appropriate special district
or private water company. The town does not require any improvements other than those deemed
necessary to maintain the public health, safety and welfare.
Onsite Wastewater Maintenance District
During the latter part of 1992, the town established an onsite wastewater maintenance district that will
monitor the performance of individual septic tank and leachfield systems, and oversee the enforcement
of the town sewage disposal ordinance. Existing systems serving rental units that are experiencing
failure will ultimately be repaired and/or upgraded. This will result in the potential increase in
opportunities for affordable housing units, or at the very least, increase the preservation of existing units.
A review of multiple-family residential projects constructed in the last two years, indicated that
maximum densities had been reached.' Development of housing within the Town is constrained by the
lack of a community sanitary waste collection system; however, the Town has accepted engineered
designed systems for septic and leach line disposal facilities on a project by project basis. A formal
onsite system variance procedure has been established by the Town in an effort to provide approval for
higher density projects including a 96-unit assisted living housing project currently under construction
on Buschmann Road. Approximately ten variance applications have been submitted and approved through
the variance procedure since 1995. Approximately 40 additional affordable housing units were approved
through the variance procedure. Although, still considered a constraint, the procedure to allow variances
to the adopted onsite sanitation regulations is minimizing this constraint to the maximum extent possible
while maintaining health and safety protection.
Development Permit Processing
In 1997, the Town of Paradise adopted a "Planning Process Reforms and Policy Document.'' The
purpose of the document is to provide early and complete information about the development process.
A "Planning Process Handbook" was produced to further implement the goals of the "Planning Process
          2
            Town of Paradise, Community Development Department, April 1998
          3
            Adopted by the Town Council, July 1, 1997

Environmental Setting Document                       116                                       Revised 9/15198
Reforms and Policy Document." The Handbook contains useful information regarding development
permit processing. According to Town staff, the most common reason for an increase in application
processing time, is the submittal of incomplete information by the applicant. The "Handbook" provides
specific information to help applicants submit complete applications, and thereby streamlines the
development application process.
All Town development applications contain an "Estimated Processing Time" section. Land division
applications are generally processed within 8-10 weeks and Site Plan Review applications such as second
dwelling unit permits can be processed in 6-8 weeks. If the pem1it is approved administratively, this
time-line can be shortened by two weeks. The Town has a "projects coordinator" who tracks
development applications through the various divisions within the Town's Community Development and
Public Works Departments to ensure timely processing of development applications. Development
application processing and tracking is not a constraint to the provision of housing.
In addition, to the Town's residential zoning districts, high density residential use is allowed in the C-C
[Community-Commercial] and C-S [Community-Services] zoning districts subject to site plan review.
A field survey conducted in spring, 1998, indicated vacant or underutilized properties within the C-C
and C-S zoning districts which may be utilized for affordable housing.'
Like other California cities, the Town of Paradise collects development impact fees for residential,
commercial and industrial development to finance public facilities and improvements which will be needed
to serve the new development Fees help finance road improvements, police and fire facilities and drainage
improvements (only in areas which require stormwater facilities). As required by State law, tbe impact fee
schedule was adopted ouly after a thorough analysis (nexus) study determined the collection of fees was
justified by the projected impact of development on essential public services and facilities. It is estimated
that impact fees per housing unit for the Town of Paradise range between $8000 and $10,000 (including
school fees). In comparison, the Town of Paradise impact fees are $2000 to $4000 less than neighboring
City of Chico. Impact fees for both of these jurisdictions are considered lower than fees collected in the
urbau areas of the state. Development impact fees are not a constraint to the provision of housing.
Although development processing fees do contribute to the total cost of development, and therefore
housing, the fees charged by the Town of Paradise are very modest in comparison to fees charged by
other cities and counties throughout the state. However, the town is not the only public agency which
imposes fees on new development. Impact and/or hookup fees are also charged by the Paradise Unified
School District, the Paradise Irrigation District, the Lime Saddle Community Services District, the state
(for review of environmental documents by the Department of Fish and Game), and the County of Butte.

By law, fees cannot exceed the cost of providing the particular facility or service for which they are
charged. A recent study completed for the town has revealed that for many years, the fees charged by
the Town of Paradise have not even recovered the cost to the town of providing facilities and services.
The town is in the process of updating its fee schedule to reflect a greater rate of recovery. Building
permit fees are as established by the currently adopted edition of the Uniform Building Code, and
charges are consistent with most cities and counties.
Building permit fees for residential construction vary depending upon the valuation of the project. Site
plan review permit and use permit fees for multi-family residential developments and other alternative
housing projects range from $225 to $750 depending upon the scale and intensity of the actual project.
However, discretionary review is not required in every zoning district for all residential projects.
The Town of Paradise does not have a comprehensive town wide development impact fee program that
would adversely impact housing projects. The Paradise Unified School District impact mitigation fee
program does have an exemption for housing development projects serving the elderly population, which
assists the town to promote and support this type of housing opportunity within the cormnunity.
Public Facilities and Services
As discussed elsewhere in this document, sewer and water service place significant constraints upon
existing and planned residential development in Paradise. Water service is provided by special districts
and is not currently under the town's control. Water service may not always be available at a particular
point in time or location in accordance with the town's timetable for growth and development. The
policies of the General Plan call for a feasibility study of consolidation and/or acquisition of these
districts by the town. The feasibility study on the consolidation or reorganization of the Town of
Paradise and Paradise Irrigation District which provides water service to most properties within the
jurisdiction of the Town, will be agendized for Town Council consideration as part of the annual budget
discussion. As noted above, the Town has no control of provision of water; bowever, Town officials
are taking the lead in opening the discussion for the potential funding for the feasibility study.
Even with construction of the proposed cormnunity collection sewer system, large areas of existing and
planned residential development will remain unsewered during the time frame of the plan. This
limitation was acknowledged by BCAG in the Regional Housing Allocation Plan, which adjusted the
town's share of regional housing needs under the assumption that the maximum amount of housing it can
accommodate is 1,350 dwelling units between 1991 and 1997. At the densities and minimum parcel
sizes necessary to properly accommodate new septic systems, the production of affordable housing
becomes problematic. However, the formation of an onsite wastewater maintenance district, in 1992,
and the implementation by town staff may lead to creative alternatives in terms of sewage disposal for
residential construction projects.

Nongovernmental Constraints
Nongovernmental constraints are those generated by the private sector which are beyond the control of
local government, as well as physical/environmental constraints. With respect to Paradise, these include
availability and cost of financing, price of land, construction costs, consumer preference, and
topography/soil suitability.
Availability and Cost of Financing
Interest rates for both construction and take-out financing probably have more impact on housing than
any other factor, at least in the short term. When interest rates are high, or financing is not generally
available, an increasing number of households cannot afford home ownership even if housing prices are
affordable. A 1992 analysis of the components of monthly housing cost for a median-priced single
family house costing $100,000, purchased with a ten percent down payment and financed at 8.5 percent
for thirty years, indicates that a $ 10, 000 reduction in land and development costs results in a ten percent
reduction in monthly payment, while a four percent increase in take-out financing interest rates results
in a thirty-eight percent increase in the monthly payment. In the Paradise area, the median sale price
of a three-bedroom home was $100,000 in 1991, and is $31,900 for a mobile home in a mobile home
park.
To mitigate the impact of high interest rates, when they occur, one of the few options available to local
government is to fmd a means of subsidizing those rates for the home buyer and/or developer. This has
been accomplished in the past primarily by the sale of mortgage revenue bonds, often coordinated at the
county level. This process has been complicated by changes in federal law and state caps on the amount
of bonds that can be issued statewide. State and federal mortgage subsidy programs are available at
various times to qualifying projects and developers. While mortgage interest rates are currently at their
lowest point in twenty years at the time this is written, the availability of construction and development
financing is very tight, primarily in response to savings and loan institution failures and foreclosed
development projects on the national level.
Financing for housing construction or rehabilitation loans is generally available. The securing of federal
entitlement city funding will greatly increase the availability of local funding programs for housing and
onsite sewage disposal rehabilitation projects."
While there are no definitive "blighted" or "slum" areas in the community, the land inventory program
has identified a number of both rental and owner occupied housing units and sewage disposal systems
in need of repair and rehabilitation. These areas have been targeted for low-interest rehabilitation loan
programs.

Price of Land
According to the California Building Industry Association, the cost of land represents an ever-increasing
proportion of the total housing development cost. In 1980, land cost represented approximately thirty
percent of the cost of a new home in California, but by the end of the decade that component accounted
for nearly thirty-five percent of the cost. In Butte County, land costs are still reasonable compared to
other, similar areas in California. In Paradise, the average cost of a one acre single family lot ranges
from $32,300 to $50,340. The average cost of a multiple family lot is difficult to estimate due to the
small number and unique characteristics of such lots. The low density (one acre) of a typical single
family lot and the scarcity of multiple family sites are attributable to the lack of a sewer system. The
policies of the General Plan and imminent construction of a sewer system will address these constraints
during the time frame of the Housing Element.
Measures available to local government to address land costs include the use of redevelopment funds to
write down land costs, and development of housing by a nonprofit corporation or the Housing Authority.
Use of surplus government-owned land for housing is an option not often available to a small town or
city, due to a general lack of suitable publicly-owned land. However, this option should be kept in mind
when such an opportunity occurs. Finally, attempting to stabilize or reduce land prices through
increasing the supply of available land can only be effective if a full range of public services and
facilities are available at a reasonable cost.
Cost of Construction
Rising costs of labor and materials have contributed to nongovernmental constraints on housing
development and improvement. These costs, plus energy costs, formed a substantial part of housing cost
increases during the 1970s, increasing by ten percent during that decade. Labor and materials costs
continued to increase during the 1980s. The cost of wood is expected to continue to increase due to
significant projected cutbacks in timber harvesting in the United States for environmental reasons. Labor
costs for publicly-constructed housing are higher than for privately-constructed housing due to the
requirement to pay prevailing wage rates, which in an area such as Butte County are significantly higher
than local wage rates.
The total cost to the local developer for housing project financing, materials, fees, and labor are not
considered significantly prohibitive in Paradise. Financing, materials and labor costs in the community
are similar, if not identical to other communities in Northern California. The development impact fees
are considerably less in Paradise than in other cities in Butte County.
Local governments can use Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds and redevelopment
funds to finance infrastructure improvements (e.g. water and sewer lines), which assist in lowering
housing costs. The town is considering applying for CDBG funds to assist with the construction of the
sewer system.

Consumer Preference
Part of the increase in housing costs in the 1980s has been due to consumer preference and lifestyle
expectations regarding dwelling unit size and amenities. All of these lifestyle choices have costs
associated with them. As housing costs and/or interest rates make detached single family dwellings less
affordable, alternatives such as smaller lots, smaller units, and attached housing become more
acceptable, but are still not the housing of choice for the majority of households. Local goverrunent can
assist in making a variety of housing types available through permitting higher densities, zero-lot-line
housing and smaller lots; only, however, if infrastructure permits.
Topography/Soil Suitability
The steeper slopes characteristic of the large canyons east and west of the town, and smaller canyons
to the south, limit residential densities and entirely preclude development of some areas. Grading
requirements on steeper slopes increase the cost of housing as well. In the Regional Housing Allocation
Plan, BCAG acknowledged this limitation and adjusted Paradise's share of the regional need
accordingly. Soil suitability for septic systems affects the minimum parcel size as well as septic system
installation and monitoring requirements, all of which impact the cost of housing.

    12.6 EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSlNG
             .ELEMENT
Pursuant to Section 65588 of the Government Code, the Town of Paradise has reviewed its 1985 Housing
Elemem and has evaluated the appropriateness of its housing goals, objectives, and policies in contributing
to the attainment of the state housing goal, the effectiveness of the Housing Element in attainment of the
town's housing goals and objectives, and the progress of the town in implementation of the Housing
Elemen!. The new Housing Element has been updated to reflect the results of this review.
Results of Previous Goals. Quantified Objectives. Policies and Programs
By definition, a goal is an" ... ideal future end, condition or state related to the public health, safety or
general welfare toward which planning and planning implementation 1neasures are directed.,. a goal is
generally not quantifiable, time-dependent or suggestive of specific actions for its achievement" (State of
California General Plan Guidelines, 1990). Thus, it is unlikely that the Town of Paradise can expect to
completely achieve the goals set forth in tl1e 1985 Housing Element. Nevertheless, the town has made
progress toward its goals, as described in this section and below in the review of the 1985 Housing Element
programs. The goals, wltich are consistent with state and uational housing goals to provide a decent home
and suitable living environment for every individual and family, have for the most part been incorporated
unchanged into this Housing Element update due to their continuing worthiness as an expression of
community values.
The General Plan Guidelines define a policy as a specific statement tliat guides decision making and which
indicates a clear commitment of tl1e local legislative body, the Town Council. A review of the policies
contained in the 1985 Housing Element indicates that the town intends to support and uphold some of the
adopted policies, which have been carried forward into the Housing Element Update (Volume I, Policy
Document, Section 6, Housing Element), along with newly drafted policies.
An objective is defined as a "... specific end condition or state that is an intermediate step toward attaining
a goal." With regard to the Housing Elemem, objectives must be quamified; that is, measurable and/or
time-specific. The quantified objectives contained in the 1985 Housing Elemen!, along with an estimate of
the actual results achieved during the planning period, are presented in Table 12-16.
Previous Housing Element Programs
The results of the program' contained in the town's 1985 Housing Element are summarized and reviewed
below on a prograrn-by-prograni basis.

•         6.42 Building Sites and Densities
          •          Allow residential and mixed development in commercial zanes, particularly dwellings in
                     upper stories.
                     Residential uses are permitted in the C-B (Central-Business) zone and the C-C
                     (Conununity-Commercial) zone with a use permit, to implement this program.
          •          Encourage creation of new building sites through demolition of dilapidated units and
                     assemblage of small parcels.
                     The town has established a demolition permit process and has also included lot merger
                     provisions in the recently-adopted subdivision ordinance to implement this program. In
                     addition, the town is actively considering establishment of a redevelopment agency and
                     preparation of a redevelopment plan, which would provide tools for assembling
                     properties for this purpose.
          •         Assist development of specific plans for residential densities, roads, drainage, utilities
                     and sewage disposal in the largely undeveloped ridgetops along the southern and western
                     edges of the town.
                     The town has completed studies and established impact/road improvement development
                     fees for the westside and southside areas, which will allow development to proceed in
                     those areas, and help to implement this program. The 1992 General Plan revision, of
                     which tl1is Housing Element is a part, designates areas for development and addresses the
                     issues outlined in this program.
•         6.43 Development and Construction
          •          Continue to review innovations and cost saving materials and techniques that will provide
                     the same quality construction at lower cost to the consumer.
                     The building permit review process which implements this program is ongoing. 111e
                     building division has reported moderate success in educating themselves and builders
                     about innovations and cost saving materials and techniques. Due to lack of staff and
                     budgetary constraints, full implementation has been delayed and success has been only
                     moderate.
          •          Require the first floors of the multi-family developments to accommodate access and use
                     by the elderly and handicapped.
                     This is currently required by the Town of Paradise, to implement this program.

          •           Continue to analyze setback requirements, lot design criteria, review procedures, parking
                      requirements, and street improvement standards and modify each of these where possible
                      to cut development costs.
                      This is an ongoing process in the Town of Paradise Community Development
                      Deparunent. Major revisions to the zoning ordinance were adopted in 1988 and 1992,
                      and amendments to the subdivision ordinance were adopted in 1990 and 1993, which
                      incorporated numerous changes in setback requirements, lot design criteria, review
                      procedures, parking requirements, and street improvement standards.
          •          Allow mobile homes in all residentially zoned areas of the town unless clearly
                      incompatible with existing development.
                      The zoning ordinance does not distinguish between conventional houses and mobile
                     homes on permanent foundations within rural residential and single family residential
                      zoning districts. In addition, the Paradise zoning ordinance includes a Mobile-Home
                      combining zone which permits the use of mobile homes not placed on a permanent
                      foundation as dwellings in the Rural Residential-3, Rural-Residential, Single-Family
                      Residential, Multiple-Family Residential, Multiple-Family/Professional, Rural
                      Residential-IO and Rural Residential-20 zones. Relative to other California cities and
                      towns, there is a high percentage of mobile homes in Paradise (22.6 percent of the single-
                      family housing stock).
          •           Limit condominium conversions to assure sufficient housing opportunities for renters.
                      The actions of the private market have li1nited the conversion of apartments to
                      condominiums without the need for intervention by town government to implement this
                      progra1n. Very few conversion requests have ever been submitted to the Community
                      Development Department.
•         6.45 Maintenance and Utilities
          •           Inspect housing upon complaints about health and safety problems and require
                      compliance with applicable codes.
                      Such inspections and co1npliance procedures are an ongoing function of the Town of
                      Paradise building division to implement this program.
          •           Initiate a program of periodic inspections of apartments and rest homes.
                      Due to a lack of staffing and budgetary resources, the town does not yet have a program
                      for performing periodic inspections of apartments and rest homes to determine
                      compliance with applicable codes. Residential care facilities must be licensed by the
                      state, and are periodically inspected by state officials as part of the licensing procedures.

          •         Require demolition of vacant dilapidated dwellings which are not economically feasible
                    to improve to code standards.
                     The town adopted an ordinance (Chapter 15.06.010 of the Paradise Municipal Code) in
                     1989 to implement this program.
          •          Require design of new residential development to minimize use of energy and water and
                     to maximize use of natural lighting, heating, and cooling process.
                     The Town of Paradise building division enforces building code requirements to
                     implement this program.
          •         Allow home occupations.
                     The Town of Paradise permits home occupations with the securing of a home occupation
                     permit in residential zones to implement this program.
          •          Require developers to pay the costs of new facilities and services needed for new
                     development.
                     This is currently the practice of the Town of Paradise with regard to new facilities.
                     although a recent management study has shown that not all costs are fully recovered by
                     town fees. While there are additional mecbanisms available to recoup the costs of
                     increased services (such as AB 1600 fees and assessment districts), implementation of
                     such fees would not advance the cause of increasing the supply of affordable housing in
                     the town.
•         6.46 Residential Environments
          •          Encourage retention of adult trees or replacement with adequate sized trees on all new
                     development sites.
                     The town has adopted a tree ordinance to implement this program. This ordinance is
                     further supported by the policies contained in the revised Conservation Element of the
                     General Plan. Implementation of this program results in lower energy (cooling) costs
                     for home occupants.
•         6.47       Housing Assistance Programs
          •          Assist development of a housing complex for the elderly, handicapped and disabled
                     through the Butte County Housing Authority by helping the authority select and acquire
                     a site and by placing a referendum on the ballot.

                      Due to a lack of staff and budgetary resources, the town has been unable to implement
                      this program. The hours of town staff were cut by ten percent in 1990 for budgetary
                      reasons.
          •           Support continuance and expansion of the Housing Authority's rental assistance program.
                      The town provides informal support for this Housing Authority program.
          •          Apply for CDBG jitnds (from HUD) to help finance a senior citizen's center, acquisition
                      of new housing sites, rehabilitation loans, construction of public facilities, and other
                      eligible activities.
                     The Town of Paradise submitted a CDBG application under the small cities program in
                      1989 for a housing rehabilitation program within a target area. It is the town's
                     understanding tbat this application was not competitive due to the town's relatively high
                      median income (in comparison to Butte County), the relatively good condition of the
                      housing stock, and perhaps also the lack of a comprehensive housing condition survey.
                      In 1989, the town initiated the process of evaluating its most serious community
                      development needs which would be eligible for funding. The town determined that one
                      of those needs was a rental housing survey. The town received a planning/technical
                      assistance allocation under the CDBG program to fund the survey work, with the
                      direction to prepare subsequent applications for state and federal funding to address needs
                      that are identified in the survey report.
                      Private projects tbat tl1e town has supported include the Heritage Convalescent Hospital,
                      a 100-bed facility located on upper Skyway.
          •           Support continuance of the Community Action Agency's weatherization program and
                      other housing-related programs.
                      The town provides informal support for Community Action Agency programs.
          •           Encourage local developers and nonprofit sponsors to use HUD-FHA programs to assist
                      comtruction of affordable housing, particularly for the elderly and those needing various
                      levels of daily care.
                      Due to lack of staff and budgetary resources, the town has been unable to devote the
                      resources that would be required to ilnplement this progra1n.
          •           Support continuance and local use of housing assistance programs provided by the
                       California Department of Housing and Community Development.

How the Updated Element Incorporates What Has Been Learned from the Previous Element
Several observations and conclusions can be drawn based on experience gained by the town in implementing
the previous Housing Element. First, it is reasonable to conclude that the town has accomplished more in
the quest for decent, affordable housing than if there had not been an adopted Housing Element during the
plauning period, simply by focusing attention on this issue. Secondly, it is fair to say that outside forces,
both governmental and nongovernmental, play a large role in the town's relative success or failure at
Housing Element implementation. This conclusion is particularly valid with regard to interest rates,
availability of financing, the private real estate market, and the commitment of state and federal funds to
housing programs. Third, it can also be concluded that, at the end of this planning period, the Town of
Paradise, and the Butte County region of which it is a part, remains one of the more affordable areas in the
state for housing.
With regard to program implementation, the town experienced its greatest difficulties in attempting to use,
or encourage private developers to use, state and federal housing subsidy programs. Part of this can be
attributed to a lack of interest on the part of private developers during a relatively healthy housing market,
and to a reduced commitment on the part of state and federal government funding of such programs. The
difficulties on the part of the town, however, can mostly be traced to a lack of staffing and budgetary
resources to enable existing town staff to have the necessary time and expertise to devote to implementation
of these programs and funding applications, many of which are quite complex. The entire planning division
staff consists of three persons who are responsible for all current and long range planning activities.
There are uuique physical characteristics of the Town of Paradise which also impact the provision of
affordable housing. In addition to the higher costs associated with development in a foothill community,
Paradise is the largest unsewered community in California, which lintits high density residential
development. These issues are discussed in more detail in Section 12.5 above.
This evaluation has been taken into consideration in the development of goals, quantified objectives, policies
and programs of the updated Housing Element, as set fortl1 in Volume I, Policy Document. Two programs
are proposed that, when implemented, will have a considerable impact on housing affordability over the
long term: construction of a community collection sewer system and establishment of a redevelopment
agency. These programs are explained in tl1e Policy Document referenced above.
Public Participation in the General Plan Revision Program
The revision of the housing element has proceeded in conjunction with the overall revision to the town's
 General Plan. The public participation process has included the formation of four citizen subcommittee
groups utilizing approximately eighty citizens from all segments of the community, ranging from high
school students to lawyers, painting contractors to retired corporate executives. The citizen subcommittee
groups have met routinely for two years, beginning in early 1991, brainstornting community issues, goals
 for the future and policies for reaching those goals.

Citizens have also had the opportunity to interact in the process during the regular meetings of the General
Plan Revision Steering Committee. While these meetings are not public hearings, citizens have been
encouraged to attend and discuss any aspect of the General Plan elements or revision program.
Town staff have also conducted an aggressive speaking tour throughout the community, discussing all
elements and aspects of the General Plan revision program with various civic organizations, special districts
and other interested groups. These speeches and workshops have provided a forum for many different
groups in the Paradise community to voice their concerns and visions for the future.
Public comment on the draft Housing Element was solicited through Planning Commission and Town
Council hearings and through the environmental review process for the element. Notices of these public
hearings were published, distributed to interested community organizations representing special needs, and
posted in govermnental buildings. Town residents will have an opportunity to participate in the
implementation of the Housing Element, as many of the implementation measures require the adoption of
ordinances or other specific actions at Planning Commission and Town Council meetings.
Through the means above, the town believes it has actively sought and pursued public participation and
public comments on all phases of the Housing Element revision, and has attempted to include all segments
of the community in its public participation process.
Consistency with Other General Plan Elements
The Housing Element was prepared in conjunction with the revision of the other General Plan elements.
Its sttongest relationship is with both the land use and circulation elements, where land use categories and
circulation patterns have been established to accommodate housing needs. In addition, it bonds with the
discussions of public facilities and infrastructure, in that only those areas deemed suitable for residential
develop1nent have been so designated.
The primary thrust of the revised Paradise General Plan is to ensure orderly growth and development
according to the town 1 s ability to provide adequate services and infrastructure, as well as to ensure long-
term preservation of the environmental and rural charm of the town. While the Housing Element
acknowledges the regional housing fair share numbers, and will attempt to meet them, it stays consistent
with the primary thrust of the plan by listing factors that must come together in order for the needed housing
to be constructed in the town.

Regional access to the Town of Paradise is provided via the Skyway from the southwest and State Route
191, a two lane rural highway, northerly from State Route 70. Near State Route 70, Route 191 carries
about 4,300 vehicles per day. In Paradise, just south of Pearson Road, State Route 191 carries about 8,600
vehicles. State Route 70 is a two-lane north/south highway connecting Sacramento, Marysville and Oroville
to the south of State Route 191 and Chico and Red Bluff to the north of State Route 191. South of State
Route 191, Route 70 carries about 7,100 vehicles while north toward Coal Canyon Road it carries about
3,400 vehicles (1989 Traffic Volumes of California State Highways, Caltrans).
In Paradise, the major mode of travel is by private automobile. The pedestrian system and bicycle systems
are not extensive. However, the Town of Paradise has provided the Paradise Memorial Trailway, a
pedestrian and bicycle path along segments of the abandoned Southern Pacific Railroad right-of-way
between Skyway and Clark Road. The pedestrian sidewalk system is very limited. This is due in part to
the desire of the community to maintain the rural character of the town. There are a number of roadways,
however, which carry high volumes of traffic, including Elliott Road, Skyway, Pentz Road, Clark Road and
Pearson Road. Paradise presently has about eighty-five miles of paved public roads and an estimated 280
miles of private, largely nonpaved roads.
Very limited use is made of public transit, rail or other non-automobile modes of travel. A transit needs
assessment was prepared by Butte County and Caltrans in 1979 and updated in May of 1993 which outlines
the needs of Paradise. More than twenty regional agencies provide some form of transportation services
in Paradise, including Butte County Transit, Greyhound bus, Butte College bus, Paradise Unified School
District, local taxi services and the Paradise Express. Paradise Express, the local transit service, is
operated by American Transportation Company under contract with the Town of Paradise. It provides
weekday service with four sedans and two lift-equipped vans. Butte County operates scheduled transit
service between Paradise and Oroville (on a limited basis), hourly daytime service between Paradise and
Chico, and a dial-a-ride system. The contract for this dial-a-ride service is administered by Butte County
Transit for the Town of Paradise.
The street system in Paradise is shown on Figure 13-1. The system is comprised of three major north/south
and four east/west arterial stt·eets. The north/south arterials include: Skyway, Clark Road (State Route 191
- south of Pearson Road) and Pentz Road. The east/west facilities include: Wagstaff Road, Bille Road,
Elliott Road and Pearson Road. Other arterial streets include: Sawmill Road, a north/south roadway
c01mecting Bille Road witl1 Pearson Road; Nulllleley Road, an east/west collector, between Elliott Road and
Pearson Road; and South, Middle and North Libby Roads; which are north/south facilities that intersect a
number of the east/west streets in Paradise.

Paradise is a rural community; therefore, the street syste1n does not include freeways or expressways. State
Route 191 is designated by Caltrans as a "conventional (no access) control" facility, a highway with no
control of access, which may or may not be divided or have grade separations at intersections. Within
Paradise the street system is comprised of arterial. collector and local residential streets. Street
classification is nsed to designate the various streets within a conununity including the design standards for
the street, street width, number of travel lanes, access control and other features. Arterial streets are
generally the wider streets and carry the major traffic volumes. Collector streets carry less traffic and
provide connections between adjacent Jand uses and the arterial street system. Collector streets do not
generally function as residential streets; however, collector streets can access residential land uses. In
Paradise, many of the collector streets serve residential uses. Local streets normally serve isolated or
s1naller residential areas.
The 1982 General Plan does not specifically classify street types. A field reconnaissance was conducted
in 1991 and the street system was observed in terms of traffic volume levels, roadway widths, access and
relationship to adjacent land uses. These factors were used to provide a preliminary designation for the
n1ajor and secondary streets in Paradise.
Arterial Streets
A class of street serving a major movement of traffic not served by a freeway or expressway. In addition,
arterials tend to accommodate through traffic such as trips between Paradise Pines and Chico or Paradise
Pines and Butte College. In Paradise the following streets operate as arterial roadways:
                      North/South Arterials                          Easf/West Arterials

Collector Streets
Surface streets providing land access and traffic circulation service for residential, conunercial and
industrial areas. In Paradise the following streets operate as collector roadways:

Local Streets
Surface streets providing land access and traffic circulation service within residential areas. The remaining
streets within Paradise, non-arterial and collector streets, could be designated as local streets. In Paradise,
there are many streets which are private or do not provide linkages with adjacent collector or arterial
streets. Numerous streets have been allowed to be constructed which do not provide connectivity within
the street system.
The Arterial System
The Town of Paradise has seven major arterials. Each of these facilities is discussed below. Consideration
is given to describing the number of travel lanes, signalization, adjacent land uses and levels of service.
Average daily traffic volumes have been measured along numerous segments of the street system. Butte
Collllty compiled counts from 1955 lllltil 1977. The Town of Paradise counted an extensive number of local
intersectiorts during 1989 as part of the development by Butte Collllty of the Paradise traffic model. Table
13-1 indicates the average daily traffic volumes on the major streets in Paradise. Table 13-1 also includes
historical data along many of the local streets.

•         Clark Road (State Road 191). Clark Road is a four-lane roadway with a central two-way left
          tum lane from Pearson Road to Wagstaff Road. Clark Road carries between 9,000 and 25,000
          daily trips. North of Wagstaff Road, Clark Road is two lanes carrying about 17,000 trips with
          stop sign controls at most local intersections. Clark Road intersects Skyway at its northern
          terminus. Clark Road at Skyway is stop sign controlled with the movements along Clark Road
          controlled.
          Many of the intersections along Clark Road are signalized with left turn lanes. No onstreet
          parking is allowed along most of the length of Clark Road. The major intersections along Clark
          Road include: Pearson Road, Elliott Road, Bille Road, Wagstaff and Skyway. Local collector
          intersections are provided at Buschmann Road, Nunneley Road, and Central Park Drive.
          Between 1982 and 1989 traffic volumes along Clark Road have doubled. Generally, the growtl1
          has occurred north of Pearson Road. However, traffic levels have also increased markedly to the
          south of Pearson Road. TI1e intersections along Clark Road operate at generally acceptable levels
          of service during peak hours.
•         Skyway. Skyway is a four-lane roadway with a central two-way left turn lane from Pearson Road
          to Wagstaff Road and carries between 11,000 and 21,000 daily trips. North of Wagstaff Road,
          Skyway is two lanes with stop sign controls at most local intersections. Many of the major
          intersections along Skyway are signalized with left tum lanes. The significant intersections along
          Skyway include: Neal Road, Pearson Road, Elliott Road, Oliver Road, Maxwell Drive, Bille
          Road, Wagstaff Road, Rocky Lane, Clark Road and Pentz Road.
          Between 1982 and 1989 traffic volumes along Skyway have increased substantially. Generally,
          the growth has occurred the entire length of Skyway. The intersections along Skyway between
          Elliott Road and Bille Road operate at generally acceptable levels of service during peak hours.
          South of Elliott Road and nortl1 of Bille Road peak hour levels of service are worse. Peak hour
          conditions at Clark Road and Wagstaff in the north and at Honey Run Road and Neal Road in the
          south are at or approaching unacceptable levels.
•         Pentz Road. Pentz Road is a two-lane arterial which extends from the southern town limits to
          Skyway. Pentz Road carries about 7 ,000 trips per day. Most of the intersections along Pentz
          Road are stop sign controlled, with the stop control on the streets intersecting with Pentz Road.
          TI1e intersections of Wagstaff Road and Pentz Road and Bille Road and Pentz Road are all-stop.
          Traffic volumes along Pentz Road have increased about fifty percent since 1982. The levels of
          service along Pentz Road are acceptable.
•         Pearson Road. Pearson Road is the most southerly arterial in Paradise and carries about 1,000
          daily trips. It extends from Skyway to Pentz Road. Between Skyway and Clark Road it is a four-
          lane facility. Stop sign controls are provided at many intersections with four-way stops at Black
          Olive Drive and Recreation Drive. East of Clark Road, Pearson Road is a two-lane facility.
          Pearson Road is the last roadway in the southern portion of the town that provides continuous

          east/west access between Pentz Road and Skyway. South of Pearson Road. many of the
          residential areas must use north/south arterial and collector streets to access Pearson Road.
•         Remaining Arterial Streets. The remaining arterial streets are all two-lane facilities with traffic
          controls at most of the north/south arterial intersections. Bille Road and Wagstaff Road provide
          continuous east/west connections between Skyway and Pentz Road. Elliott Road provides
          connections between the area west of Skyway and just east of Sawmill Road. Nunneley Road
          extends east/west from Academy Drive (on the west) to Oak Creek Drive (on the east).
The Collector Svstem
There are many collector stteets in Paradise. The designation of collector and local street can be misleading
when used in Paradise. Collector streetq tend to provide the linkages between segments of the arterial street
system while local streets serve immediate residential or other isolated land uses. Using this concept. the
connection of Forest Service Road and Moore Road provides a collector linkage between Skyway and Clark
Road north of Wagstaff Road. Within the Town of Paradise roadway system, there are some missing
linkages in the collector street system. These include:
•         The connection of Young Avenue to Bille Road over public streets.
•         The easterly extension of Elliott Road to Kibler Road.
•         The westerly extension of Buschmann Road to Skyway.
•         The westerly extension of Anchor Way to Clark Road at Noffsinger Lane or alternative
          intersection.
•         The connection of South Libby Road and Edgewood Lane.
•         The connection of Pinewood Drive and Honey Run Road.
Other similar situations may occur elsewhere in Paradise. New collector road connections, and the standard
of design they should provide, need to be identified. The levels of service within the collector street system
are acceptable. There are some locations where stop sign controls and pedestrian facilities may be
warranted (e.g., along Maxwell Road near the high school).
The Local Street System
The local street system is composed of numerous public and private roadways throughout Paradise. The
system appears to be based upon individual infill developments and subdivision activities rather than a
comprehensive townwide circulation plan. Most streets serve a limited number of land uses, primarily
residential. Further, the street standards vary substantially from area to area. The minimum allowable
street width appears to be sixteen feet established in the 1982 General Plan for fire access. The minimum
street width standard is twenty feet.

As traffic grows in Paradise, the potential for increased concentrations of traffic along existing collector and
arterial streets will grow as well. Without an improved collector and local street system of interlinked
roadways, the potential for required widening of the existing collector and local street system to be required
will increase.

    13.2 EXISTING LEVELS OJ? SERVICE
Level of service is determined differently for signalized and unsignalized intersections. For signalized
ll1tersections, a percentage of capacity is calculated which results in a specific overall intersection level of
service. For unsignalized intersections, an amount of reserved capacity for each movement is calculated.
The lowest amount of reserved capacity is used to determine the intersection level of service. It should be
noted that for unsignal:ized intersections, son1e movements may experience acceptable levels of service while
others inay not. For this assessment, the level of service for the worst case traffic movement on each
approach is shown. For example, a level of service shown as "A/A/D/E" would mean tl1at the level of
service for the north and southbound approaches is "A" while the level of service for the eastbound
approach is "D" and the westbound approach "E."
TI1e level of service (LOS) rating system of LOS A through LOS F is used to indicate the average level of
traffic utilization of an intersection. LOS A indicates little or no congestion and LOS F indicates severe
congestion. Tue 1982 General Plan does not appear to establish a specific standard for acceptable level of
service. In general, most rural communities use level of service "C" for a standard. Table 13-2 describes
the various level of service categories and intersection performance characteristics for signalized
intersections. For the unsignalized intersections, the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual was used to determine
level of service (Table 13-3). The Butte County Congestion Management Program has adopted a level of
service (LOS) standard "D" for the principal arterial road system in Paradise.
Using the existing peak hour data provided by the Town of Paradise, the existing peak hour levels of service
were determined at a number of intersections. Table 13-4 details the peak hour levels of service. For the
unsignalized intersections, the level of service by approach together with the reserved capacity for the worst
case traffic movement are noted. For consistency, the order of the results is northbound, southbound,
eastbound and westbound. In other words, a LOS result shown in the various tables within this report noted
as "A/A/BIB" would mean LOS "A" for the northbound and southbound approaches and LOS "B" for the
eastbound and westbound approaches. Furtl1er, a"-" is used when a particular approach and/or left turn
movement does not exist. For example, a "T" intersection such as Skyway and Clark Road would show
the existing worst case level of service of "D" and the various approach levels of service as "A/Al-ID."
Level of Service Evaluation
Most of the intersections in Paradise operate at acceptable levels of service. Of the twenty-eight
intersections evaluated, twelve were signalized and sixteen unsignalized. The results of the LOS analysis
are discussed below.

Along Skyway, the signalized intersections at Wagstaff Road and Pearson Road operate at LOS "D" and
"C" respectively. All of the signalized intersections along Clark Road operate at LOS "B" or better.
For the unsignalized locations, many of the intersections operate at unacceptable levels of service.
Specifically, Skyway at Clark Road operates at LOS "D." Skyway at Honey Run Road and Neal Road both
operate LOS "E." Pearson Road at Scottwood Road operates at LOS "D" while Elliott Road at Maxwell
Drive operates at LOS "E." The remaining intersections operate at LOS "C" or better. The locations that
operate at LOS "C" include: Skyway at Pentz Road, Clark Road at Buschmann Road, Pentz Road at
Wagstaff Road, and Sawmill Road at Pearson Road.

    13;3 PARKING
As part of the 1982 General Plan, a parking inventory was conducted. TI1e general policy since 1982 has
been to restrict parking to offstreet areas and not develop additional onstreet parking spaces. As part of the
current General Plan, the towu's current offstreet parking standards will be reviewed and warranted changes
to these standards will be recommended.

    13.4 TRUCK ROUTES
Traffic safety smdies conducted in 1982 reconnnended the designation of specific routes for truck traffic.
Consideration of appropriate truck routes within Paradise should be based on several factors, including:
the location of businesses served by large trucks, the origin and destination of logging trucks, and tl1e
location of exclusively residential areas.
Given fue location of existing connnercial development along Skyway, Pearson Road and Clark Road, fue
following routes were reconnnended as truck facilities (see Figure 13-2).
•          Skyway from fue south town limit to the norfu town limit.
•          Clark Road from the south town limit to Skyway.
•          Pearson Road from Skyway to Pentz Road.
•          Pentz Road south of Pearson Road to the town limit.

    13.5 THE PARADISE AREA                                           TRANSPORTATION
               PLANNING MODEL
Butte County, with the assistance of a professional traffic consnlting firm, has recently completed a traffic
model for the Paradise area. The model was calibrated to 1989 conditions and includes the Town of
Paradise, the communities of Magalia and Paradise Pines and the area south of Paradise to Route 70.
External traffic zones include Chico, Route 99 south, Route 70 south and Route 70 east from Pentz Road.
The model was reviewed for use during the General Plan to evaluate future land use conditions. In general,
the model appears to be adequately calibrated for application in the General Plan process. To date, three
land use conditions have been modelled and analyzed. These include: the existing conditions, a five-year
build out of the study area and a twenty-year build out of the study area. The build out land use intensities
assumed that no major expansion of the existing sewage disposal system would occur. Therefore, the
growth in single and multiple family dwelling units for the five-year period was restricted to 2,371 units.
The twenty-year growth scenario provided 1,259 additional uuits. The existing conditions include about
14,750 single family and 777 multiple family units. Further, 3,681,600 square feet of nonresidential land
use was included in the model.

     14;0 PUBLIC SERVICES AND UTILITIES
     14;1 LAW ENFORCEMENT
The Paradise Police Department has provided law enforcement for the Town of Paradise since 1980, when
it took over Jaw enforcement responsibility for the area from the Butte County Sheriff's Department. The
police station is located at 5595 Black Olive Drive, adjacent to the main fire station. Dispatching of police,
fire and ambulance units is done by the town. The departtnent maintains a mutual aid agreement with the
Sheriff's Department. As of March 1991, there were twenty-two sworn personnel and one reserve officer
who patrol two beats. The current ratio of sworn personnel to population is one of the lowest in the state
(approximately one officer per 1,200 citizens). According to the state Departtnent of Justice, the statewide
average in 1989 was approximately one officer for 500 citizens, while the City of Chico maintains one
officer for approximately 650 citizens. The department's typical response time for routine calls is four to
five minutes.
Although the town's higher percentage of senior citizens contributes to a lower than average crime rate, the
absolute number of calls and residents' expectations of service are relatively high. The manufacture and
sale of narcotics poses a problem due to the town's remoteness and the difficulty of observing individual
properties because of the hilly and forested terrain.
Law enforcement in the unincorporated area surrounding the town is the responsibility of the Butte County
Sheriff's Department, and is provided out of a substation in Paradise Pines. Coroner's service is provided
throughout the county by the Sheriff's Department. The California Highway Patrol polices State
Highway 191 out of their Chico and Oroville substations.

     14.2 FIRE PROTECTION
The Paradise Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency services within the town limits and
has a mutual aid agreement with the Butte County Fire Department. The department's service area includes
all lands within the town limits. Upon incorporation of the Town of Paradise, the Paradise Fire Protection
District was dissolved.
The department presently operates out of three fire stations, each with a designated response zone.
Station I is located at 767 Birch Street, adjacent to the police station. The other two stations are located
at the intersection of Wagstaff Road and Harvey Road, and at the intersection of Pearson Road/Newland
Road and South Libby Road. As of March 1991, the department has twenty-seven authorized positions and
twenty-one volunteers. The Police Chief is currently the acting Fire Chief, and has assumed the position
of town Public Services Director. The department's average response time is two to two-and-one-half
minutes.
The town Police Department dispatches ambulances and fire units in response to medical emergencies.
Ambulance service is provided by Paradise Ambulance Service, a private service supervised by the Feather
River Hospital Emergency Room. Both the ambulance and the fire units are staffed by paramedics.
The Town Council has considered contracting with the California Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection (CDF) for fire protection services, rather than operating its own department, as a cost-saving
measure. Fire Department employees would have become CDF employees if the Council had approved
the contract arrangement. However, the Council has decided to maintain the Fire Department at this time.
Fire hydrants are owned by the town and maintained by the Paradise Irrigation District. Butte County,
which contracts with CDF, provides fire protection services in the unincorporated portions of the study
area. The county operates two fire stations in the study area, one in the Town of Paradise and one in
Magalia.
Wildland Fire Potential and High Fire Risk Areas
Large areas within the Town of Paradise, as well as the secondary and tertiary study area, are subject to
wildland fire potential. Typically, such areas pose a substantial fire risk to dwellings and other structures,
as evidenced by the recent 49er fire in Placer and Nevada Counties, and the even more recent Oakland Hills
disaster. Clearly, such areas pose great risk when people choose to live in them in large numbers. Despite
this risk, such areas are typically viewed as attractive places to reside. It is important that fire risk and
planning for fire safety play an important role when considering residential development in such areas. The
Multihazard Disaster Plan has identified areas of particular concern for wildland fire:

•          West side of lower Skyway
•          Butte Creek Canyon
•          West Branch Canyon

•          Hamlin Canyon
•          Berry Creek Canyon
•          Little Clear Creek Canyon
•          Clear Creek Canyon
•          Horse Thief Canyon
•          Dry Creek Canyon
Fire hazard severity zones have been mapped for the state responsibility area (SRA) around the Town of
Paradise (see Figure 14-1). All of the secondary study area, and most of the tertiary study area, are within
areas rated "high" or "very high." Fire hazard severity zones are intended to show relatively homogeneous
areas and are based on fuel loading, slope, fire weather and other factors. The state Board of Forestry has
adopted fire safety regulations which apply to the SRA and which require certain minimum fire safety
measures within tl1ese areas. Outside the SRA, risks are more typical in nature and do not pose any unusual
constraints to development, assuming that adequate fire service is in place and that standards for
development take fire safety into consideration.
According to the Paradise Multihazard Disaster Plan, the possibility of major urban fires exists primarily
witllin the built up areas of the downtown commercial areas of Paradise. This would pose major problems
in the event that evacuation is necessary. All of these structures present a variety in type of construction,
occupant load and fire potential.
Peakload Water Supnly Requirements
In order to bave effective fire suppression capability, it is necessary to bave an adequate and reliable supply
of water. As shown on Figure 14-3, the Town of Paradise and all but the most northerly portion of the
secondary study area are served by one of the water districts or companies described in Section 14.8 below.
Generally speaking, these systems have adequate line size and hydrants for fire suppression purposes;
however, fire flow quantity may vary considerably from area to area, depending on the immediate water
main size. The town's Fire Department has identified various fire flow deficiencies in the community.
Water must be pumped to portions of the service area at higher elevations. The capital improvement
program for the Paradise Irrigation District includes an accelerated pipeline replacement program to correct
existing inadequacies, as described in Section 14.8 below.
According to the Paradise Multihazard Disaster Plan, municipal water systems are able to support large
fire flows in the commercial areas, but not in the wildlands. The town is served by a forty-two inch PID
water main. If ruptured, the town has approximately a one-day reserve; however, drought conditions would
seriously disrupt these capabilities.
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                           151                                               1994

The town currently requires that each lot or unit within a subdivision have adequate water for domestic use.
However, the subdivision ordinance does not require hookup to an existing system, and does not establish
fire flow standards.
In the unincorporated area of Butte County, the type and size of the project dictates the county Fire
Department requirements for water, as established in the Butte County improvement standards.
Requirements range from a pressurized water system to a static water supply system. The county 1 s fire
flow requirements are included in the improvement standards and vary by lot density.
In addition to town or county standards for new systems, the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC)
establishes minimmn standards for systems not operated by a public entity. These standards are found in
PUC General Order 103 and also apply to existing systems that may not meet current requirements;
however, compliance is only required when new hookups, tnodifications or extensions of systems are
proposed.
Road Widths and Access
The Town of Paradise subdivision ordinance requires all access easements or rights-of-way to be fifty feet
in width, except for those which serve four or fewer lots. However, subdivision applicants n1ay request
widths of less than fifty feet for privately maintained roads. They must connect, via private roads if
necessary, with a publicly-maintained street. Maximum cul-de-sac length is 1,800 feet.

     14.3 SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL
Solid waste collection and disposal in the Town of Paradise is provided by four independent haulers and is
not 1nandatory. Recycling services are provided through various sources, both by private co1mnercia1
haulers, nonprofit organizations and independent for profit recyclers. Yard waste is commonly disposed
of by burning, and some residents dispose of their own refuse by hauling it to the landfill on an individual
basis. Paradise generates approximately 30,398 tons per year of residential and industrial waste
(Preliminary Draft Source Reduction and Recycling Elements, 1991).
The Neal Road Landfill, the only landfill for disposal of municipal waste in Butte County, is located on the
north side of Neal Road, within the tertiary study area, and is operated by the Neal Road Landfill Company.
It is a Class 3 landfill (no hazardous materials) and is anticipated to reach capacity by mid 1999. A new
county disposal facility will need to be developed to meet the disposal needs of the county. The City of
Chico has the only permitted composting facility in the Butte County area, and the cities of Chico and
Oroville have significant recycling operations including redemption and drop off centers, commercial
collection and wood waste processors.
AB 939, the Solid Waste Management Act of 1989, established the requirement for every city and county
in the state to develop comprehensive plans for the implementation of programs and policies to reduce,
recycle or otherwise divert from landfill disposal twenty-five percent of the solid waste stream by 1995 and
fifty percent by 2000. These plans include the city and county Source Reduction and Recycling Elements
and Household Hazardous Waste Elements as well as a countywide Siting Element. All of these elements
are to be incorporated into a countywide Integrated Waste Management Plan by January 1, 1994.
The town is currently considering revisions to its solid waste management ordinances that would establish
a town-wide roadside (curbside) recycling program, a chipping/composting program and mandatory solid
waste collection for the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. The Source Reduction and Recycling
Elements call for the establishment of a centralized permitted composting facility to be developed in Butte
County by 1995. The actual siting for tlris proposed facility is not yet determined. The Household
Hazardous Waste Element calls for the development of a household hazardous waste drop off center within
three years. A permanent household hazardous waste collection facility is proposed to be developed by
Paradise Solid Waste Systems, Inc., a private local company, at their facility to serve the needs of the town.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company provides electricity in the study area and natural gas within the town and
some outlying areas. Two high voltage electrical transmission lines cross the tertiary study area, near
Highway 99. Electrical energy comes from a variety of sources and Pacific Gas and Electric Company
foresees no problems in meeting future demand. Telephone service is provided to the study area by Pacific
Bell. Propane is utilized for heating in some areas outside the town limits.

    14.5 BEALTIJ SERVICES
Tue Town of Paradise is well-served with doctors, other medical practitioners and facilities. Feather River
Hospital, a private hospital, is the largest employer in the Town of Paradise. It provides general acute-care
service in a 109-bed facility located at 5974 Pentz Road. The hospital offers cardiopulmonary services,
intensive coronary care, maternity care, surgical services and twenty-four hour emergency treatment. In
addition, the hospital's discharge plauning and social services department provides senior and support
services for patients. Hospital expansion plans include the obstetrical unit, enlarging the operating room
and additional beds for outpatient services.
Other facilities offering treatment in the Paradise area include:
•          Alcohol and Chemical Recovery Program
•          Feather River Home Health Agency

The Paradise Unified School District (PUSD) provides public elementary and secondary education wifuin
1he Town of Paradise, norfu to 1he Tehama and Plumas County boundaries, and within the secondary study
area boundaries (please refer to Figure 14-2). The tertiary study area is served by 1he Chico Unified School
District and 1he Durham Unified School District.
PUSD operates four elementary schools, one intermediate school, and two high schools. Two of 1he
elementaty schools (Paradise Elementary and Ponderosa Elementary), Paradise Intermediate and Paradise
High School are located within 1he Town of Paradise. According to a Site Selection Study for a new
elementary school prepared for PUSD in October 1989, enrollment at each of 1he elementary schools, with
the exception of Brakebill Elementary (located in Stirling City), exceeded capacity. A more recent study,
Facility Needs and Funding Analysis (March 1991), indicates 1hat Pines Elementary is at capacity (see
Table 14-1). Wifu Paradise Elementary on year-round education (YRE), its capacity exceeds its current
enrollment. Enrollment exceeds capacity at Paradise Intermediate School, but additional capacity exists at
Paradise High School.
As stated in the Site Selection Stuily, "The rate of enrollment and the net increase in number of students has
increased district-wide 1hrough the late 1980s. For grades K-6, enrollment has increased at an average
annual rate of 5.87 percent from 1985-89. This growth rate is likely to continue furough the 1990s." The
study further states that " ... enrollment is roughly proportional by grade, however, there is a slightly higher
percentage of students in elementary school and most notably in kindergarten," which implies 1hat the
growth trend will continue. Please refer to Table 14-2 for district enrollment, 1978-79 through 1990. The
1991 study reports that the district has been experiencing enrollment growth of approximately 3.5 percent
annually; however, as is indicated in the table, the actual change varies from year to year. Although some
years have shown decreases, 1he average rate of increase from 1986-87 1hrough 1990-91 was 3.29 percent.
One of the two elementary schools located in the town, Paradise Elementary, currently operates on a year-
round schedule, and Ponderosa Elementary is proposed for a year-round schedule in 1991-92. The district
owns another school site in the Upper Ridge, and plans to build a new school as soon as possible (probably
a middle school). The district collects developer impact fees from building permit applications to apply to
land acquisition and new construction costs.

In 1981, the district adopted the following criteria to guide planning for new sites and buildings:
•           educational needs of students
•           proximity of students to school plants
•           safety of students
•           ages of students served
•           nature of the educational program
•           racial and ethnic balance
In addition to these criteria, the following criteria were used in the 1989 Site Selection Study:
•           proximity to centers of growth
•           site accessibility
•           site topography
•           adjacent residential development
•           land size, minimum of eight-ten acres, single parcel
•           opportunity for joint use
•           possible hazards - power lines, gas transmission lines, water hazards
•           available services
The study area is located within the Butte Community College District, and Butte College is located along
Highway 191 within the tertiary study area. The college has recently prepared a preliminary ten-year plan
which includes new construction on the campus and a permanent Chico center. Proposed new on-campus
facilities include new classroom and office buildings, an expanded tutoring center, a child care center and
a "little theater."

    14.7. PARKS AND RECREATION
Parks and recreation services are provided by the Paradise Recreation and Park District, a special district
established in 1948. The district encompasses 169 square miles, including the Upper and Lower Ridge and
the Town of Paradise. The district boundaries extend beyond the General Plan study area. The district,
as well as other entities own, operate and maintain the facilities described in Table 14-3 containing
approximately 415 acres. The district also operates numerous recreational services including programs for
senior citizens, adult sports, teens, youth and children's programs and aquatics.
The district receives revenues from property taxes, impact fees ("Quimby" fees, which are imposed upon
all subdivision and parcel maps) required by the Town of Paradise, fees for recreational programs, and
grants (primarily from state park bond funds). The town subdivision ordinance requires that, as a condition
of approval of a final subdivision or parcel map, the subdivider must dedicate land, pay an in-lieu fee, or
both, at the option of the town and the recreation and park district, based on the formula contained in the
ordinance. The ordinance is based upon a standard of three acres of park land per 1,000 population. The
draft Butte County Energy, Natural Resources and Recreation Element proposes to establish Quimby fees
in the unincorporated area.
The district operates several facilities in cooperation with the Paradise Unified School District, and makes
facilities such as the swimming pool available for use by the schools. Current recreation and park district
projects include improvements to Paul Byrne Park and Bille Park. Some of the identified recreational needs
include a second pool, two additional lighted softball diamonds and additional soccer practice and play
fields. In addition to providing youth activities, the district is also one of the largest employers of youth
in the community.
State and federal parks and facilities are also used by residents of the study area. These facilities are listed
in Table 144. In addition to the parks and facilities listed in Tables 14-3 and 14-4, there are a number of
public and private trails which are used by the public for walking, jogging, bicycle and horseback riding.
These trails are listed in Table 14-5.

    14~8       WATERSERVICE
The primary and secondary study areas are served by two water purveyors: Paradise Irrigation District and
Del Oro Water Company. Of these, Paradise Irrigation District is the major supplier, with approximately
9,802 service connections serving about ninety-five percent of the incorporated town. Del Oro Water
Company serves Paradise Pines district, a large unincorporated, rural residential community immediately
north of Paradise, with a population of approximately 9,000, and Magalia District (a county water district
recently acquired by the Del Oro Water Company), serving about 400 acres between Paradise Pines and
the Town of Paradise, and providing water to approximately 300 households and fifteen businesses. It also
serves the Lime Saddle District, 2,750 acres extending south from the Town of Paradise to Lake Oroville.
  A small urbanized area of the Lime Saddle District has been annexed to the Town of Paradise; it is an
urbanizing district with planned service to more than 1,000 homes (see Figure 14-3 for water purveyor
boundaries).
Paradise Irrigation District
TI1e district obtains its water from a series of two reservoirs on Little Butte Creek (Magalia Reservoir and
Paradise Reservoir). The reservoir system has a storage capacity of 14,140 acre feet, and the firm annual
yield is calculated at 7 ,860 acre feet. Water is transported to the town through a single transmission line.
Distribution lines, booster pumps and surface-level tank reservoirs serve various pressure zones throughout
the town. Calculated per capita water usage has varied since 1980 from 245 to 289 gallons per day.
The Paradise Irrigation District staff indicates that the district must, subject to voter financing approvals,
undertake three major steps to enable its functions - water supply and distribution to keep pace with
anticipated growth:
 •         Add, by June of 1993, filtration capacity to enable the district to meet revised federal and state
           water quality standards. The district can currently provide filtration treatment for six million
            gallons per day, and is proposing to expand that capacity to twenty-five million gallons per day.
 •          Supplement its existing surface water supply, deemed by the district to be sufficient to serve
            community growth to 1996, by adding reservoir capacity, developing a supplementary
            groundwater source, purchasing surface water, or any combination of these options.
 •          Replace a significant percentage of the older portion of its 180 mile distribution system, to both
            ilnprove fire protection to existing developed areas and allow new development in accord with
            modem fire protection requirements.

Del Oro Water Company
The Del Oro Water Company's Paradise Pines and Magalia service areas have relevance to the Town of
Paradise water planning program only if the areas were to be aimexed to the town or if their water supply
sources conflicted with proposed additional water supplies essential to maintain town growth.
The Lime Saddle service area's water system planning is of greater relevance. It is evident that continued
urban growth in the area may significantly impact community resources from a planning standpoint, and
there is potential for further annexation to the town of new subdivisions in the area. Del Oro Water
Company has recently undertaken t11e legal and physical steps essential to obtain a supplemental water
supply from Lake Oroville to serve further plaimed urban development in the Lime Saddle area.

    14.9 WASTEWATER
The Town of Paradise is the largest unsewered incorporated community in California. Wastewater
treatment facilities within the town consist of individual privately owned septic tanks and soil absorption
disposal systems known as leach fields, together with several engineered subsurface disposal systems
serving commercial and institutional facilities. In anticipation of an eventual need for centralized
wastewater management facilities, portions of a future sanitary sewer system have been constructed along
the Skyway. However, there are no existing connections to the system. Businesses and residences in the
vicinity of the furore sewer system continue to rely on septic tank/leach field systems for wastewater
treatment and disposal.
The typical residential septic system installation in Paradise consists of a two-chambered septic tank,
measuring approximately 1,000 gallons in volume, connected to about 150 feet of leach field piping. Within
the septic tank, heavy solids settle and decompose, leading to the formation of a sludge blanket which must
be periodically removed. Grease and other floatables are trapped in a scum layer which forms behind the
baffles. In a properly designed, well maintained, septic tank forty to seventy-five percent of the total soluble
solids (TSS) and twenty-five to sixty percent of the biological oxygen demand (BOD) are removed.
However, septic tank effluent still contains large quantities of pathogenic microorganisms and nutrients.
Effluent from the septic tank enters the leach field where physical, chentical and biological processes within
the soil provide further treatment and disposal of the wastewater.
The Town of Paradise authorized several studies, commencing in 1981, to exantine the integrity of existing
individual wastewater collection and disposal systems (septic tank and leach field design), the extent and
degree of water quality degradation and the various alternatives for development of an integrated community
wastewater collection, treatment and disposal system. These studies are listed below:

The Town of Paradise contracted with Kennedy/Jenks/Chilton Consulting Engineers to prepare a feasibility
study to examine the formation of a central area wastewater assessment district for wastewater collection,
treatment and disposal. Tilis study recommended the formation of an assessment district to fund the design
and construction of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal facilities.
Current Status
A wastewater design assessment district was formed to finance steps preliminary to construction of a
wastewater collection, treatment and disposal facility, including but not linlited to enviroutnental impact
reports, feasibility studies, engineering plans, cost estimates, legal expenses, the acquisition of easements
and rights-of-way. The district withstood a legal challenge and hired a project manager and a consulting
engineering firm.
Previous engineering studies have recommended a bifurcated system, with the commercial core of the
community being served by a formal centralized collection, treaunent and disposal facility, while the balance
(the predonlinantly residential portion of the community) is to re1nain on septic systems with an onsite
wastewater management district to monitor and manage the individual systems.
The plan envisioned a formal sewerage system serving the high wastewater flow areas of the town,
including the commercial and multifanlily areas, together with the industrial area and other areas with poor
soil characteristics. The success of the program is believed to be founded upon the ability to operate an
onsite wastewater management district that will care for existing systems, with nlinimal alterations, for the
foreseeable future.       The onsite district was formed townwide in May 1992 and has become a town
function. The stated purpose of the onsite wastewater maintenance district (zone) is to protect the public
health and safety, protect surface and subsurface water quality, conserve water and to nlininlize the rate and
tax expense of the community. The district is intended to accomplish the following tasks:
•          Oversee the periodic inspection of all onsite wastewater disposal systems within the zone.
•          Provide continuing educational programs for the users of all onsite wastewater disposal systems
           relating to the proper use, maintenance and repair of said systems.
•          Provide reviews and approvals of all repairs and alterations to the existing systems in accordance
           with the town adopted design guideline manual.
•          Provide reviews and approvals for all new onsite wastewater disposal systems that may be
           installed within the zone in accordance with the town adopted design guideline manual.
 •         Maintain a water quality monitoring program that will detect any changes in the water quality of
           the community.

•           Initiate remedial actions as may be necessary to assure the protection of the public health and
            safety and to assure a nondegregation of the community water quality.
The onsite district contains three or more zones, ranging from a zone requiring only simple onsite suitability
determinations, to areas with high flow and/or marginal onsite suitability determinations. The latter areas
may require community leach fields or other unique solutions.
In May of 1992 the town formally adopted the manual for the onsite treattnent of wastewater intended to
facilitate the orderly development of wastewater management within the district (zone). It provides technical
guidance for siting, design, con'itruction and inspection of onsite wastewater treatment and disposal systems.
Approved procedures, design and siting criteria, materials, methods, administrative policies and enabling
legislation are described in detail in the manual.
After an advisory measure for a limited community collection sewer system was defeated by Paradise voters
in November of 1992, the Town Council took action to postpone all work efforts associated with the sewer

    15.0 SCENIC AND (JULTURAL RESOURCES
Scenic and aesthetic resources and views are one of the study area's greatest assets. The forested nature
oflhe town and lhe surronnding areas, tl1e number of vegetation connnunities and lhe range of topography
combine to offer a fairly unique variety of visual experiences within a relatively compact geographic area.
Views range from valley and canyon panoramas to forest and ridge lines. From some vantage points, the
Sutter Buttes and the Coastal Range are visible on clear days.
Residential development is located primarily in forested areas. Trees have been cleared for various
connnercial and industrial development, some of which is less visually pleasing. The overall ambience is
rustic and natural, a genuine connnunity asset which can be enhanced lhrough local policies, guidelines
and/or ordinances.
Table 15-1 lists identified historical landmarks and historic structures within and near the study area.
Ethnographic Background
Paradise lies within territory formerly held by lhe Northwestern Maidu or Konkow Indians, who inhabited
much of what is now Butte County. These people spoke dialects similar to the Norlheastern or Mountain
Maidu, who occupied lhe upper Feather River basin in much of what is now Plumas County, and lhe
Southern Maidu or Nisenan, who occupied portions of lhe monntains and the Central Valley to lhe soulh
within the Bear, Yuba, and American River basins. Like most native Californians, the Konkow were
divided into territorial groups known to anthropologists as '1tribelets" or "village communities. 11 These
consisted of two or more politically confederated villages led by lhe head man of lhe most prominent
village. Each tribelet was sovereign in matters of land ownership, reaction to trespass, war, and
ceremonies. TI1e head man was often assisted by lesser officials and a council of elders. Most tribelet
leaders "ruled" by virtue of lheir wisdom, experience, and acquired respect, ralher lhan lhrough any real
aulhority. Tribelets were lhe largest social and political unit among most California Indians.
The Konlww tribelet was centered aronnd Concow Valley, while lhe Michoopda tribelet claimed the area
around Chico and are believed to have foraged within lhe foothills east of Chico. Some antliropologists
believe there was a tribelet in the vicinity of present-day Cherokee called Ti '-mah, who may also have
foraged on portions of Paradise Ridge. It may be impossible to determine which of lhese groups actually
claimed or inhabited Paradise. All of lhese tribelets could have maintained settlements or exploited
resources in lhe area at various times. Major villages were located atop lhe crests of ridges high above lhe
rivers or part of lhe way down lhe walls of lhe canyons on mid-slope benches, particularly where lhere were
springs.

Acorns, deer, and fish provided dietary staples, which were supplemented by a vast variety of small game,
seeds, nuts, fruits, and berries. The Konkow exploited their environment very systematically. Far from
being randomly nomadic, they planned seasonal hunting and foraging rounds to arrive at specific places
during peak productivity of certain resources. Their semi-sedentary lifestyle would be impossible without
technologies for preserving and storing food resources. For example, these technologies enabled them to
convert vast, but seasonal surpluses of acorns and salmon into reliable year-round staples.
Even before the arrival of large numbers of Euro-American settlers and miners, the Indians were affected
by white civilization. In 1833, an epidemic of what is believed to have been malaria was brought into the
California Central Valley from Oregon by fur trapping parties. As many as seventy-five percent of the
native people in !he Valley and lower foothills died. The Indians never recovered from this catastrophe and
were lhus unable to resist !he invasion of their homeland during and after the Gold Rush.
Along with epidemics and armed attacks, the Indians had to contend with !he destruction of the fisheries
and other resources by gold miners and the exclusion of Indians from prime hunting and food galhering
lands claimed by white settlers. They were soon reduced to poverty, becoming homeless refugees in their
own country. During the late 1850s and 1860s, many surviving Northwestern Maidu were removed to the
Round Valley Indian Reservation.
A few Maidu Indians reside in Butte and Plumas Counties today. Many are involved in efforts to revive
their native language and culture.
Prehistory
Archaeological excavations in Messilla Valley in the soulheastern corner of the study area suggested to
archaeologists that five distinctive cultural expressions had occupied !he region over the last three or four
lhonsand years. From youngest to oldest, !hey are called the Historic Complex (A.D. 1830 to 1850), which
clearly represents the archaeological remains of !he Norlhwestern Maidu, the Oroville Complex (about A.D.
1500 to 1830), the Sweetwater Complex (about A.D. 800 to 1500), the Bidwell Complex (about A.D. 1 to
800), and the somewhat enigmatic Mesilla Complex (possibly 1000 to 2000 B.C. to A.D. 1). Many
archaeologists feel that !he Bidwell Complex marks the appearance of Maidu-speaking people in !he area,
although this has not yet been confirmed. At least one prominent archaeologist has hypothesized !hat the
Konkow arrived no earlier than about A.D. 1400, while several archaeologists have recently unearlhed
evidence !hey believe suggests even the Mesilla Complex people were Maiduan.
The Mesilla Complex bears certain sintilarities to Central Valley and high Sierran cultures of t11e same
period, including the Martis Complex of the Lake Tahoe and Truckee basin areas. However, most
archaeologists now recognize the Martis and Mesilla as distinct cultures.
There is tantalizing evidence for much earlier human presence in many northern Sierra Nevada locations,
although none of the evidence is as yet unequivocal. This evidence, in the form of large, relatively crude
projectile points that were used for spears - the bow and arrow was not introduced until about A.D. 500 -

concentration in tbe Lime Saddle area. The map indicates tbat "land disturbing projects" soutb of tbe line

116;0 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PLANS
    16.1 BUTTE COUNTY GENERAL PLAN
Butte Couuty has recently started work on a comprehensive update of the Butte County General Plan. The
existing land use plan for the Paradise area, the Paradise Area Land Use Plan, was adopted by the Butte
Couuty Board of Supervisors in 1981, and generally encompasses the area corresponding to the primary
and secondary study areas. The area within the 1981 Paradise town limits is primarily designated for
medium density residential development (seven-thirteen dwelling units per gross acre) and low density
residential development (one-six dwelling units per acre). Some areas paralleling the Skyway and along
Clark Road are designated for high density residential development (fourteen-twenty dwelling nnits per
acre), and most of the length of the Skyway and an area along Clark Road are designated for commercial
development. Selected sites are designated for industrial and public use. No explanation is provided
regarding the relatively high residential densities shown on the plan in the absence of a connnunity sewer
system.
With regard to the secondary study area, the communities of Paradise Pines and Magalia are designated for
low density residential development. Surrounding areas, north to Coutolenc Road, are primarily designated
agricultural residential (one-forty acres per dwelling units). TI1e easterly portion of the area is designated
timber mouutain (forty acre mininmm parcel size), grazing and open lands (forty acre minimum parcel size)
and public, and the westerly portion is designated grazing and open lands.
To the east of the Paradise Area Land Use Plan boundaries, the county has adopted the Concow Area Land
Use Map. lhls map designates a majority of the area as timber-mountain, with three sizable areas
designated for foothill area residential (one-forty acres per dwelling units). TI1e majority of the area
abutting the Paradise Area Land Use Plan boundaries to the north and east is designated timber-mountain;
and to the west, grazing and open land. Within the tertiary study area, lands are designated agricultural
residential, grazing and open land, and public (Butte College).
The county has adopted a general plan amendment entitled the Paradise Urban Reserve Policy Statement
and has designated an area as "Urban Reserve" south of the town limits (south Paradise area). The area
is shown in Figure 16-1. The area was formerly designated agricultural residential. This general plan
amendment established the following policies for the south Paradise area:
 •         The couuty's land use policy, zoning and subdivision shall be coordinated with the Town of
           Paradise and any other service district within the Urban Reserve.

•         The Urban Reserve designation permits rural residential development and uses on parcels of not
          less than forty (40) acres in those areas designated by the California Department of Fish and Game
          (DFG) as NO DEVELOPMENT ZONES for the protection of critical deer herd winter ranges
          (see Figure 64), and twenty (20) acres on all other properties until such time as they are needed
          for development and adequate services are available to serve this area.
•         Any proposal for a general plan amendment, rezoning or subdivision which would permit parcels
          of less than twenty (20) acres to be created shall be coordinated with all public agencies which
          provide utility and public services as well as the plans of the Town of Paradise for extension of
          water, sewer, circulation, drainage, and shall be accompanied by the following plans prior to or
          concurrently with the adoption (summarized).
          •   capital improvement plan
          •   park and open space plan
          •   environmental plan
          •   street and transportation plan
          •   health department standards
          •   fiscal plan
•         Any parcel which is now less than forty (40) acres which was legally created, pre-existing, and
          nonconforming may be developed according to its zoning.
•         Development standards compatible with the Town of Paradise shall be utilized for urban
          development projecrn within the Urban Reserve.
The definitions of the "land use plan designations" contained in the Butte County General Plan which apply
to the portions of the study areas outside the area subject to the Paradise Urban Reserve Policy are
summarized as follows:
•         Grazing and open land - livestock grazing, animal husbandry, intense animal uses and animal
          matter processing.
•         Timber-mountain - forest management and the harvesting and processing of forest products.
•         Agricultural residential - agricultural uses and single-family dwellings at rural densities.
•         Foothill area residential - single family dwellings at rural densities.
•         Low density residential - detached single-family dwellings at urban densities.
•         Medium density residential - a mixture of urban residential uses, including detached single-
          family homes, condominiums, multiple-dwelling structures, mobile home parks, group quarters
          and care homes.

•         High density residential - higher-density urban residential uses, including condominiums,
          multiple-dwelling stmctures, mobile home parks, group quarters and care homes.
•         Commercial- structures and activities providing a full range of merchandise and services to the
          general public.
•         Industrial - processing, manufacturing, packaging, storage and distribution of goods and
          commodities.
•         Public- large facilities owned and operated by goverrnuent agencies, including schools, colleges,
          airports, dams and reservoirs, disposa1 sites, recreation facilities, conservation areas, fire stations
          and other goverrnuent buildings and property.
Land Use Element policies which are particularly relevant to the Paradise area include the following:
•         Regulate development in identified winter deer ranges to facilitate the survival of deer herds.
•         Prevent development and site clearance other than river bank protection of marshes and significant
          riparian habitats.
•         Protect valuable scenic areas and parks for enjoyment by residents and visitors.
•         Encourage compatible land use patterns in scenic corridors and adjacent to scenic waterways,
          rivers, and creeks.
•         Provide open space areas near and between designated urban areas on the land use map.
•         Promote the development of new industry in the county.
•         Allow agricultural uses and farm animals in designated residential areas where appropriate.
•         Correlate residential densities to soil, slope and other natural site characteristics.
•         Relate residential densities to intensity and compatibility of adjacent uses.
•         Balance residential densities with traffic-carrying capacities of existing and proposed circulation
          plans.
•         Support water development projects needed to supply local demands.
•         Control development in watershed areas to minimize erosion and water pollution.
•         Consult with incorporated cities and neighboring counties in the development of planning
          proposals for areas of mutual concern.

•         Designate adequate land for free-market competition among land suppliers to avoid artificially
          constricting land availability.
•         Encourage annexation to existing cities and existing districts.
•         Encourage development in and around existing communities with public facilities.
•         Encourage urban expansion toward the least productive soils.
•         Allow rural residential development as a buffer between urban development and intensive crop
          land.
•         Retain in an agricultural designation on the land use map areas where location, natural conditions
          and water availability make lands well suited to orchard and field crop use, while considering for
          non-agricultural use areas where urban encroachment has made imoads into agricultural areas and
          where past official actions have planned areas for development.
•         Maintain extensive areas for primary use as livestock grazing land.
•         Prevent scattered development in grazing areas.
•         Retain in a grazing-open land category areas on the land use map where location and natural
          conditions make lands well suited for grazing land, while considering for nongrazing use areas
          where urban encroachment has made inroads into grazing areas and where past official actions
          have planned areas for development.
•         Retain in a "timberland" category areas on 1he land use map where location and natural conditions
          make lands well suited for timberland, while considering for nontimber use areas where urban
          encroachment has made iuroads into timber areas and where past official actions have planned
          areas for development.
The Circulation Element of the Butte County General Plan was adopted in 1984. It includes assessments
of projected traffic grow1h for the following plamung areas with relevance to tl1e Paradise General Plan:
•         Upner Ridge - Significant population growth in tins mountain plam1ing area will cause need for
          a capacity expansion of the Skyway from Paradise Pines to 1he Town of Paradise sometime during
          the 1990s. Also, it will be important to ensure adequate access for rapid evacuation in case of a
          wildland fire emergency in tllls planning area. The Upper Ridge will continue to have a very high
          percentage of senior citizens, and public transportation development for this area should be
          encouraged as part of a Paradise area transit systetn.
•         Paradise - The Paradise planning area is almost entirely under 1he jurisdiction of the Town of
          Paradise. The town has developed a circulation forecast to 1990 which shows the need for several
          street collector extensions to better serve east-west travel demand in the community.

•         Concow- The population of the Concow area is forecasted to triple by the year 2000. However,
          because of extremely low trip generation rates expected by the area's rural population, traffic
          growth rates will increase slowly, resulting in no needed capacity expansion of primary roads to
          the area.
•         Central Butte - This foothill planning area's population growth rate forecast is the highest in Butte
          County to the year 2000; more than a 600 percent increase over 1980. This is due to a very large
          inventory of land with a designation of agricultural residential (A-R) in the Land Use Element.
          This area is located mostly south of the Town of Paradise and totals approximately 12,500 acres.
          The development of potential from the A-R designation is extremely variable due to its wide
          density range (one-forty acres per dwelling unit) allowed. This kind of density range does not
          allow the development of a confident traffic forecast for the planning area.
          The planning area presents special problems for circulation planning and forecasting, in that the
          area is largely undeveloped, contains difficult terrain, and could potentially impact circulation
          plans and programs in the Town of Paradise and Chico. Before significant developments occur
          in this area, a comprehensive plan should be developed for this plarnling area.
Circulation Element policies which are particularly relevant to the Paradise area include the following:
•         The transportation system shall be developed in a manner consistent with specified land use
          densities and estimated trip generation capabilities and which is consistent with the policy to
          encourage development in and around existing cities and community centers.
•         Circulation plans for the county's foothill areas should be designed around patterns which
          encourage development near existing highway corridors and emphasize development near existing
           rural community centers.
•         The most important roads and highways should be designed and maintained to the llighest possible
          level of service and convenience. The least important roads and llighways should receive only
          the improvements necessary to maintain their structural integrity and operational safety,
•         Encourage development in areas that can be served by public roads in a manner that does not
          become an economic burden to the county, over time.
•         It is suggested that the utilization of county road funds should focus on completing projects with
          a higher priority before completing a lower priority project.
•         Rural arterial road and highway traffic capacity levels should be planned to provide a level of
           service "B," and be considered to be providing acceptable service at level of service "C" when
           fiscal, environmental, or site constraints are prohibitive.
•          Land uses that would preclude the timely development of right-of-way needed for new roads or
           expansion of existing roads shall be prohibited.

•         All road systems, both public and private, shall provide for the safe evacuation of residents and
          adequate access for fire and other emergency services by providing at least two means of
          emergency access to an interconnected collector system.
•         The county will work with the Butte County Fire Department and the California Division of
          Forestry towards developing emergency evacuation routing plans for developing foothill and
          1nountain areas with extreme fire hazard potential.
•         The county will consider city-initiated circulation element amendments to the county transportation
          element.
•         111e county and its cities should develop mutual and complementary policies regarding the ti1ning
          and phasing of new urban area developments, as necessary for the logical and timely development
          of each urban area circulation network.
•         The county will jointly coordinate circulation capital improvement programs with the respective
          cities.
•         Urban street and highway traffic capacity levels should be planned to provide a level of service
           !tc, n and be considered to be providing acceptable service at level of service "D" when fiscal,
          environmental or site constraints are prohibitive.
•         Urban area street improvement standards should conform to city street standards and circulation
          plans for each respective city.
•         The county shall support local public transportation services in the three largest urban areas and
          adequate intercity service to the Chico, Oroville, Paradise, Gridley-Biggs, and Palermo areas.
•         The county will encourage the cities to prepare and propose comprehensive urban area bicycle
          plans to the county for review and adoption.
•         Construction or expansion of all major arterials shall consider bicycle paths of Class II or better.
•         The county shall implement measures in unincorporated areas that provide for the continued safe
          operation of airports.
•         The county will support the cities in the encouragement of ridesharing and carpooling programs
          by large employers and public agencies.
The Circulation Elemen! also identifies the following state highway and other road projects in the Paradise
area which have current or projected capacity-safety problems that will need correction during the 1981-
2000 planning period:

•          State Route 99 - 0.8 mile north of Pentz Road to 0.4 mile south of the Skyway overcrossing.
           This segment of highway is presently near capacity and should be widened to a four-lane
           expressway in the near future.
•          ~aradise           area)-Realignment of the SkYway between Coutolenc Road and 0.2 mile inside
           of the northern Town of Paradise limits. This portion of the SkYway between the Town of
           Paradise and Paradise Pines is at or near capacity. The realignment would follow the improved
           grade of the abandoned Southern Pacific rail line to Stirling City, making construction of a two-
           lane expressway along this segment possible.
The county has circulated a draft Natural Resources, Recreation and Energy Element. The existing Noise
and Safety Elements were discussed in previous sections of this document.

    16;2 SPHERES OF INFLUENCE
Spheres of influence are adopted by the Butte County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) for
all cities, towns and special districts (excluding school districts) within Butte County. A "sphere of
influence" is defined in state law as a plan for the probable ultimate physical boundaries and service area
of a local agency. Annexations to cities, towns and districts must be consistent with adopted spheres of
influence.
The secondary study area follows the sphere of influence boundary adopted by LAFCo for the Town of
Paradise.
Special districts which provide services to the Paradise area, and whose spheres of influence lie at least
partially within the study area, include:

The Paradise Downtown Revitalization Plan was adopted in 1986 to provide the town witl1 a tool leading
to an improved economic climate in fue Central-Business district (CBD) by providing sets of time-phased
progranmiatic goals to be attained by a partnership between town government and downtown businesses.
The plan focuses on the area bounded by fue Skyway, Pearson Road, Almond Street, and Elliott Street.
The plan includes a design concept plan and phasing plan, as well as recommendations regarding parking,
circulation, land use, business organizations, marketing and promotion, target businesses and industries,
beautification, improvements and fmancing.

    16.4 Jll.JT'l.'E COUNTY AIR QVALI'l'Y ..t\'ITAINMEN'I'
               PLAN
The California Clean Air Act transportation planning requirements mandate that nonattainment areas for
ozone and carbon monoxide develop air quality plans by July 1991. Therefore, the Butte County Air
Pollution Control District, in coordination with transportation agencies (BCAG), is required to coordinate,
adopt and implement various transportation controls to meet specific performance standards outlined in the
Act. Butte County is coordinating with other Northern Sacramento Valley counties (Shasta, Tehama,
Glenn, Colusa, Sutter and Yuba) in the preparation of this plan.
The Air Quality Attainment Plan for the Northern Sacramento Valley Air Basin has been prepared in
compliance with the Clean Air Act and submitted to the Air Resources Board. The plan is designed to
achieve a reduction in district-wide e1nissions of five percent or more per year for each nonattainment
pollutant or its precursors, averaged every consecutive three-year period. By law, the five percent
require1nent is calculated against the 1987 actual emission level of each nonattainment pollutant or its
precursor.
According to the plan, it does not demonstrate a five percent reduction of the pollutant levels, as the control
efficiencies and cost-effectiveness are not available for many of the proposed control strategies. The plan
states that it does, however, include every feasible control measure and a schedule of adoption for the
control measures.
The plan provides that Butte County must reduce reactive organic gases (ROG) emissions by 12.39 tons per
day, and reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by 7.58 tons per day by 1994, in order to comply with
the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The county must reduce ROG emissions by 17. 70 tons per day and
reduce NOx emissions by 10.83 tons per day by 1997, and must reduce ROG emissions by 23.00 tons per
day and reduce NOx emissions by 14.08 tons per day by 2000.
The draft plan contains proposed community contact, educational and public information elements designed
to reduce emissions from transportation and area wide sources. The plan also contains a list of feasible
control measures, which are proposed to be implemented according to the following schedule:
•          All measures ranked No. 1 shall be proposed and implemented by applicable districts no later than
           July 1, 1992.
 •         All measures ranked No. 2 shall be proposed and implemented by applicable districts no later than
           July 1, 1993.

•          All measures ranked No. 3 shall be proposed and implemented by applicable districts no later than
           July 1, 1994 only if attainment of the state ambient air standard for ozone is not achieved by
           January 1, 1994.
A complete listing of these control measures is included in the plan. The ranking of feasible control
measures is based upon technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness, emission reduction potential, rate of
emission reductions, public acceptability, and enforceability. The control measures include a new source
review rule (requirements for pennitting new and modified stationary sources of air pollution), indirect
source review (sources which generate or attract inotor vehicle activity, including shopping centers,
residential and commercial developments, government buildings, medical facilities, office buildings,
hospitals, hotels, restaurants, etc.), and ttansportation control measures, for which each district will develop
measures that are appropriate for only its own jurisdiction.

    16.5 nuTTE COUNTY HAZARDOUS WASTE
               MANAGEMENT PLAN
The County of Butte has prepared a Hazardous Waste Mauagement Plan in accordance with state law. The
plau contains information on sites that may be potentially suitable for various hazardous waste facilities,
including trausfer and storage facilities, treatment and recovery facilities, and solidification for storage or
residuals repositories. Tue plan describes the various facilities as follows:
Transfer and Storage Facilities
Hazardous waste transfer and storage facilities generally serve as collection stations for industrial waste,
but could also be used for household waste. Materials are frequently stored on site until quantities are
sufficiently large to be shipped economically to treatment or recycling facilities.
At transfer stations, hazardous wastes are examined and analyzed to confirm their identity, degree of
hazard, and compatibility with other wastes. They are then separated as liquids, solids, and sludges
according to their overall chemical characteristics, and are kept separate from inco1npatible wastes. Drums
may be trausferred directly out of the transporting vehicle to the storage area, or they may be transferred
by forklift from a receiving area to tl1e storage buildings. Uncontainerized dry solid hazardous waste is
transferred to bins or tanks by dump truck or a conveyor system. Uncontainerized liquids, sludges and
slurries are transferred by pipeline from tank trucks to appropriate storage tanks. Wastes are subsequently
transported from a transfer/storage facility to a treatment, recovery, incinerator or residuals repository.
 •         Treatment and Recovery Facilities: Hazardous waste treatment facilities can occupy anywhere
           from three to thirty acres. A large facility can treat up to 200,000 tons of liquid wastes annually.
           This volume would likely require 185 tanker trucks or 120 rail cars annually. Visually, the
           aqueous treatment center resembles a municipal sewage treatment plant.
           Water contaminated with hazardous wastes, for example, arrives at a treatment facility from a
           transfer station, from a liquid organics recovery facility or sometimes from a large waste
           generator. Various processes are used to remove heavy metals, reactive ions and organic matter.
           The segregated wastes are then neutralized aud/or oxidized to precipitate metals or to detoxify
           selected chemicals. Treated wastewater effluent is discharged either to a sewer or to an
           evaporation pond. The sludges that are formed are sent to an incinerator, to a biological waste
           converter or are stabilized for land disposal.
           Liquid hazardous wastes containing solvents, oils and other organics arriving at the recovery
           facility are analyzed at an ousite laboratory to identify those constituents valuable enough to
           recycle. Decisions are made regarding those components which will be reclaimed, incinerated
Paradise General Plan
Environmental Setting Document                          19t                                                1994

          recycle. Decisions are made regarding those components which will be reclaimed, incinerated
          or converted to usable or stable residues. Solvents and oils are separated and clarified,
          respectively, by physical processes such as distillation, condensation and filtration. Toxic vapors
          are destroyed by incineration or are collected on adsorbents. The purified solvents and oils are
          sorted, recycled, blended into fuels, or stripped out as industrial raw materials. Residues or
          sludges from this facility are incinerated, extracted for metals, or "stabilized" prior to land
          disposal. Wastes remaining after recovery procedures have been completed are then sent to an
          aqueous waste treatment facility for further processing.
•         Solidification for Storage or Residuals Repositories: Some hazardous wastes that cannot be
          recycled, treated or destroyed can be solidified or stabilized. Liquid wastes and sludges can be
          solidified by use of special additives. InorgarLic sludges can be fixed by adding lime and fly ash.
          Other wastes can be encapsulated in asphalt or plastic coatings for lengthy storage or ultimate
          retrieval.
          A solidification facility would constitute a large industrial building with several tall silos attached
          for storage of dry chemicals. These facilities generally require one-ten acres. Transportation
          requirements would vary depending on the volume of waste handled.
•         Residuals Repositories: Residuals repositories are designed for long-term storage of wastes that
          have been treated and/or reduced to the maximum extent feasible. They would be sited only in
          areas that meet conditions set forth in Subchapter 15, Title 23 of tl1e CaliforrLia AdrrLi1tistrative
          Code goverrLing the disposal of wastes to land. The residuals to be stored at these facilities are
          solids, with low organic content, and with inorganic components that are relatively insoluble.
          These solids are among the most inert and least mobile wastes presented for land disposal. An
          example of residuals potentially suitable for long-term storage would be the solids from
          pretreatment from sewage treatment facilities. The facility would be designed and operated to
          keep materials dry in order to prevent the formation of leachate. Thus, a properly designed and
          well operated residuals repository should present very low environmental risk.
Using a "constraints and opporturLities mapping" process, the county has selected candidate areas that may
be "appropriate for siting the various facilities." Maps contained in the plan show portions of the Town of
Paradise, the secondary and tertiary study areas, as "potentially suitable" or "potentially usable with
adequate mitigation measures. The plan also recognizes, however, that:
          Butte County does not generate enough hazardous waste to warrant siting more
          than community transfer and collection stations ... potential areas for siting
          treatment and residuals repository facilities are reflected in the plan only to
          comply with DHS (Department of Health Services) guidelines. The advisory
           committee will, however, meet with the surrounding rural counties to establish
           multi-county agreements for any treatment or residuals repository facilities
           deterrrLined to be needed in the larger geographical area.

               COMMISSION
The Butte Couuty Allport Land Use Commission has adopted the Paradise Skypark Airport Land Use Plan
(1985) for the airport and the surrounding area. The plan establishes planning boundaries around the
Paradise Skypark Airport area of influence, and sets forth appropriate land uses, including building height
restrictions, to the extent that such land is not already devoted to incompatible uses. The plan's stated
objective is "to promote the orderly development of lands contiguous to the Paradise Skypark Airport in
a manner which safeguards the general welfare of the inhabitants, assures the safety of air navigation, and
maintains the utility" of the airport.
According to this plan, "In general, the Paradise Skypark Airport may be described as a safe airport
because the past accident record is entirely free of incidents involving the public or the public welfare. In
addition, structures do not now intrude into the air space requirement of the airport and no future problem
with height restrictions is foreseen. 11 The plan also includes noise policies to assure that new land uses in
the airport environs are compatible with aircraft-generated noise. The plan recommends that Butte Couuty,
in conjunction with the Town of Paradise, begin negotiations with owners of the land in each of the clear
zones to purchase, exchange, or acquire avigation easements for the land. Appendix E includes the plan's
 "Land Use Guidelines for Safety Compatibility," and the clear zones and approach zones are shown in
Figure 7-4.

        RE:          Citizens' Opinion SUIYey Results
        DATE:        May 9, 1991
    Attached are the results of the Citizens' Opinion SUIYey of 300 Paradise residents
    conducted by volunteers during the months of March and April. 1991. The survey
    insnument was designed by the General Plan Steering Committee, Town staff and
    QUAD Consultants, and was based in part on the Citizens' Attitude SUIYey
    conducted in March, 1981.
    Where questions were comparable, results from the 1981 survey a.re inciuded for
    purposes ofcompa.ri.son. Some of the highlights. or most notable differences between
    1981 and 1991 include the following:
    •       Decrease in the number of survey respondents age 60 and older, and
            corresponding increase in the number of respondents between the ages of 18
            and 40. This suggests a shift in the age composition of the population to a
            younger median age.
    •       Decrease in the percentage of the labor force working        ID the Town of
            Paradise from 1981 to 1991.
    •       Increase in the percentage of shopping dollars spent outside the Town of
            Paradise from 1981 to 1991.
    •       By a margin of 2 to 1, respondents believe that parking is adequate        ID
             Paradise..

•       Over 55 percent of respondents prefer Paradise to grow at a lower rate or not
        at all; 43 percent prefer the present rate. and only 3.9 percent prefer a higher
        rate oi growth.
•       One-quarter to one-half-acre lots are the preferred lot size for smgle family
        homes.
•       Almost 80 percent believe there should be an active attempt to increase job
        opporrunlties in Paradise.
•       The highest interest in recreational facilities is in foot and bicycle paths..
        followed by namre areas and an auditorium.
•       While 36.8 percent would improve traffic conditions by encouraging the use
        of alternative forms of transportation, 70 percent would use bus service only
        occasionally or not at all.
Results of the survey are ac=ate within 3 to 4 percentage points.
While this survey provides much information of interest, it cannot be all things to all
people and questions of equal interest could not be asked due to length.. Survey
results will be supplemented by input from the General Plan Steering Committee, the
four Subcommittees and citizens at public meetings and hearings.

AMBIENT NOISE LEVEL:       The composite of noise from a 11 sources near and far.
                           In this context, the ambient noise level constitutes
                           the normal or existing level of environmental noise at
                           a given location.
CNEL:                      Community Noise Equivalent Level. The average
                           equivalent sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained
                           after addition of approximately five decibels to sound
                           levels in the evening from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and
                           ten decibels to sound levels in the night before 7:00
                           a.m. and after 10:00 p.m.
DECIBEL, dB:               A unit for describing the amplitude of sound, equal to
                           20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of
                           the pressure of the sound measured to the reference
                           pressure, which is 20 micropascals (20 micronewtons
                           per square meter).
                           Day-Night Average Sound Level. The average equivalent
                           sound level during a 24-hour day, obtained after
                           addition of ten decibels to sound levels in the night
                           after 10:00 p.m. and before 7:00 a.m.

                           l, 8 and 24-hour sample periods.
       NOTE:  CNEL and Ldn represent daily levels of noise exposure averaged on
              an annual basis, while Leq represents the average noise exposure
              for a shorter time period, typically one hour.
Lmax:                      The maximum sound level recorded during a noise event.
                           The sound level exceeded "n" percent of the time

          NOISE MEASUREMENT AND MODELING METIIODOLOGY
 ROADWAYS
         The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Highway Traffic Noise
 Prediction Model (FHWA-RD-77-108) was used to develop I..i11 contours for all
 highways and major roadways in Paradise. The FHWA Modef is the analytical
 method presently favored for traffic noise prediction by most state and local
 agencies. including Caltrans. The current version of the model is based upon the
 CALVENO noise emission factors for automobiles, medium trucks, and heavy
 trucks, with consideration given to vehicle volume, speed, roadway configurat10n,
 distance to the receiver and the acoustical charactenstics of the site. The FHWA
 Model predicts hourly Leq values for free-flowing traffic conditions, and is generally
 considered to be accurate within 1.5 dB. To predict I..in values, it is necessary to
 determine the hourly distribution of traffic for a typicaT24-hour day and to adjust
 the traffic volume input data to yield an equivalent hourly traffic volume.
         Short-term (15-minute) traffic noise measurements and concurrent traffic
 counts were conducted by Brown-Buntin Associates (BEA) for State Route
.191/Clark Road, Skyway, Pearson Road and Elliot Road (see Figure 7-1) on March
 14, 1991. The noise·measurements were made to evaluate the noise exposure due to
 traffic on those roadwavs. Instrumentation was a Larson Davis Laboratories (LDL)
 model 700B integrating sound level meter which was calibrated in the field before
 measurements using a CA-250 acoustical calibrator.
         The purpose of the traffic noise level measurements was to determine the
 accuracy of the FHWA model in describing the existing noise environment at the
 project site. Noise measurement results were compared to the FHWA Model
 results by entering the observed traffic volumes, speed and distance as inputs to the
 FHWAModel.
         Traffic data representing annual average traffic volumes for existing
 conditions were obtained from Caltrans and Dowling Associates traffic consultants
 as summarized in Appendix D. Day /night traffic distribution and truck mix were
 based upon Caltrans and BEA file data. Using these data and the FHW A
 methodology, traffic noise levels as defined by Lctn. were calculated for existing
 ( 1990) traffic volumes. Distances from the centerlmes of selected roadways to the
 Lctn contours are summarized in Table 7-1.
 COMMUNITY NOISE SUE VEY
         A community noise survey was conducted to document noise exposure in
 areas of the community containing noise sensitive land uses. For that purpose, noise
 sensitive land uses in the Paradise General Plan Study Area were considered to
 include residential areas, parks and schools. Noise monitoring sites were selected to
 be representative of typical conditions in the community.
         Short-term noise monitoring was conducted on March 13-14, 1991. Each site
 was monitored three different times during the day and night so that valid estimates
 of Lctn could be prepared. One long-term noise monitoring site was established in
 Paradlse to record day-night statistical trends. The data collected included the Leq
 and other statistical descriptors. Noise monitoring sites. measured noise levels ancf
 estimated Lctn values at each site are summarized in Table 7-2. Monitoring sites are
 shown by Figure 7-1.

       Community noise monitoring systems were calibrated with acoustical
calibrators in. the field prior to use. The systems comply with all peninent
requirements of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for Type I sound
level meters.

BIR Addendum                                       iii                                                 1994

The intent of this environmental document is to provide an addendum to the previously prepared draft Environmental
Impact Repon (BIR) for the Paradise General Plan. The draft BIR was originally released in May of 1992,
circulated through the state clearinghouse, and made available for public comment through an extended review
period.
Subsequent to the closure of the public review and comment period, and prior to the conduct of public hearings,
the Paradise General Plan Revision Steering Committee directed staff to make changes to the draft policy document.
These comprehensive changes, were geared towards restructuring the approach of the plan into a growth
management plan, and reducing potential build out and population projections by modifying the draft General Plan
land use designation map.
The purpose of this draft BIR addendum is to provide an analysis of the potential environmental impacts resulting
from the changes and revisions to the draft General Plan. Because the plan has been revised to reduce potential
residential build out and population growth over the fifteen-year planning period, it is not anticipated that new and
significant adverse environmental impacts will result from plan implementation.
Pursuant to Section 15164 of the California Environmental Quality Act guidelines, this addendum is being prepared,
rather than a subsequent or supplemental BIR for the following reasons:
1.        The changes in the project (draft General Plan) will not require revisions of the previous draft BIR due
          to the involvement of new significant environmental impacts not considered in the previous draft BIR.
2.        No substantial changes in the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken, such as substantial
          deterioration in air quality, have occurred since the production of the draft BIR.
3.        No new important information that will cause new significant environmental impacts has become available
          since the production of the draft BIR.
4.        The revisions and changes to the project (draft General Plan) will not cause previously insignificant

This BIR addendum accompauies Volume II, draft Environmental Impact Report, Volume I revised Policy
Document, Volume III, Environmental Setting Document and the associated land use designation map, citculation
diagram and enviromnental constraints diagrams.
Together, these documents (Volumes I, II and l/I), maps and diagrams constitute the draft Paradise General Plan.
Paradise General Plan
EIR Addendum                                           2                                                    1994
The primary changes and revisions to the draft General Plan involve restructuring it into a growth management
plan. This was accomplished in a number of ways. First, by incorporating a land use planning tool termed
"constraints analysis" to influence land use designations, dictate the assignment of future zoning classifications, and
guide the future design and review of development proposals. The plan now calls for lower density and less land
use intensity on lands containing both infrastructural and environmental constraints. Land use designations and build
out projections have been influenced by these types of constraints, and the plan requires residential densities and
land use intensities to be based upon the degree of constraints affecting properties.
Second, the smallest minimum parcel size for new lots created for single-family residential development (divisions
of land) is now predominantly one-half net acre, rather than up to three to five parcels per gross acre as suggested
in the earlier draft plan. The "T-R" (Town-Residential) land use designation would potentially allow up to three
dwelling units/parcels per net acre. However, it is estimated that this change would only result in approximately
thirty-nine additional units/parcels within the primary study area. This will serve to reduce potential build out, and
potentially limit ultimate population growth over the fifteen-year planning period.
Third, specific police and fire response times thresholds have been established and highlighted in the plan. If the
town Police Department or Fire Department cannot respond to an emergency at a proposed development site within
the time thresholds established by the plan, the development cannot be approved.
Fourth, specific traffic service levels have been established in the circulation element of the plan. If the level of
service at intersections or along roadways will erode below the threshold level established by the plan as a result
of a proposed project, then it cannot be approved.
Finally, the plan suggests an overriding policy of requiring development to be designed to accommodate constraints,
rather than altering the environment to accommodate the development project.
Other major changes to the draft General Plan include the following:
•         A change in the land use designation of properties in the southern portion of town from "S-R • (Suburban-
          Residential) to "A-R" (Agricultural-Residential).
•         Changes in the housing element to more strongly promote rehabilitation of existing dwelling units rather
          than the construction of new units, and to provide a more personalized approach to the future planning for
          housing in Paradise. Also, to assure its consistency with the growth management thrust of the plan.
•         Putting more "teeth• into the open space/conservation element. Placing more of an emphasis on open space
          acquisition, promoting a strong relationship with the Paradise Recreation and Park District, and promoting
          agricultural land preservation.

•         Modifying the circulation element to reflect the growth management thrust of the plan. Revising circulation
          system classifications to reflect a more rural character.
•         Modify (soften) language regarding the community collection sewer system, and add language regarding
          the Paradise onsite wastewater management zone (district).

3.1        INTRODUCTION
The draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the Paradise General Plan primarily uses the goals, objectives,
policies and implementation measures as mitigations to avoid potential impacts or to reduce them to a level of
insignificance. The DEIR also recommends additional mitigation measures for impacts other than goal, objective
and policy statements related to a number of topics. This addendum uses the same format and approach as the draft
Environmental Impact Report. The topical setting is described, the potential impacts discussed, and the suggested
policies/mitigations measures are listed. The text describes the revision, deletion, addition, and renumbering of
goals, objectives, policies, and implementation measures used to assure that the potential impacts resulting from plan
implementation will be insignificant.
3.2 TOPOGRAPHY
The discussion of the topographic setting contained in Section 3.1 of Volume III, Environmental Setting Document,
is still accurate, and is unchanged as a result of the revised draft General Plan.
Impacts
Identified Impact Nos. 3.2.1-1 and 3.2.1-2 on pages 4-2 and 4-5 of the BIR are still valid, yet their potential is
reduced because the build out projections townwide have been reduced, and therefore the potential for excessive
cuts and fills on steep slopes, and for the modification of ridgelines is lessened.
Policy/Mitigation
The policy statements contained in the original draft General Plan that act to mitigate potential topographic impacts
such as excessive cuts and fills and modification of ridge lines, all remain in the revised draft General Plan, except
for LUP-2 and OCEP-27.
Paradise General Plan
EIR Addendum                                               8                                                      1994
•         LUP-2 has been revised to read:
          The environmental and infrastructure constraints analysis system should to determine future zoning
          classifications, land use densities, and to evaluate future development projects.
•         OCEP-27 has been revised to read:
          Protective land use designations and zoning classifications should estsblished for sensitive lands such as
          areas of resource production, steep canyons, and stream corridors, and areas or significant natural resource
          value.
•         In addition, identified policy OCEP-17 has been renumbered to OCEP-21.
Conclusions
Even though the potential impacts to topography resulting from future build out and construction activities has been
reduced in the revised draft General Plan, the policy ststements/mitigation measures are still in place to assure that
any resultsnt effects on the topographic setting of the town will be less than significant.
3.3 GEOLOGY/SEISMICITY
The discussion of the geologic/seismicity setting contsined in Section 3.2 of Volume III, Environmental Setting
Document, is still accurate and unchanged as a result of the revised draft General Plan.
Imoacts
Identified Impact Nos. 3.3-1, 3.3-2 and 3.3-3 listed on 4-7 and 4-8 of the EIR are still valid under the revised draft
General Plan, because as the town grows and develops, people will still be exposed to potential hazards associated
with earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruption and dam inundation. However, because the projected build out and
ultimate population over the fifteen-year planning period has been lessened, the potential impacts have likewise been
lessened.

Policv/Mitigation
The policy statements contained in the draft General Plan that are intended to mitigate potential geologic and seismic
impacts/hazards to a level of insignificance still remain in the revised draft General Plan. However, SI-6 and SI-7
have been combined and renumber to SI-5, and SI-8 bas been renumbered to SI-6.
Conclusions
Even though the projected build out and future population growth have been reduced in the revised draft General
Plan, the potential geologic/seismic hazards will still exist. The goals, objective, policies and implementation
measures intended to mitigate these potential impacts have been retained to assure that the potential effects will be
less than significant.
3.4 SOILS
The discussion provided in Section 3.4 of Volume III, Environmental Setting Document, is still accurate, and is
unchanged as a result of the revised draft General Plan.
Impacts
Identified Impact Nos. 3.4-1 and 3.4-2 on pages 4-11 and 4-14 of the draft BIR are still valid, yet their potential
has been reduced because the build out potential and population projections have been reduced.
Policy/Mitigation
The policy statements contained in the original draft General Plan that are intended to mitigate potential impacts
to soils, such as conversion of agricultural and timber lands to urban uses, and disturbance/erosion of soils all
remain in the revised draft General Plan, yet have been renumbered.
Paradise General Plan
EIR Addendum                                               10                                                      1994
•         In addition, LUP-84 has been renumbered to LUP-70 and modified to read:
          Encourage Butte County to maintain the urban reserve policy for the area south of town limits and work
          with Butte County officials to develop appropriate policies for the growth and development of the ares
          north of Paradise.
Conclusions
Even though the potential impacts to soils resulting from future build out have been reduced in the revised draft
General Plan, the policy statements/mitigation measures are still in place to assure that the effects on soils in the
town resulting from plan implementation will be less than significant.
3.5 AIR QUALITY
The description of air quality in the Paradise planning area contained in Sections 4.2 and 16.4 of Volume III,
Environmental Setting Document, is still accurate and unchanged as a result of the revised draft General Plan.
Impacts
Identified Impact Nos. 3.5-1, 3.5-2 and 3.5-3 listed on pages 4-16 and 4-19 of the draft BIR are still valid under
the revised draft General Plan. These identified impacts include a potential cumulative degradation of regional air
quality resulting from build out and incressed automobile usage, generation of air pollution resulting from
construction activities, and a potential increase in source emissions resulting from incressed industrial and business
developments. However, the potential for these impacts is lessened in the revised draft General Plan, because build
out projections and population estimates have been reduced.
Policy/Mitigation
The policy statements contained in the draft General Plan that are intended to lessen the potential air quality impacts
resulting from plan implementation still remain in the revised draft General Plan, yet have been renumbered. In
addition, some of the policy statement have been modified.
Paradise General Plan
BIR Addendum                                               11                                                      1994

•         OCEI-15 has been renumbered to OCEI-25, and modified to read:
          Eliminate leaf burning after establishing a program for disposing of yard debris in an environmentally
          sensitive manner.
•         In addition, original CP-15, CP-12, OCEI-14 and OCEI-31 have been deleted because they were either
          redundant or infeasible.
Section 3.5 in the draft BIR also includes an important mitigation measure (No. 3.5-1 on page 4-20) beyond the
draft General Plan policy statements. It calls for the Butte County Air Pollution Control District to install and
maintain an air monitoring station in the Town of Paradise. Comments received from the Butte County APCD on
the draft BIR were not adverse to this suggested mitigation measure.
Conclusions
Even though the build out projections and population estimates have been reduced in the revised draft General Plan,
significant cumulative impacts to the local and regional air quality will result from implementation. This is due to
the fact that all of Butte County is currently not in compliance with state air quality standards. Any increase in
ozone or PM-10 resulting from mobile source emission will add to the cumulative degradation of air quality.
However, the reduction in build out and projected future population represents less of a contribution to the
cumulative impacts than proposed in the original draft General Plan, and analyz.ed in the draft BIR.
The mitigation measure calling for the Butte County APCD to install and maintain an air monitoring station in the
town is still appropriate because of the areawide status as a nonattainment area for ozone.
3.6 HYDROLOGY
The discussion of the hydrologic setting, water quality, and town and district responsibilities contained in Section 5. 0
of Volume III, Environmental Setting Document, is still accurate and unchanged as a result of the revised draft
General Plan.
Paradise General Plan
EIR Addendum                                               12                                                       1994

Ilnnacts
The potential impacts to the town hydrologic setting resulting from General Plan implementation identified in the
draft EIR include, on and offsite flooding, degradation of surface water quality and contamination of the watershed,
degradation of groundwater quality, and the potential to encounter unsafe drinking water. All of these identified
potential impacts are valid under the revised draft General Plan, becanse opportunities for land use development
and construction activities will continue to be available during the fifteen-year planning period. However, because
the build out projections and resulting population estimates have been reduced, the potential for these impacts to
occur and be significant is reduced.
Policy/Mitigation
The policy statements contained in the draft General Plan that are intended to lessen potential impacts to the local
hydrologic setting and water quality are for the most part retained in the revised draft General Plan. However, the
following have been deleted because they are either redundant, infeasible, or they no longer are applicable: SP-10,
OCEP-38, LUP-16, LUI-7, OCEI-40.
•         In addition LUP-15 has been renumbered to LUP-19, and modified to read:
          Land Use densities should primarily be based upon the degree of infrastructural and environmental
          constraints affecting properties in the town.
•         LUP-57 has been renumbered to LUP-47, and modified to read:
          Residential densities shall be consistent with the standards for onsite wastewater disposal, and other
          infrastructural constraints, and should provide for minimum lot sizes of one-third acre in new
          developments.
Mitigation Measure No. 3.6-1 on page 4-29 of the draft EIR calls for compliance with federal storm water collection
and disposal standards. This mitigation measure is still valid and is retained.
Conclusions
Even though the project build out and population estimates have been reduced in the revised draft General Plan,
potential hydrologic impacts still exist. The policies and mitigation measures intended to lessen potential impacts
to a level of insignificance have been retained, modified, and/or deleted based upon their applicability given the
revisions to the draft General Plan.

3.7 VEGETATION AND WILDLIFE
The description of vegetation and wildlife in the planning area found in Section 6.0 of Volume III, Environmental
Setting Document, is still valid and unchanged as a result of the revised draft General Plan.
linpacts
The potential impacts to wildlife and vegetation resulting from build out under the draft General Plan include
potential loss of vernal pools and wetlands (secondary study area), potential impacts to wildlife resources, and
potential loss of sensitive plant populations. All of these potential impacts are valid, yet reduced under the revised
draft General Plan, because build out and population growth have been reduced.
Policy/Mitigation
The policy statements contained in the draft General Plan intended to lessen potential impacts to vegetation and
wildlife resources have for the most part been retained in the revised draft General Plan. However, all have been
renumbered and the following have been modified or deleted:
•         OCEP-27 has been modified to read:
          Protective land use designations and zoning classifications should be established for sensitive lands such
          as areas for resource protection, steep canyons, and stream corridors, and areas of significant natural
          resource value.
•         OCEP-3 has been deleted because it could produce other significant environmental impacts.
 •        OCEP-6 has been deleted because it is financially infeasible.
 •        OCEP-7 has been deleted because it is redundant.
In addition, the draft BIR recommends a number of mitigation measures separate from the General Plan policies
that are intended to reduce potential impacts to a level of insignificance. These include Mitigation Measure
Nos. 3.7-1, 3.7-2, 3.7-3 and 3.7-4. These suggested mitigation measures are still valid and recommended for
adoption.

Conclusions
Even though the projected build out and population estimates have been reduced in the revised draft General Plan,
the potential impacts to wildlife and vegetation will still exist, but to a lesser degree. Regardless, the majority of
policy statements and mitigation measures designed lo lessen these impacts have been retained in the revised draft
General Plan.
Impacts upon wildlife resources is no longer considered a significant unavoidable cumulative impact because
residential densities in the southern portion of town have been drastically reduced, the revised draft General Plan
emphasizes growth management based upon environmental and infrastructural constraints, the existence of the town
tree ordinance, and the lack of vernal pools or wetlands within the primary planning area.
3.8 NOISE
The discussion of the Paradise noise environment contained in Section 7.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting
Document, is still accurate and unchanged as a result of the revised draft General Plan.
Impacts
The identified potential noise impacts resulting from General Plan implementation listed on pages 4-40, 4-41 and
4-43 of the original draft EIR are still valid under the revised draft General Plan because as the town grows and
develops, roadway noise will increase, the Skypark Airport may expand, and new noise sources may be introduced
into the community. However, because build out projections and population estimates have been reduced, it is
anticipated that potential noise impacts will likewise be reduced over the fifteen-year planning period.
Policy/Mitigation
The policy statements contained in the original draft General Plan that are intended to lessen potential noise impacts
still remain in the revised draft General Plan, with the exception of NP-10, which has been deleted because it is
redundant with other policy statements.

Conclusions
Even though the projected build out and population estimates have been reduced in the revised draft General Plan,
the policy statements and mitigation messures intended to lessen potential
noise impacts have been retained.
3.9       LIGHT AND GLARE
The description of light and glare in the Paradise community contained in Section 8.0 of Volume III, Environmental
Setting Document, is still accurate and unchanged as a result of the revised draft General Plan.
Impacts
The identified impacts listed on page 4-45 of the draft EIR are still valid under the revised draft General Plan. The
potential for light and glare resulting from development in previously undeveloped areas will be reduced because
development opportunities, in terms of potential build out have been reduced. However, some degree of potential
new sources of light and glare still remain.
Policy/Mitigation
The policy statements contained on page 4-46 of the draft EIR (CI-20 and OCEP-60) have been deleted in the
revised draft General Plan, because they were either infeasible or the intent is accomplished by other means, such
as existing town adopted ordinances.
Conclusions
Even though the build out projections and population estimates have been reduced in the revised draft General Plan,
the potential light and glare impacts resulting from General Plan implementation still remain to some degree.
However, it is anticipated that the existing z.oning, subdivision, building, and other town ordinances and codes will
successfully regulate construction to eliminate potential light and glare impacts. Therefore, no policy statements
or separate mitigation measures are necessary in the revised draft General Plan.

3.10 LAND USE AND POPULATION
The description of land use and population in the Paradise planning area contained in Sections 9.0 and 11.0 of
Volume III, Environmental Setting Document, are still accurate and valid uoder the revised draft General Plan.
The land use designation map has been revised to reduce potential build out and ultimate population growth.
Table 3.3-1 in the draft EIR (2-2 in Volume I, draft Policy Document), has also been revised to clearly show the
new build out and population estimates resulting from the revised draft General Plan.
Impacts
The potential impacts to land use and population resulting from implementation of the revised draft General Plan
listed on pages 4-49, 4-50 and 4-51 of the draft EIR are still valid. However, the potential has been decreased
because of a reduction in the build out projects and population estimates in the revised draft General Plan.
Policy/Mitigation
Even though build out projections and population estimates have been reduced, most of the policy statements
contained in the original draft General Plan intended to Jessen impacts associated with land use and population have
been retained in the revised version. However, all have been renumbered, and the following have been either
modified, or deleted:
•         LUG-2 has been modified to read:
          Accommodate a rate of growth consistent with the physical and infrastructural limitations in Paradise.
•         LUG-17 has been deleted because of redundancy.
•         LUP-55 has been renumbered to LUP-45 and modified to read:
          New higher density land use development should only be permitted in areas compatible with surrounding
          land uses, infrastructure capabilities, and established service levels.
•         LUP-92 has been deleted because the sewer project is no longer active.
•         SP-14 has been deleted because of redundancy.

•         OCEG-1 has been deleted because of redundancy.
•         OCEG-2 has been deleted because of redundancy.
•         OCEG-6 has been revised to read:
          Preserve and protect naturally sensitive areas, and significant natural features in Paradise, such as trees,
          views, stream courses, wildlife habitat and clean air.
•         LUP-87 has been deleted because of redundancy.
•         LUP-88 has been deleted because its intent is covered by existing town ordinances.
Conclusions
Even though the build out projections and population estimates have been reduced in the revised draft General Plan,
the policy statements/mitigation measures have for the most part been retained. Many have been renumbered to
reflect editing for redundancy and/or the combining of goals and policies. Some have been modified to better reflect
the growth management thrust of the plan.
3.11 HOUSING
The description of housing in Paradise contained in Section 12.0 of Volume III, Environmental Setting Document,
has been expanded to provide additional background information. The original discussion is still valid, yet enhanced
by the new language.
Impacts
The potential impacts to the town and its housing stock resulting from the implementation of the housing element
have been lessened because the build out projections and population estimates have been reduced. However, the
identified potential impacts are still valid to some degree.

Policy/Mitigations
The policy statements contained in the draft General Plan have been renumbered and the following have been either
deleted or modified to reflect the revisions to the housing element:
•         HG-1 has been renumbered to HG-3 and modified as follows:
          Develop objectives that will lead to the provision of affordable housing as required by the California
          Department of Housing and Community Development and the Butte County Association of Governments.
•         HG-5 has been renumbered to HG-2 and modified as follows:
          Achieve an adequate supply of safe, decent housing for all the citizens of Paradise.
•         HG-6 has been renumbered to HG-1 and modified as follows:
          Encourage the production of all housing types, from affordable to exclusive, consistent with the overall
          goals, objectives and policies of the Paradise General Plan.
•         H0-3 has been deleted and its intent incorporated into other objectives.
•         HP-12 has been deleted.
•         HP-15 has been renumbered to HP-1 and modified as follows:
          The town shall encourage a full range of housing types, including both lower and higher density housing,
          as physical and infrastructure constraints permit.
Conclusions
The housing element in the revised draft General Plan has been geared towards rehabilitation of existing units rather
than the creation of new units. Even with the reduced build out projections and population estimates, many of the
policy statements/mitigations have been retained, or modified to reflect the revised approach to housing. It is
anticipated that the policy statements contained in the revised policy document will assure that impacts related to
the provision of housing will be lessened to a level of insignificance.

3.12 HEALTH HAZARDS AND SAFETY
The description of the existing conditions related to health and safety hazards contained in Section 10.0 of
Volume Ill, Environmental Setting Document, is still accurate and unchanged as a result of the revised draft General
Plan.
Imoacts
The identified health and safety impacts contained on pages 4-56 and 4-57 of the draft EIR are still valid under the
revised draft General Plan. These potential impacts include exposure to nuisance and disease vectoring mosquitos
and ticks, and increased traffic congestion leading to potential degradation of evacuation routes. However, the
reduced build out projections and population estimates will reduce these impacts accordingly.
Policy/Mitigations
The policy statements/mitigation measures contained in the draft General Plan that are intended to lessen potential
impacts related to health and safety haz.ards still remain in the revised draft General Plan. However, policy CP-8
has been renumbered to CP-6.
Conclusions
While the potential impacts related to health and safety haz.ards has been reduced as a result of the revised draft
General Plan, the policy statements and mitigation measures remain unchanged. This will assure that potential
impacts are lessened to a level of insignificance.
3.13 TRANSPORTATION AND CIRCULATION
The description of the transportation and circulation setting in Paradise contained in Section 13.0 of Volume III,
Environmental Setting Document, and the traffic data tables (Appendix "F") in the same document are still accurate
Paradise General Plan
EIR Addendum                                               20                                                   1994
and unchanged as a result of the revised draft General Plan. The circulation diagram has been modified to better
reflect the growth management thrust of the revised General Plan.
Jinpacts
The identified transportation and circulation impacts listed on pages 4-59 and 4-65 of the draft BIR are still valid
under the revised draft General Plan. These potential impacts include cumulative increases in traffic, increases in
congestion on many local streets, and specific cumulative impacts to Pearson Road, because of a lack of east-west
connector streets in the southern portion of town. Based upon the reduction of estimated population and reduced
build out projections over the fifteen-year planning period contained in the revised draft General Plan, these impacts
will likewise be reduced. In addition, the proposed business park land use designation for lands along lower Neal
Road has been deleted to eliminate the potential adverse traffic/circulation impacts that could require road widening.
Policy/Mitigation
The policy statements/mitigation measures contained in the draft General Plan that are intended to lessen potential
transportation and circulation impacts still remain in the revise.d. draft General Plan. However, because of the
reduction in build out projections and population estimates, the calculated average daily traffic volumes have been
reduced, yet CP-1 has been retained to strive for a planning area level of service (LOS) "D" or better. The 'D"
level of service (LOS) would potentially be reached upon build out along the central portion of the Skyway within
the town.
In addition, suggested Mitigation Measure No. 3.13-1 on page 4-66 of the draft BIR has been modified to eliminate
Roe Road as a possible east-west roadway connection during the fifteen-year planning period. With reduced build
out and ultimate population in the revised draft policy document, the need for east-west roadway connections is
potentially lessened.
The "S-R" (Suburban-Residential) land use designation identified in Section 3.13 of the draft BIR has been modified
to 'R-R" (Rural-Residential). In addition Tables 3-13-3, 3.13-5 and 3.13-6 have been revised to be consistent with
the growth management thrust of the draft General Plan.
Conclusions
The reduction in potential build out and estimated future population in the revised draft General Plan will lessen
potential impacts related to transportation and circulation. Some of the policy statement(s) and mitigation measures
have been revised, yet will still assure that alternatives for resolving any significant adverse impacts related to traffic
can be successfully mitigated.

Paradise General Plan
BIR Addendum                                                        29                                       1994

3.14 PUBLIC FACILITIES AND SERVICE
The descriptions of Paradise law enforcement, fire protection, solid waste, schools, and park and recreation facilities
contained in Chapter 14 of Volume III, Environmental Setting Document, are still accurate and valid under the
revised draft General Plan. The discussion of wastewater found in Section 14. 9 of that document has been revised
to reflect the changes in the revised plan.
Impacts
The identified potential impacts to public services resulting from implementation of the draft General Plan are all
still valid under the revised draft General Plan except for Impact No. 3-14.10. This impact relates to the potential
effects of constructing a formal community collection sewer system, which was a strong assumption in the original
plan. The revised draft General Plan states that discussions concerning some form of community sewer system may
occur within the fifteen-year life of the plan, but it no longer is an objective calling for construction to be completed
with three to four years after plan adoption. It is therefore concluded that the potential for impacts resulting from
the construction activities are significantly reduced.
In addition, it is assumed that because the build out projections and population estimates have been reduced,
potential impacts resulting from plan implementation will likewise be reduced.
Policv/Mitigation
Most of the policy statements/mitigations measures listed to offset the potential impacts related to public services
have been retained in the revised draft General Plan. All have been renumbered, and the following have been
deleted because of redundancy and/or they are no longer needed to provide mitigation: LUP-19, LUP-20, LUI-14,
OCEP-20, OCEP-34, OCEP-41.
•         In addition, LUP-25 has been revised to read:
           The town should designate general locations for new schools, fire stations, and parks/open space, in the
           planning area, and shall reflect the general location of these future facilities on the land use diagram. The
           actual location of fire stations shall be in conformance with the criteria established in the safety element.
           The actual location of new parkland shall be in conformance with the criteria established in the open
           space/conservation/energy element.
•          SI-6 has been renumbered SI-5, and has been combined with original SI-7.

•         LUP-11 has been renumbered to LUP-14, and revised to read:
          Growth and land use development should be linked to the availability of public services and facilities, and
          to the degree of overall infrastructural and environmental constraints affecting property in the Town of
          Paradise.
Conclusions
Even though the projected build out and population estimates have been reduced as a result of the revised draft
General Plan, the policy statements and mitigation measures have basically been retained. Some have been either
modified or deleted depending upon their applicability given the thrust of the revised draft General Plan.
Increased water consumption is no longer considered a significant unavoidable cumulative impact because of the
dramatic reduction in potential build out and total population estimates in the planning area. In addition, the revised
draft General Plan emphasizes growth management based upon environmental and infrastructural constraints
analysis. If domestic water service or water for fire protection cannot be assured, a development proposal cannot
be approved by the town.
3.15 SCENIC AND CULTURAL RESOURCES
The description of the town history, and scenic and cultural resources within the planning area contained in
Sections 3.1and3.15 of Volume III, Environmental Setting Document, are still valid and accurate under the revised
draft General Plan.
Impacts
The two identified impacts relating to scenic and cultural resources involve the potential disturbance of
archaeological sites and scenic resources resulting from implementation of the plan and future build out. These
impacts still have the potential to occur, yet their likelihood are lessened because of the reductions in build out
potential and population estimates.

Policy/Mitigation
Most of the policy statements/mitigation measures contained in the draft General Plan intended to lessen potential
impacts upon cultural resources have been retained in the revised draft General Plan. However, all have been
renumbered, and some have been deleted because they were either redundant, infeasible, or no longer necessary.
The following policy statements have been deleted: LUP-79, LUP-66, OCEP-44, OCEP-66, OCEI-26, OCEI-28.
Conclusions
The reduction in build out projections and population estimates reduces the potential for the impacts to occur. The
remaining policy statements and mitigations measures provide reasonable and appropriate assurances that all potential
impacts to cultural resources will be lessened to a level of insignificance.
The draft EIR concludes that implementation of the original draft General Plan would result in the following three
significant unavoidable cumulative impacts:
1. Degradation of air quality
2. Increased water consumption
3. Degradation of wildlife resources
Air Quality
While the degradation of air quality must still be considered an unavoidable cumulative impact, its severity has been
significantly reduced by the reduction in potential build out units and total population estimates established in the
revised draft General Plan.
Water Consumption
Water consumption will increase as a result of the revised draft General Plan. Obviously, the demand for domestic
water service and water for fire protection will not be as great with the implementation of the revised plan, because

EIR Addendum                                              32                                                      1994
build out projections and population estimates have been reduced. In addition, the revised draft General Plan
emphasizes a growth management strategy based upon the analysis of environmental and infrastructural constraints.
If domestic water service or water for fire protection cannot be delivered to a proposed development in the future,
the development cannot be permitted under the policies of the revised draft General Plan.
Wildlife
As a result of the revised draft General Plan, the degradation of wildlife resources has been reduced to a level of
insignificance. This is due to the dramatic reduction of potential residential densities in the southern portion of
town, the existence of the town tree ordinance, reduced densities and intensities in the southerly secondary planning
area, and the Jack of wetlands and/or vernal pool areas within the primary study area. In addition, the revised draft
General Plan emphasizes a growth management strategy based upon environmental and infrastructural constraints.
The discussion of General Plan (project) alternatives found in Chapter four of the draft BIR is still valid and
important. However, the revised draft General Plan constitutes a sixth alternative for consideration. Alternatives
one through four were created by the four citizen subcommittees, and the fifth, which is described as the
environmentally superior alternative was a hybrid of the first four. The General Plan Revision Steering Committee
had melded many of the components of the four citizen subcommittee alternatives into a "preferred alternative,
which become the draft General Plan.
The revised draft General Plan as described in the second section of this BIR addendum, is considered a more
environmentally superior alternative than the previous "preferred alternative" (original draft General Plan) for the
following reasons:
1.        Build out projections in both the primary and secondary planning areas have been significantly reduced.
2.        Population estimates within the planning area have been significantly reduced.
3.        The safeguards, standards, and mitigation measures contained in the original draft General Plan intended
          to prevent incompatible and significantly increased growth in the secondary and tertiary planning areas have
          been retained in the revised draft General Plan.

Sections 5.1 through 5.5 of the draft BIR are still accurate and valid as a result of the revised draft General Plan.
The identification of air quality and water consumption as significant cumulative impacts still exist, yet are reduced
because build out projections and population estimates have been significantly reduced.

             FOR THE 1994 PARADISE GENERAL PLAN AS IT RELATES
                  TO THE PROPOSED 1994 PARADISE GENERAL
                     PLAN AMENDMENT TO THE TEXT OF THE
                          HOUSING ELEMENT (GA-98-001)
                             PREPARED JUNE 12, 1998
                               TOWN OF PARADISE
         COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, PLANNING DIVISION
The proposed amendment to the 1994 Paradise General Plan entails a proposal to
establish minor text changes of the housing element in response to comments
received from the State Department of Housing and Community Development and in
order to make the Paradise Housing Element in compliance with current State housing
element law.
This addendum has been prepared pursuant to Section 1 5164 of the California
Environmental Quality Act. As set forth in Section 151 64, the Addendum does not
require circulation for public review. In compliance with Section 1 5162 of the
California Environmental Quality Act the following findings are made for the
Addendum:
•      No substantial changes are proposed in the project which would require major
       revisions of the EIR.
                                      35

DISCUSSION: The Town of Paradise is proposing the establishment of text
amendments to the housing element of the 1994 Paradise General Plan in response
to comments received from the State Department of Housing and Community
Development. The amendment entails text changes to the housing element that
expand or add discussion of the following topics: 1) analysis of governmental
constraints upon housing, 2) identification and analysis of lands suitable for residential
development as related to zoning and available public facilities and services, and 3)
an analysis of existing assisted housing developments that are eligible to change from
low-income housing uses, etc. The topics discussed within the proposed housing
element text amendments do not involve any new significant environmental effects
nor any increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects of the 1994
Paradise General Plan EIR.
•       No substantial changes occurred with respect to the circumstances under
        which the project is undertaken which will require major revision of the
        previous EIR due to the effects or a substantial increase in the severity of
        previously identified significant effects.
DISCUSSION: As indicated above, no new impacts are associated with the changes
to the text of the housing element.
•       New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could
        not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time that
        the previous 1994 Paradise General Plan EIR was certified as complete.
DISCUSSION: No new information which would result in a significant impact not
identified in the 1994 Paradise General Plan EIR has surfaced as a result of this
proposed Town of Paradise action (GA-98-001 ).
It is concluded that the text changes of the housing element to be established by this
proposed amendment to the 1994 Paradise General Plan does not require the
preparation of a subsequent EIR due to the reasons stated above, and that the use
of an Addendum is consistent with the provisions of the California Environmental
Quality Act.
NOTE:          On July 7, 1998 the Town Council of the Town of Paradise adopted this
               amendment document.
